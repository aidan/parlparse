<a name="51220-01_star0"></a><h3 align=center>Planning Regulations</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether they have any plans to review the procedure for consultations on amendments to planning regulations.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, like all government departments, is committed to carrying out a full public consultation on proposed new policies and regulations, as outlined in the code of practice on consultation published by the Cabinet Office. The code was revised in 2004 and at present there are no plans to amend it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. Is he aware of a recent consultation carried out by the ODPM on antennae, in which overwhelming support was received for one option which the Government later said was not technically feasible? Can he explain why the Government went out to consultation and put forward an option that was not feasible in the first place? Does he not agree that that is the sort of cavalier attitude to consultation that brings the whole process into disrepute?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness makes a fair point about consultation, but there are mitigating circumstances, which I shall endeavour to explain to your Lordships&#039; House. I hope to get a warm and reasonable response in the circumstances, it being close to Christmas.
</p>

<a name="51220-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>The no-change option&#151;option 1&#151;received 96 responses in support, which was 29 per cent of the total, while the limited change option&#151;option 2&#151;received 88 responses in support, which was 27 per cent. So we are talking about a 2 per cent difference. The department took the reasonable view that, under the circumstances, as it simply could not do option 1, it was not unreasonable to move to option 2. In formulating the final policy, it took reasonable account of the significant proportion of respondents who did not want change at all.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that many of us feel still that there is room for a lot of improvement in planning consultations in the sense that they take far too long? Many planning <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1622"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1622</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

decisions take 12 months before we know exactly where we are going after we submit an application. Could those applications not be sped up?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister takes this subject extremely seriously. For that reason, the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 was amended to improve consultation. Local authorities now have to make a statement of &quot;community involvement&quot; in the local development framework. We take the issue very seriously. Having been the leader of a council, I certainly understand the frustrations that local residents have experienced with the planning process. The Deputy Prime Minister is well seized of that issue too.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   My Lords, the time that planning applications take has just been referred to. Will the Minister comment on the desperate shortage of planners in local authorities? Local authorities cannot recruit them; it is very difficult indeed. The problem was compounded by the press reports a fortnight or so ago, before the Chancellor&#039;s pre-Budget speech, that there might be further planning legislation. Can the Minister confirm or deny that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, it would not be right for me to speculate about future legislative programmes. On the noble Lord&#039;s first point, there have historically been shortages of planning officers. With his background in local government, perhaps the noble Lord would agree, however, that the planning process has improved and speeded up in the past three years. The period between applications being submitted and their consideration is shorter. That is an impressive feature of how local government has improved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Tanlaw: </b>   My Lords, does that apply to wind turbine applications? The delay in putting up wind turbines is a constant problem, which must affect the Government&#039;s programme on the environment. There is also a delay in putting up broadband masts in the hill and upland areas of the countryside. If those areas are to develop, they require access to broadband.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, this is one of those areas where it is probably fairest to say that there is a balance to be struck. Clearly, many residents object to wind turbines and masts being erected in areas of outstanding natural beauty and attractive landscapes. Equally, we need to develop sustainable energy policies and give life to them. On balance, we probably get it about right, but I can understand some of the frustrations that people experience.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the draft guidance on the housing needs assessments for Gypsies and Travellers has been out for consultation for many months, and that the process of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1623"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1623</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

determining the needs of Gypsies and Travellers, and thus the implementation of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act, is being held up?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am aware that a detailed consultation is being conducted. I pay tribute to the noble Lord for the way in which he pursues this issue. I think that, like me, he would like to see progress made on it, but it is a policy area where we have to tread very delicately around the various issues, because it is quite complex.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew11"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   My Lords, while declaring my interest as a landlord, I warmly welcome the news from the Minister of the acceleration in the planning process in the light of my experience of meeting homeless families who are living in temporary accommodation. We are all worried about the 100,000 families or more now in such accommodation. I warmly welcome his news on that basis.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am always grateful to receive warm welcomes. It is a very pleasant experience in your Lordships&#039; House.

<a name="time_0"></a>

<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spopq1"></a><b> Viscount Ullswater </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What is their response to the recent National Audit Office report on the benefit system which estimated that &#163;2.6 billion is lost through fraud and errors.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </b>  My Lords, the Government welcome the National Audit Office report. We are making progress in the fight against benefit fraud, but we are not complacent. There is more to be done to continue to drive fraud and error out of the system.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew13"></a><b> Viscount Ullswater: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply, but is it not a fact, as this report makes clear, that the gradual introduction of new benefits and the constant flow of changes have created a tangle of fiendish complexity? When will the Chancellor learn that benefits should be easy to understand, apply for and administer so that this scandalous amount of money lost through fraud and error can be properly allocated to those who are in genuine need?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, the aim should always be to reduce complexity, and that is the Government&#039;s aim, but there is always a balance between responding to the needs of individual clients and customers and administrative simplicity. Of course we are committed to reducing complexity. We have reduced the number of forms, and we are reducing the number of information leaflets for our <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1624"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1624</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

customers. The introduction of contact centres means that many clients can actually process forms over the phone, helped by members of staff from my department. Progress is being made, but there is still some way to go.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that this report is in some senses disappointing? It points out that complexity can indeed ensure and facilitate serious fraud, but on the other hand it says that simplicity may not be possible or desirable. As far as I can see&#151;and perhaps he can reassure us&#151;the only recommendation is that complexity on a regular basis should be studied. I assume the department is doing that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="51220-01_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, we always keep these matters under review, and will continue to do so. To be fair, although it is not for me to defend the National Audit Office, it seems to me that it has come to a pretty reasonable view. As I have already stated: yes, we want to reduce complexity, but doing so means you then have hard and fast rules that many clients will consider to be unfair. Over the years the rules are changed to make them more sensitive. As you do that, however, they become more complex, and there are then issues for staff in administering those schemes. This matter will continue to be addressed. We will do what we can to reduce complexity, but we also have to ensure that the benefit rules are fair as well.

<a name="51220-02_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   My Lords, can I ask the Minister&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker): </b>  My Lords, it is the turn of the Liberal Democrats.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that &#163;220 million was lost last year through errors in the complex pension credit alone? I hope that he is, since the figure comes from a report published by his own department last Thursday. Hopelessly complicated credit like that is not reaching 1.7 million people and it is wide open to errors. How much longer will the Government continue to treat pensioners as second-class citizens by making them claim what should be theirs by right?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, we must not anticipate the conclusions of the Government&#039;s consideration of the Turner commission report on pensions. It is all very well to have a go at pension credit, but it has enabled thousands of older people to get out of poverty. I continually come across older people who benefit enormously. As for error, we are of course committed to doing everything that we can to reduce it. There are programmes for staff training and for targeting those offices where the figures are disappointing. But in taking forward the debate on the pension commission report, we must not underestimate the good that pension credit has achieved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   My Lords, how much of the problem is due to a complete mess-up in the systems <br>&nbsp;<br>

employed by the Department for Work and Pensions&#151;much like the systems employed throughout government? When will there be joined-up government in looking at IT systems overall?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, there are mechanisms in place which enable people responsible for developing IT systems to compare and draw on good practice. The Government&#039;s gateway review ensures that departments who progress these schemes are subject to rigorous scrutiny. While problems are inevitable when introducing new systems, the fact is that my department&#039;s performance is improving enormously. The result is that through the use of contact centres, customers are able to get through to a service that can be delivered over the phone rather than having to come into Jobcentre Plus offices.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord O&#039;Neill of Clackmannan: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend appreciate that for many of us the change of attitude, particularly within the DWP, has meant that it is far easier for many people to obtain benefits than ever before or, certainly, before 1997? Moreover, instead of crocodile tears about fraud and incompetence, should we not worry about the larger problem of those who are deterred from claiming? It is not all down to complexity; old-fashioned social attitudes are denying these people their entitlement to the decent benefits which the Government are now providing.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend puts it well; I find it difficult to disagree. Surely, the question is one of rights and responsibilities. We must ensure that customers who are entitled to benefits get them in as straightforward a way as possible. Much of my department&#039;s work is designed to communicate that, and the work we have put into reducing the complexity of application forms also derives from that. My noble friend is also right that this Government have done much more than the previous one to deal with fraud and error.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, for many years the Comptroller and Auditor-General has qualified his opinion of the DWP&#039;s accounts because of unacceptable levels of fraud and error. It is not therefore surprising that the latest PSA targets for the department have nothing whatsoever about tackling fraud and error?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, PSA targets have been set for the department to reduce fraud and error. I am sorry to say that the noble Baroness is quite wrong. In terms of the department&#039;s record, I can inform your Lordships that in the spending review of 2004, the PSA 10 targets relate to reductions in fraud and error concerning income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51220-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>As for qualification of the accounts, I regret that they have been qualified. However, I would point out that they have been qualified for 15 years, going back into the Conservative government&#039;s performance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Chan: </b>   My Lords, what proportion of these frauds and errors relate to those benefits that require NHS letters of recommendation? I should have thought that the system in place would have reduced such error and fraud.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, it is difficult for me to answer that. Letters from doctors are required for many benefits. I am sure that the noble Lord is referring particularly to incapacity benefit, which is an issue. He will know that we will shortly be bringing forward a Green Paper on welfare reform, part of which will encompass the relationship with GPs and the health service because, clearly, they have an important role to play.

<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>How effective the provisions of Part 8 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 concerning high hedges have been since its implementation.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the Government have undertaken no formal review or assessment of how the provisions of Part 8 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 concerning high hedges are working. That part of the 2003 Act came into operation only in June 2005, so it is too soon to draw firm conclusions on its effectiveness. However, informal feedback suggests that the legislation is helping to end the misery caused by overgrown hedges, and many disputes are being resolved voluntarily.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. I pay tribute to him, to the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and to the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, for helping to get this legislation. It means a great deal to many people. However, a major problem has arisen in the advice and guidelines given out by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister; it all hinges on the word &quot;remove&quot; in the legislation. Councils are naturally frightened that they will be liable if a hedge dies, because they have been told that if it dies that is the same as removing it. Is the Minister aware that there are no regulations that allow councils to implement an order to reduce a hedge in phases? Should new regulations be considered, because councils are frightened to do anything where they will personally carry a liability? While most people are thrilled with the legislation, some are worried about what is happening. Can the Minister give me any hope in that regard?
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am not sure that the problem is necessarily susceptible to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1627"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1627</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

regulation. The noble Baroness raises an understandable concern. Paragraph 624 of the ODPM guidance, <i>High Hedges Complaints: Prevention and Cure</i>, offers very useful advice. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;Councils are, therefore, advised to obtain arboricultural input when framing the requirements of a remedial notice&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>I believe it is saying that if it is better and more intelligent to reduce the height of the hedge in phases, according to the growing season, that is a good way to act. By taking arboricultural advice they will probably be well protected.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, apparently if a council wishes to reduce the height of a hedge&#151;I understand the advice is that not more than one-third should be reduced&#151;the biggest hedges are the ones most caught in this problem. Can the Minister see a way whereby councils can charge only once? People are being charged &#163;650 to go to the council to have one-third removed and they might have to go back to the council three times, whereas if a council could impose the order at the outset, only one fee would be charged, and the council could supervise the procedure?
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, it is up to the local authority to determine its own fees. The noble Baroness is right to say that some local authorities, such as, I think, Sevenoaks, have been reported as charging &#163;650. That local authority has made a local judgment and it is a matter for local authorities to determine. However, it is important that, where there are such problems, they should be drawn to the attention of the ODPM because, as yet, we have not encountered any profound problems with the operation of the legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="51220-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister tell the House how fast the fastest-growing anti-social hedge grows in a year?

<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord obviously does not know that, as we speak, we have an armed snatch squad of inspectors touring up and down the country looking for these fast-growing leylandii cypress, and they are due to report back shortly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   My Lords, we know only too well of the bitterness, anger and resentment that disputes of that nature can cause between neighbours and how they can sour relationships for years, if not decades. Can the Minister therefore confirm that legislation will be used to settle one of the longest and worst examples of this type of dispute&#151;that is, of course, the one between Nos. 10 and 11 Downing Street?
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lord, lots of good answers are being suggested to me, but it is probably best that I hold fire. However, I think that the Government are working perfectly well at the top.

<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My Lords, the Government welcome the clarity that their Lordships&#039; judgment has brought to this important and difficult issue. We have consistently condemned torture. It has never been our intention to present to court evidence which we believe to have been obtained by torture, and the effect of the judgment is to replace this policy with an exclusionary rule of law. SIAC must exclude evidence if it is established on the balance of probabilities that it was obtained by torture.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s reply&#151;not without time. Are the Government able to say unequivocally that, apart from condemning the policy of torture, they will do everything to undermine and condemn it? Will they also co-operate fully with the Chief Constable of Manchester regarding his inquiries into the alleged flights by the United States into the UK?
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I am happy to endorse everything that my noble friend has said about our total condemnation of torture. I am not aware of the Chief Constable of Manchester&#039;s inquiry and I will write to him in relation to that matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, the Law Lords decided by a majority of four to three that evidence would be excluded only if the defendant proved, on the balance of probabilities, that that evidence was obtained by torture. Since for obvious reasons that will be extremely difficult to prove, does this not mean that in future a good deal of evidence will be heard that is in fact obtained by torture?
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I do not believe that is so. In the leading judgment, which was of course made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, he puts the position very succinctly. Of course, if there is still a question as to whether evidence might have been obtained by torture, that would go to weight and he rightly expressed the view that one would have to be cautious about it.

</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I do not understand that question. If the noble Baroness is asking whether the EU and US consult on and talk about these issues, then of course it is right. But we have made it absolutely clear that this Government will do only that which is consistent with their international and other obligations, and will at all stages act lawfully within the meaning of our law and international law. That is something of which we can be proud.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   My Lords, I apologise to the noble Baroness, Lady D&#039;Souza; I had not appreciated that she had risen to speak. I would always yield to her on this issue, and she is a Cross-Bencher. I want to pursue a slightly different aspect of the question that she raised. We have a special relationship with the United States and rendition is now very much a live issue in the Congress, where there has been a lot of debate about it. Given that, can the Minister assure the House that, using our own channels to the United States, we will make it absolutely clear that we oppose rendition and ask it to review its policy on that matter?
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Well, my Lords, it depends on what the noble Baroness means by rendition. If she means improper use for torture, then absolutely, and we were very warmed by the United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice when she said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;The United States has respected&#151;and will continue to respect&#151;the sovereignty of other countries. The United States does not transport, and has not transported, detainees from one country to another for the purpose of interrogation using torture. The United States does not use the airspace or the airports of any country for the purpose of transporting a detainee to a country where he or she will be tortured. The United States has not transported anyone, and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>That was a clear statement that we very much welcomed, and that endorsed our position in terms of the total unacceptability of the use of torture in any circumstances.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Peston: </b>   My Lords, can my noble friend say, for those of us who are not lawyers, whether it is not perfectly obvious that something obtained under torture simply is not evidence and could not be construed as evidence in any meaningful sense? Why then does the burden of demonstrating various statements not fall on the prosecution? Is it not obliged to satisfy itself that it has fully checked everything that it puts forward as evidence, according to an absence of torture criterion?
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, it is always difficult to explain these issues in detail from the Dispatch Box.

We respectfully suggest that the leading judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, is absolutely right and is balanced. I commend to the House paragraph 118 on page 66 of the judgment, because it is succinct and puts the case as it should be put.

<a name="51220-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, if it emerged that people were being transported via British territory to places abroad where they could be tortured, would not a crime have been committed under Section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988? What steps would the Government take to increase the capacity of the Metropolitan Police to deal with those offences, considering that only two officers are allocated to those duties?
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="51220-03_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, that is a hypothetical question, not least because we have trawled the records and your Lordships will be aware of a statement made by my right honourable friend Jack Straw in relation to rendition.

<p><a name="st_58"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment would introduce a new clause to the Bill which relates to counter-terrorist powers and would amend Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Section 44 permits a police officer, within an authorised area, to stop and search an individual without any need to have a reasonable suspicion of unlawful behaviour. The officer can detain the individual for the duration of that search and, if an individual refuses to allow an officer to search him or attempts to leave while being detained, he will be guilty of an offence. The requirement of reasonable suspicion provides a fundamental safeguard against the arbitrary and discriminatory use of police powers that can be both intrusive and intimidatory. The requirement limits the circumstances in which an officer can exercise the power and provides the subject with a standard against which the lawfulness of the search can be tested.
</p>

<a name="51220-04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>Over the years, police powers to stop and search have caused extreme tension between the police and the community, particularly in relation to disproportionate use against ethnic minorities. That has occurred even when the standard of reasonable suspicion has been in place. When that standard is removed, the potential for abuse is massively increased. I emphasise that I accept that, in a state of emergency, exceptional powers may be necessary. What concerns me and others&#151;for example, the Joint Committee on Human Rights, Liberty, and other organisations concerned with civil liberties and justice&#151;is the way in which Section 44 is being used. At the DSEi arms fair in Docklands in September 2003, police officers used Section 44 to stop and search large numbers of peaceful protestors. The Metropolitan Police originally denied that that was happening but was forced to change its stance when evidence came to light.
</p>

<a name="51220-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The organisation Liberty issued judicial review proceedings against the Met claiming that the use of Section 44 against the peace protestors was unlawful because it was not being used to combat terrorism but rather to assist public order policing. In addition, the legislation itself was challenged as being incompatible with European convention rights since it leads inevitably to arbitrary use. The litigation is currently travelling to the House of Lords, and the Appellate Committee will consider the challenge in January 2006.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1633"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1633</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>In the course of the Liberty proceedings, it was discovered that the entire Greater London area has been subject to a rolling Section 44 authorisation since February 2001&#151;indeed, since before 9/11. That effectively changes the law on stop and search for a significant proportion of the population indefinitely. The secrecy of the way in which authorisations have been given is unjustified and, in the light of the acknowledged aim of creating a hostile environment for potential terrorists, is in fact having the opposite effect.
</p>

<a name="51220-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Since the arms fair incident, there have been several other occasions on which the flaws in Section 44 have been highlighted. The release of Home Office figures on stop and search show that a disproportionate number of minority ethnic individuals, particularly Asians, have been stopped and searched under Section 44. In 2002 to 2003, the number of Asians subject to stop and search under this section rose by 300 per cent. On the previous occasion the noble Baroness said that that had gone down slightly in the following year. However, a survey conducted by the BBC suggests that there has been a significant increase since 7 July this year, with many police forces saying that in the months since that date they have exercised stop and search powers under Section 44 on a basis three times greater than in the whole of the previous year.
</p>

<a name="51220-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>In the wake of the 7 July bombings, two incidents have once again drawn attention to the inherent risk of granting police powers without safeguards. The chief constable of the British Transport Police remarked publicly that his police officers, when exercising their Section 44 powers, would not waste their time searching white old ladies but would concentrate on young Asian men. Since those remarks, the British Transport Police has met the organisation Liberty and revised its guidance to officers to take out references to particular ethnic groups. But an individual officer remains free to exercise stop and search powers on the basis of racial stereotyping without the protection of the &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; standard.
</p>

<a name="51220-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>At the Labour Party conference in Brighton, Mr Walter Wolfgang was detained but not searched by a police officer purporting to use his powers under Section 44&#151;a section that allows only a search of an individual and detention for that purpose. Mr Wolfgang has publicly stated that he believes that officers were stopping and searching only those displaying controversial political views. It is questionable whether opposing the Government&#039;s foreign policy on the war in Iraq can be said to be controversial. Mr Wolfgang has since received a formal public apology and an acknowledgement that the police officer acted wrongly, and the Sussex constabulary has revised its guidance to officers. Nevertheless the incident highlights the way in which extraordinary police powers can be abused if they are not carefully monitored.
</p>

<a name="51220-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Like Liberty, I believe that a stop and search power that does not require reasonable suspicion should be used only in a genuinely blanket or random way. Since an officer already has the power to stop and search an individual on the basis of reasonable suspicion&#151;under <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1634"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1634</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Section 43 of the Terrorism Act 2000&#151;any use of Section 44 on the basis of suspicion must be triggered by a standard that is lower than reasonable. In other words Section 44 is being used to allow officers to stop and search on the basis of unreasonable suspicion, which is a recipe for discriminatory use.
</p>

<a name="51220-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>There are only two appropriate ways to use the power&#151;I do not put my suggestions in order of preference. First, we should designate a limited area for a limited time and then search every individual in that area. If, for example, the limited area was Downing Street because President Bush was visiting, anyone in that area of Whitehall wanting to pass through could be stopped and searched indiscriminately and it would apply to everybody. If everyone was treated exactly the same there could be no scope for discrimination or arbitrariness. Secondly, if that is not possible because of lack of resources or some other genuine reason, we should stop and search on a truly random basis, such as every fifth person or every tenth vehicle passing a particular point or officer.
</p>

<a name="51220-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>While it is difficult to legislate for that approach, the proposed amendment to Section 44 would place limits on the section&#039;s use and would prevent the abuses of power that happen now. The amendment would change the standard for authorisation of the use of Section 44 from being considered &quot;expedient&quot; for the purposes of preventing terrorism to being &quot;reasonably believed to be necessary&quot;. It would change the basis for the authorisation. Secondly, it would reduce the area that can be covered by a Section 44 authorisation so that authorising an entire police area, for example, a county or the whole of Greater London, would no longer be straightforward. We would do that by introducing a proportionality test.
</p>

<a name="51220-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Thirdly, the amendment introduces a two-tier process for making Section 44 authorisations. Police officers may give the authorisation but it will last only 24 hours, subject to a 24-hour extension by a High Court judge. If the authorisation is needed to last longer than 24 hours, it should go outside the police&#039;s remit, and the Secretary of State may authorise a period of up to 28 days, but that must be laid before both Houses of Parliament to provide accountability. Fourthly, the amendment introduces a requirement to publicise authorisations within seven days to allow individuals to know their rights and again to increase accountability.
</p>

<a name="51220-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Finally, I want to quote something that was said by the Metropolitan Police Authority in evidence to the Home Affairs Committee on 8 July 2004. It said that it had been given &quot;powerful evidence&quot; that Section 44 was having a &quot;hugely negative impact&quot; on community relations, and added:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;Section 44 powers do not appear to have proved an effective weapon against terrorism and may be used for other purposes, despite the explicit limitation expressed in the Act&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>The Metropolitan Police Authority went on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;It has increased the level of distrust of our police. It has created deeper racial and ethnic tensions against the police. It has trampled on the basic human rights of too many Londoners. It has <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="column_1635"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1635</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>cut off valuable sources of community information and intelligence. It has exacerbated community divisions and weakened social cohesion&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights has noted mounting evidence that the powers under the Terrorism Act 2000 are being used disproportionately against members of the Muslim community in the United Kingdom. It is for those reasons that I have placed the amendment before the Committee. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="51220-05_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I thank my noble friend for giving us an opportunity to debate this issue, which relates to Section 44. We think that Section 44 is merited and that it does exactly what it was intended to do inasmuch as stop and search under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 is an important tool in the ongoing fight against terrorism. As part of a structured anti-terrorist strategy, the powers help to deter terrorist activity by creating a difficult environment for would-be terrorists to operate in. That deterrent effect means that there is a crucial difference between the powers under Section 44 and the other stop and search powers.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>An authorisation under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act gives the police the power to stop and search pedestrians, vehicles, drivers and passengers in the area specified in the authorisation. I remind my noble friend that those areas can be very limited indeed and can, if the need arises, be quite precise. An authorisation can be given only if it is considered expedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism. Authorisations are made by an officer of ACPO rank and must be confirmed by the Secretary of State within 48 hours to remain valid after that period. The powers can be authorised in particular locations and for a particular period.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>The justification for authorising the use of the powers is intelligence-led and based on an assessment of the threat against the United Kingdom and how that transfers to potential targets within a force area. My noble friend&#039;s proposal would limit the use of those powers to instances where there is a &quot;specific threat&quot;. Intelligence rarely allows such a defined threat to be identified. In our respectful submission, the police must be allowed to make informed and evidence-based assessments of where the powers are best utilised according to the information available.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>In 2004, the Home Office produced guidance for forces which requires any officer making an authorisation to set out in detail the evidence to support the authorisation and how that relates to the assessment of the terrorist threat. The guidance also states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;Special attention should be given to whether the powers are required across an entire force or whether a designated area, or indeed a number of designated areas, can be identified. Where powers are authorised force wide, the authorising officer should explain the reasons in detail for rejecting the option of a designated area and applying the powers more extensively&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1636"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1636</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>The decision to make an authorisation is an operational one for the chief officer concerned and it is appropriate that that remains the case. The power is, however, subject to considerable scrutiny. As well as requiring authorisation at senior officer level and Secretary of State confirmation for authorisations over 48 hours, any authorisation can be cancelled by the Secretary of State at any time. All authorisations are carefully considered and confirmed only if they are deemed a proportionate response to the threat. This system is entirely appropriate, giving as it does the operational discretion to the police and an executive decision to the Secretary of State, who remains answerable, ultimately, to the electorate.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>There is no requirement in the Terrorism Act for either the police or the Home Office to publicise authorisations under Section 44. To routinely and proactively identify areas that have such authorisations in place would identify areas where similar powers were not in place. This would assist terrorists in identifying areas where the powers were not in use and assist their planning of attacks in areas they considered more vulnerable. Some information about where the powers have become authorised will become available purely as a consequence of the powers being used. We recognise that communities play a vital role in combating terrorism, and the police will always seek to share as much information as possible with the public. However, a statutory requirement that does not take account of operational sensitivities is not a solution.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>We are undertaking work with the police to develop more detailed guidance on the circumstances in which Section 44 powers should be used, in order to increase consistency and reassure the public that the powers are used appropriately.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>It is never appropriate to stop and search a person purely on the basis of personal facts such as ethnicity. That would be both discriminatory and operationally na-ve. PACE Code A states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;Officers must take particular care not to discriminate against members of minority ethnic groups in the exercise of these powers. There may be circumstances, however, where it is appropriate for officers to take account of a person&#039;s ethnic origin in selecting persons to be stopped in response to a specific terrorist threat (for example, some international terrorist groups are associated with particular ethnic identities)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>This should be used only&#151;we emphasise, only&#151;as one of a range of factors, which must also be supported by available intelligence; for example, a person&#039;s behaviour, gender, age, and the vulnerability of the location. This is also consistent with the Home Office stop and search manual, which was published in April this year. Countering the terrorist threat and ensuring good community relations and involvement are interdependent. Appropriate consultation should be undertaken in those circumstances.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>We agree with my noble friend that the sensitivities about this are critical, the need to operate proportionately is essential and the powers must be exercised with integrity. We believe that the procedures we have in place deliver that. Stops and searches under Section 44 are subject to the same <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1637"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1637</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

recording requirements as other stop and search powers. The joint Home Office, ACPO and APA guidance issued to the police service in April this year points to the role of the following: the police authority, in monitoring police stop and search data on a quarterly basis and providing a bridge with the communities they serve; the chief constable, in setting out a clear policy on the appropriate use of the powers, with an identified ACPO lead responsible for supervision and monitoring. That monitoring goes down the line, ultimately to the first-line supervising sergeants, who are responsible for ensuring that every record of a stop is examined and any anomalies pursued.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The Government have also set up a delivery board and a community panel to report to Ministers, analysing the use of stop and search powers in relation to minority ethnic communities. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, for the sterling work he is doing in that regard.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>For those reasons, we do not believe that this is an appropriate amendment to make. I hope that in that light my noble friend will feel able to withdraw it.


</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="51220-05_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   I apologise to the Minister for the misunderstanding on our Benches about who would speak when.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>I shall start where the Minister began. The problem on stop and search powers is that a balance has to be struck. They are undoubtedly often a very effective weapon against terrorism and serious crime, as the Minister indicated, but on the other hand their use arouses a great deal of concern and often a considerable sense of threat and intimidation among people who, for one reason or another, feel particularly vulnerable to stop and search procedures.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The noble Baroness will know that since the 7 July attacks there has been a substantial increase in the use of stop and search under Section 44. More people have been stopped and searched since then than in the whole of the preceding year. The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, quoted the troubling evidence given by the Metropolitan Police Authority. It refers to the impact on attitudes and opinions particularly among minority communities, which the Committee should pay careful attention to. That is also borne out by the remarks of the most senior Muslim officer in the Metropolitan force, Mr Ghaffur, who indicated that stop and search was a double-edged weapon.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The police must rely strongly on information from the minority communities. There is no better base for what the noble Baroness rightly referred to as intelligence-based policing. Yet if those communities are alienated&#151;the evidence of the Metropolitan Police Authority was certainly that they were being increasingly alienated&#151;that information and intelligence will not be forthcoming and the battle against terrorism will be weakened.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>The noble Baroness referred to PACE code A, which says that religious belief should not be a factor in determining the use and targeting of stop and search <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1638"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1638</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

procedures. However, there is also now a requirement that the person stopped and searched must be informed by the police officer and that that matter should be recorded. Code G, which has recently come into force&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, referred to it in a debate on 9 December&#151;has an attractive aspect, saying that an arrest should take place only if the police officer is convinced of its necessity.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, specifically included a test of necessity, not a test of expediency, in her amendment. I therefore wonder whether the Minister might consider the appropriateness of that aspect of the amendment, part of which she obviously does not willingly accept. Will she consider whether the test of necessity fits better with code G than merely a test of expediency, which is much more open to criticism and to a belief that the police officer concerned may be prejudiced in the steps he has taken?
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>The amendment also measures proportionality. The Minister eloquently defended the argument&#151;as she usually does&#151;about proportionality, but the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, referred to the rolling authorisation under Section 44 for the whole of London over the past two years. It is hard to see how that could be described as proportionate. Is the whole of London really at risk in such as way as to justify stop and search powers over the whole city for such a long period?
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I respect the Minister&#039;s concern about getting the balance right, but part of the argument behind the amendment is that the balance is not quite right. The balance has drifted a little too far towards measures that allow stop and search over wide areas and long periods. Members of the Committee will be as aware as I am that the sense in London of our being under very close police surveillance is very different from that which obtains in many other cities. It is interesting that West Yorkshire Police, which might be considered to have a specific and difficult problem, given that several of the 7 July people came from that county, are very reluctant to use stop and search powers, specifically because they recognise their alienating effect on the community that they are obliged to police.
</p>

<a name="51220-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I hope that the Minister will consider very carefully whether there cannot be some tightening up of the authorisation on such wide bases, both geographically and temporally, of current stop and search powers and whether that might not improve and increase the level of support and co-operation from all our communities as compared with the difficulties pointed to by the Metropolitan Police Authority and Commissioner Ghaffur.

<a name="51220-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   British Transport Police has already been mentioned. It is clear that that police service is very much on the front line of counter-terrorism activity. It is very much to be commended for holding what it calls community engagement forums, where matters such as stop and search can be discussed in a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1639"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1639</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reasonably informal way with some of those who have been affected. The chief constable pointed out at the most recent forum that Muslims were not being targeted for stop and search. He went on to say that there had been 22,000 stop and searches, but he did not specify over what period. The result was that there had been very few formal complaints. It is possible that those affected did not know they had a right to complain, and perhaps that should be more widely publicised.
</p>

<a name="51220-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I have it on the authority of British Transport Police that a person stopped may be asked any question that the police officer wishes to put, but he does not have an obligation to reply. It is not an offence not to reply. Perhaps that could be made rather more widely known.
</p>

<a name="51220-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Finally, will the Minister do all she can to ensure that guidance given to police officers, whatever force they belong to, emphasises the importance of having reasonable suspicion before stopping and searching somebody? This will not be possible in all cases, but it should, as far as possible, be the norm.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="51220-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   As the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said, Section 44 can be an important weapon for combating terrorism, but not if it is a blunderbuss that is not aimed at any specific target at any particular time. When we hear that for a number years a rolling authorisation has covered the whole of the metropolitan area, it is clear that the focus of Section 44 powers has been lost.
</p>

<a name="51220-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>We have to look at the experience of the way in which the provision has been used. One has to agree with the sentiments expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland: the section can be confined to a particular location at a particular time; it is an operational decision so that it is a proportionate response to a terrorist threat that should be used with sensitivity and integrity. Those are marvellous sentiments, but the effect of the way in which the section has been used is to demonstrate that it is too loosely drafted. Its use of the word &quot;expedient&quot; in subsection (3) requires amendment in the way that the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, has proposed. Instead of giving an authorisation where the person giving it considers it &quot;expedient&quot;, the person should give it when he or she reasonably believes it to be necessary for the prevention of acts of terrorism.
</p>

<a name="51220-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>It is right that the noble Baroness&#039;s amendments go on to define more narrowly the place and time. In subsection (4), she suggests that, instead of the whole of a police area outside Northern Ireland&#151;or the whole of the Metropolitan Police district, or the whole of the City of London and so on&#151;the authorisation should relate to a part that is actually the subject of a terrorist threat. I do not accept the argument that by defining a particular part&#151;and publicising that, so that everybody knows where it is&#151;you therefore leave open other broad areas where Section 44 authorisation has not been obtained.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51220-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>For those reasons, we support the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="51220-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   I add a quick proviso to what the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford has just said, which is that we are apparently moving fairly inexorably towards the enlargement of police areas. This Bill will no doubt be an Act in force when that happens. There will not be an early opportunity to amend it, and great resistance to using parliamentary time to do so anyway. It should therefore be in a form which is fit for purpose when that change comes in, if it does.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="51220-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Foulkes of Cumnock: </b>   I shall try to dispel the apparent consensus that we have heard, that we are all concerned about the rights of the suspected terrorists. Some of us are also concerned about the potential victims. When there are a large number of people concerned about their lives, limbs and future, who are in danger because of increasing terrorism&#151;and we see that&#151;it is important that the police have real, effective and genuine powers, not constrained by lawyers who very seldom get out and about, as I do, on the Underground and buses in London, and see the threat and the problems. There are many ordinary, law-abiding people, on the buses and trains and in their houses, who are concerned by potential threats. It is important that the Minister and the Government take account of those concerns, as well as, of course, the liberty and the rights of people who may be suspected by the police of acts of terrorism. I hope that the Minister will not believe that what she has heard from the Liberal Benches and pseudo-liberal Benches represents the feeling of the whole House.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="51220-06_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   I strongly support what has just been said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="51220-06_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I have considerable sympathy with the observations made by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, about the way the current system operates. I suspect that the areas are rather wider than necessary, and that stop and search is sometimes used for purposes other than those set out in the legislation.
</p>

<a name="51220-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>Having said that, I am unable to support the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment. I say that with genuine reluctance because I often find myself supporting proposals that she has made. The way the noble Baroness has worded her amendment would leave it open to an individual&#151;relatively frequently, if that individual was so inclined&#151;to seek to judicially review the decision of the authorities when it came to seeking an authorisation.
</p>

<a name="51220-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>In my view, the nature of the terrorist threat that we face at the moment is such that the ability to judicially review the police in this area could lead them to hesitate in circumstances where their instincts tell them that something needed to be done. In the current circumstances that would be an undesirable consequence. It might lead to a situation in which the &quot;nose&quot;, if I can put it that way, of an experienced policeman told him that a problem might arise; but, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1641"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1641</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

because of the way in which the noble Baroness has drafted the amendment, he would be constrained from following his instincts and disastrous consequences might ensue.
</p>

<a name="51220-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>So, although I have great sympathy with the noble Baroness&#039;s reasons for promoting the amendment, it would be, on balance, wrong for the Committee to accept it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="51220-06_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I should say to my noble friend and to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, that they should not misunderstand the Government&#039;s own concern about the way in which these powers should and must be used in order to maintain confidence in the exercise of them. It was for precisely that reason that we set up the stop and search action team, the delivery board and the community panel to report to Ministers. We were very conscious of the need for real, robust and appropriate procedures which would enable us to scrutinise what was being done and to alter practice and procedure if necessary.
</p>

<a name="51220-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>So the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, about guidance is very much part of the work that we have undertaken with the assistance of the panel and the delivery board. We are working with ACPO and the National Centre for Policing Excellence on guidance which will include provisions on the role of community consultation and assessing the impact that the powers have on communities. This will include full co-operation with police authorities. So we understand the impact that this can have.
</p>

<a name="51220-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>However, taking up the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;in answer, in part, to the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams&#151;about necessity, their concerns are also very real and we have to deal with them. That is the reality now. I must, with respect, advocate a great deal of caution when my noble friend Lady Kennedy of The Shaws refers to the &quot;whole of London&quot;. We are very clear that we never state the area to which the Section 44 order applies. I reiterate what I said earlier: in identifying those areas to which Section 44 applies, we take into account the threat, the assessment made, the location and the reasons for it. Each Section 44 application has to justify why that area is to be identified for the use of Section 44. Every single area goes into that type of critical assessment by a Minister&#151;usually the Home Secretary or the Minister identified. I have had the onerous burden of looking at Section 44 applications. I can assure the Committee that each application is scrutinised, and the evidence adduced to support it is looked at, before a ministerial decision is made as to the propriety and proportionality of what is being requested. Because I cannot from the Dispatch Box answer the assertions that are made, noble Lords should not assume that those assertions are necessarily correct. I can assure the Committee that the orders are proportionate and appropriate. The Government have been very clear about that.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1642</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


<a name="51220-06_time0"></a><h5>12.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51220-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a> We have to remember also that Section 44 exists to deter and disrupt. It does not necessarily exist simply because there is a specific threat against a specific person on a specific date at a specific place. Assessments of vulnerability and the nature of the threat are made. Relying on that assessment, decisions on whether a Section 44 order is merited are made. If it is no longer merited, the Secretary of State, or a Minister acting on his behalf, has an opportunity not to confirm that order. If an order is not confirmed, it lapses within 48 hours. If it comes to the attention of the Minister within 48 hours&#151;before that ordinary period has elapsed&#151;and the Minister disagrees with it, we can discharge that order on behalf of the Home Secretary. Noble Lords need to be conscious of the rigour which is adopted in relation to these orders.
</p>

<a name="51220-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a> I should also make it plain that the stop-and-search statistics will of course be affected by the areas in which Section 44 operates. Those areas will differ in complexion and the nature of the population. What may appear as disproportionate in national statistics may be entirely proportionate when one looks at the area to which the Section 44 order applied. I can assure your Lordships that these issues will continue to be scrutinised.
</p>

<a name="51220-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a> I accept the concern that has been raised by the noble Baroness, but I assure the Committee that Section 44 has within it sufficient flexibility both to keep our country safe and to make sure that it is not used in a way that inures to the disadvantage of our civil liberties. That balance is maintained in the procedure which now exists pursuant to Section 44.

If that is wrong, I would be grateful to receive information from the Minister on how it is so. It is the position of Liberty.
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="51220-07_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I make it clear that I am not, and will not be, in a position to give the noble Baroness any clarification on that at all.

</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="51220-07_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws: </b>   The organisation Liberty has presented that argument publicly. While I of course understand that the Government are bound by concerns about security, it is a matter of public concern if rolling powers are operating in that way. I make it clear that I am not against the existence of powers under Section 44. It is appropriate for the police to have emergency powers that can be used in terrorism-related circumstances. The whole purpose of Section 44 was to provide for the kind of emergency where it could be said that the police need not even have suspicion. Perhaps he came in late during the argument, but my noble friend Lord Foulkes of Cumnock is wrong: if the police suspect someone of terrorism, they have powers to act. That is not required under Section 44, which does not even require reasonable suspicion, but gives powers just to stop and search without there being any standard of the kind that normally applies in stop and search powers.
</p>

<a name="51220-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a> While it is accepted that these kinds of powers should exist, it is being argued that they should be carefully constrained and operate within a much tighter regime than currently exists. All that one is saying to the Government is that, in bringing in legislation, sometimes you have the opportunity to reflect on its operation over a considerable period. Here, it is two years. If it looks as though it is being used in a way that may run counter to the purposes for which it was put in place, and may have the negative effect of interfering with police intelligence-gathering, as referred to by the Metropolitan Police Authority, that is a serious consequence, and I am sure the Government are mindful of it.
</p>

<a name="51220-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>It is precisely because of our concerns about the way the section is used by the police that we are raising the possibility of constraining this section. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that if the police have the kind of suspicion he describes&#151;a police officer&#039;s sixth sense that something is not quite right in a particular set of circumstances&#151;there are powers under Section 43 of the Terrorism Act 2000 that allow them to act. We are concerned about this special power under Section 44 that does not require any reasonable suspicion at all.

With regard to the argument she is now developing, I want to clarify that the point of Section 44 powers is to make a target more difficult. If it is apparent that one person in five is being stopped by the police on an entirely random basis, that makes it more difficult for terrorists to act under those circumstances. Surely providing the police with considerable flexibility to act in that sort of way without there being suspicion about <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1644"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1644</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

any of the individuals being stopped, while making a target more difficult, is desirable. As I understand it, that was one of the objectives of giving the police Section 44 powers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="51220-07_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws: </b>   I am sorry my noble friend was not present when I made the argument in the first instance, because that is precisely my argument. It is absolutely right, when there is a set of circumstances where you want special powers&#151;where there is intelligence, or a visit by a state leader, or a political event taking place&#151;that you do not have to have suspicion, but would just stop every fifth person. Or you could stop and search everyone, and we would all, as citizens, agree to that happening. One does not want powers to be directed against someone because they wear a political t-shirt that someone does not like, or against minority communities who may see them as racially discriminatory. One could tighten Section 44 in a way that would prevent that kind of use of the power, which interferes with the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; argument that is so essential to intelligence-gathering. Your Lordships may have the opportunity afterwards to see the <i>Hansard</i> report of this, because that is the argument I am making.
</p>

<a name="51220-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>These powers are necessary, but it is how they are exercised that is so important. One is seeking to create a tighter regime and some parliamentary involvement by allowing Parliament to be aware of the existence of notices. I hope that we may reflect on this in the period in between. The drafting in this amendment may be inappropriate, and maybe the Government themselves can come up with some better formulation. What is needed here is a much tighter constraint on the way the section is currently being used.

<a name="51220-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Intelligence is key to defeating terrorism. Of course that cannot be done by laws alone, however strong and severe they might be. Indeed, certain measures may at times be counter-productive. I hope that what is being suggested here is a sensible, measured and practical attempt to constrain the way in which these powers have been used over the past two years. It should not be too broadly drafted, but should operate within a much more limited time frame.

<a name="51220-07_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for tabling these amendments, which enable me to go into a little detail in explaining Clause 30, which amends the Intelligence Services Act 1994. I will bear in mind the real point of the noble Lord&#039;s amendment, which is how we define seniority.
</p>

<a name="51220-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>To understand why that fits, let me say that the intelligence and security services, as the noble Lord knows, work tirelessly to disrupt and interrupt terrorist activity in the United Kingdom and abroad. To do so, we need them to be flexible and adaptable, capable of facing an ever-changing challenge posed by the international terrorists whose purpose is to destroy our very way of life. As the noble Lord, Lord Elton, pointed out, the Intelligence Services Act 1994 permits the authorisation of certain acts that would otherwise be contrary to British law. Section 7 relates to the authorisation of actions abroad, while Section 5 relates to the authorisation of actions within the United Kingdom. The issue of an authorisation or warrant, enabling the carrying out of such actions, is under the authority of the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="51220-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>A senior official is anyone holding a position in the senior Civil Service. That is, using old-fashioned language, an assistant secretary, also known as a grade 5. Someone becomes a senior official once they are, in current parlance, a grade 5.
</p>

<a name="51220-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>It is clearly of the utmost importance that the intelligence and security services are able to disrupt the activity of terrorist groups. Clause 30 streamlines the warranty to enable greater flexibility to respond to the threats faced from international terrorism. For that reason we have made it clear that a senior official would need to be involved in any such process. I do not know whether that answers the noble Lord&#039;s question and whether he wants me to continue and delight the Committee with all the other things that I could say in relation to this amendment, or perhaps that is enough.

<a name="51220-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   &quot;Delight&quot; is in competition with Christmas, so I would not press the Minister to go too far. I am a little disturbed, as what she has said appears to me to mean that every assistant secretary in the home Civil Service is already vested with these powers. I am glad to see her shaking her head. I presume they are named within a department by the Secretary of State. If she could tie that up, I would be very happy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="51220-08_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   It means that anyone who is identified and entrusted with this work has to be at least at that level. Of course, it would be invidious to say, &quot;It has to be within this department and it has to be this person&quot;, but it has to be an identified person who is at the level of a senior civil servant.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="51220-08_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   So it will name Fred Smith rather than saying &quot;the assistant secretary in the Home Office at such and such a time&quot;. I wait for the nodded head but I do not get it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="51220-08_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I am not sure it would name Fred Smith, but it would name someone who is of the level of Fred Smith, in a specified way. I hope that satisfies the noble Lord. I see vigorous nodding to show me that what I am saying is absolutely correct.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="51220-08_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   I was afraid of nominating a post rather than a person, because it could depend on the character of the person. With that understood, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51220-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="51220-08_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Elton </b>   moved Amendment No. 133ZA:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>Page 30, line 12, at end insert &quot;and section 7(1) shall apply though authorisation had been given by the Secretary of State&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>The noble Lord said: A tiny error has crept into the groupings list, which I thought I had avoided. Amendment No. 133ZA should stand on its own; I have decoupled it. This again is a probing amendment. Warrants may be issued with the express authority of the Secretary of State, as we now know, to senior officials. Clause 30(3) restricts that provision to cases in which the actions authorised to be done in the British Isles conform to a condition, extant immediately before the issue of the warrant. That condition is that if they had been done outside the British Isles, they would have been authorised under Section 7 of the ISA, which is the section that, in effect, provides an indemnity in the United Kingdom for persons doing abroad things that would be crimes if done at home.
</p>

<a name="51220-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>That seems to be a rather roundabout way of saying that the warrants can authorise criminal activity in the British Isles. So the intention appears to be that senior officials shall, in an emergency, be able to authorise the doing of criminal acts in the United Kingdom if, at the time the authorisation is given, they would have been indemnified under ISA Section 7 if done abroad. But, in this case, the authorisation is not given under Section 7 and, therefore, the question arises in my <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1647"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1647</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mind whether the person authorised is to be indemnified, as I am sure is the intention of the draftsman, for the criminality of his action as he would be if it had been so indemnified. It seems to me that if we concede that crimes can justifiably be legitimised by circumstances, we ought to ensure that those who are authorised to commit them are not punished for doing so. The amendment is designed both to probe this question and to enable us to consider whether the situation so revealed is desirable. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="51220-08_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I do not think the amendment is necessary. I shall explain why. In one sense, we could have had the debate on Amendments Nos. 134 and 135 with this amendment as they fit in with it, but I shall try to take them out of sequence. The amendment adds a section of text to Section 6(1) of the Intelligence Services Act as inserted by Clause 30(3) of this Bill. The purpose of Clause 30(3) is to establish that the senior official nominated by the Secretary of State can issue Section 5 warrants in urgent circumstances and that he may do so only if the actions covered would be authorised by a current Section 7 authorisation if carried out overseas. That is how I understand the noble Lord puts the matter.
</p>

<a name="51220-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I believe that this amendment is intended to establish that the actions authorised by such a warrant, issued by a senior official, will be treated as if they were authorised by the Secretary of State under Section 7 authorisation. I see the noble Lord agreeing with that. I am grateful to the noble Lord for attempting to clarify that, although I do not believe that it is necessary. Referring back to Section 7 authorisation may be misleading, as Section 7 authorisation may relate only to actions taken overseas, whereas Clause 30(3) relates to the issue of warrants in urgent-circumstances actions in the British Isles. So Clause 30(3) is intended to set out the limits in which a nominated senior official may issue a warrant under Section 5 of the Intelligence Services Act and the subsection does not, therefore, set out the effect of the warrant.
</p>

<a name="51220-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>The short answer to the question raised by the noble Lord in relation to the actions is, of course, that they are lawful and not criminal. So by reason of the warrant under Section 5, the authorisation is relevant only as a precondition of issue and an urgent warrant in the circumstances proposed by the new powers. The difficulty that the noble Lord sees does not actually exist in fact. As I said earlier, the subsection does not set out the effect of the warrant; the amendment appears&#151;I say &quot;appears&quot;&#151;to insert the effect of the warrant. I can understand from the way in which the noble Lord put the matter that that may not be what he thought his amendment did, but it appears to do that. It is unnecessary as the force of the text is already provided in the relevant parts of Section 5 of the Intelligence Services Act. The noble Lord need not concern himself with the fact that the way in which the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1648"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1648</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

clause has been put together would somehow put the official who was authorising it into a difficulty greater than that&#151;I see the noble Lord shaking his head&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="51220-08_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   I was not worried about it before because the official will know what he is doing. I am worried about the operative who is given the warrant because what he does, under certain circumstances, is criminal. In the original section he is protected by the fact that he is under the skirts, as it were, of the Secretary of State. As this is not given under Section 7, that skirt does not appear to be extended to the operative. I am trying to visualise the situation when an unfortunate man or woman does something illegal under a warrant given to him but the warrant does not actually protect him from pursuit in the courts.
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="51220-08_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   The short answer is that if he does that which he is entitled to do pursuant to the warrant, he will have acted lawfully.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="51220-08_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   I am very happy with that. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>Page 30, line 36, after &quot;believed&quot; insert &quot;by the Secretary of State or the person authorised by him to issue a warrant under section 5&quot;</p>

</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall try to compress what I have to say into a couple of sentences. I am left in doubt about one thing. It is not clear to me, as a bungling layman, in whom the suspicion must exist&#151;a bungling but law-abiding layman, my noble friend prompts me to say. The Bill does not specify in whom the belief must subsist. Normal usage would suggest that it is believed by the public or by the police or by No. 10. We need to be specific and I have tabled this amendment to find out who has to believe it. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="51220-08_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   It may be easier if I explain how we say these two fit together. Under the current provisions in the Intelligence Services Act 1994, the Secretary of State may issue an authorisation under Section 7 to enable the carrying out of acts overseas that would be contrary to UK law if carried out in this country.
</p>

<a name="51220-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>In order for an authorisation to be issued in the first place it is required that the issuer be of the opinion that the target for acts authorised under Section 7 is located outside the United Kingdom. Only the Secretary of State or, in some specific circumstances and situations, a senior official, are entitled to issue an authorisation.
</p>

<a name="51220-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>An authorisation will then be passed to the agency permitted to carry out the actions it sets out. If, in carrying out the action, the person holding the authorisation discovers the target to be within the United Kingdom, the changes made by Clause 30 provide that they will continue to be authorised to carry out the activities in question, if <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1649"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1649</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

those actions are such that they could have been authorised under Section 5 of the Intelligence Services Act.
</p>

<a name="51220-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>The duration for which they would continue to be authorised to carry out acts, while the target is in the UK, is a maximum of five working days. This should provide sufficient time to assess the situation and return to the Secretary of State to obtain a warrant under Section 5, if judged appropriate.
</p>

<a name="51220-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Lord might be intended to require the person authorised to carry out actions to return instantly to the person issuing the authorisation and make them aware of the fact that the target is actually in the UK. This may not be possible in an urgent operation, and would eliminate the necessary flexibility that the clause is intended to produce.
</p>

<a name="51220-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>I remind the Committee that this particular provision is intended to ensure that no damaging hiatus exists in an authorised operation intended to disrupt terrorist groups and others, overseas, if members of that group and their property were to enter the United Kingdom. This provision gives us that flexibility.
</p>

<a name="51220-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The noble Lord&#039;s amendments relate to Clause 30(6), which inserts new subsections (11) and (12), among others, into the Intelligence Services Act. The belief referred to in those subsections belongs to the person carrying out the action outlined in the authorisation. This is clear in the amendment. The location of the target property will not always be known as being in the United Kingdom, so the amendments would relate this belief back to the person issuing the authorisation. We would argue that this misunderstands the specific situation&#151;that it is not the person issuing the authorisation who carries out the action.
</p>

<a name="51220-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>The amendment would also create the eventuality in which an individual holding an authorisation would be required to return to the person issuing it in the case that the target enters the United Kingdom, forcing them to cease any actions they are carrying out. It is precisely this case that this clause addresses: in allowing the continuation in the UK of actions that have been authorised overseas, it grants a breathing space to the agency responsible in which a warrant need not be sought for actions in the United Kingdom and which would avoid criminal and civil liability.
</p>

<a name="51220-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Such a breathing space is necessary, as it is often the case that a warrant may not be obtained instantaneously. If this provision is amended, it would not be possible for the operation to continue if the target for actions were to be discovered to be in the United Kingdom, while the warrant was sought. I hope that has better explained why we say that the amendment is not necessary and the two have to go together as we have constructed them. We think that the clause is sufficiently clear to achieve its effect and the amendments tabled by the noble Lord strip out the very usefulness of the amendment made in Clause 30. I hope that, following that explanation the noble Lord will agree that his amendments are not necessary and <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51220-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   The noble Baroness has given a full and satisfactory answer to Amendment No. 136, which I shall not move when we get to it. However, I am left a little concerned about the mistaken belief existing in the mind of the operative&#151;that is the man or woman in the field; as I understand it that is what the Minister said&#151;because the man or woman in the field will know where the thing is that they are doing the thing to, because they will be there doing it, will they not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="51220-09_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I have made clear that the whole point of this provision and the way it works is to allow those who are following an operation, if they have a warrant which was supposed to be exercised outside the jurisdiction and they discover that the person, contrary to reasonable belief, is no longer outside the jurisdiction, but comes back to within the jurisdiction, they will be able to continue that operation. What the amendments would do is to strip that flexibility out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="51220-09_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   That is not quite what the Bill says. In subsection (11), which is where this comes from, it says,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;An act is done in circumstances falling within this subsection if it is done in relation to the property at a time when it is believed to be outside the British Islands.&quot;</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>If the person is doing it to the thing in the British Isles, it must be clear to him that he can no longer believe that it is outside, is that not so?
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="51220-09_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   It depends on whether the person who has the warrant knows the location of the property. In the case of trafficking, for example, the person may not immediately know the location or the details of that location. That is why the flexibility is necessary. Would it be helpful if I wrote in clear terms to the noble Lord in relation to this issue, so that I will perhaps be able to satisfy him more easily on paper?

with what the Minister told me in the interim. What the noble Baroness told me in respect of this amendment was,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;Your amendment 96 (and the similar ones grouped with it) queried why the definitions of terrorism in the Bill refer to the Terrorism Act 2000 as a whole rather than specifically to Section 1 of that Act where the definition is contained&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>as one might have said is the normal form. She goes on,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;This Bill provides that the term terrorism has the same meaning in the Bill as is provided for throughout the Terrorism Act 2000, not just in the definition of Section 1. That Section solely provides the interpretation of terrorism that allows the other provisions in that Act to be understood and the term terrorism in that Act needs to be understood in the separate contexts provided for. We are simply extending that.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>If the noble Baroness could tell me succinctly how I could discover the meaning of terrorism at different points in this Bill, as related to different points in the Act, and why it cannot have a single definition, as would have been better I would have thought, first time around anyway, I would be most grateful. I would not want her to take too long about it, and nor would anybody else, I fear.
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="51220-09_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The noble Lord will have to put up with this noble Lord on this one. As ever, I applaud the desire of the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for clarity and comprehension, for which he has a long track record. I was recently reminded of a very long track record. The noble Lord taught a friend of mine, who said to me recently, &quot;the good thing that you can understand about Lord Elton is that clarity is his middle name&quot;. That was a nice compliment for him to make.
</p>

<a name="51220-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>We do not think that there is any ambiguity in the parts of the Bill that the noble Lord&#039;s amendments seek to alter. They all relate to the definition of terrorism and in each case relate back to the Terrorism Act 2000. All the references concerned are clear on this point and there are helpful pointers to explain which sections of the Act the reader should look at. There should not be any confusion.
</p>

<a name="51220-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>I am afraid that making these changes would result in a provision that would not be as apt as the provision in the Bill. The term &quot;terrorism&quot; is defined for the purposes of the whole of the Terrorism Act 2000 not just Section 1 of that Act, as would be the implication of these amendments. Section 1 may contain the definition of terrorism, as the words in brackets helpfully explain, but that definition applies to the whole of the 2000 Act, as it will to the whole of Part 1 of this Act. This is a subtle distinction but an important one.
</p>

<a name="51220-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>I should draw to your Lordships&#039; attention the fact that several of the terms used in the definition of terrorism in Section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000 are themselves defined later in that Act, in Section 121. For example, the terms &quot;action&quot;, &quot;firearm&quot;, &quot;explosive&quot; and &quot;property&quot;, all of which feature in Section 1 of the 2000 Act, are all defined in Section 121 of that Act. Section 121 is not the only place in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1652"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1652</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which relevant definitions appear. The definition of &quot;proscribed organisation&quot;, for example, is to be found in Section 3(1) of the 2000 Act.
</p>

<a name="51220-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>For those reasons, I think the current drafting is correct. It is technically accurate in that it refers to the definition used in the 2000 Act, not the definition used in a particular section of it, and it provides a helpful pointer towards Section 1 of the 2000 Act as the place where readers may find the body of the definition. As I have indicated, I am sure that these amendments are very well intentioned but I hope that in the light of what I have said the noble Lord will appreciate why it would be appropriate to withdraw them.

&quot;AMENDMENT OF PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT 2005

<br>
(1)   After paragraph (p) of section 1(4) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (c. 2) (power to make control orders) there shall be inserted&#151;

&quot;(9)   The references to property or assets in subsection (3)(q), (r) and (s) include references to property held by the individual as a trustee or under any other fiduciary obligation.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_106"></a>The noble Baroness said: I emphasise that this is a probing amendment that seeks reassurance on issues that I raised at Second Reading, when, I fear, my speech must have sounded rather like an excerpt from <i>The spy who came in from the cold</i>, especially for noble Lords who were not present at the time of the incident that triggered my concern.
</p>

<a name="51220-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>Since Second Reading, the Minister has discussed this issue with me and written to me, for which I thank her. However, my concerns remain and are shared by many people. It would therefore be very helpful if the Minister could provide assurances that this Bill or previous legislation prevent the financial penetration of institutions of key strategic, military, technological or commercial significance by persons who could use their positions for purposes associated with terrorism.
</p>

<a name="51220-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>The example that I described at Second Reading raises specific questions concerning the ownership of significant numbers of shares in firms responsible for security surveillance systems here in Parliament and at other key strategic institutions, such as Ministry of Defence buildings, commercial organisations such as Texaco and British Airways, symbolic locations such as Canary Wharf, and sites of maximum security risk such as the nuclear installations at Dounreay and Sellafield. I am not asking the Minister to comment on specific cases now, but there is widespread concern about the broader issue of the vulnerability of such institutions through the financial control or undue <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1654"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1654</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

influence through ownership of a significant proportion of shares by people with terrorist intent or connections.
</p>

<a name="51220-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>Such influence could include, for example, the appointment of staff. It would need only one or two people, with access to all the internal features of an organisation or regular movements of key personnel and so on, who could, when the time was ripe, initiate a terrorist act and wreak death and destruction from inside a building. In that case, elaborate fortifications and the dedicated police force which protects the exterior of such buildings would be irrelevant.
</p>

<a name="51220-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>I am not paranoid. The amendment seeks to prevent a potentially realistic and catastrophic scenario. Can the Minister say whether there is internal security vetting for all employees here in Parliament and other institutions of key significance, or whether the responsibility for such vetting lies with the employer or contractor? If the latter is the case and the firm employing staff were to have any direct or indirect interest in terrorism, is that not an issue that needs to be addressed?
</p>

<a name="51220-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>The Long Title refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;conduct carried out . . . for purposes connected with terrorism&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>This is relevant to the concerns that I have identified. Clause 5 deals with people engaging,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;in any conduct in preparation for terrorist activities&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>and seeks to restrain it. I shall refer to people who are engaged in such conduct as falling within the Clause 5 principle. The amendment seeks to probe the scope of current provision in this area and to pursue the Clause 5 principle of restraining preparation for terrorist acts. More specifically, perhaps I may ask the Minister the following questions.


</p>

<a name="51220-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>First, is there adequate provision in present legislation or in the Bill as it now stands to cover the acquisition of property, in particular share interests in companies and intellectual property, by people who are engaging in preparation for giving effect to terrorist intentions, which is the principle of Clause 5? Secondly, is there adequate provision for restricting the use of rights to, for example, vote at AGMs, or employ staff, that arise from possession of such property, for people falling within the principle of Clause 5? Thirdly, is there adequate provision for ensuring that people within the principle of Clause 5 can be properly and fairly compelled to divest themselves of certain kinds of property? Fourthly, are there adequate mechanisms for tracing the disposal of property by people falling within the Clause 5 principle? Fifthly, are there adequate mechanisms for ensuring that people falling within the Clause 5 principle do not use trust or other assets held in a fiduciary way improperly? In this connection, are there current legal provisions to prevent the use or abuse of charitable money for purposes associated with terrorism, or do the provisions of the Bill already cover this contingency?
</p>

<a name="51220-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>It is with these questions in mind that we bring these amendments forward. I emphasise that, given the Clause 5 principle, they lie properly within the ambit of the Bill. In detail, they propose amendments to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1655"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1655</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Section 1 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. They are to be inserted after Clause 34 of the Bill, because they are miscellaneous provisions, falling within the main purpose of the Bill. Subsection (1) of new Clause 35 makes it clear that the power to make control orders, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, definitely extends to the kind of questions I have just raised.
</p>

<a name="51220-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>Therefore, I shall briefly and specifically describe the amendments in detail. Paragraph (q) deals with stopping someone with terrorist intentions or connections obtaining ownership or control of certain kinds of property, or using that ownership in undesirable ways. An example would be ownership of a software company whose work has defence implications. Paragraph (r) deals with requiring someone with terrorist intentions or connections to cease owning certain property; for example, where a biotechnology firm holds stocks of potentially dangerous organisms or biological material. Paragraph (s) allows investigation of how someone within the Clause 5 principle may have disposed of certain property and on what terms. For instance, where sensitive intellectual property rights have been sold or passed on, it is important to know the identity of the recipients. Paragraph (t) allows investigation of whether someone is really a nominee for another person or group. Clearly this is of pressing interest where exact chains of responsibility may not be those immediately apparent; for example, where there is a secret holding company registered abroad.
</p>

<a name="51220-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>Subsection (2) of the new clause ensures that trust assets may be properly protected and not abused for terrorist purposes. We have used wide terms such as &quot;property&quot; and &quot;assets&quot; because we recognise how wide the class of things is that might be perverted for terrorist purposes. We have used both the technical term, &quot;trust&quot;, and the broader term, &quot;fiduciary,&quot; to cover the different ways in which someone with legal title may be obligated to deal with property at someone else&#039;s direction.
</p>

<a name="51220-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>I am most grateful for the opportunity to bring these concerns to the Committee of your noble Lordships&#039; House. I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to assure your Lordships that this Bill, or previous legislation, prevents financial penetration of organisations of key strategic financial, political, technological or military significance by those who have an ultimate objective associated with terrorism. If this is not the case, I hope very much that the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, will consider introducing amendments on behalf of the Government to close this massive security loophole.
</p>

<a name="51220-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>I am aware that, like so many measures which have to be taken to deal with this new kind of terrorism, which endangers innocent people on a massive and unprecedented scale, the balance shifts a little in the direction of prevention, rather than our historic and cherished priority principle of response after the act. But as Sir Karl Popper eloquently explained in <i>The Open Society and its Enemies</i>:

<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="51220-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </b>   I rise to support this amendment in the name of my noble friend Lady Cox, to which I have added my name. The amendment follows on from our debate at Second Reading on 21 November (at cols. 1423&#150;26 and cols. 1476&#150;78 of the <i>Official Report</i>) to which, I regret to say, the Minister was unable to give any sort of satisfactory reply (at col. 1492). In my remarks at Second Reading I detailed the case of a gentleman with clear Islamist links who owns 75 per cent of a UK company which supplies high-tech surveillance and security management to this Palace of Westminster and other locations as mentioned today by my noble friend. I revealed that when the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, and I raised this situation with the security services we were told that we had nothing to worry about because the gentleman in question took no interest in the day to day running of the company, despite having increased his shareholding from 25 to 75 per cent around the time of 9/11 and ignoring the fact that, as controlling shareholder, he hires and fires the directors and fixes their remuneration. They must do as he wishes or get another job: he is the company.
</p>

<a name="51220-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>When the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, replied, she was constrained by the fact that it was 10.05 pm and she felt that she could not comment on individual cases or security issues. She then wrote what I can only describe politely as a classically unhelpful letter to my noble friend on 7 December, which was not copied, as promised, to those of us who had spoken in the debate. This is not her fault, of course, but it was sent on to me by my noble friend. I have put a copy in the Library but I cannot resist quoting the final paragraph, as it is one of which Sir Humphrey would have been extremely proud:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;Regarding your specific question about persons of concern holding a controlling interest in the company bidding for or holding such a contract&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>that is, the kind of contracts I have mentioned&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;I am again unable to be specific about whether, when and how assessment of the controlling interests in a particular company is or is not carried out. However, I would like to assure you that the Government take these matters very seriously and due care is given to ensuring that sensitive Government assets and information are protected&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>We were not just talking about &quot;sensitive Government assets and information&quot;. We were talking about the whole range of our industrial, commercial and charitable infrastructure. This is what this amendment seeks to address.
</p>

<a name="51220-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Perhaps I may put some simple questions to the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, in order that we can all understand just how exposed we are? First, when a contract is awarded, giving regular access to a government location or a major industrial or commercial interest, together with opportunities for entrance and surveillance&#151;for instance, the cleaning <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1657"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1657</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

contract in your Lordships&#039; House&#151;is the vetting of all personnel involved left to the contractor, or is it validated independently by the security services? Secondly, what mechanism exists for assessing and, if necessary, removing controlling and substantial interests in our non-governmental industrial, commercial and charitable infrastructure? Thirdly, what duty is placed on this infrastructure to ensure that its own and its contractors&#039; personnel are adequately vetted?
</p>

<a name="51220-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>At this point I can hear my fellow employers in your Lordships&#039; House groaning somewhat at the thought of yet more regulation. We are already submerged by mountains of pointless red tape, most of it forced on us by the beings from outer space who have taken us over via the European Union. We have directives and laws on sexual discrimination and harassment, part-time workers, the handicapped, the hours we are allowed to work and those who may or may not share the colour of our skin. We can freely employ any dodgy character who comes our way from the European Union, but not our skilled and laudable kinsmen from Australia, New Zealand and the USA. We are even supposed to ensure that our workmen on building sites do not expose their posteriors to sunburn, and that they do not climb a ladder unless another workman holds its bottom. In short, we have already gone completely mad.


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>so why do we not have some regulation which might do something to protect our industrial, commercial and charitable infrastructure from the gathering clouds of Islamist terrorism? If the Minister does not want to place an additional burden on our compliance officers, I promise that I can sit down with her and advise her on which items to jettison from the present culture of overregulation, which is most of them.
</p>

<a name="51220-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>Since our Second Reading debate, I have heard disturbing rumours from friends in the security services, which leads me to ask two further questions. First, is there any truth in the suggestion that our vetting procedures generally are being or are going to be relaxed? Secondly, are our procedures for checking the credentials of asylum seekers being relaxed? On a related matter, I note from the front page of today&#039;s <i>Times</i> that the Britishness test for Imams has been abandoned and feel sure that this must be a mistake in the current climate. Will the Minister confirm that that has happened and tell us why that decision was taken?
</p>

<a name="51220-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Finally, this leads me to refer to what I said at Second Reading about the present state of the Muslim religion and the vital need to stimulate more debate within Islam about its true nature and purpose. I regret that the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, is no longer in this place because I was struck by what he said in Committee on this Bill on 13 December (at cols. 1181 and 1182 of the <i>Official Report</i>). The noble Lord is a respected pillar of the Muslim community and, as such, he much regretted that members of that community in this country feel that much of the legislation going through Parliament such as the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1658"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1658</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill, the Identity Cards Bill and this Terrorism Bill are all targeted at the Muslim community.
</p>

<a name="51220-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>I am sure that we all share the noble Lord&#039;s regret and frustration, but I hope that he and his colleagues will understand if I point out that the new barriers and security arrangements that surround your Lordships&#039; House and the other place were not put there to deter Hindus, Christians, Buddhists or even Irish terrorists; they were put there to defend us against the new phenomenon of Islamist terrorism. I therefore ask the Minister whether the Government have given any thought since Second Reading on 21 November as to how they might encourage serious debate within the Muslim community with a view to making the Islamists among them see the errors of their ways and so gradually persuading them to return to peaceful coexistence with the rest of us? I look forward to the Minister&#039;s replies and wish her well in her endeavours.
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="51220-11_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   I support the amendment. The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, has made a most convincing case. It seems to me that, moreover, anyone infiltrated into or already working in a firm responsible for security in a vital installation would be well placed to gather exactly the sort of material needed to mount an attack on the security system. A sleeper could do great damage. Subsections (1) and (2) of Clause 5 are relevant.
</p>

<a name="51220-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>I well understand that the kind of threat which has been identified is such a delicate subject that it is virtually impossible to discuss it here without risking publicising either HMG&#039;s knowledge or lack of knowledge of the present submission. I can only say that I find it extremely disquieting that one man, a Sudanese and not a British citizen, should own a 75 per cent controlling interest in not one, but two firms responsible between them for making and setting up surveillance equipment in a wide range of sensitive British defence and nuclear installations. It is surely a cause for anxiety that these two firms are operating within and responsible for the security systems of several MoD bases, both Houses of Parliament, British Airways, Texaco, and not least 11 nuclear power stations. That is too much knowledge to be held by two basically non-British firms, where the controlling interest is held by one man, a foreigner.
</p>

<a name="51220-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>The actual British employees and managers are I am sure entirely trustworthy and efficient, and this has presumably enabled the two firms to extend their operations by osmosis across a wide range of sensitive targets by a process of introduction. Clearly, a central overview of how many targets were involved and their nature has been lacking. The database that they must hold is surely very vulnerable to infiltration and exploitation by terrorists. The Sudanese owner, or indeed any foreign owner with possible terrorist links, will be able quietly to ensure that some sensitive appointments&#151;even one would be enough&#151;go to his nominee&#151;direct or indirect&#151;possibly someone at a very modest level which would attract no attention. He or she could be triggered at an appropriate time and meanwhile would have invaluable access. I hope <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1659"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1659</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

therefore that the Minister can assure the House, whatever the status of this amendment, that HMG will lose no time in reviewing&#151;if they have not already done so&#151;this potentially dangerous threat to national security, as well as providing on the face of the Bill the safeguards for the future which the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, is proposing. I believe that we owe a great debt to her for her determination over many months in identifying this potentially very serious threat to the safety of our country.

<a name="51220-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   I ask the Minister not to follow too closely some of the tempting lures laid in front of her by my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch. The simple fact is that a controlling interest of this sort held by anyone of any nationality who was linked to any terrorist organisation of any ethnic group would be equally unacceptable, so we are not concerned with Europe or Islamists; we are concerned with terrorists. It is from them that we and the country wish to be protected.
</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="51220-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </b>   Before the Minister rises, I accept the rebuke from my noble friend Lord Elton in tempting her slightly wide of the specifics of the amendment, but Islamism does enter into this amendment very seriously because the gentleman concerned has clear Islamist links.

<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="51220-12_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   Any suggestion that the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, makes about combating terrorism has to be taken seriously. As the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, observed at Second Reading, she has done more than anyone to warn of the growing danger that militant Islamism poses to Western society.
</p>

<a name="51220-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The issue that this amendment confronts is: are terrorists or those sympathetic to terrorism buying into strategic industrial and infrastructural concerns in our country with the aim of undermining our security? The Committee will recall the worries that the noble Baroness expressed about certain companies in her Second Reading speech.
</p>

<a name="51220-12_para1"></a>

noble Lord, Lord Elton, that I will do my best to resist the lures cast out by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, in relation to leading me astray down the path of commenting on things that are inappropriate to this amendment. I also reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Park, that we understand the sensitivity of these issues and bear in mind the caution that she rightly mentioned in relation to this whole issue and how it must be dealt with.
</p>

<a name="51220-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>Noble Lords will know that the security issues as they pertain to this House are a matter for the House authorities. Therefore, I am unable to comment on them. I hope that the Committee will understand that.
</p>

<a name="51220-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>The new clause proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, would amend the existing exemplary list in Section 1(4) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. Before getting into the substance of the amendment, perhaps I can say something more generally on the subject of control orders. As your Lordships may be aware, it was agreed between the main political parties in July that we would accelerate the passage of the Bill and leave the issue of control orders to one side for the time being.
</p>

<a name="51220-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>Noble Lords will also be aware that the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, who is the independent reviewer of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, will give his report on the operation of the first nine months of the control order regime early in 2006. That will be the appropriate time to consider the issue of control orders more generally. I hasten to make it clear that I absolutely understand why the noble Baroness raises the issue now, as it is the appropriate vehicle for her to explore the issue and give us an opportunity to talk about it. I make no criticism of the noble Baroness for doing that, as it is an important discussion for us to have.
</p>

<a name="51220-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Turning to the amendment, the new clause would amend Section 1(4) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. It is important to remind ourselves that Section 1(4) of that Act contains a list of examples of obligations that can be imposed on an individual who is subject to a control order. The specified obligations are all examples of the types of obligations that can be imposed pursuant to the general power in Section 1(3), which allows a control order to impose any obligation but only when those obligations are considered,

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>That limitation on the obligations that can be contained in a control order is important when considering the new clause. We think that the noble Baroness&#039;s concerns can be subsumed within those provisions. However, with the limitation that I have just outlined, I do not think that the additions suggested by the noble Baroness are necessary. There is some doubt about whether some of them may even fall within the ambit of the control order regime at all. That is because it has to be tied back into what is necessary for the purposes of preventing or restricting involvement by the individual in terrorism-related activity.

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>Proposed new paragraph (q), which refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;a prohibition or restriction on his acquisition of specified property or assets (including intellectual property)&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>is unnecessary as that is covered by existing obligations specified in Section 1(4)(a), (b) or (c), which are,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;(a) a prohibition or restriction on his possession or use of specified articles or substances;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>(b) a prohibition or restriction on his use of specified services or specified facilities, or on his carrying on specified activities;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>(c) a restriction in respect of his work or other occupation, or in respect of his business&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Even if it were argued that the wording of Section 1(4)(a), (b) and (c) did not quite fit the particular circumstance of buying shares, it is important to remember that the obligations in Section 1(4) are examples such that similar obligations controlling the use of a person&#039;s property can be imposed, provided of course that they are necessary and proportionate to prevent his terrorism-related activities.
</p>

<a name="51220-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>On the other obligations proposed by the noble Baroness in new paragraphs (r), (s) and (t), there is a question on whether their insertion into the control order regime is practical. The control order regime is preventive as I have just explained. Obligations can be imposed only where necessary to prevent or restrict the controlled person from involvement in terrorism-related activity. Punitive obligations therefore are excluded from the regime, as are obligations that do not directly address the risk that the individual poses. To that end, we question whether the remaining proposed paragraphs could be included in the control order. With regard to proposed paragraph (r) it would be the use, not the possession, of such asset that would pose a risk. That is not to say that we do not take the possession of assets by those who pose a risk to the UK&#039;s security and interest seriously. We certainly do.
</p>

<a name="51220-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, for indicating that she does not expect me to answer or comment on specific cases, and I shall not do so. The Terrorism Act 2000 introduced a number of special provisions for the detection and prosecution of terrorist finance. For instance, it provided for the seizure and subsequent forfeiture of cash at borders by the police. It required individuals to report activity that came to light in the conduct of their profession, and which aroused suspicion of terrorism. It also allowed the police to place a disclosure order on a financial institution requiring the release of customer information as part of a terrorist investigation.
</p>

<a name="51220-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 amended that framework, allowing the United Kingdom to take immediate targeted action to freeze the assets of overseas individuals or groups that carry out or support terrorist acts. Part 1 and Schedules 1 and 2 to the Act contain provisions to prevent terrorists gaining access to their money. They ensure that investigative and freezing powers are available wherever funds could be used to finance terrorism. The Act gives law enforcement agencies the power to seize terrorist cash anywhere in the United Kingdom, and the power to freeze assets at the start of an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1662"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1662</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

investigation, rather than when the person is about to be charged, thereby reducing the risk that funds will be used or moved before they can be frozen.
</p>

<a name="51220-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The Newton committee, which reviewed the legislation, concluded that the provisions were a proportionate and effective extension of the framework set by the Terrorism Act 2000. The Act also provides for freezing orders that ensure that controls equivalent to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 apply to terrorism. The control orders include gold, cash, deposits and securities, which include stocks, shares and debentures.

<a name="51220-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   Is that power dependent on the wish to interrupt the flow of cash and its availability to terrorists? If so, it is outwith the debate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="51220-13_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Where terrorist activity has been established, whether by an individual or whether there is a risk of it, various steps can be taken. We can freeze assets or reclaim other assets. They are all ways of getting financial control of individuals who have been identified as terrorists or who have been involved in terrorist activity. It is predicated on their being identified. I am sure that noble Lords would not wish us to be able to seize, take and otherwise deal&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="51220-13_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   May I revert to the point made by my noble friend Lord Elton? Whatever else we may get from this extremely valuable discussion can we be assured that if there has not already been, there will now be a central review of all the organisations and targets that are known to be serviced by those two firms, so that the issue is looked at in the round from above, and not simply from the point of view of the MoD, the House of Commons or the House of Lords? That would be a major result from all this, which we are entitled to expect.
</p>

<a name="51220-13_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   The noble Baroness will know well from her own experience that I could not possibly comment on this case or on what has already been done. But the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, has raised an important matter. We have had an opportunity to debate it and it is a matter of which the Government are fully aware. She has expressed her concerns with force and cogency and therefore, in addressing her issues, I can assure the noble Baronesses, Lady Park and Lady Cox, that these matters have excited the appropriate level of interest.

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="51220-13_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </b>   In that case, can I refer the noble Baroness to something that she said earlier, on which I have been ruminating? I think that she said that the Government separated the possession of an asset from the active use of an asset. Of course, that does not work if one is talking about a 75 per cent shareholding in a company. Although one may not be doing anything active with it at the moment, with that sort of power one can put people in place as sleepers, if one likes, through the directors of the company who are controlled, and one can activate that at a moment&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>

notice. So in this review, which the noble Baroness assures us is taking place&#151;or it may not be taking place, and she cannot tell us whether it is&#151;I urge the Government simply to consider that controlling shareholdings of this kind cannot ever be regarded as dormant, especially when the person concerned increased his shareholding from 25 to 75 per cent at the time of 9/11 and he has an acute interest in the company.
</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="51220-13_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I have made it clear&#151;and the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, accepts&#151;that it would be quite improper for me to say anything at all about the facts and the case that she has highlighted. However, I can say that one has to look at the integrity of the provisions that we have and consider whether they can meet the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness and whether we need to do more. I understand that that is the thrust of the noble Baroness&#039;s attempt to amend the Bill at this stage. I am very happy to address the thrust of her amendments and I hope to be able to give her a modicum of reassurance that her concerns have already been, and are being, adequately dealt with.
</p>




<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="51220-13_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. It would seem that the acid test of the position put by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, is this. Certain key infrastructural operations in this country are vital to our daily lives&#151;power stations are one obvious example and there are others which are perhaps less obvious but, nevertheless, still crucial. The danger that we face from a company controlled by someone who is sympathetic to terrorism is that if that company, for example, wins a contractual bid which gives it access to a key part of our infrastructure, it can gain information from that access which would make it much easier for terrorists to take out that concern and therefore undermine our security.
</p>

<a name="51220-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>The Committee needs to know whether the existing legislation is adequate to ensure that an opportunity would not be given to a company controlled by someone with terrorist intentions. That is the acid test of the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="51220-13_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   I should like to look at these matters much more generally than in terms of the two companies to which reference has been made. I fully agree that the amendment is no doubt defective and that it is probably wrong in proposing to use control orders as a mechanism for dealing with the problem identified. But that problem seems to be the great vulnerability of a wide range of sites. I shall give one example.
</p>

<a name="51220-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>There was a recent serious fire in a fuel depot, which the media promptly hyped up into a risk of serious air pollution covering the whole London metropolitan area. Fortunately it did not come to that but, under different circumstances, it might have done. Therefore, how far does positive vetting of contractors&#039; personnel, who already have access to these vulnerable sites, extend? How thorough is it? <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1664"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1664</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Who is in charge of such positive vetting? No doubt the Government will say that, where it is a commercial site, the commercial operators of the site are responsible for their own vetting. But there are a large number of government sites in varying degrees of vulnerability, and surely the Government should put their own house in order and set a good example to the commercial and private sector. I look forward to any further information that we can be given.
</p>




<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="51220-13_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I assure the noble Lord that in relation to the security of government sites appropriate measures are taken by the Government, and indeed have been taken by every government that went before us. The most vigorous attention is paid to our security, not least because of the sensitivities with which we now find ourselves and which we have been talking about throughout the passage of this Bill. Therefore, I assure noble Lords that the Government are as sensitive to our vulnerabilities as are various Members of the Committee.
</p>

<a name="51220-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>I can also say to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that we understand the import of the noble Baroness&#039;s questions. But it is a difficult matter because the whole debate is predicated on certain assertions being made by and about certain individuals, which may or may not be true. If someone had been identified as a terrorist or as being involved in terrorist activity, it would be clear that under the legislation that we have there would be trenchant opportunities for us to intervene, to remove his property, to control his activities, and to ensure that he was disabled from getting the information and taking adventitious advantage of resources which would inure to the disadvantage and detriment of our country. However, where such persons carry out lawful activity, it is right that we should not be able to intervene or interfere in the proper exercise of that activity in a way that is disproportionate and unjustified. That is the balance that we have to make. But in terms of those involved in terrorist activities, the control orders and provisions made in this Bill would then bite.
</p>

<a name="51220-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>So we have the ability to deal with matters under the Proceeds of Crime Act, as I have just described, and the 2001 Act. The Act also includes an obligation on the financial sector to report where there are reasonable grounds to suspect terrorist financing, and it gives us a power to freeze the assets at the start of an investigation, thus reducing the risk that funds will be used or moved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="51220-13_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   The noble Baroness said earlier that the amendment is not directed at the funding of terrorism but at the control of security. We have mentioned a particular case. If it is the availability of cash for terrorist purposes that triggers what the noble Baroness says is available&#151;that is how she expressed it&#151;that would not relate to this case. As we are discussing a case, that is relevant.


</p>




<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="51220-13_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I have said about six times now that I am not discussing this case, but I shall return to the facts and remind your Lordships what <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1665"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1665</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I have already said on the powers that we have under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Section 1(4). We already have under the control orders an ability to prohibit the person&#039;s possession of specified things or articles, their use of specified services or specified facilities or their carrying on of specified activities, and restrictions in respect of their business. Those issues that we have under Section 1(4) enable us to control what an individual does with the assets that he has.
</p>

<a name="51220-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>The reason why the use is important is that we need to be clear that the punitive obligations are in relation to the use, not the possession, of such an asset. We would have to look at the risk posed. Any of the control orders can be made in relation to controlling that identified risk.
</p>

<a name="51220-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The combination of the provisions we have under Section 1(4) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Terrorism Acts 2002 and 2001 gives us a broad spectrum of powers to enable us to control appropriately such assets and the use to which they are put by those identified as terrorists or the financers of terrorists. I have already dealt with the first part of the argument and simply seek to reassure noble Lords that we can freeze assets too, so as to ensure that they are not used.
</p>

<a name="51220-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>I will repeat it if it assists noble Lords: the orders under the Proceeds of Crime Act can include gold, cash, deposits and securities&#151;which include stocks, shares and debentures&#151;and removing them from the control of those who have been identified under the Act as capable of having their property removed from them. I hope that that satisfies the noble Lord, Lord Elton, because I cannot say it more comprehensively.

I realise how we test her patience. In the last two sentences before she sat down, she referred to powers that I will want to read about. I will reread what she says between now and Report. She seemed to be saying that if somebody who was not funding terrorism, but was in a position to control security of government and other assets essential to national life, they could be deprived of that control.
</p>

<a name="51220-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>I really cannot see that she can pin her hopes on Section 1(4)(a) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005,

<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="51220-14_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I thank the noble Lord, but I hope that he will appreciate that, if someone has acquired certain assets, we cannot deprive them of those assets simply because they happen to have a nationality with which we have concerns. That, frankly, would be intolerable.
</p>

<a name="51220-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>I remind noble Lords that under Section 1(4)(c) restrictions can be imposed in respect of business. That is under the control order.
</p>

<a name="51220-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>The Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2001 gives effect to the UN resolution of 28 September and provides the Treasury with the power to direct that funds are not made available to any person specified under that order. Asset freezing is an essential element in measures countering the financing of terrorism, by denying terrorists and their financers access to funds across the world. I can only assume that one of the concerns is that not only may this person have financially infiltrated the system and therefore have assets, but he could also use those assets in a way that might be detrimental and to the disadvantage of this country. We have done a great deal of this work since 11 September 2001; 44 accounts have been frozen in the United Kingdom, and a total of 45 accounts are frozen by UK financial institutions.

<a name="51220-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>These add up to a substantial package of measures, which can be taken to ensure that those who are serious security concerns are dealt with appropriately.
</p>

<a name="51220-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>In relation to proposed paragraphs (s) and (t), a control order cannot be used to try to uncover criminal activity. If we impose a control order on someone because his terrorist-related activities include, for example, facilitating terrorism through holding assets on trust for other terrorists, the control order itself would address this activity by restricting it. By contrast, if no activity is suspected or known about, it is difficult to see how an obligation could be necessary or proportionate for purposes connected with preventing or restricting involvement by that individual in terrorism-related activity.
</p>

<a name="51220-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>I thank the noble Baroness for giving me such a delightful opportunity to explore the issue in such depth. I hope that I have satisfied her that this is a matter that the Government are seized of and which is being dealt with appropriately.

then I am sure that your Lordships&#039; House would accept, in turn, that a piece of legislation other than the control order system might be more appropriate to regulate the problem that the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, identified.
</p>

<a name="51220-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>My difficulty with what the Minister has said so far is that I am still unclear whether she thinks that the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, has identified a problem that is not yet covered by any existing legislation.

</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="51220-14_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I am not aware of any relaxation or change in our procedures.

<a name="51220-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>On the discussion about terrorism and the contribution of all our communities, the noble Lords will know that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and many others have already indicated that that is to be welcomed. We are working closely with the Muslim community to try to address the causes of radicalisation. We are looking at how to take forward the recommendations of the Preventing Extremism Together workshops, which have been meeting since July. All that work is important, but it is also important that we do that work with all our other communities. Terrorism does not, regrettably, attack just one part of our community. It is something to which we are all subject. That was made clear, if it was not clear before, when the bombs went off on 7 July: the people of our country, of all different nationalities, but all British, died, and they died together.

<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="51220-14_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Cox: </b>   I am most grateful to all noble Lords who have contributed to the debate and have clarified and enhanced the concerns I tried to express. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, very graciously pressed these points with great eloquence and I am grateful for his clarification and persistence on the heart of the matter. The heart of the matter, as I said in my opening remarks, must move a little from the specific to the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1668"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1668</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

general and from the general to the specific.  It deals with the question of undue influence by people who might have terrorist intent through the financial influence of firms of key strategic significance of various kinds.
</p>

<a name="51220-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>As the Minister rightly said, I do not expect clarification on matters which have specific security sensitivities. That would cover relationships concerning the Houses of Parliament. We also talked about other organisations; as the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, said, we are really talking about the whole of our industrial, commercial and charitable infrastructure. On the arrangements for ensuring appropriate employment or vetting procedures, I understood the noble Baroness to say that the responsibility lies with employers or contractors. That must be a matter of public transparency. That is not in the realm of the secret and the sensitive; we are dealing with firms such as Texaco, British Airways and others. I am still not sure how much reassurance we have had on the procedures that are in place to ensure that for key posts in those firms, there is adequate vetting for sensitive areas.
</p>

<a name="51220-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Park, highlighted a point which has been at the heart of my concern. Here we must move from the general to the specific.  There is almost a cartel of security surveillance firms. Security surveillance for a whole range of organisations is arranged through two firms&#151;IEDS and Protec.  The range of those firms is enormously significant, particularly when one of the key financial personnel in that firm has close links with the Islamist regime in Khartoum. Saleh Idris owned a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, and anyone who owns a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum must have very close links with the National Islamic Front regime, which is committed to spreading militant Islam throughout Africa and beyond. We must move from the general to the specific in terms of transparency, safeguards and general principle.
</p>

<a name="51220-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>Disagreeing for a moment with the Minister, I endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, said. We are addressing a specific kind of terrorism: Islamist terrorism. Of course the vast majority of Muslims in this country are peaceable, law-abiding and very hospitable, but there is a definite strand within the Islamic community in this country&#151;and it is incontrovertible&#151;that is committed to Islamist terrorism and is underpinned by an Islamist ideology which promotes terrorism. That is particularly worrying given the relaxation of restrictions concerning imams in this country. Those of us who have followed these issues, read the websites and heard the speeches know that there are people in this country who are promoting Islamist terrorism&#151;Abu Hamza did it freely for many years&#151;and that many people have come under their influence.

<a name="51220-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Elton </b>   moved Amendment No. 144:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>Page 38, line 37, leave out &quot;of&quot; and insert &quot;for&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_136"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is proposed on the grounds of good English. The header to Clause 21 is entitled &quot;Grounds of proscription&quot; when it should be &quot;grounds for proscription&quot;. I then saw that in the header to Clause 24 we had got it right. I was told by the Table that one cannot amend the header because it is outside the Bill. Then, with delight, I found the phrase on line 37 of page 38, so I tabled this amendment which I hope the noble Baroness, in the spirit of Christmas, will be moved to accept. If she is not, and before she has a chance to disappoint me, I should like to say with what admiration I have watched the way in which she has conducted two main programme Bills, in parallel, virtually single-handed through this House. I have had some experience at the Dispatch Box, and know what strain she has been under. I think she has borne it with exemplary patience and clarity, and I am most grateful to her. Having said that, I cannot believe that she will not agree to the amendment. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="51220-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I hate to disappoint the noble Lord but it is to me that the Committee will have to listen on this very worthwhile amendment which my briefing note says we have to resist. I appreciate, as ever, the noble Lord&#039;s style in moving the amendment. I greatly admire my noble friend Lady Scotland and have enjoyed working alongside her. She has done a brilliant job on this Bill and the Identity Cards Bill, and I know that everybody shares that view.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>This is the final amendment. Paragraph 2(2) in Schedule 2, which is concerned with seizure of terrorist publications, says that a seizure notice must set out,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The amendment would change the word &quot;of&quot; to &quot;for&quot;. In our opinion, that would make absolutely no difference. As a matter of law and of correct English, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1670"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1670</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

both terms are correct. Nor do I think that one option, rather than the other, would enhance the clarity of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Elton, takes the Conservative Whip, so I am sure he will be familiar with one of the great Conservative quotations in history. It was Lucius Cary, the second Viscount Falkland, who in 1641 said:

Clause 21 is entitled &quot;Grounds of proscription&quot;, while Clause 24 is entitled &quot;Grounds for extending detention&quot;. I hope that the Government will repent of this miserly, niggardly, inflexible, sour and detestable reply they have given to a simple request, made on the eve of Christmas. None the less, I wish them well for the season. Regretfully, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="51220-15_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>This short Bill extends the life of the provisions contained in Part VII of the Terrorism Act 2000 until 31 July 2007, with an option to extend the provisions for one year only thereafter. Without this Bill, the provisions would lapse in February 2006.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>The Part VII provisions are particular to Northern Ireland. They contain measures designed to tackle the threat of terrorism connected with the affairs only of Northern Ireland. That is distinct from the permanent counter-terrorism provisions in the UK, which are designed to tackle terrorism more generally.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1671"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1671</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The Bill also makes some changes to Northern Ireland counter-terrorism legislation. It permanently repeals some of the Part VII provisions that are no longer required. It also gives the Attorney-General greater discretion to certify cases out of the Diplock system of non-jury trial, and grants the Secretary of State the ability to make transitional provision for any of the Part VII provisions which cease to have effect.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I would particularly like to explain the July 2007 date is contained on the face of the Bill. On 28 July this year, the IRA made an historic statement ending its armed campaign. In the light of that, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced a programme to normalise security measures in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>The security situation in Northern Ireland has improved significantly. Coupled with that, the permanent counter-terrorism legislative framework in the UK has become even stronger and more effective since the passing of the Terrorism Act 2000. These two developments together mean that the temporary provisions will no longer be necessary in the future.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>Subject to a continuing improvement in the security environment in Northern Ireland, the normalisation programme envisages the repeal of counter-terrorism legislation particular to Northern Ireland in the final four months of that programme. If the security situation does not support it, normalisation and the repeal of the Part VII provisions will not go ahead. That is why the Bill contains a once-only power for the Secretary of State to extend the life of the provisions beyond 2007, for up to a year.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>We have a duty to protect the safety and security of the people of Northern Ireland and we will not do anything to jeopardise this. That is why, if the security situation does not support the repeal of the provisions in 2007, we will extend them for a further year. If that is not sufficient, then, of course, the whole thing will lapse, and we will return to Parliament and seek the retention of Part VII for a further period beyond that date. That, of course, would have to be done by primary legislation.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, who is the Government&#039;s reviewer of counter-terrorism legislation, has said that this approach is:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;justified on the merits and proportional&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>We are optimistic that the time is right for the repeal of Part VII and a return to normalised security arrangements, but we are also cautious. This Bill ensures that we can continue to protect the people of Northern Ireland by providing the law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to combat terrorism in Northern Ireland. I commend the Bill to the House.

<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="51220-15_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   My Lords, the Minister&#039;s speech has already dealt with many of my concerns, but I shall nevertheless reiterate them.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1672"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1672</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>My chief concern with the Bill is to support the provisions which retain and strengthen the powers of the police and the status of the judicial system. I believe that the Diplock courts need to be retained, and those parts of Section 67 which provide that, because of the vulnerability of magistrates&#039; courts, a magistrate cannot grant bail. Further, we should retain police powers for the prevention and investigation of terrorist crime; notably, the powers to arrest, stop, search and seize, and to examine documents. The Bill before us does that, and even extends such provision. As Gerry Adams famously said, the IRA has not yet gone away, despite some tardy decommissioning. The paramilitaries remain a serious threat to society.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>It is fashionable to accept Sinn Fein/IRA&#039;s dissociation of itself from the Real IRA, INLA and the Continuity IRA. However, these so-called dissident groups would never be allowed to exist and continue to recruit and train even now, according to the Monitoring Commission, if they were really defiant, independent entities out of PIRA&#039;s control. They are, for the Provisional IRA, useful organs which can be disowned, as they were at Omagh, but are, in reality, still manifestations, and even creatures, of the IRA.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>For the same reason, I am glad to see, if I have understood the Bill, that the oral evidence of a police officer will continue to be admissible as evidence that the accused was or is a member of a proscribed organisation.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>I could wish that there were not the prospect that some Part VII provisions, though continuing in force after February next year, are to cease to have effect in July 2007, but the Minister has commented on that. It has taken eight years for the IRA to do some serious&#151;although, in my view, almost certainly incomplete&#151;decommissioning. HMG, for its part, has demolished border posts, disbanded regiments and removed protection from police posts.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>The paramilitaries, however, are still there, dominating their communities. Those they exiled have not returned. They are not only, despite the good work of the Organised Crime Task Force, a serious threat to the economy of the country&#151;and not just through the Northern Bank raid&#151;but continue to prevent justice from being done, and try to exert undue influence through the so-called restorative justice networks. They have driven the McCartney sisters, good republicans, from their homes, and continue to deny them justice. The case of the McCartney murder has still not come to court, because the IRA refuses, as always, to allow witnesses to testify; another example of its total, continuing rejection of the justice system. As at Omagh, it does not recognise the British courts.
</p>

<a name="51220-15_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>I hope that HMG continues to maintain, for as long as possible, a criminal justice system which can deliver justice. That will certainly be at risk if criminal justice in Northern Ireland is devolved too soon. Not least, we must not allow recent developments, which are by no means what they seem, to be exploited by Sinn Fein/IRA to bounce HMG into giving more concessions prematurely in the area of policing and criminal justice that are at present, I thank God, safe and in the public interest.

<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="51220-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton </b>  : My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill so succintly. There is a somewhat surreal quality to the debate today in the light of the recent Stormontgate revelations, but that is for another time.
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>During the progress of the Terrorism Act 2000 through Parliament, the Liberal Democrats welcomed the fact that those measures were to be in place only for five years and were to be subject to renewal by Parliament by statutory instrument every twelve months. Along with many other noble Lords, I have participated in many of the debates on the statutory instruments which renewed the provisions, and others who have listened to and read the debates will agree that it is very important that Parliament has been able to look at the provisions on a regular basis and to make its own judgement about the situation in Northern Ireland and whether those provisions remained necessary.
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>It has also been extremely useful in the run-up to these debates to have been able to study the annual reports of my noble friend Lord Carlile of Berriew. His work in this area has been invaluable.
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Unfortunately, given the time-frame needed to have this Bill on the statute books before the provisions run out in February, we are unable to see his deliberations on the operation of Part VII of the 2000 Act in the current year, but we shall be looking very closely at his latest report when it is published.
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>It is still important to ensure that the measures we are debating today&#151;which this Bill seeks to keep in force&#151;are subject to a very specific time limit. We welcome the fact that Part VII is to be extended for only a very limited time&#151;until 31 July 2007. There is provision in the Bill for the sections that are then in force to continue in force no later than 1 August 2008, but again with specific parliamentary approval by statutory instrument. I congratulate the Government on facilitating that. It is desperately important that Parliament is able to look regularly and closely at whether such measures are indeed necessary in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>It is regrettable that insufficient progress has been made in Northern Ireland in the five years since the 2000 Act was passed to render the provisions of Part VII redundant. Although some progress has been made recently in Northern Ireland, there has been such turmoil in the intervening years that it is with much regret that we have to agree with the Government that the provisions of Part VII are still necessary.
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>While the IRA statement in July and the subsequent decommissioning of IRA weapons were significant events, the fact that it took so long to happen&#151;five and a half years after all paramilitaries were meant to have completed decommissioning and seven and a half years after the signing of the Good Friday agreement&#151;has meant that we have not yet had sufficient time to judge whether the IRA will be true to its word. The signs from the latest IMC report are encouraging and we look forward to its next report in January.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1674"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1674</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>Although there has been progress in relation to IRA violence, there unfortunately has not been similar progress made in relation to loyalist violence or dissident republicans. The violence that we saw over the summer from loyalist paramilitaries was truly horrific and unfortunately demonstrated in no uncertain terms why it is necessary for Part VII of the 2000 Act to remain in force. In saying that though, we were very encouraged to see in October that the UDA was continuing to talk to the decommissioning commission. Can the Minister tell us if any progress is being made or if there have been subsequent meetings? Is the Minister hopeful that other loyalist paramilitaries might follow this example? Can he indicate to the House what the Government are doing to persuade loyalists to give up their arms?
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>We are pleased that in the past five years the Government have largely accepted the recommendations put forward in his annual reports by my noble friend Lord Carlile of Berriew. We are particularly pleased that the Government are not now seeking to resurrect Sections 70 and 71, which were repealed earlier this year. Those sections provided for the Secretary of State to make directions for young persons charged with a scheduled offence to be held in adult prisons while on remand. The power derived from a time when young persons were held in remand homes. These were insecure and presented serious problems in the management of some of the remand population. Thankfully, there have been great advances in the youth justice system in Northern Ireland in recent years, with Hydebank Young Offenders Centre and the Juvenile Justice Centre now being able to provide the level of security that is needed. These are welcome developments and the Government are right to ensure that those sections do not return to the statute book.
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>However, in his report on the operation of Part VII, my noble friend Lord Carlile raised some concerns in relation to Section 108 of the 2000 Act. It makes provisions for the evidence that may lead a court to conclude that a Section 11 offence&#151;membership of a proscribed organisation&#151;has been committed. Subsections (2) and (3) of that section render admissible under Section 11 charge hearsay evidence which would not otherwise be admissible. The evidence must be given orally by a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent. If it is his opinion that the accused belongs to an organisation which is specified, that statement &quot;shall be admissible&quot; as evidence of the matter stated.
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>In his 2004 report, Lord Carlile found that Section 108 had not been used. In paragraph 19.7 of that report he states,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;I am totally unpersuaded by the arguments for its retention . . . Section 108 could be repealed without any measurable disadvantage to the cause of public protection from terrorism. It is a provision that lies uncomfortably in the broader context of normalisation and the Good Friday Agreement&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>By virtue of this Bill, Section 108 would continue to remain in force.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1675"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1675</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>The issue was thoroughly debated in another place, where the Minister argued that only when the provision is tested will we know whether my noble friend Lord Carlile&#039;s concerns are justified. The Minister further argued that its repeal would undermine a prosecution case in relation to the Omagh bombing. We have considered those arguments very carefully. Can the Minister indicate whether, if it came to 2008 and the Government decided that the situation was such in Northern Ireland that Part VII was not on the whole necessary, they would keep Section 108 on the statute book if it had still not been tested?
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>Our other issue of concern raised in the other place related to Diplock courts. We very much welcome the assurances given by the Minister to consult on new arrangements and put them to pre-legislative scrutiny. On the basis of those reassurances we shall not be pressing this issue at this time.
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>It is important to ensure that the Part VII provisions of the 2000 Act remain in force for the time being. We shall, however, be studying with great interest and in detail the next IMC report and my noble friend Lord Carlile&#039;s next report. We sincerely hope that this is the last time that these provisions need to come before the House.

<a name="51220-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the Northern Ireland terrorism Bill. In the Province there are many like me who have difficulty coming to terms with the need for this Bill at a time when the &quot;war is over&quot; according to the Government.
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>In a Written Answer of yesterday the Government described the IRA statement of 25 September as historic. On the other hand, in the same batch of Answers to Questions I learn that to provide security for many homes has cost &#163;45 million in five years and that the cost has gone up each year. The news is full of the fall-out from the Stormontgate spy issue and more is revealed each day. The legislation may unfortunately be required and I agree with its introduction in this form. However, the Government should have introduced measures to confront the new threat of white collar terrorism.

But the last two weeks have also highlighted the possible extent of the web of IRA/Sinn Fein sleepers and spies in both governmental systems and in other places of influence.
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>How can measures in this Bill help to expose the many IRA sleepers who are in the decision-making process in Northern Ireland?

<a name="51220-16_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>For decades the IRA and Sinn Fein have been infiltrating the media in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. One of the Republic&#039;s main graduate journalism courses, in Griffith College Dublin, is run by Niall Meehan, a long-serving Sinn Fein official, and by that party&#039;s general secretary, Robbie Smyth. Neither has worked on any mainstream newspaper or broadcasting station. The NUJ executive in Dublin also includes Ronan Brady, whose experience in journalism is largely limited to his time on Sinn Fein&#039;s newspaper <i>Republican News</i>, an organ which glorified the murderous exploits of the IRA in its &quot;War News&quot; section.

<a name="51220-16_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>That much of the media is now infiltrated and influenced by Sinn Fein/IRA can be seen in the highly negative reaction in sections of the southern media, in particular the state broadcaster RTE, against the Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, when he outed and denounced Frank Connolly&#151;one of the Republic&#039;s most prominent journalists&#151;as an IRA fellow traveller who, as I pointed out in your Lordships&#039; House in June, joined one of the IRA&#039;s top bomb-makers, Padraig Wilson, on a secret trip to Colombia in June 2001 under a false passport. It is not a coincidence that, instead of being lauded for his actions, the Minister for Justice of the Irish Republic found himself the subject of a campaign of vilification in the Irish media. The worst example of biased coverage has been that of the RTE. In view of the past two weeks, perhaps it is time that two very senior RTE officials explained their extreme republican backgrounds.
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Gerry Adams said recently that all British and Irish spies in the IRA/Sinn Fein must be removed. I say to Gerry Adams: what about the IRA/Sinn Fein spies in the establishment, who the Irish police, the Garda, call Gerry Adams&#039;s secret army? Will he be unveiling and removing his people?
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>I have been concerned for some time about an Irish-only policy being adopted by sections of the Northern Ireland Civil Service. This means that anything Irish gets support; anything that is not Irish is held up. The massive payments to nationalist festivals each year and very little to non-Irish events is an example that I have discussed with the Minister and shall return to again.
</p>

<a name="51220-16_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>In broad terms, I support the Bill.

<a name="51220-17_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, it is, of course, extremely disappointing that we are still here today debating the necessity for the Bill as it touches on terrorism matters in Northern Ireland. But, as we have heard, it is still important to ensure that terrorism is fought wherever it appears&#151;and, sadly, Northern Ireland has known its full horror for far too many years. That is why we are here to extend, yet again, the provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000 to Northern Ireland, and specifically Part VII of the Act which applies only to Northern Ireland, as the Minister outlined at the beginning of his speech.
</p>

<a name="51220-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>As we have heard, the provisions are temporary. We have seen them before, always hoping it would be the last time. They are also time-limited, as my noble <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1677"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1677</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

friend Lord Smith of Clifton reminded us. We therefore agree that they need to be extended once again, otherwise they will expire on 18 February.
</p>

<a name="51220-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Progress is being made, slowly and painfully, but with some amount of good will here and there. It is to be hoped that politicians of all persuasions will work together so that these provisions may not be necessary for much longer. Perhaps this is a na-ve and wishful thought but it is the only way in which this part of the legislation will eventually be repealed.
</p>

<a name="51220-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>As my noble friend Lord Carlile of Berriew noted in the introduction to his <i>Report on the Operation in 2004 of the Terrorism Act 2000</i>:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;Serious political parties can have no truck with organised crime or gang violence. This needs to be accepted without demur on a permanent basis by all parties in Northern Ireland. Those who oppose judge alone criminal courts there weaken their case dramatically by any involvement in the activities of ruthless criminals to whom intimidation of others is second nature. I cannot emphasise too much the importance of that observation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>We urge all parties to think carefully about that statement.
</p>

<a name="51220-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>As it stands, those Part VII provisions extending only to Northern Ireland are to remain in force until 31 July 2007. If by then it appears to the Government that normalisation has taken place, then Part VII will be repealed, as we have heard. Of course, if normalisation has not taken place, then Part VII can be extended by order for a specified period up to 1 August 2008. Let us hope that will not be necessary.
</p>

<a name="51220-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The Bill also makes provision to add to the list of scheduled offences under Part VII of the 2000 Act other offences created by the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005; to repeal certain provisions which are not currently in force; and to retain parts of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2004 until July 2007, ensuring that breaches of bail on scheduled cases are dealt with in a similar way to non-scheduled cases and also to those cases to which my noble friend Lord Smith of Clifton referred.
</p>

<a name="51220-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>Perhaps the most controversial part of the Bill is to retain the Diplock courts, a matter which has already been referred to. Sections 65 to 80 and Schedule 9 deal with this part of the Bill. This court system dates back to 1972 and it is indeed regrettable that we still have to refer certain&#151;albeit very serious&#151;and specific cases to such courts. These special judicial arrangements are for prosecutions relating to paramilitaries and the special situation in Northern Ireland. They may still be necessary to deal with cases of witness and jury intimidation, but until normality is reached the Government feel it is still necessary to retain them. It is vital, therefore, that Parliament keeps a very careful eye on how these courts are operating. We expect to hear more about this at a later date.
</p>

<a name="51220-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>Section 108, which has been referred to, is a concern of ours and I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response to my noble friend Lord Smith of Clifton, who raised the matter in his speech. For how long will this legislation stay on the statute books without its ever having been used?
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51220-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>This has been a short but important debate for the people of Northern Ireland and for their safety. But, as I said at the beginning, it is regrettable that the Bill has had to be brought before your Lordships&#039; House. I reiterate that we hope it will be the last time we have to deal with these matters.

<a name="time_13"></a>
<a name="51220-17_time0"></a><h5>2.25 pm</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="51220-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for bringing forward the Bill today. I want to open by expressing on behalf of my party our almost unqualified support for the Bill. It gives the House an opportunity to take stock of all that has been achieved in the progress towards a peaceful Northern Ireland during the past decade, and particularly in the past five years since the Terrorism Act 2000 was passed.
</p>

<a name="51220-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>The Belfast of today is far removed from the Belfast of 10 years ago. The police and the Armed Forces are no longer being routinely attacked and bombings have almost ceased. More recently, the statement by the IRA on 28 July this year, as has been said by other noble Lords, confirming that it would complete the decommissioning process was long overdue but has been welcomed, albeit cautiously, by most people. As I made clear in a debate in this House two months ago, that statement was only a first step on the road to building the trust and confidence that are necessary if we are eventually to see a restoration of devolved government. It is in the context of the start of the process of the restoration of trust and confidence that I suggest to your Lordships we consider the Bill, rather than view it as a concluding of the peace process.
</p>

<a name="51220-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>We have yet to witness on the ground a complete cessation of military activity, whether by the Provisional IRA, the dissident republican paramilitaries or, indeed, loyalist terrorist organisations. It is against this backdrop that any measures to extend the Part VII powers of the Terrorism Act 2000 must be examined. The provisions of Part VII of that Act provide the security forces and the courts with the wherewithal they need to tackle terrorism and protect the people of Northern Ireland. We entirely agree with the Government that they are still vital and necessary in maintaining peace in Northern Ireland. Sadly, violence has not ended in the Province and still blights the existence of the people of Northern Ireland. As the seventh report of the Independent Monitoring Commission stated on 19 October:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;Paramilitaries exercise control over and exploit communities which they say they protect and from which they claim support. Their hold needs to be loosened so as to help create a &#039;culture of lawfulness&#039; within which the normal democratic principles of law enforcement and human rights apply&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>We recognise that normalisation has to begin and we support the attempt that this Bill signifies to create the enabling environment. For the two-year normalisation programme to progress, the Bill sets up a two-year timeframe by allowing the Part VII powers to be extended until July 2007 or, at the very latest, 2008. It is at this point that we differ from Her Majesty&#039;s Government on the question of how far into the future these powers should be extended.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1679"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1679</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>The Government seem to view July 2007 as the time after which they believe the IRA involvement in terrorism will have effectively ceased. But this view seems to me&#151;I know I am known as a pessimist by the Government Front Bench in these matters&#151;to be overly optimistic. There is no guarantee that dissident republican organisations will have ceased their activities and the loyalists show no sign of decommissioning or ceasing their illegal activities. The threat from terrorist-related activities may, unfortunately, continue well beyond 2007. Therefore, one might question whether it is a little premature to place the criminal justice system of the Province on a par with the rest of the United Kingdom in 18 months or, at best, two and a half years.
</p>

<a name="51220-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>It would be far more satisfactory if this type of legislation was not used as the driving force behind the normalisation programme but rather used to follow and support the programme. Amendments were proposed in another place that would have left the Government with more flexibility by allowing them to extend the legislation annually up to 2012. This approach would be preferable to us, as it would give greater comfort to the people of Northern Ireland and the special provisions could easily remain. If the Bill remains in its current form, all that the people of Northern Ireland will have to rely on is the possibility of the Government deciding to take action in 2008, as the Minister stated that they would intend to do. I hope that the Minister will give this House a firm assurance that the Government will come to an objective and fair decision on the need for these powers when their expiry time draws near.
</p>

<a name="51220-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>We look forward to debating in Committee the details of the provisions relating to Part VII, as mentioned by noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches. But at the outset of the Bill&#039;s passage through this House, it is right to mention one important aspect of those powers: the use of the so-called Diplock Courts. Despite concerns raised by, for example, the Northern Ireland Civil Liberties Group Committee that the risk of intimidation of jurors is not as great as the Government may suggest, we believe that it is vital to retain non-jury courts where there remains any possibility of concerted intimidation of jurors. Until such time as the terrorist infrastructures are dismantled for good, it would be folly to remove this unfortunate but necessary component of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="51220-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>At the same time, I emphasise that conducting trials on indictment without a jury is not something which in any other circumstances I or my party would normally support. Given our support for the current Diplock system, we therefore fully support also the measures in Clause 3 to add the new offences created by the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 to the list of scheduled offences under Part VII of the 2000 Act.
</p>

<a name="51220-17_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>The necessity of this Bill is regrettable but undeniable. In principle, the Government are right to introduce it. I look forward to discussing the exact details and the Government&#039;s precise intentions in Committee. The situation in Northern Ireland still <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="51220-18_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker): </b>  My Lords, I am grateful for the support&#151;sometimes measured, sometimes almost unqualified, as the noble Lord just said&#151;for the Bill. I shall do my best to answer some of the detailed points. We can address in Committee in the new year those that I do not cover.
</p>

<a name="51220-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a> In one respect, we are continuing existing law. We are not making major changes today. Therefore, I shall confine my remarks to the contents of the Bill, which maintains the status quo in some respects. There would have had to have been a deterioration of some substance if we had had to talk about even a one-year extension to 2008. On the basis of the significant progress that has been made, we are confident that 2007 is fine; 2008 is a longstop. Beyond that, fresh legislation would be needed to deal with what would be a fresh situation, because, quite clearly, things would not have worked out in an acceptable way.
</p>

<a name="51220-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>The International Monitoring Commission&#039;s seventh report recognised the IRA&#039;s statement as being very significant. The report also states that initial signs, following the Provisional IRA&#039;s statement, are encouraging. The Secretary of State has drawn his conclusions from that. As has been said, it is not the end game. The report in which we will really be interested is due before the end of January, because that will cover a longer time span. The first report dealt only with the first few weeks following the IRA&#039;s statement of 28 July. The later report will deal with a further three months, so some important points are yet to be taken on board. Nevertheless, the IMC judged the IRA&#039;s statement to be significant.
</p>

<a name="51220-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>We are putting what pressure we can&#151;if &quot;pressure&quot; is the right word to use&#151;on the loyalists to decommission. We want all groups to decommission, simply because we want to return to the rule of law, and not the rule of the gun and intimidation. We call regularly on those with influence to help bring this about. I fully accept that the Liberal Democrats agreed to five years in 2000, as the noble Lord, Lord Smith, said. The situation has been regularly scrutinised since then, and that has been useful.
</p>

<a name="51220-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>I fully accept what has been said about the Diplock Courts. There is no question that they have served the people of Northern Ireland well. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, has recommended on several occasions that a three-judge court would be a potential replacement for Diplock Courts, but no firm conclusions have been drawn. We are committed to the return of jury trials. That was implicit in what the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, and it has obviously got to be the long-term aim. Subject to an enabling environment, the Diplock system will cease to have effect by the end of July 2007&#151;that is, the expiry of Part VII&#151;but we are looking actively at what may be required after that period for paramilitary-type trials <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1681"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1681</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

where jurors could be subject to intimidation, because we want to ensure the effectiveness of the criminal justice system as we go forward. We do not want to prejudge, certainly not during the passage of this Bill. I freely admit that I will not be in a position in Committee to elaborate on what might be the replacement for Diplock Courts. But we are mindful that to move from Diplock to no-Diplock for everything will not be possible. Therefore, we are actively reviewing the situation and looking at potential replacements.
</p>

<a name="51220-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Park, spoke strongly about the devolution of the criminal justice system. We could not devolve policing and justice to the Northern Ireland Assembly if it returned tomorrow. The conditions are not right. Legislation will be required. That commitment was made as part of the peace process. In the early part of next year, the Government will indeed bring forward legislative proposals, and they will be subject to scrutiny in both Houses of Parliament, but they will lie unused until the conditions are absolutely right. So it does not automatically follow that if the Assembly returned tomorrow, we would devolve those functions. We need to pass the legislation first. The conditions would have to be absolutely right before both Houses of the Westminster Parliament devolved the criminal justice system to Northern Ireland. In the mean time, we are strengthening the criminal justice system so that it can tackle the issues of intimidation and organised crime which the noble Baroness mentioned, but a broader devolution will not happen overnight. Separate primary legislation will be brought forward for that. It will be given Royal Assent and then parked until the situation is more satisfactory.
</p>

<a name="51220-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>One or two noble Lords mentioned Section 108. I shall quote the Explanatory Notes before I give a longer explanation. They state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;Section 108 allows for the oral evidence of a police evidence, of at least the rank of superintendent, to be admissible as evidence that the accused is or was a member of a specified organisation. The accused cannot be committed for trial, found to have a case to answer or convicted solely on the basis of this statement&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>That is a very important caveat.
</p>

<a name="51220-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>In moving towards a normalised security environment, as we hope we are in Northern Ireland, it would not be necessary or appropriate to maintain any of the special provisions contained in Part VII. As the House knows because of other legislation going through on a UK-wide basis, the UK has strengthened terrorism legislation. It is some of the strongest and most effective in the world, so we are fairly confident that the permanent counter-terrorism powers that apply throughout the UK will be sufficient to deal with any residual terrorist threat that may linger, because these things will take a while. I suspect the tail will be quite long when it comes to the total elimination of terrorism, but we are making good progress to date.
</p>

<a name="51220-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>I shall respond briefly to what the noble Lord, Lord Laird, said about sleepers and spies in the Republic of Ireland&#151;a European Union partner, but for practical purposes a foreign country, for which I do not speak at this Dispatch Box. Neither the British <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1682"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1682</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government nor this Parliament have any responsibility at all for counter-terrorism measures in the Republic of Ireland. That is a matter for the Irish Government to address. As I have said, though, here in the UK&#151;and obviously we work with our European partners and neighbours&#151;we have some of the strongest and most effective counter-terrorism legislation in the world. We are satisfied that it is sufficient to protect the people of this country.
</p>

<a name="51220-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>I have one more general point, following the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. In renewing this legislation, including dates when it will completely expire, the Government and Parliament are sending a signal that things have changed; that progress has been made, substantially over the past 10 years and very substantially in the past five; and that the security situation has shown, in the words of the IMC, &quot;significant improvement&quot; since 28 July last year. But there is still a massive need to build trust across and within the communities. There is no question about that. To bring about a normal civic society in Northern Ireland, as well as a normalised security situation, will need men and women of substance in positions of leadership. They are needed to operate the normal processes that we take for granted in the rest of Great Britain, which either Northern Ireland has not been able to do, or for which, in recent years, only people of non-sufficient substance have been available. This will require many changes and many pressures.
</p>

<a name="51220-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>As the Secretary of State has said, there are some corners to be turned. As we know from what is happening at the moment in the other place, there will be some legislation that is difficult to stomach. It is evil, but it is necessary because of the process we are engaged in. We hope that, at the end of the parliamentary process, and with the other actions taken, that extra trust can be in place. Without it, progress will not be made&#151;it will be superficial. Nevertheless, I am grateful for the widespread support for the continuing of this legislation, and I look forward to debating in greater detail the contents of the Bill in Committee in the new year.

<a name="51220-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down and my noble friends get settled, will he try to persuade his colleagues, the Secretary of State and No. 10 Downing Street, to improve the spin so that, when we read the press about Northern Ireland and the Government&#039;s activities, we get more confident? We are still reading a negative press from the Unionist/Conservative point of view that the Government are doing deals all the time with Sinn Fein. I am not charging the Government with that at this time, but I am charging them with failing to communicate the real messages, if they are as I hope they might be, to the population.

point. There is sometimes an obsession with the past, and with issues that people thought had been put to bed years ago; and a reluctance in some ways, even in the media, to debate normal society and normal issues.
</p>

<a name="51220-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>Led by the Secretary of State and the Northern Ireland team there, we are pushing on with a normal civic society reform programme. We are pushing on with the reform of local government with a new system of raising local government finance, the legislation for which will come to this House early in the new year, and water charges&#151;all the normal things that happen. There is reform of the health service and the education service: all these transcend the issues around security and the constitution. We are going to get on with it. We hope that the penny will drop for the media in Northern Ireland that there are other things to report than the tittle-tattle from various street corners about which group is getting what over another, and that they can be debated in a more normal fashion. The Government do not own or run the press&#151;heaven forbid that they did&#151;but I will make sure that the &quot;spinmeisters&quot; in No. 10 are well aware of the noble Lord&#039;s request.

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a> Enlargement has also provided new consumers for United Kingdom goods and services, and new markets for our firms. High street names such as Next, Mothercare, Marks & Spencer and Tesco are just examples of the companies now operating through the 10 new member states. Tesco has 33 stores in Slovakia and over 40 in Hungary. Hundreds more British firms are benefiting from the enlarged EU&#151;Vodafone, HSBC, BP, Shell and GlaxoSmithKline, to name just a few. It is therefore not surprising that enlargement has become an issue on which this House has been united, and I am delighted to be able to say that cross-party consensus remains just as strong as was clearly evident in 2003, when there was universal support for the EU accessions Bill for the 10 countries of eastern and central Europe. As the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said on Second Reading on that occasion,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;we are . . . thankful that at last the moment has arrived when these vigorous and independent states, many of which have been through terrible trials and experiences, join the enlarged European Union&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 3/7/03; col. 1070.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>This Bill is intended to do the same for two more eastern European countries that have emerged from similar trials and experiences. Bulgaria and Romania are also vigorous, independent states that have made similarly impressive advances in the space of a few years. Bulgaria&#039;s economy has consistently grown at double the EU average during the last five years; unemployment has been halved in that same period. Romania has performed strongly as well; inflation is down from over 100 per cent in the late 1990s to around 8 per cent today. It has also successfully attracted more direct foreign investment than any other state in south-east Europe.
</p>

<a name="51220-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>The prospect of EU membership has also spurred both countries to make real progress in political and economic reform. The European Council acknowledged that progress in December 2004 when it formally closed accession negotiations with both countries, agreeing that they should be ready for membership in January 2007. Four months later, in April 2005, the 25 member states of the EU signed a joint accession treaty with both countries which envisages their accession on 1 January 2007. However, unlike in previous accessions, the timing is not guaranteed. Both countries need to continue to make progress in their EU-related reforms. If they do not and either Bulgaria or Romania is deemed to be &quot;manifestly unprepared&quot; for membership, EU member states can decide to delay that country&#039;s entry by a year. That new approach is designed to ensure that countries joining the EU sustain their reforms right up to accession and indeed beyond. That is in the EU&#039;s interests, and in those of the countries which want to join.
</p>

<a name="51220-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The European Commission is responsible for monitoring both countries&#039; preparations. On 25 October it produced detailed and rigorous reports on their performance against EU commitments. In presenting these reports, Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn said that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;Bulgaria and Romania have achieved significant progress so far in the preparations for accession. But, the jury is still out&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="column_1685"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1685</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>The reports highlight a range of areas in which Bulgaria and Romania need to make urgent progress to be ready for accession in 2007. That includes addressing the problem of corruption which, in both countries, remains a corrosive agent, undermining public and business confidence. Part of the problem lies with their justice systems, which need further reform. Bulgaria must also tackle head-on the problem of organised crime. The daylight assassination of a high-ranking financier in October demonstrated starkly the scale of the challenge in that area.
</p>

<a name="51220-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>However, there were also a range of more specific technical concerns. For example, both countries need to do more to bring their agricultural and food safety standards up to those of the EU member states. They need to improve their capacity to absorb EU funding streams, to enhance their protection of intellectual property rights and&#151;particularly in Romania&#039;s case&#151;to do more to tackle environmental pollution. In the coming months, the Commission will continue monitoring the progress of both countries, targeting in particular areas of serious concern identified in the reports. It will then produce further reports next April or May.
</p>

<a name="51220-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>If the Commission has then judged there to be a serious risk of either or both of Bulgaria and Romania being &quot;manifestly unprepared&quot;, as the words were, for membership in January 2007, the European Council can then decide to delay their entry. In addition, the Commission can impose more targeted safeguards and measures to tackle problems in specific areas. Those were considered for previous enlargements but, happily, in the event did not prove necessary.
</p>

<a name="51220-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>We are content that the EU has the right mechanisms in place to protect our interests, and remain confident that both countries can be ready to join the EU on schedule in January 2007. Yet they cannot afford to be complacent. They need to take vigorous actions now to address the concerns identified by the Commission. Of course, we will continue to provide bilateral and other assistance targeted in the areas which matter most. We already have three advisers working in Romania on corruption issues, and embassy liaison officers in both countries working with their counterparts on drugs and people trafficking. We are funding various projects in both countries focusing on human rights, judicial training and institutional capacity building.
</p>

<a name="51220-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>I am sure that your Lordships will be interested to know exactly how much Bulgarian and Romanian membership will cost, since their accession coincides with the discussions which have taken place over the next financial perspective of the EU, from 2007 to 2013. Those costs have been the matter of recent negotiation. That said, most EU expenditure on Bulgaria and Romania has been previously agreed for 2007&#150;10, assuming that accession takes place in January 2007. Spending will total approximately &#8364;15 billion over the three years and will not be altered by our recent proposals for the financial perspective or the agreements made on it. Of that total, roughly &#8364;5.5 billion will be devoted to agriculture-related <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1686"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1686</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

spending and approximately &#8364;8 billion to structural funds. I stress that those figures are from recent negotiations and had, up until then, been indicative.
</p>

<a name="51220-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>Of course there is a significant amount of money in the package, by any standards. But, as your Lordships will be more than aware, most of the accession costs are being borne by the new member states themselves&#151;the objective being, over time, to ensure that net recipients start to contribute to the EU budget. Spain and Ireland are good examples of that and, indeed, Slovenia and Cyprus are performing strongly in that regard among the newcomers.
</p>

<a name="51220-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>I turn briefly to Clause 2. Under the terms of the accession treaty, the UK has the ability to decide what level of access it offers Bulgarian and Romanian workers, up to a maximum period of seven years after accession, before Community rules on the free movement of workers come in. Clause 2 gives the Government a wide degree of flexibility in deciding these terms.
</p>

<a name="51220-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>With accession still over a year away&#151;and possibly two&#151;it is too early to decide now what the level of access should be, and right to keep our options open. We may want to continue the current work permit scheme. Conversely, we may decide to offer more lightly regulated access along similar lines to that given to the workers of the eight central and eastern European countries who joined in the 2004 enlargement.
</p>

<a name="51220-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>As we have seen, that policy has proved a real success. Over 293,000 nationals from the A8 registered with the worker registration scheme between May 2004 and September 2005. Most workers registering are young and have taken on jobs throughout the country. Less than 1 in 5 is based in London. They are employed in a broad range of industries from administration to healthcare and farming, industries where there are serious gaps in our own labour market. They are contributing to the UK&#039;s economic growth and to our tax revenues without being a burden on the state.
</p>

<a name="51220-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Of course, we must recognise that the situation could change. That is why we intend to take a decision on the level of access we grant to Bulgarian and Romanian workers nearer the time of their accession. In reaching any decision we will want to consider the requirements of the labour market and other member states&#039; decisions. The Home Office, the Cabinet Office, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will all be involved in that process and I should stress that any future regulations will be subject to parliamentary approval through the affirmative procedure.
</p>

<a name="51220-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>In conclusion, the United Kingdom&#039;s strong support for enlargement is well recognised throughout the world, across Europe and not least by Bulgaria and Romania themselves. Many of your Lordships on both sides of this House have played an extremely important part in bringing us to that point. We should be in no doubt that this enlargement is a real success for United Kingdom policy. It is a success both for this Government and for the country as a whole. I am <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="51220-20_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I apologise to your Lordships and to the Minister for missing the first few minutes of his opening comments. I can assure the House that by an extraordinary manifestation of cross-party support and consensus, I have been able to ascertain the general drift of what the Minister said&#151;indeed, the precise words. I hope he will forgive me. The timing caught me short.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>I want to make it clear to the Minister&#151;it is probably evident to him&#151;that there is broad and strong support from this side of the House for the Bill and for the aims and purposes behind it, notably the treaty that the Bill seeks to bring into British law. However, the Bill raises a number of acute questions about the enlargement and the whole future direction and character of the European Union to which the answers are far from clear. Indeed, in recent times, they have become even less clear. I shall return to them in a moment.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>First, I turn to the precise purpose and detail of the Bill, which is to give effect in UK law to the accession treaty opening the way, as the Minister has explained, for Bulgarian and Romanian membership of the EU. That treaty is an extremely bulky document, which I have here&#151;I can hardly pick it up. It was laid before Parliament last August and contains four sections. One of those sections is redundant as it concerns the interaction of the treaty with the proposed European Union constitution, which has, of course, capsized and sunk to the bottom of the sea where, in my view, it deservedly lies. The section dealing with the relationship between the treaty and the constitution no longer is of any particular use.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>That is slightly odd because we were assured at the time of the debate on the constitution that our doubts about it were destructive and that the constitution was necessary&#151;I believe those were the words of the Prime Minister&#151;for enlargement to proceed. At the time we questioned whether the Prime Minister and the Government had that right. It turns out that our questioning was right and the Government were wrong. It is, of course, nonsense that the constitution was necessary for enlargement. Certain improvements and changes are necessary but the ill judged, ill constructed and ill directed constitution was not one of them.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>However, the episode reminds us of an important aspect of all these enlargement negotiations, and this will not be the last. There is no doubt that there is more to come with Macedonia, Croatia, Turkey, Serbia, Ukraine, Belarus&#151;who knows?&#151;and others. Each time there is an accession process the newcomers are stepping on to a moving platform. The EU is, to put it bluntly, in flux. The rules by which it is to be governed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1688"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1688</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are unsettled; the powers and competences of the central EU institutions are in dispute&#151;although the constitution tackled them, it failed to solve the problems and without the constitution they remain unsolved&#151;the social policy dictates, as people increasingly recognise on all sides, paralysing economic growth in the union; and the future budget, to which I shall return in a moment and on which there has been in the words of the Minister &quot;recent agreement&quot;, rests on vague undertakings about agricultural support which may or may not materialise. They seem to be hanging in the air.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>In a sense there is a sort of time warp at work. These new entrants believe, or are being led to believe and no doubt want to believe, that they are joining a European Union or a European Community of the kind that existed some years ago; namely, a mighty oasis of free-market vigour and democratic freedoms and values which some years ago seemed to be a bastion against Soviet communist tyranny and corporatist socialism, and an engine for expanding free markets and open markets and doing away with protection in world trade. That was the EU&#151;before it was called a union it was called a community&#151;that many of us admired and thought was definitely an entity that all countries in this region of the world should seek to join and join quickly. Of course, today things are not like that at all. Today the EU has lost its free-market vigour. The Soviet Union is no more and today Europe is trapped in a dense network of centralist regulations and restrictions and, as the <i>Financial Times</i> said this morning in its editorial, Brussels is no longer the motor or driver that it once was.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>In a way it is a pity that we cannot offer these new arrivals a better welcome and a better ambiance to join. It seems to me quite wrong, for example, that they should be required to sign up to the whole of the <i>acquis communautaire</i>&#151;that is the massive book of EU powers of at least 88,000 pages and some say it is nearly 98,000, many of which are completely out of date and belong to an institutional structure and process which is not relevant in this century. Indeed, they belong to the age before the information revolution which has made the dispersal of power so much more desirable and practicable, and centralism so much more inefficient and unnecessary. In my view, a really vigorous assault on redundant <i>acquis</i> powers is one more thing that should have happened and one more missed opportunity under the dismal British presidency.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>Clause 1 makes the accession treaty part of UK law and deals with increased powers for the European Parliament. It does not say anything about the safeguard and postponement clauses that the Minister rightly explained, which would allow negotiations to be delayed if certain criteria in the two countries were not met. I would like to ask the Minister a couple of questions about these, since safeguard measures can be triggered by old member states&#151;the United Kingdom, among others&#151;as well as by the newcomers.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>Who makes the key judgments as to whether the negotiations should be suspended for one year, as they can be under the treaty, or whether commitments are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1689"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1689</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

being met, either on the internal market front or in justice and home affairs? Who is the judge in all this? Is it the Enlargement Commissioner&#039;s say-so, or is there an open procedure? Or is there an appeal avenue? These are serious judgments, with serious effects. The Commission apparently has to pronounce whether good governance and accountability are up to standard, but is it really the body that we feel is absolutely the best to do that? One has to note that it is a bit strange that these sorts of judgments come from a body whose own standards leave much to be desired, which is not free itself of corruption taints and whose accounts the auditors regularly refuse, year after year, to sign off.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>It is undeniable that both these new accession countries have had difficulties in cleaning up corruption and curbing organised crime. However, having had the privilege of a pleasant visit to Sofia just a few months ago, it was clear to me that under the extremely well balanced and wise management and leadership of ex-King Simeon, enormous progress has been achieved. That is gratifying indeed. However, it seems to me that those of us who want to see these two new entrants fairly treated in the coming negotiations ought to be much more inquisitive about the powers of judgment and how they are going to be exercised than perhaps we have been in the past. I would like to hear more from the Minister on all this.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>Clause 2 deals with the freedom of movement of workers and one thing must be said at the outset. There can be absolutely no confidence at all in Home Office or Foreign and Commonwealth Office predictions about future patterns and flows in this area. Laughably, at the time of the last big accession to the EU, the Home Office predicted between 5,000 and 13,000 immigrants net a year from the new member states into the UK. In fact, Ministers explained that between May 2004 and September 2005 293,000&#151;not 5,000 or 13,000&#151;workers from these countries were accepted on to the worker registration scheme. As I have calculated it, the departments here were out by about 2,200 per cent which is, frankly, not a brilliant forecast.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>As the Minister reminds us, many of those immigrants bring welcome skills and seem to be well spread out across the country and have contributed to economic growth, although there are inevitably one or two less desirable groups and practices that have crept in. But when the Minister says the policy has proved &quot;a huge success&quot;, surely what he really means is that the success has come despite the Government&#039;s initial and frankly idiotic policy assumptions, and not because of them.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>It is therefore no surprise that this time with this smaller, but equally important, accession phase, the Government are adopting a much less cavalier and a more hands-on attitude and are reserving the power to restrict the right to work of Bulgarians and Romanians, as the treaty allows. We are told that the actual level will not be decided for another year or so. I just hope, as we all do, that the Government have better information on which to decide than they did last time. We will have to see.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1690"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1690</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>Will the Government be proposing the same restrictions on benefit entitlements as those which they had to bring in last time, when it was realised that no other member state was being as silly as we were in initially eschewing all transitional arrangements permitted under those accession treaties at the time?
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>Finally, I turn to the costs and the budget. It says in the Bill, and the Explanatory Notes confirm, that there will be,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;no significant additional public expenditure&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>The Minister has explained that there will be a cost of &#163;10 billion, or &#8364;15 billion, over three years and this obviously has to fall on somebody. We are told that most of these costs will be borne by the new member states themselves. Is that really right? My own researches suggest that the UK contribution invariably increases every time new enlargement proposals go forward. I accept that these sums are contained within overall existing capped budget limits&#151;or the recent agreement, as the Minister calls it. A more accurate wording in the Explanatory Notes to the Bill would have been &quot;no further additional public expenditure&quot;. That would have been nearer to the position and would have been more accurate. I still wonder who makes room for these new outlays within the existing budget.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>Of course we must pay, and we have paid, our fair share. These are brave and spirited nations who treasure their independence and share our view here in London of how Europe should develop. But what is hard to bear is that these extra resources are being found not by cuts in the wasteful and destructive subsidies to French farmers, but from the hard-pressed budgets of the rest of us. And it is even harder to bear to be told that this is a wonderful bargain for the UK.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>The truth is that the proposed further enlargement, which we welcome, must inevitably put the whole CAP structure under even more strain. Justice and fairness cry out that the system should be radically revised now if Europe is to become the more flexible and fairer network of more equal states which most of us&#151;alas, not all of us&#151;want to see.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>We must face the fact that there has been an utter failure to go that way, with only vague and unbankable assertions that things will be reviewed in due course. Instead, some shameful but luckily unsuccessful proposals emanated from Whitehall and the Foreign Office some weeks ago, which alienated our friends in central and eastern Europe and left wounds which will be remembered, despite the subsequent attempts to patch things up and the assurances given in the final agreement.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>Enlargement is far from popular in many member states of the EU, but here in the UK we on all sides take a positive view&#151;which is what the Minister said, and I agree with him&#151;and we have remembered that in the best parts of our history we have been on the side of the smaller states of Europe against the bigger bully-boy countries. That is the position as I have understood it, but in recent weeks our foreign policy makers&#151;wherever they are in Whitehall&#151;who are obsessed by fashionable notions about &quot;being at the heart of <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1691</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Europe&quot; and the &quot;post-modern state&quot; and all that nonsense, have lost sight of our true friends and interests.
</p>

<a name="51220-20_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>Let us hope that with this Bill, and with the accession process bringing these two nations into the European family, we remember again who our best allies are, that we remember what kind of Europe we really want to see, and that we work for it much harder and more skilfully than we have in recent times.

<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="51220-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </b>   The Bill relates only to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria and it is right that we should address directly the case for those two countries to join the European Union. I will try to bring a little more seasonal good cheer than the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, did.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>In recent months the issue of further enlargement has become contentious in Europe, as has not been the case since Britain was twice vetoed by General de Gaulle in the 1960s. It makes sense to look more widely at the issue of further enlargement and try to draw some preliminary conclusions about the way ahead in what remains one of the most critical policy areas with which the European Union has to deal. This is all the more necessary now that the leaders of the Union have agreed that there must be a full discussion of that before any further accession negotiations begin.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>The accession of Romania and Bulgaria is a subset of the major round of enlargement that has already taken place in May 2004. The two countries applied for membership at much the same time as the other central and eastern European countries which have already joined. It has taken longer to reach this point as a result of the greater complexity and intractability of the problems they faced in accepting the constraints and responsibilities of membership, and because, particularly in the case of Romania, they were slower to respond effectively to those challenges.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>The institutional adjustments that were needed to accommodate them have already been taken in the Nice treaty and were approved by this Parliament in that context. Only one really important issue remains outstanding and that is whether they are to join on 1 January 2007 or 1 January 2008. That decision is not pre-judged in the treaties of accession we are considering today. My own view is that this decision should not be too heavily politicised, although I have no doubt that it will be seen, particularly in the acceding countries themselves, as highly political. I suggest that it should be considered objectively, with the greatest weight given to the assessment that the Commission will have to provide. If that assessment points towards 2008 it should be understood that it will be as much in the interests of the acceding country&#151;or countries&#151;to take more time in preparation and join one year later, as it will be in the interests of the Union. I would also hope that if a different balance of assessment is reached with respect to each one of the two countries, it will be accepted and not brushed aside in favour of arguments relating either to bureaucratic tidiness or <i>amour propre</i>.

</p>

<a name="51220-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>Turning to the wider issue of further enlargement, the picture is a good deal less clear and the decisions are not for today or tomorrow, but for a more distant future. Negotiations with Turkey and Croatia have already begun, but actual accession, particularly for Turkey, is not foreseen before the middle of the next decade. All the other countries of the western Balkans&#151;and there could well, in due course, be two more than exist now: Montenegro and Kosovo&#151;are seeking membership. Macedonia has now been accepted as a formal candidate. Beyond them are a number of countries in the former Soviet Union, whose European identity can hardly be denied, and which also aspire to membership. We should never forget the remaining members of EFTA, who, if their electorates should ever so decide, would rapidly qualify to join and, I suggest, should rapidly be welcomed.

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>It is all too easy to throw up one&#039;s hands at this list, say &quot;enough is enough&quot; and call for a line on the map beyond which countries will not qualify for membership. That is what many politicians across Europe have been saying in recent months, using arguments ranging from respectable ones about the coherence of such a large body to far less respectable ones, based on ethnic and religious prejudice. It is easy to call for that line on the map, but, I would argue, highly irresponsible. A restrictive decision by the European Union, amounting to the pre-emptive exclusion of a number of countries, could have extremely far-reaching and damaging foreign policy and security implications, ranging from an upsurge of instability in the Balkans, to a drift back by former members of the Soviet Union into the embrace of a far from democratic or human rights respecting Russia.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>What right does the Union have to take such a decision? The founding treaty, never changed, says clearly that membership is open to any European country. Since then the European Union has established the Copenhagen criteria for judging any application from such a country. The treaty already establishes the limits and trying to vary them would require treaty change by unanimity&#151;an unlikely prospect, given the views of many member states. It is sometimes suggested that further enlargement, indeed, even the existing scale of enlargement, would have shocked and horrified the founding fathers of Europe, Monnet, Adenauer, De Gaspari and Schuman. I am sure they would have been surprised by it; they were, after all, operating in a Cold War dominated world. However, to suggest that they would have approved of the rejection of the candidature of free, democratic east European countries is, quite frankly, a travesty.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>It follows from this reasoning that I very much welcome the support that the Government continue to give to further enlargement, but it is not sufficient to support that cause and simply assume that it will carry the day. We surely need to try to convince those who call for a restrictive policy that this is the wrong road for the European Union to take. If we cannot persuade people of that, we will drift towards that most dangerous of all scenarios, in which a country negotiates its terms of accession, is accepted by all the <br>&nbsp;<br>

governments of the European Union and is then rejected by the votes of one or more of them in a referendum. That would surely be a disaster for all concerned. To avoid it we and the other supporters of further enlargement will need to explain much more clearly and cogently than has been done in the past, the advantages, both intangible and material, which have flowed from previous enlargement and which can reasonably be expected from further ones. I do not believe that we have anything to fear from such a debate; but we certainly need to have one if we are to avoid a shipwreck. I would welcome a response from the Minister about how the Government intend to carry forward their advocacy of this aspect of their European policies.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>The transformation qualities of enlargement are really not in doubt. They have been demonstrated again and again, first in Greece, Spain and Portugal, then in central and eastern Europe. Countries freed from dictatorship and external domination have been helped to establish stable democracies and flourishing market economies. That is surely &quot;soft&quot; power in action and is achieving admirable and noble objectives in countries whose capacity to achieve those objectives on their own had not previously been too obvious, to put it politely. Of course, at the same time, there are costs which have to be borne by the existing members and we should not flinch from that. Listening to reasoned debates over the budgetary costs of the new member states in your Lordships&#039; House yesterday and this afternoon, hearing phrases such as, &quot;Why should we help to build the Warsaw Underground?&quot;, I detect distant echoes of that most deplorable of statements by a British Prime Minister, when he described Czechoslovakia as a,


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;faraway country of which we know little&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>I hope that we are not going to head back in that direction again.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>To conclude, the Bill that we are discussing today deserves our wholehearted support. Romania and Bulgaria will be welcome new members so long as they keep up and intensify their struggle against their own internal demons, among them corruption and organised crime. I confess that I was startled by the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, that they should not be asked to accept the whole <i>acquis communautaire. </i>I am not sure that it is well appreciated that in such countries the acceptance of the <i>acquis communautaire</i> actually liberates them from the structures that they had before. The <i>acquis communautaire</i> contains legislation infinitely more liberal than what they had before. I am afraid to say that, even if it were not likely to take the whole of the noble Lord&#039;s Christmas holiday to work out which bits of the <i>acquis communautaire</i> they should and should not be let off, it would not be a good idea.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>In any case, I hope that we can also from this debate send out a clear signal of our support for the further enlargement of the European Union beyond those two countries. This wider issue should surely be debated on the Floor of the House before too long, perhaps on the basis of a report from your Lordships&#039; European Union Select Committee.

<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="51220-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Anderson of Swansea: </b>   My Lords, I join in the general chorus of approval, however qualified it was in the case of the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, and join wholeheartedly with what the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has said about the need for the Government to be an advocate in terms of enlargement and indeed of the success of the European Union generally. I follow the Minister in saying that the Bill is relatively narrow in scope: first, it implements the treaty of accession of Bulgaria and Romania and, secondly, it provides for freedom of movement for workers from those two countries.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>After the fall of communism, those two countries enjoyed public support in their principal aim fully to join in the Euro-Atlantic structures. They joined NATO last year and will become full members of the European Union on 1 January 2007 or in 2008. That has been decided. It should be welcomed in spite of renewed questions about their readiness, particularly in the case of the lack of movement for part of this year in respect of Bulgaria. Their accession is in the context of greater questions about the enlargement potential of the Union as a whole. I join in the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, who is always worth listening to on this and other subjects.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>Logically, if there is a Europe, there is a non-Europe. Even the word &quot;Europe&quot; in the treaty has to be defined, but it cannot be defined too largely. The former French Commissioner Claude Cheyson once told me, on returning from a visit to Mongolia, that it was enquiring about EU membership.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>What defines our Europe? It is partly values, but that would include Norway and Switzerland. It is partly geography, and partly history, but that history might also include parts of north Africa if we consider the Roman empire. If there is a case for a privileged relationship at the borders, it will have to be considered as part of the debate that will take place over the next year.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>It is clear that enlargement will make the European Union very different from the vision of the founding fathers. All the new countries in prospect carry greater risks than the core Europe and the Europe of the earlier accessions in terms of their adherence to the rule of law, internal stability, corruption, organised crime and free markets. Yet clearly, our Europe has an interest in stability at our borders, wherever they are drawn. It is true that the prospect of membership and the gravitational pull of core Europe has had a wholly beneficial effect on those countries at its borders, including Bulgaria and Romania. Yet some of those doubts on enlargement clearly led to the referenda results in France and the Netherlands in the summer. The effects of enlargement played a key role in the debate and provoked debates about a two-tier Europe, which led, for example, to the contribution to the current debate of the Belgian premier, Mr Verhofstadt, suggesting that the euro-zone should take on a more political dimension, which would have interesting consequences for us and other countries&#151;also incidentally for the prospects of countries such as Turkey.

</p>

<a name="51220-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>There is a debate. Indeed, the <i>Financial Times </i>on 16 December reported that a specific part of the communiqu&#233; would be to have a freeze on further enlargement. The only reference that I can see is in the context of the decision on the candidacy status of Macedonia. Paragraph 25 of the report says that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;further steps will have to be considered in the light of the debate on the enlargement strategy, as provided by the Council conclusions of 12 December 2005&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>That paragraph continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;The absorption capacity of the Union also has to be taken into account&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>In any event, it would be wrong to talk about a freeze. There will be no movement in respect of Macedonia over the next year. Croatia will proceed in any event. It therefore seems appropriate to have time for reflection during either the Austrian or Finnish presidency. Clearly there is a group within the Union, including France, Spain, Germany, Portugal and Ireland, that is asking fundamental questions about not so much borders but future enlargement generally.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>How do Bulgaria and Romania measure up? It is convenient to deal with them together, yet they have different problems. Until earlier this year Bulgaria was in the lead, but Romania had been moving steadily. It would probably be realistic to talk of differentiation if the Commission were to conclude in April or May of next year that one or other had not moved substantially. But I have some doubts about whether that would be politically possible. It is clear that the jolt to Bulgaria given by the Commission&#039;s opinions and conclusions in October has had a salutary effect in moving Bulgaria from, if not a complacent attitude, at least a belief that it can coast along.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>The working assumption must be that, by the time the Commission comes to make its reports in the spring of next year, the two countries will have moved along sufficiently substantially. In any event, there are fallback provisions, not only in the unique proposal by the Finnish delegation for a possible one-year delay but also in the continuing possibility of exempting from full membership certain areas of policy. For example, in terms of food safety, we could say that we would not accept agricultural exports from those countries if we were not convinced about their procedures for ensuring food safety. But there should be a sufficient jolt or stimulus to ensure, as should be the case, that those countries will be full members of the Union at the appropriate time.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>Clearly, they are historically part of a European dimension. Bulgaria has Greek and Slavic roots and Romania was a province of Dacia in the Roman empire. I understand that Romanian is the closest of the Romance languages to Latin. Indeed, I understand that there was even a Dacian regiment on parade holding Hadrian&#039;s Wall, and no doubt that has had an effect on part of the current population in Cumbria.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>Both countries have had the awful experience of dictatorship. Zhivkov was a slavish follower of the Soviet Union and Ceausescu was a Stalinist oriental despot of the worst type. Both countries are poor. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1696"></a>

Their GDP is one-third of that of the existing members of the EU, including the A10, and a quarter of that of the UK. It is difficult to see where either country would go if not to the Union. Both have made major strides since they moved from communism, and the spring report for Eurobarometer and the latest New Europe Barometer (NEB) survey have been quite favourable.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>In respect of Clause 2 of the Bill, the Eurobarometer report showed that for 60 per cent of Romanians the European Union is, first and foremost, about free movement of persons. That clearly has some relevance to the view of free movement which our Government will come to, including for the 1 million Moldovans of Romanian nationality. But, contrary to what the Opposition were saying at the time, it is clear that the accession of the 10 has been extremely beneficial, allowing our labour market to be more flexible in key areas where we were not providing, such as bus drivers and seasonal agricultural labour. In my judgment, it is right for the Government to leave the options for the Home Office and other relevant departments to decide in the light of all the circumstances, including the date of accession and the policies adopted by other governments.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>I come to my final point. The prospect of membership has already been a great dynamic for positive change, and we can reasonably assume that that is likely to continue. Major failings exist. They were set out in the Commission&#039;s October document and in the commentary by Commissioner Rehn, which was hard-hitting and rigorous. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, that gives me confidence that the Commission will be equally rigorous and objective when it comes to make its report in April or May next year.
</p>

<a name="51220-21_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>But still something is left on trust. The process cannot now be stopped, but we cannot reverse the Kosovo formula and give status without standards. My understanding is that both countries have made substantial moves and that the Commission has struck the right balance. Accession will be of benefit to the European Union. There will be a form of probation until the spring of next year, but every indication is that the countries will succeed. It will be good for them and, indeed, it will be good for Europe. However, I hope that the current period of reflection envisaged in paragraph 25 of the European Council&#039;s report does not lead to an undue delay for the western Balkans, which, in my judgment, should properly be included as soon as practicable within our Union.

international youth camp organised by the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which the Minister will realise at once was a communist front organisation. Had I been a member of the Labour Party, I would have been proscribed for such initiative. That I bare, but will take no further, as this is not the occasion for personal reminiscence.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>I want to make three points. I want to consider the geography of Europe in the light of the legislation. Secondly, I want to talk about the economics, particularly the problem of financing, as has been demonstrated vividly over recent days with the settling of the budget. Finally, I want to revert to the problem of the constitution.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>First of all, on the geography, as has been demonstrated, this is not a question of drawing the line. Charles Stewart Parnell once said that no man can halt the march of a nation, and we are rather in that mood as far as the European Union is concerned. I accept at once that this is not the end of the expansion of Europe.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>The treaty on the prospective accession of Romania and Bulgaria invites the immediate consideration of the expansion of the European Union to the south-west, to incorporate the Balkan territories whose prospective accession was discussed quite recently in the context of Croatia. I will go no further on that. This afternoon at least we can reflect that the whole question of Ukrainian membership becomes that much more live. My noble friend Lord Howell mentioned it, and I note that it is also the view of the noble Lord, Lord Anderson. It is a great temptation. I share much of the cultural instincts of the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, about seeing Europe not merely in economic and political terms, but also in cultural terms. I cannot see the Uniate church without feeling a strong sense of rapport.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>On the other hand, there is no doubt that that expansion will raise delicate issues with our immediate neighbourhood, with Russia. That is not an expansion that we can undertake without making full judgment of what will be the wider consequences. I leave it in those rather elliptical terms, which are none the less very real.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>I now turn for a moment to the question of finance. I am not going to join the general chorus of applause and doom that has attended the recent budget negotiations. I think that the Prime Minister had a difficult hand to play, and I am not among his foremost critics. Are we really to suppose that the common agricultural policy will be that much easier to dismantle on account of the accession of these two countries? I rather doubt it. They both have strong agricultural interests, which they will be determined to protect. That is as I understand it. Can the Minister indicate what are the kinds of reform that the Government have in mind in respect of the common agricultural policy that can then encompass the interests of Romania and Bulgaria? Does he foresee the single payments, which will be at the heart of agricultural expenditure over the period we are surveying, being subject to a reduction? That course is <br>&nbsp;<br>

advised by an academic writing in the <i>Times</i> today; it is over the brow of the future, but it will become part of the immediate consequences when we discuss the implied accession of Romania and Bulgaria.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>Secondly, and probably of equal challenge to the prudent financing of the European Union, is the question of accession payments. I quite understand that every eastern European country which is joining the European Union needs some kind of Marshall aid. But it should be kept as modest as possible; above all, it should be seen as a transitional payment. I say this because I believe that those countries will make their way in the European family largely by virtue of their own exertions. They have the basic advantage that whatever may have been the misfortunes of communist rule, education was not a casualty. Therefore, their sheer nationhood and population are formidable weapons in adjusting to the economic patterns of western Europe.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>There is a certain paradox here: the more we welcome the movement of labour&#151;and I do&#151;the more we realise that quite often the people who will come to the West from eastern Europe could do a tremendous task in raising standards in their own country. Very often, those who come to the West are among the most enterprising and achieving. I do not wish to establish any barrier against that free movement of labour, but we would find ourselves caught in the most dreadful problem if we had to make substantial budgetary payments to eastern Europe on account of the migration of their best westwards.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>I do not wish to be confrontational, but I see, hidden in the situation, the prospect of trying to resolve all the difficulties by having recourse to higher spending. We understand that the deal was eventually brokered last week by a modest addition to the Community budget. I promise that when the Prime Minister goes before the European Parliament this afternoon he will be confronted by cries for a much more ambitious budget. Of course the European Parliament will call for a more ambitious budget because those are not the politicians who will have to confront the taxpayer with the consequences. The split between the institutions of the Community and the long-standing institutions of nation states will become much more sensitive as we approach the situation of greater and greater spending on accession assistance.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>The Commission, helpfully at this stage of the argument&#151;I quote from today&#039;s <i>Evening Standard</i>&#151;is proposing a European tax, which would be levied by the institutions of the European Union and collected direct from the taxpayers of individual countries. That is like advising someone with a common cold to seek the cure for bubonic plague. I cannot think of anything that would give rise to more antagonism and disillusionment towards the idea of a European partnership.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>That takes me to my third point&#151;the constitution. My noble friend Lord Howell said that it had sunk and settled on the seabed. Well, I have news for him.

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>It is fitting that a historian like myself should be among those who rejoice&#151;to use the word of the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, in another connection&#151;at the prospect of welcoming Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union. The noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, may be remembered as having said in a neglected passage in her speech at Bruges in 1988 that it was essential for us in western Europe to keep a candle burning to light the way of such countries as these we are talking about towards liberty. I think we can say that, after 1988, that candle burned very well.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>These two countries have much in common. As the noble Lord, Lord Anderson of Swansea, said, the territories of both were in the Roman Empire in the days of Trajan. It is fair to say that the recovery of those Roman borders has some relevance to what we are trying to do in Europe today. Both countries were, from the middle of the Middle Ages to about the middle of the nineteenth century, dependent on or subject to the Ottoman Empire in one way or another, while the Muslim armies of the Sultan swept on&#151;not just once, but several times&#151;towards Vienna, in a threat to Europe which must have seemed more alarming than Muslim fundamentalism does today.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>Both countries emerged from the night of Ottoman control in the late nineteenth century after the Congress of Berlin in 1878, in which two Members of this House, Lord Salisbury and Lord Beaconsfield, played a major part. That congress led to the formation of two small states, initially directed by German monarchs; one, a minor member of the Hohenzollern family; the other a Saxe-Coburg, a member of that extraordinary family which gave kings to Portugal, Belgium, even Britain, as well as Bulgaria. Both these states found it hard to survive from the time of their creation through the whirlwind of war and diplomatic struggles of the First and Second World Wars. Poor Romania was caused to fight against both Germany and Russia in the Second World War. Both <br>&nbsp;<br>

states, it is important for those in this House to recall, were let down badly in 1945 by the western Allies, despite the Yalta conference&#039;s declaration on liberated Europe.

<a name="51220-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>One friend of mine, a member of the British military mission to Bulgaria in 1945, found that his first duty was to attend the execution of 68 parliamentarians. That assignment helped to make Malcolm Macintosh an especially acute observer of the Soviet military machine in subsequent years.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>No doubt because of Soviet brutality later on, both Bulgaria and Romania have shown astonishing lack of bitterness at the western failure of the immediate post-war years, a failure which resulted in the imprisonment or death of hundreds of admirable people who expected support from us. I mention only the name of the ex-Romanian Prime Minister Maniu.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>Though they have much in common, these two states also have many differences. For example, Romania maintained her contacts with the West&#151;particularly France&#151;through her Latin-based language. The noble Lord, Lord Anderson, mentioned that point.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>Bulgaria&#039;s position should not be neglected. In the Middle Ages she constituted a major empire, a threat for a long time to Byzantium, and also preserved her orthodox Christianity during the long era of Ottoman control. Both Bulgaria and Romania have had close relations with Russia from the 16th century onwards for obvious geographical reasons, though Romania&#039;s were basically destructive. Bulgaria&#039;s&#151;at least until the communist era&#151;were usually benign.
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>Modern Romania has constituted four territories: Moldavia and Wallachia which constituted the heart of the country after 1878; Bessarabia which after several improbable changes is now the independent state of Moldova; and Transylvania which was wrested from Hungary in 1919 under the Treaty of St Germain. Bulgaria has experienced fewer territorial changes, though she did lose a priceless outlet to the Aegean in 1919.

The cleverness of King Boris of Bulgaria should not be forgotten since he did much to save the admittedly smaller Jewish population of that country. However, Bulgaria did have the dubious honour of enduring the longest reign of any communist satrap, that of Zhivkov who was in power for 35 years in Sofia&#151;just before the noble Lord, Lord Biffen, went there for the first time.

<a name="51220-22_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>In rejoicing at the likely entry of these two tragic but resilient countries into the European Union, there is one further thing that I should say. Throughout their history, both have been affected by their associations with larger enterprises, whether the Hapsburg, the Ottoman or even the Soviet empires. Thus they are not like the great nation states of western Europe such as ourselves, France, Spain, perhaps the Netherlands and Sweden which have enjoyed five centuries of untrammelled sovereignty and naturally find it more <br>&nbsp;<br>

difficult to forget or neglect the attitudes so formed. Thus though both Romania or Bulgaria could throw up European statesmen of importance&#151;ex-King Simeon might turn out to be one&#151;it is unlikely that they will aspire to lead Europe as France has or as Britain could have done. 
</p>

<a name="51220-22_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>That brings me to comment&#151;this may seem irrelevant but it is, all the same, important&#151;that, like others, I have pondered on the reasons for the astonishing transformation of British politics over the past 20 years which has caused the party of Europe&#151;which the Conservative Party was from about 1960 until 1988&#151;to change places with the Labour Party, which until 1988 seemed, to say the least, unenthusiastic about associations with the European Union.

<a name="51220-22_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, touched on why he personally had moved from an old enthusiasm to a modern scepticism. But I think this change occurred for a different reason. I think that about 1988 Conservative leaders realised that Britain had lost the chance to lead Europe&#151;a chance which could have been theirs. Those who led this country into Europe&#151;Lord Stockton, Sir Edward Heath, Lord Duncan-Sandys, for example&#151;

<a name="51220-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>I think it was on 1 May last year that the 10 countries joined the EU. I remember watching it on television&#151;the ceremony took place in Dublin&#151;and I found it a very moving occasion. It symbolised to me the way in which Europe was moving and how European enlargement was taking in, in that case, eight countries that had been under communism for 50 years.
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>Of course there are people in eastern Europe who have said to me, &quot;Don&#039;t we lose our national identity by joining the EU?&quot; and I have said, &quot;Not a bit of it. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1702"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1702</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Look at Ireland&quot;. Ireland has become, if anything, more Irish since it joined the EU than it ever was before, with not a trace of loss of national identity. But I recall the plea of the then Slovenian Minister for European Integration at a meeting in the Palace. He said, &quot;Look, 10 countries are about to join. Please do not treat us all as if we were the same. We are not identical countries; we each have our individual histories, our traditions and our present attitudes. Please treat us as individual members&quot;. It is in that spirit that I approach the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>I had the opportunity to visit Romania a few months ago, although I have not been in Bulgaria for about 12 or 14 years. Given that corruption is probably the number one problem facing Romania in its bid to join the EU, I found the Romanian Government&#039;s policy impressive and clear. I was particularly impressed by the Minister of Justice in Bucharest, who was very clear about what she was seeking to do to tackle corruption. But, as she admitted, corruption at the top level can be tackled and the Romanian Government can have clear policies, but it is a lot more difficult making sure that the anti-corruption drive works further down. I think the Romanian Government are determined to deal with it but it may not be as easy on the ground as it is at governmental level.
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>I have had it said to me in more than one of the accession countries that joining the EU is making them introduce changes that they wanted to make anyway, but which have been given more of a political imperative, making things happen faster. The same applies to Romania. Of course the Romanians are very keen to join. They have said to me that it would be a disaster if their bid to join was delayed by one year. None of us wants that to be delayed, but, although undesirable, I would not have thought it would be the end of the world.
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>My noble friend Lord Triesman spoke about the opportunities for British investment in these countries. I agree that the opportunities exist, but on my visits to Romania and to some of the countries which joined the EU last year, it was disappointing to find that British investment is a bit thin on the ground. For example, I was told that there was not a single British bank in Budapest, yet we lead the world in financial services. We are missing opportunities there. I hope that we will not miss so many in Romania and Bulgaria, although I fear that we do not have much on the ground there at present.
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>I accept the view that Romania has to improve its marketing, particularly of its agricultural produce. It has simply not got to grips with the needs of modern supermarkets and modern countries. Indeed, Romania has to import some products from other countries even though it has perfectly excellent products of its own.
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>My one serious criticism of Romania concerns the Roma minority there. Some months ago, our parliamentary delegation had the chance to visit a Roma village and a Roma school in that village. We <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1703"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1703</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

spoke to both Roma people and Romanians. Romania will have to move forward if it is to give the Roma community a chance to lead a proper life in that country. The Roma still seem to suffer quite a lot of discrimination, not from the Government but at lower levels.
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>I hope that Romania and Bulgaria will join in January next year. I also hope that we will deal with the rights of people from those countries to work in Britain as we have dealt with the right to work in Britain of the people of the 10 countries that joined us. It did us a great deal of good in the eyes of the countries in eastern Europe that joined that we allowed their people to come and work here, provided that there were jobs for them and that they were not coming for social security. I hope that a similar arrangement will apply for the people of Romania and Bulgaria.
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>I am concerned that visa requirements still apply for Romania and Bulgaria. Will the Government drop those visa requirements in the process of those countries moving towards accession?
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>Moldova&#039;s position is rather unusual because of its close relationship with Romania in both economic and social terms. It is my understanding that when Romania joins the EU, Moldova will be affected more adversely than has been any other country through its neighbour becoming a member of the EU. That is because the ties will be cut, with serious economic and social damage to Moldova. I hope that Brussels realises this and that it will look to provide some special support for Moldova to tide it over the difficult situation that it will be in when Romania joins.
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>I understand that about one million Moldovans have a Romanian passport. Will my noble friend confirm that? If it is true, what will be the position of those people who live outside the EU, but who have a passport or citizenship of an EU country?
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>I turn to the wider issues that stem from the Bill. It is good news that Croatia&#039;s difficulties with General Gotovina have been resolved with his arrest and that Croatia is now on the way to joining the EU. I was told that long delays in countries joining the EU have adverse effects on public opinion there. The Croatians were quite concerned that public opinion might turn against EU membership. I hope that, with the resolution of the difficulties pending the way to negotiations with Croatia, that problem has been dealt with. I am delighted that Macedonia has been mentioned as a candidate country just recently.
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>I shall say a brief word about Turkey. I am a strong supporter of Turkish membership of the EU. I was delighted when the Government secured with our European partners the opening of the doors to Turkey, even though it will take some years before that happens. I am therefore disappointed, as a friend of Turkey, about the Orhan Pamuk case, where, just a few days ago, a world-famous novelist has been up in court on charges that, frankly, could not stand up in any EU country. I was surprised that they were not thrown out by the Turkish court. He allegedly insulted his country by making statements about Turkey as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1704"></a>

regards, I believe, Armenia. Friends of Turkey&#151;of whom there are many in Britain, although not quite so many in other EU countries&#151;are disappointed by this, and of course it is ammunition for Turkey&#039;s opponents. I hope the Turkish authorities will drop this case very quickly.
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>The question that has been asked, in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, is: what about further enlargement? How do we move forward? The governance issue will certainly have to be tackled sooner or later, as more countries join. We are managing at the moment, although not as well as we might had we had the new constitution, but we will have to revisit that. I hope my noble friend on the Front Bench will give some encouragement.
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>There is no need at this stage to decide specifically how much further Europe should go. It is perfectly sensible to deal with that pragmatically. A number of countries are in the pipeline, and we do not have to decide how much further Europe will go. It becomes a philosophical question, rather than a practical political one. Of course, other countries are interested: Georgia, Ukraine, Armenia and others. At some point Europe will have to decide whether those countries are on the path to full membership or to a closer association with Europe.
</p>

<a name="51220-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>These countries on the borders of Europe clearly wish to adopt our values of freedom, human rights and democracy. If Europe does not welcome them, we are giving them no choice but to associate more closely with countries to their east that are not democratic. I believe such an outcome would pose a much greater threat to Europe than our being welcoming to Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Croatia and Macedonia, as well as to other countries on the borders of Europe that wish to espouse our values.

<a name="51220-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bowness: </b>   My Lords, I support this Bill, although I must say to the Minister that the one argument I felt was not dreadfully compelling was that it enabled Tesco to go marching across the continent. Although the treaty of accession has been signed by Romania, Bulgaria and the other member states, I know those two countries will be anxious to hear that the treaty has in effect been ratified by the Parliament of the United Kingdom by the passing of this Bill.
</p>

<a name="51220-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>I must declare an interest, in that earlier this year I was a guest at the Romanian senate for three days. The people who were kind enough to see me when I was in Romania emphasised just how important membership is for the process of reform. Those with whom I spoke, including their former negotiator in Brussels, did not view the European Union in quite such depressing terms as my noble friend Lord Howell&#151;who unfortunately is not here&#151;described it this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="51220-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>As has been said, the treaty envisages the possibility of the accession date being delayed until 2008. Everyone I spoke to said that such a delay would have a profound effect on the work that was being done to bring the country to the standard required by <br>&nbsp;<br>

membership. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, referred to the problem Croatia had with General Gotovina. When their accession process stalled briefly, public support plummeted, although, happily, I believe it has come back. I found in Romania that there were worries that the decisions on accession might be more political than objective, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said, and that the European Council might not be looking closely at how far Romania had been able to meet its obligations.
</p>

<a name="51220-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>We were told when we were there, and people we spoke to accepted, that there were problems with administration and judicial reform, competition and environmental issues. However, they all emphasised that the reform had been accelerated through the prospect of joining the European Union. At that time, in the summer, the government&#039;s efforts were focused on judicial reform and competition policy. There were still problems with the judiciary. The relevant Bills on competition had gone through parliament but there was a need to ensure that they were enforced.
</p>

<a name="51220-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>Others to whom we spoke referred to the large rural population, who hoped that the European Union could offer advantages since, they believed, Romania was more competitive than many CAP countries. Apparently Romania does not subsidise agriculture at present, although it imports subsidised goods. Accession would help to create a fairer playing field. There was a need to change the agricultural pattern from one of subsistence farming to a market economy. Interestingly, they foresaw farms getting bigger yet remaining organic. Everyone agreed that Romania clearly needed to implement all its commitments to join the EU, but that the actions taken have been costly in some areas. It was therefore important that it proceeded. Others whom I met said that the economics of accession were less important than the message that integration would send to the public and to investors, and that the process of change was quicker if you were inside an institution, where certain objectives had to be met.
</p>

<a name="51220-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>It is critical that the problems of the constitutional treaty, whether it sits on the bottom of the sea or not&#151;and we should recall that there are often successful expeditions to salvage the best of what has been sunk&#151;are not allowed to stand in the way of enlargement, particularly in the case of the western Balkans. It is, as other noble Lords have said, a driver for peace and stability in all countries. Macedonia&#039;s acceptance as a candidate country at last weekend&#039;s European Council was important. I hope that the enlargement strategy paper, which has changed the rules since the last enlargement round, will not be used as a political weapon to delay and restrict enlargement. Dashed hopes in the western Balkans could have disastrous results.
</p>

<a name="51220-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>I suspect that the presidency conclusions of 15 and 16 December to which the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, referred could be used to delay all future enlargements&#151;especially, the sentence which refers to:

<a name="51220-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Tomlinson: </b>   My Lords, it is a great pleasure to support the Motion so ably moved by my noble friend Lord Triesman. Since we joined the European Union, there has been a stream of new and successful enlargements. We had, successively, Greece, Spain and Portugal moving us up to a community of 12 members; then Sweden, Austria and Finland moving us up to 15; then, last year, the 10 new countries acceded, taking us up to 25. Now we have Romania and Bulgaria and, waiting in a line, Turkey, Macedonia and, possibly, Croatia.
</p>

<a name="51220-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>Everybody seems to want to join the European Union. No politicians are seriously griping anywhere across the Union, other than here in the United Kingdom&#151;where we seem to have more than our fair share. In welcoming the proposed enlargement the noble Lord, Lord Howell, sounded about as enthusiastic as Scrooge welcoming Christmas. I think he was having one of his bad days today; I much preferred the tone of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, who seemed enthusiastic indeed about what he was supporting.
</p>

<a name="51220-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>Yesterday saw parts of the United Kingdom at their worst; mainly, those parts represented on the Conservative Benches in both Houses. They profess to want to be in Europe, to want to support enlargement and to want policies that support economic reform in eastern Europe. They want to do everything but pay their fair share of the bill for that process.
</p>

<a name="51220-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>Perhaps the worst service ever done to serious discussion of Europe was that performed by a former prime ministerial demand that we want our money back. That demand reduced Europe in so many people&#039;s minds to a balance-sheet exercise and yet most of the real benefits have been seen in the political and security consequences of many of the successive enlargements to which I have referred.
</p>

<a name="51220-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>In Greece, we saw the return to democracy following the overthrow of a military junta and the membership of the European Union underpinned that democracy. In Spain and Portugal we saw the replacement of General Franco and Salazar by newly emergent, political democracies, again fully underpinned by their membership of the European Union. Even when we saw successful, economically prosperous, net-contributor countries joining&#151;countries such as Sweden, Austria and Finland&#151;we saw them all face up to very real political problems about their different sorts of neutrality and decided, despite the views that at one time they had thought were obstacles to them joining the European Union, <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51220-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>The more recently liberated-from-the-shackles-of-communism applicants all sought to re-establish their sovereignty and democracy within the framework of that same European Union. They are our natural allies, sharing our view of Europe. They did not reject the centralisation of the former Soviet Union by seeking to join a European Union that would then be one in which they surrendered their new-found freedom and their new-found independence to the centre at Brussels&#151;no more will Bulgaria or Romania. Like us, they want to remain members of a Union of sovereign nation states.
</p>

<a name="51220-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>My noble friend Lord Triesman was correct and proper to emphasise that what we have before us in this Bill is not a fully done deal, based on the assumption that both countries will automatically join the European Union on 1 January 2007. There is the possibility for either or both to be delayed for a year. Our obligation is to ensure that the serious work is continued. We must ensure that the process of economic liberalisation, the necessary judicial reforms, the tackling of the environmental problems, and dealing with the problems of corruption and organised crime are continued. In that role both we and the European Commission must assist in those and other problems. It is correct that it is far more important to get the accession right than to get it quickly.

<a name="51220-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Biffen, in a fascinating and very interesting speech, sounded an important warning to his friends on his Front Bench on the views of Angela Merkel. She sounded some very interesting views as well. I was fascinated to see the letter she has reportedly sent to Mr David Cameron, looking forward to close co-operation with him within the framework of the European People&#039;s Party. I am not sure whether it was that letter that led to the appearance in today&#039;s <i>Independent</i> of a full page article, which I noticed at the bottom, in small print, said it was co-financed by Conservative MEPs and the European People&#039;s Party, which they are supposed to be about to leave. Or is that just another view that is about to be jettisoned under the kind of pressure from Mrs Merkel. However, the noble Lord, Lord Biffen, was right to emphasise that institutional questions have to be tackled. They needed to be tackled after the enlargement to 25, and they are as imperative as ever, if not more so.
</p>

<a name="51220-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>I remain an unapologetic supporter of the outcome of the Convention on the Future of Europe. The institutional proposals in that convention are infinitely preferable to those that we have in the Treaty of Nice. We have to face up clearly to what we are going to do in relation to the institutional proposals that came from the Convention on the Future of Europe which suit an enlargement much more satisfactorily than those that we have had to revert to in the Treaty of Nice.

<a name="51220-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, we on these Benches welcome the Bill. Looking at the Bill in its full length and complexity reminds me of the benefits of being mainly concerned with foreign affairs in this House. I took part in a Second Reading debate of one of the Home Office Bills the other week and I did my best, as I looked through it&#151;through Article 60 and Article 80 and further&#151;to appreciate how much harder, in legislative terms, my colleagues on other policy teams have to work. When I picked up the Company Law Reform Bill the other day, that was an entirely different matter.
</p>

<a name="51220-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>The careful balance of the European Union&#039;s approach to enlargement, particularly with reference to Bulgaria and Romania, seems to me entirely the right approach: that we should welcome the European states which move successfully through the painful transition from authoritarian regimes and state-run economies to open economies and democratic government into membership. However, we should, at the same time, insist that they meet the necessary political, economic and administrative conditions required for membership.
</p>

<a name="51220-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>Enlargement has been the most successful foreign policy that the European Union has conducted over the past 25 to 30 years. I can remember visiting Portugal, Greece and Spain in the mid-1970s as they began to move away from authoritarianism and it is astonishing how far&#151;Portugal in particular&#151;they have moved. The quality of Greek administration today and so and so forth all owe a lot to their membership of the European Union, which helped a great deal. We have seen the same with the eight east European countries that have already joined and we are following the same path with Romania and Turkey. We need to do the same with the rest of south-eastern Europe: with Croatia and with the other countries of the western Balkans. We are attempting to do the same with Turkey.

tied in to our own country. Every time I visit my father-in-law&#039;s grave in Bradford with my wife, I see the Polish section and the Ukrainian section of the same graveyard, carefully tended.
</p>

<a name="51220-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>I used to have many enjoyable conversations with Lord Roll, long-since departed, about Ruthenia and his time growing up there. This is not a distant area about which we know so little, although I am not entirely sure about Dacian regiments and whether or not those of us whose ancestors come from southern Scotland should count Dacia as part of our blood. Furthermore, one does have to remember, as we play around with where we think Europe stops, that the Emperor Charles IV settled all those Saxons in those towns in Transylvania to defend the boundaries of Europe, as he saw them, against the barbarians coming in from the east again.
</p>

<a name="51220-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>We have to be very careful about further enlargement beyond this. I disagree with some noble Lords who have spoken. We have some difficulty with populations in other western European countries&#151;I spent some time in the Netherlands during and after their referendum&#151;where there is some resistance to enlargement. If we are to hold to the line on the western Balkans and on Turkey we must discuss how much enlargement carries on thereafter. There are those who talk not only about the Ukraine but the southern Caucasus. The Government and their partners in Europe need to talk about how we make the ineffective neighbourhood policy that the European Union is now pursuing more valuable&#151;about how a broader European economic area and political consultation is put into effect.
</p>

<a name="51220-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>Various noble Lords have mentioned costs. The costs are relatively modest. They, and certainly the noble Lord, Lord Howell, did not talk much about the benefits and the investment in stability and security which assisting these countries to move towards open market economies and effective and non-corrupt administrations provide for us. We now spend half as much on defence as we did 20 years ago. This is investment in our security in a different sense.
</p>

<a name="51220-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>The budget deal that we have just achieved was not too bad. I have two criticisms of it; first, that the British Government should have avoided offending our natural allies in eastern Europe&#151;the Poles, the Czechs and the Slovaks&#151;with our proposals before the final stages to cut what was transferred to those countries; and, secondly, that the Government should have used the occasion to argue not only for sharper changes in structural funds towards the new members, but that more money needs to be spent from the common budget on foreign policy regarding countries outside and around Europe with which we share common interests.
</p>

<a name="51220-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>I was sorry to hear the noble Lord, Lord Howell, following what seemed to be the <i>Daily Mail</i>&#039;s &quot;misery agenda&quot;, as it is now called. The noble Lord, Lord Turner, said the other day that the difference between the free market in Europe and the free market in the United States was that in Europe we regulate, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1710"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1710</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but in the United States they litigate. The costs of litigation in the US are absurdly high, so there is something to be said for our level of regulation.
</p>

<a name="51220-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>Clause 2 refers to the free movement of labour, which is a delicate issue that we must all be concerned with. It is difficult to extrapolate long-term migration flows from short-term migration flows. In the past year there has been a significant surge of people into the United Kingdom, but the net figures for the previous year were negative and it is not clear whether last year&#039;s surge will be maintained for the next 10 to 20 years. I note that in Spain, Greece and Portugal, the flows of migration that accompanied their moves towards the European Union were reversed as they became more prosperous. All three are now countries of net immigration, rather than net emigration. Most of those who came to the European Union in the process of accession have since gone home. I anticipate that the same will happen in Poland, the Czech Republic and others. Yet again, that is a reason for us to invest in helping them towards greater prosperity.
</p>

<a name="51220-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, should be careful about following the MigrationWatch agenda in this respect, which provides us with the worst possible extrapolations of current trends. After all, the principles of the free market rest on the four fundamental freedoms of trade, services, capital and labour. I hope that liberals&#151;and I understand that the Conservative Party is moving in their direction&#151;interfere with those freedoms as little as possible. The conditions are important. I note that in the other place the Minister for Europe said that accession was not yet a <i>fait accompli</i>. I now understand that to mean that it is not simply a question of whether there will be a delay of one year, but that accession itself is not yet absolutely guaranteed.
</p>

<a name="51220-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>The European Union rests on the quality of national regulation, national courts, national policing and national and local administration. That is what holds together the single market and our shared political and social space in Europe. It is important to maintain that, which is what the Copenhagen conditions do. The Commission&#039;s comprehensive monitoring report in October 2005 expressed serious concerns about corruption and organised crime in both Bulgaria and Romania. From visits to both countries I am aware that there is a degree of overlap between organised crime and corrupt administration. People talk about the &quot;deep state&quot; with reference to Turkey; certainly, people in Sofia have talked to me about the deep state in terms of the links between some aspects of the administration and organised crime. I read the report on the problems of Bulgarian court procedures and the case of Michael Shields, which Louise Ellman has raised in the other place.
</p>

<a name="51220-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, asked what would happen next and how would we know what was to happen next. Here it is in the Commission&#039;s comprehensive monitoring report: the Commission will present to the Council and Parliament in April/ May 2006 and may recommend that the Council postpone the accession if there is a serious risk of any of those states being manifestly unprepared to meet the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1711"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1711</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

requirements of membership by January 2007. The Commission will make a proposal and the Council will reach a decision; this is the normal way things operate. The two states will be treated separately. I should like to say in passing that I note that the British Government have given high compliment to the quality of the Commission&#039;s work on enlargement. This is and remains one of the best areas of Commission work. I think we may all have particular confidence in Olli Rehn, who has a British PhD and I can recommend to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, his thesis on the political economy of small states in a globalised open market. It is the sort of thing I am sure he would enjoy reading; I speak as a former supervisor.
</p>

<a name="51220-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>Conditionality standards and the current member states are something that we might wish to touch upon. Some of us have some concerns about whether Italy fully meets current standards in terms of the quality and diversity of its free media, the problems of its financial corruption and even, perhaps, the independence of the judiciary from the government. I touch on that only in passing. We on these Benches welcome this Bill. British interests are clearly served by further enlargement to the eastern and western Balkans. This is about our stability and our security. For that the Government have strong support from these Benches.

<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="51220-26_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Rawlings </b>  : My Lords, I, like my noble friend, Lord Howell of Guildford, warmly welcome this Bill and am grateful to the Minister for moving the Second Reading. It has been a fascinating debate; we have heard the history of Bulgaria and Romania, slightly potted, from the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, personal experiences from my noble friend Lord Biffen, and other noble Lords&#039; experiences. With your Lordships&#039; tolerance, I will concentrate mainly on Bulgaria. I go back to the start of its European Union aspirations, because I took the Bulgarian Europe agreements through the European Parliament in the 1990s, when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, reminded us. I declare an added interest in Bulgaria as a governor of the American University in Blagoevgrad. The degree of consensus on these Benches and in the other place is extremely pleasing and, I hope, represents the widespread appreciation both of what the European Union can do for Bulgaria and Romania, and what they can do for us.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>A Bulgarian friend of mine pointed out with great pride the enormous achievements of young Bulgarians worldwide. Their international achievements include world-class opera singers, mathematicians, chess players, computer programmers and so forth. There is no doubt that, once accepted, both Bulgaria and Romania will play a significant and constructive role in the European Union on our populations, economies and cultural wealth. They will also have significant power within the European Union institutions, with Bulgaria wielding the same number of votes as Austria&#151;10&#151;in the Council, and of seats&#151;12&#151;in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1712"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1712</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, and the European Parliament&#151;17. Romania, because of its larger population, will have even more.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>The experience of the last round of accessions, where not just two but 10 countries were accepted with similar potential for success and failure, has been very positive. I see few reasons to believe that this round of accessions will not go equally as successfully. However, there are areas that are worrying. Despite Bulgaria and Romania having GDP growth rates significantly above the EU average, both have GDPs of around a third of the EU average. Both countries have done a commendable job in squeezing in all the <i>acquis communautaire</i> laws in order to comply with the EU deadlines. But the laws now need to be implemented. Specifically, the Bulgarians must revise their judicial system and make certain that at long last criminals are sentenced and accordingly sent to gaol. It is unacceptable that so far not a single boss of the criminal world is sitting behind bars.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>The European Parliament has already demanded greater effort in stamping out such crimes. The European Union, too, still has to make the necessary institutional reforms as mentioned by my noble friend Lord Biffen to cope with the present and future enlargements. The sheer enormity of the task facing the European Union and the tasks facing these two countries make their preparations for 2007 seem a Herculean task. Ten years ago this month, the European Council took the decision to let Bulgaria become a European Union member when it met the political and economic criteria, regardless of its place in the queue, up to 2007. That was a huge spur and encouragement. It also presented a steep hill to climb. We should congratulate the Bulgarian people on having strived so diligently, despite having suffered great hardship along the way, to meet the requirements. They are nearly there.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>We must use every method possible in the time left to us to encourage these countries to fulfil the requirements and prepare themselves effectively for their accession. The alternative, so rightly stressed by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, is unthinkable. I wish them both the best of luck and I end by returning to Clause 1. We on these Benches urge that the ratification of the treaty and that of the Bill go through Parliament as quickly and as smoothly as possible.

<a name="51220-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I start by welcoming the spirit in which this debate has been conducted&#151;irrefutable evidence were it ever to have been needed that Bulgaria and Romania will be welcomed, for the most part certainly, into the European Union by the United Kingdom as friends and equal partners. I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part. The noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, and the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, spoke very clearly on behalf of their <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1713"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1713</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

respective parties and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, for pointing out that this is a brief Bill&#151;small but, I think, perfectly formed.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>As I said earlier, the United Kingdom has always been a strong supporter of enlargement, and it is not difficult to see why. Successive UK governments have supported enlargement because it has brought security, stability, and prosperity to our continent.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, made the vital point about the passage of history and the general state of development. That is reflected in Article 49 of the treaty of the European Union. It offers the prospect of membership to any European state. There may be feelings on all sides about how far Europe has stretched, but I feel that the discussion needs to go a little beyond generalisations into real-life issues, as my noble friend Lord Dubs urged.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>Enlargement works, as it has done for all the accession countries. It has worked for us, and restrictive policies have not been a credible approach to the issues of security and prosperity. It is vital to carry it forward. We need regular reports and discussions on the west Balkans, Turkey and Croatia, as well as Bulgaria and Romania. It should not be a small discussion in a private garden. The noble Lords, Lord Hannay and Lord Wallace, reflected the scope of this joint project of discussion. The enlargement agenda is packed. Bulgaria and Romania are making preparations for membership. Turkey and Croatia are in negotiation. Further integration and discussion is taking place on the western Balkans. All recognise the importance of the work, but it is also important to communicate the benefits of enlargement and to ensure that public opinion understands what those processes are about.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>Let us take, for example, last year&#039;s accession of the 10 eastern and central European states&#151;those to which the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, drew particular attention. My noble friend was quite right. The prospect of membership unquestionably helped to boost their economies in the run-up to accession. Membership has been achieved, and we can see the advantages. Growth rates are as high as 8.3 per cent in Latvia and 5.3 per cent in Poland. It is a virtuous circle. High growth provides job opportunities and helps to raise living standards in the new member states, and provides new trade and investment opportunities for the United Kingdom. Since May 2004 British businesses have had access to a market with 70 million more consumers. I am sure that Tesco is taking some advantage of that, and I guess a good many others are, too. The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will add a further 30 million to that growing market.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>My noble friend Lord Tomlinson identified the value of seeing the benefits and putting them into the picture. How appropriate it is to lead through those advantages to a discussion on security. In particular, I welcome the way in which my noble friend introduced the security issue by focusing on how the fall of dictators and the recovery from decades of dictatorship have enhanced our security. Greece, Spain and Portugal saw that extreme Right <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1714"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1714</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

dictatorships could have that legacy eradicated by understanding how Germany had developed inside the EU. I have little doubt that communist dictatorships came to have to face their people&#039;s understanding of the nature of those dictatorships because they, too, could see from those examples the value of living in a totally different way.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>Enlargement also means that we can live in a more secure Europe with closer co-operation on border control and on tackling organised crime. New member states have brought experience and knowledge to specific regional problems. Their expertise has enabled us to get one step ahead of the drug and human trafficking gangs working through eastern Europe. A good example was the arrest of sex traffickers in Sheffield in October, which came about through specific co-operation with new member state police forces.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>Enlargement also means the accelerated adoption of human rights and democratic standards that we have established in Europe right across the continent. Let us not forget that only 15 years ago people had to take to the streets in many countries across central and eastern Europe to demand those changes. Since then, the prospect of European Union membership has driven and supported political developments of the kind that we have discussed this afternoon. For many eastern Europeans, EU membership represents the final step in their country&#039;s transformation from dictatorship to democracy.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>Thankfully, Romania and Bulgaria are coming to what may be the end of their journeys. We will judge it but that is what I hope. Their paths have not been easy. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, reminded us of the depth of their historical struggle and, not least, of the obligation that we owe for the failure to recognise what was needed in 1945&#151;a point made with great force. More work still needs to be done. But the significant changes that have already taken place are a credit to the vision, energy and determination of the peoples and Governments of Romania and Bulgaria, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, said, the dynamics of change are bound up in all those things. That is a powerful point on which to reflect when the discussion on the western Balkans becomes significant. In my judgment, the noble Lord is 100 per cent right to say that, as we go forward, we must not play with people&#039;s aspirations; we must be serious about them. I welcome that point.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>Perhaps I may address some of the questions asked by noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, was kind enough to give me some indication of his speech, and I appreciate that. I was asked who will make the key judgments on whether the negotiations should be suspended for one year. The Commission will produce another monitoring report. I take comfort from the quality of its reports thus far, and it will report in April or May 2006 on the preparedness of Bulgaria and Romania for accession. On the basis of those findings, the negotiations on one or both countries will be delayed if there are outstanding areas of concern. It will then be for the Council to make the decision on whether to defer the accession of the offending state or <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1715"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1715</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

states. In practice, the Commission is unlikely to recommend delay if there is no political support or cause for such a recommendation.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>The key judgments will be made in the way that I have described. The single market and JHA safeguard clauses allow the Commission to impose protective measures to correct difficulties in the initial three years after accession. Member states can request that the Commission takes appropriate measures to address a particular concern, or the Commission can act on its own initiative, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, rightly pointed out.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>I was asked whether there would be an open procedure. I believe that there will be. The reports will all be published and they will be very visible. I have no doubt that we will debate them in your Lordships&#039; House on every occasion that noble Lords feel it is appropriate to do so.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>I was asked whether the countries can appeal against the safeguards. There is no appeal procedure but I believe that the conditions set out are well understood. They have been signed by Bulgaria and Romania and I think that they understand the procedures involved.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that there is no significant additional public expenditure. The EU expenditure is capped over each financial perspective and there will be budgetary limits. The enlargement of Bulgaria and Romania will therefore not involve additional costs above those agreed by the United Kingdom. But of course the redistribution of structural and cohesion funds to the A10 states and to Bulgaria and Romania over the course of the next financial perspective will see the EU 15 states accessing less than they would have done in previous years.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>A question was raised about the Home Office&#039;s predictions of the number of workers moving across Europe. I should say that the figures came from a paper and research from University College, London. I have no doubt that that was carried out in the best way possible. As we enter the next phase, I think I can say that the research methodology has probably improved&#151;one always hopes that that is the case with research methodology in general.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>I welcome the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, that the flow of people in Europe has moved backward and forward and has reflected market conditions. That is because it is a market economy and this is a market. That is what happens in markets, and that is what we always wanted of the European Union. As I said, at the moment no decision has been taken on possible restrictions or subsequent access to public funds in the light of the decisions because obviously we will need to know more about numbers.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Biffen, raised the issue of the impact on common agricultural policy arrangements. Enlargement does not destroy the prospects of CAP reform, difficult as those prospects have been shown to be in recent weeks. The accession treaty makes <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1716"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1716</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provision to adapt the parts that relate to CAP where that is required by further enlargement before accession.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>The Bulgarians have stated that they would like to go through our ideas on CAP reform, and that they want to work with us on moving towards a more rural development approach than the current CAP arrangements. The radical reforms of 2003 and 2004 mean that the CAP is now less trade-distorting and less environmentally damaging, but I would be the first to say that there is still a great deal of work to be done. I acknowledge that.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Biffen, also described the financial arrangements as a kind of Marshall aid and as more desirable if they were transitional payments. Let me say that the negotiations&#151;your Lordships will have seen that the figures are important&#151;have come about because, as the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, has just reminded us, the economic circumstances of those catching up are important. They are still very much poorer. They still need to come to a position where they can compete on a level basis. Their people are half as wealthy as the rest of Europe. That is a big gap to make up. It may be difficult. All negotiations are, but the accession countries have welcomed the outcome in the last few days.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, that of course it was a sharp discussion&#151;it was a negotiation. I seem to have spent quite a lot of my life doing negotiations. One of the things that I have learned about them is that for much of the process there is very little cuddling involved. Actually, as you get a little beyond that, post-agreement, recovery is usually pretty rapid, because everyone understands that strong positions are taken during that process.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, in the context of saying that delay would not be a disaster if problems were still to be overcome, asked a bit more about the corruption issue. I am afraid that both countries, given their poor rankings in the Transparency International 2005 corruption index, have to face big challenges. The goal of accession will, I think, drive the changes. The simple fact is that it will have to drive the changes. Not least, constant inspection will be needed to ensure that EU funds themselves are not lost to corruption. That would be a double travesty. The Commission is to pay the closest attention to this, and our embassy liaison staff are working with others on the anti-crime issues, including money laundering and other sorts of crime. It may well be that money laundering is one of the reasons that the banking system has been difficult to encourage on the ground.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>Certainly more work is also needed on discrimination against the Roma. We discussed it recently in the House, so I will not say anything in huge detail, but the Commission is bound to take that issue into account. A proper platform of human rights is invaluable and cannot be ignored.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>The number of applications for Romanian citizenship from Moldovan nationals is low. Since 2002, I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1717"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1717</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

2,355 Moldavians citizens have been granted Romanian citizenship, based on figures provided by the Ministry of the Interior.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>The points I made about banking investment do not, I am happy to say, apply to other kinds of investment. Vodafone has acquired the Romanian mobile phone company earlier this year, for &#8364;2.5 billion. UK exports to Romania in 2004 were up 19 per cent on the previous year, to a value of about &#163;606 million, which is well worth having. That involvement is one we want to see going forward.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, asked whether we were giving attention to what I think was a point about the Michael Shields case. He asked it in a slightly oblique way, but I understand the point that was being made. Michael Shields, who is in prison in Bulgaria, is receiving strong consular attention, and I give my assurance that he will continue to get that attention, as will his family.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>I am delighted that the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, was very positive about this development, because of her important knowledge of Bulgaria. She is quite right: in the midst of everything, the Bulgarians must revise their judicial system. The new judicial procedure code, passed to improve the efficiency and transparency of the pre-trial phases, is now on the books. There are 12,000 new police investigators&#151;and my word, that is necessary&#151;and the Ministry of Interior Act has been introduced to modernise law enforcement structures. These are all vital measures.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>In my concluding comments, I want to turn to the fundamental part of the exchange&#151;the exchange between many Members of your Lordships&#039; House and the noble Lord, Lord Howell. It is the exchange that I want to have with the noble Lord as well, because it lies at the heart of how we look forward. I admire the depth of the noble Lord&#039;s thinking; I have seen it many times in the House and have heard it elsewhere as well. But I wonder whether it has led him to the wrong balance of conclusions. Obviously, I do not accept his argument that this has been a dismal presidency&#151;I could go through a long list of the presidency&#039;s achievements, but I will not&#151;but I want to come to the heart of what he said.

<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>The noble Lord is right that there are significant ambiguities about the direction and character of the EU. These are big debates, as we are all aware. He is quite right to press the arguments about the protection of industries, particularly agriculture, in a way which may have helped their post-war recovery but it does not make much sense in a modern economic setting. I, too, am uncomfortable about the extent and complexity of regulation. I have no differences with him on those points. These characteristics can impede vigour and renewal in European Union markets and in civil society itself. But my overall conclusion is different.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>We live in a continent which was historically renowned for the length, extent and violence of its conflicts. Some great peoples, despite the extraordinary sophistication of their culture, proved in recent history capable of acts of extraordinary <br>&nbsp;<br>

barbarism that have come to scar all recorded history. We traded blows with many of them more readily than we traded goods. Even in the past decade and a half we have seen a resurgence of ethnic violence and mass murder in the former Yugoslavia. Yet we have not only created a community that is growing to, and will, I hope, grow well beyond the 25, in which intransigent enemies of world wars and the Cold War now co-operate; we are also a fountainhead of decent values, the spread of democracy and the rule of law. People who saw Europe bathed in its own blood and capable of industrial-scale murder in its gas chambers now look to us as being nations which can give them examples that they can follow in their own finest aspirations. My noble friend Lord Tomlinson also made that point. Those aspiring to join this peaceful and prosperous market strive against the legacies of dictatorship, corruption and lawlessness to gain their place in much better societies and a much better community. That has been the greatest spur to change.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>Has the transition been flawless? Does it provoke occasional heart-searching? Do all the nations of the 25 and beyond approach these questions in exactly the same frame of mind? In this huge market, and among this diversity, of course they do not. But overall, however bumpy that ride, it is one of the most progressive and genuinely entrenched progressive developments that could possibly have been seen against that stark history and background. Who could deny that? New arrangements will be needed&#151;they will be debated hotly, but that fundamental trend is there. It is an achievement of global proportions in my view; it is no cause, if I may say so to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, for deep pessimism.
</p>

<a name="51220-26_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>I know the noble Lord to be a strategic thinker. I invite him to re-evaluate the flow of Europe&#039;s history. That is what we are debating in this House, and if we get it wrong, we are more likely to lapse back to what we have tragically experienced than go forward in the ways that have been so encouraging.

<a name="time_26"></a>
<a name="51220-27_time0"></a><h5>5.05 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="51220-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Grocott: </b>   My Lords, it is now my duty to move the adjournment of the House for the last time this year. It is a pleasant duty, and tradition has it that we take this opportunity to pay tribute to people who have retired during the course of the year and thank the staff of this House for the tremendous service that they give us. I am happy to do that. The House will be excited to hear that as well as me emerging from the shadows to do this, so will my fellow members of the usual channels and the Convenor. We shall then revert to the shadows until this time next year, which suits us fine.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>It is a good time of the year for me. The prospect of a Recess is always a pleasant one for me, and the thought of being reasonably confident that I can go for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1719"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1719</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

two and a half weeks without any government defeats enables me to sleep more easily. Before I pay tribute generally to the people who serve us, there are one or two names that I want to mention. I have put them in order of length of service, which I think is fair enough, starting with the longest-serving among those who have retired, or are imminently about to.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>I begin with Priscilla Hungerford, who has given no less than 37 years of service to this House, which is pretty phenomenal. I think it spans six Prime Ministers. She has fulfilled a number of roles, most recently one familiar to the House, that of visits co-ordinator. We all thank her collectively for that incredible length of service.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>The next person I would like to mention is David Jones, the Librarian, who will soon be retiring. In his case, it is after 28 years of service. I am not only thanking him but, on behalf of all of us, acknowledging the incredible service that we get from the Library and its research staff. Many a time I have made a speech, and I am sure this goes for all of us, where, if someone had cried &quot;Author&quot; at the end of it, I would have had to have said &quot;The Library&quot;. It provides a wonderful service to all of us. Our very best wishes to David Jones.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>I must mention, as is almost customary on these occasions&#151;especially as they are standing ominously around the Chamber&#151;the Doorkeepers. There are two to salute. One has, in part, been saluted already: John Kirtley, our Principal Doorkeeper who retired a couple of weeks ago. He had given 19 years of service, was held in great affection by this House, I know, and he held the House in great affection. We do indeed wish him a long and happy retirement, and our thanks for all that he has done.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>His colleague, also well known to many of us, Jack Blood, was the deputy Principal Doorkeeper, with, coincidentally, 19 years of service. He retired a little earlier, but I would like that to be recorded in <i>Hansard</i>. Our thanks to him as well. He had service over many years, but it was almost hereditary in his case&#151;appropriately for this House, I suppose&#151;in that his father was the Principal Doorkeeper in the Commons for quite some time. We salute and thank Jack Blood.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>I should also thank the former Editor of Debates. I include our intrepid <i>Hansard</i> writers in our thanks to Jackie Bradshaw, who had 18 years of service, first in the Commons and then here. Just as the librarians and researchers write our speeches, it is the <i>Hansard</i> writers who ensure that they are grammatical, even if they were not when we delivered them. They perform a tremendous function.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>A couple of other names are also worthy of our thanks. I have noticed in the past that we tend to pay tribute to those who are constantly at the forefront of our attention because, obviously, we meet them day in, day out. There are many other people who service the House behind the scenes, however. That is the nature of the job.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1720"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1720</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>One in particular comes to mind who has given great service. John Rankine is retiring after a relatively short period here but a long period beforehand in the Civil Service. He has played a key role in giving advice on the expansion of the number of staff who serve us. Although this has happened behind the scenes, this has been as extremely important job and we salute the work that he has done.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>There are a couple of other tributes that I would like to pay before I sit down. One is unusual&#151;well, not unusual for me but unusual for me in my role as Chief Whip of this House&#151;in that it is a party political tribute. I shall leave it to the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, as it is his principal responsibility. But we should recognise the fact that Celia Thomas will shortly be leaving her present role in the House. She has given tremendous support to the Liberal Benches over many years. Service to a political party is a noble service. It may not be fashionable but service to one particular party is a particularly noble service. My consensual mode will prevent me from mentioning which party that is. No doubt most noble Lords will acknowledge that, whatever bad press we get from time to time, political parties are a vital part of our democracy and a noble calling. We wish Celia a happy retirement&#151;if that is the right word.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>Finally to departments. The one that we must acknowledge has been working under the greatest difficulty and pressure for obvious and good reasons due to the major rebuilding is the refreshment department. How they have continued to serve us with the difficulties that they have experienced in the rebuilding of the kitchens has been phenomenal. Collectively I thank them on behalf of the House.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>Let us conclude by mentioning all the departments of the House. It is a privilege in more ways than one to be able to speak in this Chamber and be a Member of this House, but it becomes a pleasure and a privilege when the people who help, serve, guide and inform us in various ways are always unfailingly helpful and supportive.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>I wish all of them and all noble Lords in the Chamber a very happy Christmas and a splendid New Year.

<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="51220-27_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, your Lordships all know that the usual channels work very closely together and occasionally we are seen to work closely together. This is one such occasion.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>I am delighted to support the noble Lord the Captain of the Gentlemen-At-Arms in thanking all the staff of the House. We have a splendid staff. We are very well served by all of them. Beneath the patina and polish of the public face of the House of Lords, there is an amazingly efficient and surprisingly modern set of systems and staff working for us. That is nowhere better demonstrated than in the changes that have taken place in the Library during the time that David Jones has been Librarian. He has been Librarian for fifteen years, though he worked in the Library previously as assistant Librarian. During this time the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1721"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1721</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Library has &quot;gone electronic&quot;. The changes are startling to those of us who have been in this building for some time. All libraries&#151;but particularly our Library here&#151;have changed with the introduction of computers and electronic records. He has overseen that work extremely well here and had a distinguished time in doing so.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>Other changes have affected <i>Hansard</i> in recent years. Jackie Bradshaw has been Editor of Debates, as has been mentioned. The great rise in Grand Committees doubles the work of <i>Hansard </i>for large parts of the day. The Grand Committee is still sitting now and will still be sitting after the Chamber has risen. Changes of that sort have taken place and Jackie Bradshaw has been at the forefront of those in her department.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>John Rankine has been mentioned in connection with advising on staff and so on. He also had to help us to deal with all kinds of changed regulations, and to ensure that we used our staff to best effect and that they are looked after.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>The most long-serving of those mentioned is Priscilla Hungerford. We have seen her not only in her official duties in the House but quite often in her voluntary duty as one of the stewards of the Abbey, helping to sort us all out when we go to parliamentary occasions at St Margaret&#039;s, Westminster. I hope that we shall continue to see her in that capacity and I pay tribute to her role.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>More obvious, as the noble Lord mentioned, are John Kirtley and the other doorkeepers. John Kirtley was the Principal Doorkeeper and did a first-class job. Jack Blood, who retired in October, was a regimental sergeant major in the Coldstream Guards. During my national service I was subject to the ministrations&#151;if that is the right word&#151;of regimental sergeant majors in the Coldstream Guards. I have to say they were not quite the same. One did not get quite the same view of them as we do here, where they serve us extremely well. Jack Blood&#039;s ancestor came to some prominence at the Tower of London in the time of King Charles II, but perhaps we ought to draw a veil over that for the moment.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>But, as the noble Lord hinted, many other people serve us in all capacities&#151;the Clerks, <i>Hansard</i>, Black Rod&#039;s Department and the Works Department. Sometimes we are in danger of tripping over things because of the work which is being done. It is a very difficult building to look after, improve and modernise, which members of the Works Department do all the time, helped of course by the cleaners and so on.
</p>

<a name="51220-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>The Refreshment Department has already been especially mentioned. Its members have had a very difficult year but have served us well. I pay tribute to the staff of the Computer Office, the Library, the Record Office and the staff of our own Whips Offices, too. Celia Thomas was particularly mentioned and I support what was said about her. Like members of the usual channels, who you see in evidence today, they also work closely together in the interests of the House, as do all the people I have mentioned.

<a name="51220-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   My Lords, 33 years ago I spoke at a dinner where I was the eleventh of 11 speakers. Had it been a cricket team, I hope they might have said there was depth in the batting. Being third is perhaps a better position to be in than eleventh, but certain things have been said and we can be repetitive. Perhaps it is right that we should be. I thank the noble Lords, Lord Grocott and Lord Cope, for what they have said and I support them. On behalf of the Liberal Democrat Peers I thank those who are retiring. In a sense, by naming David Jones, John Kirtley, Jack Blood, Jackie Bradshaw, John Rankine and Priscilla Hungerford, we are naming representatives of those who are still serving; those who have retired but also those who are still serving.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>As has been indicated, it is appropriate for me to refer to the service of Celia Thomas. Twenty-eight years ago she was appointed as the lone helper of the Liberal Peers at that time. I met her on the first occasion at a Liberal conference. I have come across her words as written in the <i>Liberal News</i> and the <i>Liberal Democrat News</i> over the years. It is not the most widely read of publications&#151;other publications are perhaps more so&#151;but it has been a very important job for Celia because, to do that work, she had to have a total feel of what was in <i>Hansard</i> and what was going on in the House. It has been an important thing for her to do.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Graham, wrote a little book not too long ago in which he referred to some of the exploits in which Celia had been involved. There is a sense in which Celia, after 28 years, knows where some of the bodies are buried. She has become an expert in the procedure of this House and has given tremendous guidance to the inexperienced, and indeed the experienced, of my colleagues. We certainly wish her well in the future. She intends to retire from her present role here at the end of January or in early February. We will then see what the future holds for her.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>In thanking those who retire, we thank also those who continue. It is important to thank the hidden people, those whom we do not see too much but who are doing really solid work for us all here. We thank the hidden people. We thank in particular the staff of the Refreshment Department, who have had to toil with some real difficulty during the past few months while work has been going on in the kitchens.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>I thank also those on my own Benches who have had to put up with me in this role for the past seven months&#151;having had to go into the shadows just liking now and again to see the sunshine. In thanking all the people who make this place work, I wish you all a happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year.

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1723</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but praise for the service provided for us by the staff of the House. It is a pleasure as Convenor formally to express our appreciation of their work, their efficiency, their good humour and their service to us. I refer this year, as others have done, to the staff of the Refreshment Department in particular. Meals continually appear, although often in different places from where they used to appear. They are very good none the less.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>My principal purpose today, like that of others, is to express our appreciation to all the staff who will continue to serve us here for many years yet, but it is appropriate to mention some stars who have recently retired or will very shortly be leaving us. John Kirtley, the Principal Doorkeeper, held his leaving party at the same time as the Cross-Bench party, so I did not have the opportunity then to thank him personally for his 19 years&#039; service, but I gladly do that now. I thank also Jack Blood, who left a little earlier in the autumn. He also served 19 years. Those are great records of long service.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>David Jones, who I am glad to say was at the Cross-Bench party, is leaving us in January. We all know how much we have depended on the Library under his <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column 1724</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

leadership and how in the period since he joined us the Library has continuously expanded, improved and become increasingly electronic. It is now more than a few bookshelves ahead of me as it becomes more and more electronic.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>Among others whom I should recall are two members of staff who had particularly harassing jobs. They were Jackie Bradshaw as Editor of Debates, and Priscilla Hungerford, who, as most of us know, had the problem of trying to fit visits and meetings into spaces in the diary which were practically non-existent, but she did it very well.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>Finally, I mention John Rankine, the Staff Adviser, who joined us after many years in the internal management consulting team in the Cabinet Office. I feel especially entitled to refer to him, because he internally managed me in the Cabinet Office. I see him, as it were, from both sides. He did his job very well because I am still here and in good spirits, and the staff of the House are also here and in excellent spirits. So I thank all those who have served us during the year.

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="51220-28_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral </b>   moved Amendment No. 15:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>After Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
&quot;INTERPRETATION OF CLAIM IN PART 1

<br>
   For the purposes of this Part, &quot;claim&quot; shall mean a claim for damages for personal injury or death but shall not include a claim&#151;


<br>
(a)   in respect of, or consequent upon, personal injury arising out of, or in connection with, breach of a duty of care owed to any person in connection with the diagnosis of illness, or the care or treatment of any patient; and


<br>
(b)   in consequence of any act or omission by a health care professional, and &quot;claimant&quot; shall be construed accordingly.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_1"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is an attempt to clarify whether the purpose of Clause 1 is restricted to personal injury claims. Subsections (a) and (b) are taken from the definition of clinical negligence claims in the NHS Redress Bill and are designed to exclude clinical negligence claims from the definition.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Before going any further, I should just like to say how grateful I am to all concerned for producing the agreed list of groupings, and I am only sorry that it was a somewhat laborious process for all concerned last Thursday&#151;although, as Members of the Committee will know, I shall contend under Amendment No. 20 that saying sorry should never amount to an admission of negligence.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>We continue this debate on Clause 1 against a number of noises off-stage. A report has been published by the All-Party Group on Insurance and Financial Services, entitled <i>Report of an Enquiry into the Compensation Bill and the Compensation Culture.</i> In that report, the all-party group says of Clause 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;There is a very serious danger of expensive and time-consuming litigation being launched to clarify the purpose of the Bill if Part 1 of the Bill stands as proposed.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>On balance, while there are ways of strengthening Part 1, the APPGIFS believes it serves little useful purpose: it should be dropped&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>As Members of the Committee will recognise, after our first sitting, that is not the view of the Committee as we seek to improve the wording, and we shall still continue in that attempt.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>The other noise off-stage comes from the Constitutional Affairs Committee, which announced yesterday that it will hold a further three evidence sessions in the new year in its inquiry into compensation culture. The committee has given details of those evidence sessions, which will end in a climax&#151;if I may put it that way&#151;on Tuesday <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC246"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC246</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

31 January, in that the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland and Jane Kennedy MP will give evidence. That is the backdrop; but this is also a good moment to remind ourselves that the Minister made an important statement in the last sitting.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>The Minister said&#151;and the Committee very much welcomed it&#151;that she would consult the Law Commission. It was the sort of statement that many Ministers would have been fearful of making in the anticipation that their civil servants would say to them afterwards, &quot;That was a very courageous decision, Minister&quot;. But we believe that it was the right decision, because the whole purpose of this debate on Clause 1 is to get the legislation in a form whereby it can become an Act of Parliament and set out the way in which we will see the law interpreted. Of course, that is very apposite to Amendment No. 15.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>The Minister has always made it clear that she does not wish the law of unintended consequences to prevail. My contention in this amendment is that if the Bill is intended to cover personal injury claims only, it should say so. If it is not intended to be so narrow, what is it intended for? This amendment probes whether the Bill is to apply to clinical negligence claims where the defendant&#039;s activity may well be considered desirable and I ask the Minister whether the Bill is to apply in other professional negligence claims. For example, is it desirable for a personal injury lawyer to bring a meritorious claim, but not a spurious one? What about professional indemnity generally? That lengthy list would include products, planning, endowments and financial advice, as well as a topic that is very interesting to the Committee; namely, trees. We have debated at length whether climbing trees is a desirable activity, whether conker trees should be allowed to let their product fall on the heads of unsuspecting citizens, who may or may not have helmets, and whether youngsters should be allowed to play conkers without goggles. The Minister was very explicit and told us about how apples had been stolen by her friends from her orchard. In many ways, we simply have to consider the meaning of &quot;desirable activity&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>At Second Reading, the Minister said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;the provision potentially does extend to all claims in negligence&#151;as indeed does the current approach of the courts, which this reflects. The courts have considered it relevant in the context of professional negligence only in limited circumstances. We think nothing in the clause requires it to be taken into account more widely than it currently is. Therefore, in a sense, we are staying with the status quo&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 28/11/05; col. 96.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>The Minister has been very consistent on that. But my question relates to the speech on the compensation culture made by the Prime Minister on 26 May. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;The Bill will also clarify the existing common law on negligence to make clear that there is no liability in negligence for untoward incidents that could not be avoided by taking reasonable care or exercising reasonable skill&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-28_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>He then added:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;Simple guidelines should be issued&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC247"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC247</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-28_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>I hope that the Minister will give us a little more information about what the Prime Minister had in mind: the sort of guidelines and the status that they will have. The Prime Minister continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;Compliance should avoid legal action.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-28_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>In what way are these guidelines going to have such statutory effect? To avoid legal action, they will have to affect the existing law. If they are to provide an adequate defence, what are they, who is drawing them up and when will this Committee see them?
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The question of referring to Clause 1 in this vague sense will be assisted by the Minister&#039;s undertaking to consult the Law Commission. She graciously accepted that idea, which I put to her on the advice on one of my partners who is head of our strategic litigation department, Andrew Parker. When I consulted him afterwards about the sort of conversation that should take place between the Minister and the Law Commission, he asked for the following points to be raised by the Minister.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>It may assist the Minister in dealing with this and other amendments if I set them out. First, is the Minister right in saying that the clause in effect implements the decision in <i>Tomlinson </i>v <i>Congleton Borough Council</i>? Secondly, accepting that there needs to be a level playing field in negligence and breach of statutory duty, is that achieved? Thirdly, does the clause limit its application to personal injury and/or death?
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Fourthly, what does the Law Commission think about the phrase &quot;desirable activity&quot;? The Minister has been very open with us and asked whether we can suggest anything better. That is probably a good question for the Law Commission. I noticed a flurry of activity when, in a stray moment, I omitted the word &quot;desirable&quot; and referred only to &quot;activity&quot;. That may be an option, but those advising the Minister would probably be in a better position to consider the application of such a word to existing law. We have tried a number of options, such as &quot;public benefit&quot;&#151;a phrase suggested to me by one of the finest legal brains in Britain. We need someone somewhere to tell us what impact the phrase &quot;desirable activity&quot; is likely to have, given that it has never been interpreted before by the courts.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The fifth question is: is there any benefit in such a statement being in Clause 1? Does such legislation change the law? If I may summarise the Minister&#039;s position, it is: &quot;Please do not worry. We are not changing the law in any way; we are not amending the law&quot;. It rather defies the whole basis on which Parliament operates to say that if we pass a clause in the Bill it does not change the law; it does not amend the law; it does not affect the law in some way. Does it clarify the law?
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>My sixth question is: does the clause change the law? That is fundamental because, if the Law Commission&#039;s answer is that it does change the law, that is the case for referring Clause 1 to the Law Commissioners, as the Minister explained in our previous debate.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC248"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC248</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-28_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Then there is a problem of the burden of proof. In a moment we will come to an amendment that deals with that question, but what effect does the clause have on the burden of proof on either the defendant or the claimant or both?
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>My final, eighth question is: if we are indeed restating the law, is there anything else that we should be clarifying? I know that the Minister approaches the debate with the best intentions, but I recall an idiosyncratic phrase such as, &quot;The road to Hell is paved with good intentions&quot;. The Minister may be embarking on a route which, although she believes it leads to pleasant pastures, actually leads downwards into all sorts of problems.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>I hope that that is helpful in assisting the officials on whom the Minister relies to advise her about the points that she may explore in her forthcoming meeting with the Law Commission. It would be helpful to us all if the Minister were able to give us some idea of timing. Will that discussion have taken place before the noble Baroness gives evidence to the Select Committee? Will the results be ready before the Committee concludes? It would be helpful to have that sort of information before the Committee.
</p>

<a name="51220-28_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>In the mean time, this is a debate about the scope of the Bill and it would be enormously helpful if the Minister could give us some idea of the extent to which the clause will apply and what limitations she anticipates the courts will impose on its scope and coverage. I beg to move.

<a name="51220-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I think I can be brief. As I made clear on the first day of the Grand Committee, my view is that since the decision of your Lordships&#039; House in <i>Tomlinson</i> v <i>Congleton Borough Council</i> the substantive law is about right. I was therefore distinctly dubious about the value of Clause 1, as it seemed to me that it led to two risks. First, there was the risk that the courts would disregard the statement in the Explanatory Notes that this was intended merely as a statement of the current law and would take the view that it must have some intention to change the law. Secondly, it would considerably increase the risk of satellite litigation by people trying to say that it does change the law. Amendments Nos. 15 to 25 inclusive would increase both those risks. I am rising at this stage, at the beginning of a new day in Grand Committee, to say that I am unable to support any of Amendments Nos. 15 to 25, but I will not rise again to say so in those debates.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="51220-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I hesitate to intervene, not having intervened thus far, but one of the problems with this place is that so many Bills run simultaneously that one is prevented from engaging with matters that are of great interest. I am slightly perplexed since, as I understand it, Amendment No. 15 is primarily directed towards excluding doctors&#151;as shorthand&#151;from the purview of Clause 1. I cannot think of a good reason why they should be treated differently from any other section of the community. We all have the highest possible regard for the medical profession. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC249"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC249</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Part 1 has a very general application, and it is hard to see how it would have application in fact to issues of healthcare. I raise the question in a negative way because I do not see why one group of citizens should be privileged above any other. The good, noble Lord, Lord Hunt, may tell me soon.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="51220-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   As I explained at the outset, the amendment is an attempt to clarify the extent to which Clause 1 is restricted to personal injury claims. The words are taken from the definition of clinical negligence claims in the NHS Redress Bill. Therefore, it is an opportunity to probe with the Minister whether it is intended to apply to professional negligence such as that of doctors, or architects, solicitors, engineers&#151;with the collapse of bridges&#151;and quantity surveyors. Is Clause 1 intended to apply to that area? Or is the clause just a simple statement that does not have very much application? I am hoping we will hear from the Minister the sort of words that would explain to us all the extent of the coverage of the clause.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="51220-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I am grateful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="51220-29_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I am very much hoping that the Minister does not accept the amendment. It is important that doctors who stop at accident sites should be able to do so without risking their professional insurance status, which many of them fear that they do at the moment. At least they have done over the past few years; I cannot say that I have checked it recently. This seems to me to be an ideal state of affairs, as set out in Clause 1, dealing with professionals who provide their professional advice in severely unprofessional circumstances.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="51220-29_spnew5"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   Much of this matter was debated on earlier amendments, particularly Amendment No. 3. We discussed the problem that the word &quot;negligence&quot; could cover any sort of negligence, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, has just mentioned. It is not defined. I am fairly certain from the discussions held by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Risk and Adventure in Society that Part 1 aims to make people feel they can volunteer their services safely, and perhaps cover some of the cases where members of the public might want to help someone out. At present if you try to get someone who has had an accident out of their car and damage them in the process, if you have done a first aid course, you can be sued. However, if you have not done a first aid course, you will be all right.
</p>

<a name="51220-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Certainly as regards the case that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, just mentioned, doctors are not allowed to help people in certain circumstances. That is perfectly true. I took my son to a cottage hospital to have a very deep wound in his knee patched up. The GP was not allowed to touch it or do anything about it. All that was needed was for the wound to be cleaned out and two stitches inserted. That would have solved the problem. Stitches need to be inserted quickly before the blood starts to clot. I knew perfectly well that if I had taken my son to Bedford Hospital or Addenbroke&#039;s there would have been a four-hour <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC250"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC250</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

wait&#151;there always is for a minor injury&#151;by which time it would have been too late to do anything about it. We then rushed him off to Biggleswade Cottage Hospital. The staff there were not allowed to touch the wound. I offered to bring my own needle and sutures as I was in the TA and carry those things in my emergency pack. I also offered to bring my own cleaning kit so that a qualified nurse could use it. But, no, they were not allowed to touch that under rules governing their insurance. In the end I put butterfly stitches in myself and got a bollocking from staff at my son&#039;s school two days later who asked why I had not taken him to hospital. It would have been too late by then anyway.
</p>

<a name="51220-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>We have reached a ridiculous situation where people are not allowed to help others due to insurance considerations. I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that in certain circumstances, perhaps outside the hospital environment, any citizen&#151;however well qualified&#151;should be allowed to help others. That is what the measure is supposed to be about&#151;removing risk from such action. Although the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, says that the law is adequate, I have received a briefing which states that Tomlinson is an exceptional case and is the only one that has reversed a general trend. However, there is nothing to say that trend will not continue and that the courts will not consider other judgments prior to Tomlinson. If there were signs that previous somewhat odd judgments were being reversed, one might have more confidence in the opinion that the law, lawyers and the courts know what they are doing. I am afraid to say that there is still a problem in that regard. That is precisely why in general I agree with many of the amendments that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, disagrees with&#151;I refer to Amendments Nos. 15 to 25&#151;because they would help ameliorate the situation and the public perception, which is restricting people&#039;s ability to get on with normal life and treat other citizens in a normal way.
</p>

<a name="51220-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>If this is left as a general negligence clause, it will trap architects and others whom we have discussed. Although I accept that this measure may not be perfectly worded, it should be looked at between now and Report&#151;the Minister has been terribly helpful in that regard&#151;with regard to what are desirable activities. I hope that this short debate will be taken into account when that is done.

Therefore, I shall speak as briefly as possible so that we can make as much progress as possible and see this Bill safely on its way.

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, referred to the Law Commission and the Prime Minister&#039;s speech. I am grateful for the noble Lord&#039;s questions and I will study them carefully. As I indicated on our previous <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC251"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC251</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Committee day, I am the Minister responsible for maintaining links with the Law Commission. We have already been in touch with it. Although I am grateful for the questions, I have in my own mind precisely how I plan to hold those discussions. I will, of course, ensure that I keep the Committee informed.
</p>

<a name="51220-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>I am also, as noble Lords know&#151;and I know that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, knows this very well&#151;very mindful of the need to look carefully at the current wording. The Committee will hear me say more about that as we move on to later amendments, in particular those of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. My interest is to try to work with the Committee to ensure that we have an appropriate wording. What we have already heard in the contributions from noble Lords is, in a sense what I described perhaps ineptly at our last meeting as my see-saw. On the one hand is the issue of real desire. I have been talking to members of the all-party group and particularly Mr Brazier and Mr &#214;pik, who I happened to run into in the last few days, about their real desire to ensure that Clause 1 remains and about their intent to support it as far as they possibly can for precisely the reasons given by the noble Earl; ensuring not that we change the law but that we clarify it where we feel that that is necessary. That, I understand from all my dealings with the Law Officers and parliamentary counsel, is an appropriate use of legislation.
</p>

<a name="51220-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>On the other hand, noble Lords who are members of the legal profession and, perhaps more importantly, others outside have said that there is the need to ensure that we do not alter the law so that we affect how the law develops and grows, in particular as regards the common law. We have sought to do that.
</p>

<a name="51220-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I am absolutely comfortable with the current clause, although I am not, as I have indicated, wedded to it remaining precisely as it is. I am very clear that its purpose is not to change the law but to clarify it; and that it does not change the law in any way.
</p>

<a name="51220-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>As regards the Prime Minister&#039;s speech, he was speaking before we reached the point of developing this legislation, so, in a sense, his guidelines have translated into the work we have done around the legislation itself. I do not know what was in the Prime Minister&#039;s mind. I did not speak to him on that day. He is an extremely good speech-maker. He writes a lot of his own speeches and he makes the points extremely well. I thought he gave a very good exposition of the issues that he was concerned about around the compensation culture. So, in a sense, we have moved on from what the Prime Minister said and I hope that noble Lords will agree that within the Bill we have attempted to capture the issues of Clause 1.

<a name="51220-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   The noble Baroness has just made a very important statement&#151;that we have moved on from what the Prime Minister said.

<a name="column_GC252"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC252</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

happened is that the Bill is now published. The Prime Minister gave a very clear commitment that simple guidelines would be issued. Is that no longer the case?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="51220-30_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I appreciate what the noble Lord seeks to do. What I am trying to explain to the noble Lord, as the noble Lord from his vast experience in government will know, is that when one embarks on a journey of looking at how best to deal with a particular issue, it is absolutely appropriate to take that issue to develop one&#039;s thinking and to then reach the point where one puts that thinking either into legislation or, as the noble Lord will know very well, the work of the ministerial steering group.
</p>

<a name="51220-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>I would argue that the legislation has come from what the Prime Minister said, but, so too has the work of the ministerial steering group that I chair, which contains, as the noble Lord knows, nine government departments working together. One of the consequences of that will be that guidelines may well be issued around a number of subjects; for example, noble Lords will know that we are looking at rehabilitation in the group chaired by myself and my noble friend, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. We have work going on with the Department for Education and Skills in order particularly to address schools&#039; risk assessments, school trips and so on and with our colleagues in the Department of Health, linking of course to the NHS Redress Bill but also looking at issues concerning NHS trusts and their relationship with those who might seek to advertise, for example, in their premises. We have work going on with the Home Office on volunteer and police work.
</p>

<a name="51220-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>All of those, or none of those, may contain guidelines. I simply point out that when the Prime Minister set out his thinking it was before we had developed the ministerial group and the legislation. There are no secrets in that. I am not saying anything other than that. I think it is highly appropriate for a Prime Minister to do.

</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="51220-30_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I said &quot;any or none&quot;. I made the point in describing what the ministerial group may do in guidelines. I did not say that we would get a plethora of them. The noble Lord misheard me. I said that there may be some or none; in other words, in tackling our concern not to create a compensation culture and addressing the fact that people&#039;s behaviour appears to be changing because of a perception of a compensation culture, we should, as appropriate, issue important guidelines. There will be no plethora, but appropriate guidelines will be issued as needed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="51220-30_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   To summarise, simple guidelines may not be issued, therefore we have moved on.

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC253</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

2005 Labour manifesto. Is that an example of the manifesto commitment being altered? If so, that is a huge step.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="51220-30_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am not making myself as clear as I would like. In being concerned about the compensation culture, we need to do a number of things. As I was at pains to point out at Second Reading, this Bill is merely a part&#151;an important part, but a part. Many of the ways in which we will address the concerns will be to work with our colleagues in different sectors and government departments to address particular issues. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is concerned about rehabilitation&#151;that is an important matter and he has been helpful in discussing it with us&#151;but there are other issues. In the course of that, it would be appropriate to consider whether we might need to issue guidelines.
</p>

<a name="51220-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>In our previous discussion, the noble Earl, Lord Errol, mentioned filling in a risk-assessment form of 100-plus pages&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="51220-30_spnew6"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   We are doing a risk assessment for the farm estate, which is running to 108 pages. To be honest, that is not filling in a form. Things will be generated from it, but it is our risk assessment, which is complicated.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="51220-30_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The point is none the less valid. When one looks at how organisations or parts of government deal with some of these issues, we need to be clear about the information they need to concern themselves with. Either the noble Earl or the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, spoke about the quality of training, advice and support to teachers and others who might be involved particularly in working with young people. All or none of that may require us to look carefully at the guidance we give. That is appropriate behaviour for the Government.
</p>

<a name="51220-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>I shall move on to the other issues raised by the noble Lord. I take the point that he has tabled the amendment not to talk about doctors <i>per se</i> but in order to raise the more general question. We have been clear that in not changing the law, we do not want to remove from it those who might be covered. In a large area of medial negligence cases&#151;accountants, auditors and solicitors&#151;they would be captured by the law and we do not seek to alter it. As I have indicated, I am happy to look at the clause again to ensure that we have got it right, but in so doing I would not want to alter the law.
</p>

<a name="51220-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, spoke particularly about health and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, spoke about doctors. It is important that we look across the work that the NHS Redress Bill seeks to do and health Ministers are concerned about some of the statements that have been made. They are concerned to ensure that we do not end up on a position where defensive medicine is practised&#151;where doctors do not consider what is in the best interests of their patients and to look at pushing the boundaries of medical practice as appropriate. It is also important that within the NHS we create the opportunity for the system to develop. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC254"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC254</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I want to quote briefly what Jane Kennedy said at our conference last month when discussing risk and redress.
</p>

<a name="51220-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>She said about the NHS that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;the system as it stands encourages defensiveness and secrecy in the NHS, which does stand in the way of learning and improvement in our health service . . . We believe the way to resolve these problems is for the NHS to take a different approach, to change the way we do business in this field&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>Part of our work with our colleagues across the health service is ensuring that we are supportive of those who rightly have claims to make. The NHS Redress Bill will help them to make them more simply and easily. Indeed, it is part of the work within the ministerial steering group that those who have genuine claims should make them in a simpler, easier and more effective way. We also want to ensure that within the context of what we are doing we recognise the importance of the work of doctors and other professionals, while not taking away the fact that any negligence needs to be recognised.
</p>

<a name="51220-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a> Therefore, our ambition with Clause 1 is the leave the law as it stands and to clarify in a right and appropriate way. I hope that that fundamentally answers the points raised by the noble Lord and that he is able to withdraw his amendment.

<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="51220-30_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I want to take the Minister up on a number of points she made.

I would be interested to know whether in British legal history there has been another instance of Clause 1 of a Bill not changing the law. Leaving that aside, is her mind open to the thought that clarification might not be best achieved by introducing a new verbal formulation into this Bill&#151;I refer to the phrase &quot;desirable activity&quot;? That phrase is not construed judicially. My noble friend Lord Goodhart referred to the recent clarification of the law in <i>Tomlinson</i> v <i>Congleton Borough Council</i>, which is a House of Lords judgment and will override previous case law and all future cases must accommodate to it.
</p>

<a name="51220-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a> I am trying to be helpful, because we want to make the best of this legislation. Looking at it as a hoary old lawyer, I wonder whether having that phrase at the heart of Clause 1 without definition will not confuse further. Why cannot we have attached to Clause 1 some non-exclusive criteria which would help lay-people in particular? Non-exclusive is the emphasis here. That would leave the courts free to do their refining work on a common law basis, but it would give some help. I confess that I do not know what anyone would make of that phrase unaided.

<a name="51220-31_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I wish that the noble Lord had been present on our previous day in Committee because we spent a huge amount of time discussing that issue. I know that he will not mind if I say that I am deeply reluctant to re-enter the dialogue, except to say that we chose a phrase which does not have a legal history. That was deliberately chosen in the spirit of trying to find a way of enabling the courts to determine in their own way, but to try to capture the flavour of what the noble Earl, Lord Errol, <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC255</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

described in our discussions; the concern that activities in the volunteering world are being curtailed because of a fear, rightly or wrongly, of what might happen.
</p>

<a name="51220-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>We are open-minded about the wording, but we believe that the suggestions made so far narrow the proposition to the point where things might be left out and a change would therefore be made. We are nothing other than open-minded in thinking that through, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, may agree.

<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="51220-31_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   Is the Minister aware that the word &quot;desirable&quot; appears in the judgment of the Appellate Committee? The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hoffmann, in his judgment, refers to &quot;desirable&quot;, but in the context of what would be desirable growth. He determined that the word &quot;desirable&quot; was less forceful. It came below &quot;essential&quot; and &quot;highly desirable&quot;, coming straight after that. Was the Minister aware of that discussion about the word &quot;desirable&quot; and does it have any significance in her choosing that word in the phrase &quot;desirable activity&quot;?
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="51220-31_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am aware that the word desirable has appeared before but, as the noble Lord knows, not being a lawyer, my familiarity with how case determination happens is less than his by a long way. I am quite clear that in choosing that phrase we sought to capture but not in a way that narrows it. The word &quot;essential&quot; would not necessarily capture the kind of activities that we are seeking to deal with. I am not sure that the Girl Guides&#151;love them as I do, and I declare my interest as an ambassador for them&#151;would be considered essential, except by my daughter. &quot;Highly desirable&quot; also has other connotations. It is a formulation intended to capture but not in a way that would prevent the courts doing their job. Members of the Committee have expressed their various degrees of like and dislike for the phrase and I have already stated my openness on the matter. I do not want to narrow the provision in a way that would prevent us tackling the issue. That is my only concern about the wording.

<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="51220-31_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I think that we have all loved Girl Guides in our own way over the years&#151;I am only quoting the noble Baroness.

<a name="51220-31_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: N </b>  o, no, I always follow the noble Baroness. We seek clarification; that is what the debate on the amendment has been all about. There is no doubt that Clause 1 applies&#151;the Minister has now confirmed this&#151;to professional negligence. I am a little concerned that the NHS Redress Bill and various other provisions, rather than making it easier for doctors and others involved in healthcare, is making it complicated and difficult.

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>it has become rather complicated. When Mr Blair said that simple guidelines would be issued, he was referring to what steps should be taken in the exercise of reasonable care or reasonable skill. He continued by saying that that will provide,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;reassurance to those who may be concerned about possible litigation, such as volunteers, teachers and local authorities&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The whole purpose was to try to clarify the law and make it simple so that everyone understood what were their obligations. I am glad that the Minister has agreed to consult the Law Commission, because we are in difficulty here in not having had the phrase tested in any way&#151;certainly not in previously decided cases. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, that it is unusual for us to spend so much time considering a clause that does not amend the law.
</p>

<a name="51220-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>We do not have a constitution, but I should have thought that it was incumbent on those involved in the passing of laws to decide whether the provision changes the law in any way. If it does not, what is the point of it? We have had a useful debate and, in the circumstances, I should like time to reflect on the points raised. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="51220-31_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral </b>   moved Amendment No. 16:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>After Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
&quot;BURDEN OF PROOF

<br>
(1)   Subject to subsection (2), it shall be for the claimant to prove, on the balance of probabilities, all elements of the alleged negligence, having regard to section 1 above.


<br>
(2)   It shall be for the defendant to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the activity or facility in question was for the purpose of public benefit.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_25"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall not detain the Committee long on Amendment No.  16. It would insert a new clause concerning the burden of proof. It is an attempt to clarify the burden of proof. My reading of Clause 1 as it stands is that while the intention is good, it is likely that the test will be used as an additional hurdle for the parties to face in seeking to deal with a claim.
</p>

<a name="51220-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>It may also form the basis of applications by those seeking to maintain a claim asking for pre-accident disclosure of the sort of documents referred to by the noble Earl&#151;risk assessments. Claimants may well want to see copies of the risk assessments and therefore we may be creating more litigation rather than less. I hope the clause does make it clear that the defendant will have to prove that the activity or facility is for public benefit, but that once it has been done, the claimant has to prove all the remaining elements of the negligence. Thus with a school trip, for example, the defendant would show that the purpose of the trip was one of public benefit and the claimant would then have to show that certain steps should have been taken which would not have prevented the trip taking place.
</p>

<a name="51220-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>This goes back to the point made a few moments ago that any government, in introducing a new phrase into the law, are introducing a provision which changes the law. The extent to which it makes a change to the law is a matter of some concern to us, particularly that any such change will occur if the burden of proof changes. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC257"></a>

Listening to the lawyers, I think they have managed to obfuscate something which is not that difficult. The person on the Clapham omnibus would probably understand pretty well what Part 1 is trying to say. We seem to be going around the houses.
</p>

<a name="51220-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>It worries me that, given our adversarial system, if the defendant is not well off and is up against claims lawyers on the other side working on a no-win-no-fee basis, he may well be trying to defend himself. If he is attacked by a good, heavyweight lawyer, I am afraid to say that most of the time he is going to lose. He will be tied up in the kind of knots I have just heard being woven in a Gordian way by people who would probably rather see Clause 1 disappear. I do not think that subsection (2) is a good idea at all. The courts should be able to decide easily whether an activity was for the purpose of public benefit without the poor, non-qualified defendant having to do so when facing what possibly is a QC.

<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="51220-31_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The basis on which the noble Lord has so helpfully set out the purpose of his amendment is essentially where he and I part company. I do not believe that Clause 1 imposes any formal or unnecessary procedures. We seek simply to identify a factor which the courts can already take into account without requiring formal evidence. The basis on which the courts operate works satisfactorily in terms of considering the burden of proof. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that this amendment could well create difficulties in terms of satellite litigation. Moreover, we do not think that Clause 1 as set out will lead to requests for pre-action disclosure, but we think that that could become a problem if the amendment were accepted.
</p>

<a name="51220-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>We have already debated &quot;public benefit&quot; and I shall not reiterate what has been said, save that we are concerned about the risk that certain categories of case might be missed where the approach of Clause 1 has been taken. It could, for example, lose some Scout or Girl Guide activities, or certain commercial and private activities of the kind we have discussed at length. It is my proposition that if the courts are currently flexible enough to weigh up all the evidence and take all the circumstances into account on a case-by-case basis, we would not want to see this form of procedure introduced. Clause 1 as drafted does not introduce an additional hurdle; we are merely identifying a factor, and doing so in a way which recognises that the courts can already take it into account.

<a name="51220-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   We are of one mind in that no side of the Committee wishes to create additional hurdles which may prevent an individual having access to justice or, as just described by the noble Earl, being able to defend himself or his organisation. However, I think that the noble Earl understands that although this may look simple, in the hands of lawyers&#151;not necessarily clever lawyers, but lawyers who always seek certainty&#151;it creates an additional problem and therefore an additional need to take legal advice.

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Perhaps I may correct the noble Earl on one point. I would like to see a good Clause 1. We have made that clear throughout our deliberations.

</ul>
<p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_2"></a><br>
&quot;CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE

<br>
   In determining the extent to which the claimant&#039;s damages shall be reduced by reason of his contributory negligence, a court may determine a reduction of 100 per cent if the court considers it just and equitable to do so, with the result that the claim for damages fails.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_30"></a>The noble Lord said: We deal here with contributory negligence, which is an important matter. It gives us a moment to reflect on where else something has been done recently; namely, in New South Wales. I refer to the New South Wales model. It arose in circumstances very similar to those in which the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor decided to introduce a Bill very like the Compensation Bill before us. It is helpful to remind ourselves that what happened in Australia is similar to what has happened here.
</p>

<a name="51220-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>It was perceived that the courts&#039; application of negligence law was unclear and unpredictable. A government-appointed panel was established to review the law of negligence. That was set against the background of a public perception that it had become too easy for claimants in personal injury cases to establish liability and that the damages awarded were frequently high. The panel in New South Wales then <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC259"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC259</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reported that there should be a legislative restatement of the law. The Minister will recognise immediately that that is what she is trying to do in this Bill.
</p>

<a name="51220-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>At this time of year it is interesting to look over the press reports made at the time of the tort reform in Australia. The media criticised the government, in their attempt to whip up support for the legislative changes, for referring to &quot;Santa Claus judges&quot;. Judges were accused of being out of step with society&#039;s demand for personal responsibility. So it is absolutely on all fours with what we are talking about here.
</p>

<a name="51220-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>If we are seeking to make people responsible for their actions, we are seeking to do what New South Wales has already enacted. The significant legislative reforms began there in 2002, and all states and territories have now followed the New South Wales lead and have introduced legislation that implements many of the recommendations, including comprehensive changes to the law of negligence and thresholds and caps on damages for personal injury. This amendment is based on the fundamental aspect of the model, indicating that a finding of contributory negligence can be up to 100 per cent. I confess that that would represent a change in the existing law and, arguably, may be very difficult. If the claimant is deemed to be 100 per cent to blame, we are presumable arguing that the defendant is not to blame at all, or are we?
</p>

<a name="51220-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>My contention is that we are debating the failure of people to take responsibility for their own actions. That is why it is such a fascinating area of debate. There are no such provisions in the Bill at present: this amendment would introduce them. I am thinking of the example of Tomlinson itself where Mr Tomlinson was adjudicated to be to blame. Without going into too much detail, that was the result of that case. But what would have happened if the Appellate Committee had found that the council was to blame, but that Mr Tomlinson was 100 per cent to blame for his contributory negligence, to the extent of extinguishing any liability on the part of the council? I have read a number of decided cases, and a noble Lord referred to other decided cases as having flown in the face of Tomlinson, which was a decision that was not representative of all the other decisions. Therefore, Tomlinson could well have decided that the council was to blame&#151;perhaps it could have taken precautions which it did not take&#151;but that Mr Tomlinson was 90 per cent or more to blame for his actions.
</p>

<a name="51220-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>So here we are dealing with the question of the extent to which someone should take responsibility for his own actions. For example, when passengers fail to wear seat belts, injuries are 100 per cent due to the fact that they were thrown out of the car. Had they been wearing a seat belt, they would have suffered no injury at all. There have been a number of cases on that point. Similarly, a cyclist or a motorcyclist could well be thrown from their bike and suffer a head injury but no other injuries at all. That head injury would have been prevented had he been wearing a helmet. We also have mobile telephones. I do not know whether other noble <br>&nbsp;<br>

Lords have had this experience, but several times&#151;once outside the Royal Courts of Justice just last week&#151;I have been crossing the road on a proper crossing and have been narrowly missed by a car overtaking a bus on the incorrect side. I was almost mown down, but some sixth sense stopped me progressing, and I noticed that the driver was talking into a mobile telephone. But is the motorist to be blamed if a pedestrian steps off a kerb with an iPod or a mobile telephone? Unlike the present situation, can the claimant be found to be 100 per cent to blame? The New South Wales Civil Liability Act 2002 sets out that the risk must be foreseeable and not insignificant.


</p>

<a name="51220-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>There is the ability to limit liability and various other provisions. I will not go into detail, but I suggest that the Minister might like to have a look at the Act. It gives various examples of where if someone is to accept responsibility for his actions that must affect his ability to claim. The sort of guidance we have been talking about in the Committee would assist voluntary organisations in knowing exactly where they stand, if only the law were clearer. I beg to move.

<a name="51220-32_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   I can see this may have some value and it may be worth talking about. For instance, a typical example of pre Tomlinson where the court seemed to do something very strange would be <i>Craddock</i> v <i>Juan (1) Dr J A Farrer and (2) The Scout Association</i>. The date of the accident was 25 July 1995. The scout troop had organised a visit to a popular show cave at Gaping Ghyll. Some parents had gone along as well. One of the scouts asked permission to look at a cave across a stream. The scout leader refused permission. So the scout went off and asked his father. The father said, &quot;Why not?&quot; and went off with the son. He gave him a cigarette lighter. They went into the cave. The scout slipped, fell down a chimney and was killed.
</p>

<a name="51220-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>The other son continued as a member of the same scout group for another two years. Only after the son had left the scout group did the father sue the Scout Association. The judge found in favour of the claimant, saying that as he was born in a city he could not have been expected to recognise the dangers and that the scout leader should have prevented the father entering the cave with his son. In failing to do so he breached his duty of care. But how on earth will you do that? Are you meant to watch the father and son very carefully while also keeping an eye on the rest of the group? Are you supposed to rush across the stream and physically restrain him? That is a typical example of a very strange judgment. I cannot see why it happened. It may be that it should have been appealed, but where will the money come from? That is a typical case where you could say that there was a duty of care, but then say that because the father was so idiotic and there was no way that the chap could have restrained him, therefore it was 100 per cent contributory negligence. I merely offer it as a possible example to help the noble Lord, Lord Hunt.

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC261</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

negligence is a logical impossibility. You may of course be entirely responsible for your own injury, as was the case with young Mr Tomlinson in <i>Tomlinson</i> v <i>Congleton Borough Council</i> because in that case the court found that the Congleton Borough Council had done everything that it should have done in the circumstances. The whole idea of contributory negligence is it is contributory because both parties have contributed to it. The suggestion that, for example, somebody who is thrown out of a car because he is not wearing a seatbelt could be held under any fair system to be held entirely responsible for his own injury when the crash was caused by another driver driving extremely carelessly really does not make sense. We are going back by this to the doctrine of, I think it is called, the last causative act, which was abolished in the 1930s.

<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="51220-33_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for whom I have enormous respect, is sadly on this occasion, with the greatest respect, wrong. I have had experience of cases where a court was moving to declare a claimant 100 per cent contributory negligent, but was unable to do so because of the existing law. Therefore, it found the particular individual to be 99 per cent. A series of judicial decisions have been made where it was necessary to prove just 1 per cent. In order to invoke the full compulsory insurance for passengers in motorbike accidents all you had to do was say that although the rider of the cycle was 99 per cent to blame, it was 1 per cent on the part of the oncoming motorist and therefore the claimant succeeded in full.
</p>

<a name="51220-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>But it is not only that 99 per cent to 1 per cent line of cases; it is also perfectly possible, in my experience, for a court to decide that two parties were negligent but that the 100 per cent negligence of one of the parties, namely the claimant, was the effective cause of what had occurred. Therefore, perhaps at least he would accept my point on causation, where you can have negligence established on the part of both the individual parties, but the causation arguments result in just one of the parties being held to blame.
</p>

<a name="51220-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>What I am really saying is that under the existing law it is not possible to find a claimant 100 per cent to blame. My argument for saying that it would be wise to allow this is that rather than allow a case to go all the way to court to establish whether the blame was 99 per cent or 100 per cent, it would be better to have it made clear right at the outset.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="51220-33_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   Causation is of course a different matter. If someone was driving or doing something negligently, but that had no connection whatever with the accident, of course that is an entirely different matter; but where that is part of the causation there cannot be 100 per cent contributory negligence from the other party. Certainly if that were decided it would be a very strange decision.

of recommendation 31 and of a whole range of different work by the committee look again at the whole question of the law of negligence. I have the terms of reference available to me, and we will watch with interest what happens in Australia. I am aware of it, but at the moment I am completely unconvinced that I wish to go down that route. I will explain more about that in a moment.
</p>

<a name="51220-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>I want to say something else, which is slightly tangential but was raised for me by what the noble Earl said when he talked about the Gaping Ghyll case, which is the case of <i>Craddock</i> v <i>Farrer and the Scout Association</i>. One of the great points of interest and, dare I say, difficulty when you are the Minister in this area is that lots of different cases are brought to my attention in a range of ways. As the noble Earl will know, county court cases are not normally reported in legal journals so it is often difficult to get to the bottom of them, but I have been able to read articles relating to that case. The judge said that the Scouts had gone to Gaping Ghyll with no proper equipment, supervision had been inadequate and the scout leader had shown woeful ignorance. Those are strong terms to be used by the courts. The difficulty in the appeal, as noble Lords will know, is that the person who was found negligent had died by the time the case came to trial, and that may be one of the factors in the case.

<a name="51220-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I raise that not to go into details of the case, because I cannot, but because it is difficult when one looks at the judgments in particular cases at face value to see underneath all the different factors. Thus far, in every single case we have looked at&#151;and we have tried to look at every case that has been brought to our attention&#151;where people have felt very strongly that something has been done wrongly, we found other factors which, on the face of it, would appear to have had a bearing on the case. I say that as a Minister and not a lawyer.
</p>

<a name="51220-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>It does not take away from the fact that people feel very strongly that these cases happen and as a consequence they are not doing the activities they should do. I would not want any noble Lord to feel that we do not take very seriously, looking at all the different examples, to see if we can find cases where perhaps the courts have not picked up factors that noble Lords have been concerned about. I wanted to say that because it comes up quite often in my conversations, particularly in another place as well. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart&#151;I do not speak as a lawyer&#151;that if there was 100 per cent contributory negligence, it does not follow that the other person can be liable. The courts must always look at the circumstances of the individual case.
</p>

<a name="51220-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>Let us take a couple of the examples used by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. If someone does not fasten their seatbelt and is badly injured, that may be a factor in the compensation awarded by the court, but I disagree that the fact that someone smashed into them with their car should not be taken into account. Equally, if a person not wearing a helmet comes off a bicycle or motorcycle and suffers a head injury, who is to say that even with a helmet they might not have received the injury? Again, the courts will take that <br>&nbsp;<br>

factor into account, but it cannot be dismissed. In my experience chairing a health authority, it does not always follow that because you wear a helmet you will not suffer a head injury&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="51220-33_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   Perhaps I may interject one comment to clear the air a little. The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, continues with his vivid case on which the Minister has made some wise observations. In British common law it is crucial that where the House of Lords reaches a decision, that becomes a precedent which all inferior courts must follow. Although there is a plethora of cases, the case of Tomlinson will in future clarify and develop the concept of negligence in the circumstances of interest to the Bill. I hope that it would have led to a different decision in the case mentioned by the noble Earl, although I have not read the facts and who can say?
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="51220-33_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   On that note, because the courts&#039; judgments were drifting in a direction which the Tomlinson decision has changed or arrested, presumably it means that since then the courts have been free to drift again in a different direction if they so desire. Equally, another Appeal Court decision could reverse the Tomlinson decision. That could happen immediately if someone takes a case all the way to the House of Lords. There would be a different set of Law Lords&#151;I know how much they differ, having listened to them in the Chamber&#151;and who you get on the day determines the decision you will get. I remember that Lord Denning was renowned for some of his decisions and I am certain that some of the current noble and learned Lords are of equally independent thinking.
</p>

<a name="51220-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>I suspect that these decisions are not absolute and that it is for Parliament to send a strong message in a particular direction. That is what Part 1 is about. It is for Parliament to say that after much public debate it has decided that this is the way that society would like to see the law viewed. That should apply also to the House of Lords in dealing with another case similar to Tomlinson.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="51220-33_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   It would help if I said that running to the House of Lords is an expensive and rare business and that bold is he or she who runs to the House of Lords to seek the overturn of a recent decision. One is talking about the nub of the decision&#151;the ratio of the decision. There is therefore some solace for the noble Earl in the Tomlinson decision.
</p>

<a name="51220-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>Incidentally, Lord Denning never got to the House of Lords, which was not an accident, because he was altogether too adventurous for their Lordships.

must in future amend her assertions that this is only a clarificatory measure. It means&#151;the noble Earl has planted this in my mind&#151;that the House of Lords could not go back to the issues covered by Clause 1. Clause 1 is declaratory of the common law as it stands. The House of Lords can change from decade to decade but in future it will not be able to go backwards, so to speak, in terms of the matters covered by Clause 1.

<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="51220-34_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am always grateful for the interventions of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury. I understand what he is saying although, as I said, we had many discussions on this in the previous sitting. But as a non-lawyer, I believe that what we have sought in Clause 1 is to say that the courts may look at something that the courts already look at&#151;which is why, for some colleagues, the clause does not go far enough. I do not feel in my heart of hearts that I have somehow bound the House of Lords in a way inappropriate to the way in which the common law operates now or will operate in future. I am willing to be told by legal colleagues that that is not true but, frankly, it does not feel like that.
</p>

<a name="51220-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I should like to get back to the Bill and deal with the issue of 100 per cent contributory negligence. Members of the Committee will know better than I the terms of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945, which allows the courts to take into account the claimant&#039;s behaviour and how much that behaviour has affected and contributed to what has happened to the individual. Courts can reduce the amount of damages awarded to whatever extent the courts think right. Members of the Committee will know from their vast experience&#151;and certainly I found&#151;many examples of 20 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent, 50 per cent and 75 per cent, 80 per cent and 90 per cent contributory negligence in looking at different cases in which the courts were very clear that although the actions that were taken were negligent, the way in which the individual had behaved had contributed to a greater or lesser degree.
</p>

<a name="51220-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>The case that I was particularly struck by was <i>Jayes</i> v <i>IMI (Kynoch) Ltd</i>, which will be familiar to some noble Lords. The judgment said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;It must be borne in mind that in a case of this kind the court does not, for example, hold that there is 1 per cent or 2 per cent fault on the part of the employer and 99 per cent or 98 per cent fault on the part of the workman. There comes a point in time where the degree of fault is so great that the court ceases to make fine calculations of that kind and holds that in practical terms the fault is entirely that of the workman&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>As a non-lawyer, I read that to mean that the courts could effectively say that when you look at a judgment there is such a fine line that it would be appropriate, in the sense of 100 per cent. But I am very clear that it would be for the courts to determine in considering individual circumstances and taking into account, as they can, what was done in the 1945 Act. To add this would cause confusion because we already have the 1945 Act and we already have many cases in which the courts have very properly said that the circumstances <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC265"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC265</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

warrant that contributory negligence was a major or minor factor, and that it was taken into account when awarding damages.
</p>

<a name="51220-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>We should not accept the amendment for the reasons I have given. But I hope that the noble Lord will feel that the issue has been aired, as I know that lay behind the tabling of the amendment, and that he will feel able to withdraw it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="51220-34_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   Can the Minister help me with the evidence that underlies the contention that we need to give guidance to the courts as to what their powers are? She said that there was a very wide spread of contributory negligence percentages. The evidence that we have in the briefing from the leisure parks operators is that by and large it is 20 per cent and that the courts very rarely stray beyond 50 per cent. Is any data available on the pattern of contributory negligence awards that might give us some guidance as to whether the courts are erring generally too far in removing responsibility from the individual?


</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="51220-34_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I did not think that I would find a pattern&#151;but, unfortunately, I was not given the briefing that the noble Lord has. I would be very happy to look at it; indeed, I have arranged to meet the organisation involved in the near future to discuss these issues, because I know that they are of concern to this particular part of the industry&#151;if that is an appropriate term to use.
</p>

<a name="51220-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>I have found that clearly the courts, in looking at the circumstances, were mindful of the way in which the individual had behaved and made the decision to determine the percentage of contributory negligence appropriately. Of course, one could argue that that could be challenged, but I find a whole range of different cases at different levels. I was not looking for a pattern or to see whether one had a particular set of cases in a particular set of circumstances. I should be very happy to do that, and to look at evidence that suggested that. But the law is very clear that the 1945 Act allows the courts to consider contributory negligence and the courts seem to take that into account in an appropriate and proper manner. There is enough evidence to satisfy me that we need to leave the law as it stands and enable the courts to continue in that vein.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="51220-34_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   This has been a very helpful debate, but I must rise to the defence of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. The Minister cited the case of <i>Jayes</i> v <i>IMI</i>, when the court of appeal in 1985 supported the argument that a worker could be found 100 per cent contributory negligent. As the Minister knows, I am very well served by a range of talent, and one of the brightest and best solicitors I know&#151;Paula Jefferson&#151;has just passed me a note to say that would I point out to the Minister, with the greatest respect, that Jayes has been overruled. The case of <i>Anderson</i> v <i>Newham College of Further Education</i> in 2002 reviewed all the cases and found that whether the claim is in negligence or breach of statutory duty, under the existing law there cannot be 100 per cent contributory negligence. In <i>Boyle</i> v <i>Kodak</i>, the House of Lords held <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC266"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC266</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that to escape a statutory duty, a defendant had to establish that the claimant was wholly to blame and that there could be no question of contributory negligence. The Court of Appeal, in the case that I previously cited, went on to say that the judgment in Jayes did not consider Boyle and should not therefore be followed by judges at first instance. I hope that that assists the Minister, who may wish to respond.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="51220-34_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am delighted that the noble Lord has the brightest and best legal minds behind him, though I believed that it was not allowed to name people in Committee in that way&#151;otherwise I should have named mine long ago. What I understand is that Anderson does not completely overrule Jayes, and that Jayes was about the courts not straining to find the odd 1 per cent or so. Because I am not a lawyer, I crave the indulgence of the Committee that we cannot get into the position where top legal brains are, in a sense, feeding directly into the Committee to a Minister who is not a lawyer. I am happy to discuss these issues outside&#151;but it is, for me, quite inappropriate for me to try to respond in that way.
</p>

<a name="51220-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I am happy to be caught out at any time by the finest legal brains, but I would rather that we stuck to the principles behind the Bill and sought to deal with the particular issues. It is my contention, regardless of case law, that the 1945 Act gives the courts the appropriate degree of flexibility to deal with contributory negligence. That would be my contention as to why the amendment should fall.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="51220-34_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   That is why I need to counter the argument that Jayes is valid law. I believe that I have introduced an interesting concession&#151;that it was not completely overruled, but it was overruled on the question whether a worker could be 100 per cent contributory negligent. Of course, I shall reflect on the Minister&#039;s remarks, but I hope that she understands that this is not just a simple legal point. What she said in her answer to the amendment is not necessary because, under existing legislation, you can find an individual 100 per cent negligent.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="51220-34_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The noble Lord has to understand that my premise is that it is not necessary because the courts have flexibility under the 1945 Act. I am happy to put aside my comments on that case. We will look at it. My advice is different from the noble Lord&#039;s advice. We could go round this for some considerable time. The principle I am trying to establish is that the courts have a degree of flexibility which may take them to 99.9 per cent rather than the 100 per cent I suggested, but none the less means that they can take the measure into account. But by the nature of the term &quot;contributory negligence&quot; we are saying that the matter is a contribution to negligence; it is not a case of taking the full blame. My premise is that the amendment would take us into a different place.

<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="51220-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   But where they have not caught up it is our duty to put the situation right. The Minister has more or less conceded that if <i>Jayes </i>v<i> IMI</i> is considered not to be good law, she will reflect on the situation. I accept her undertaking. Perhaps we might return to this at a later stage. We shall consider a key element of contributory negligence, that of being so overcome by the effects of drink or drugs that a person cannot really be responsible for their actions, and the effect that has on contributory negligence. I anticipate that we shall shortly discuss those issues and therefore I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51220-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="51220-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral </b>   moved Amendment No. 18:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>After Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_3"></a><br>
&quot;PRESUMPTION OF CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE IN CASES OF INTOXICATION

<br>
(1)   If at the time that injury or loss was sustained the claimant was intoxicated, there will be a presumption that the claimant contributed to the injury or loss unless the court is satisfied that the claimant&#039;s intoxication did not contribute in any way to the cause of the injury or loss.


<br>
(2)   For the purpose of this section &quot;intoxication&quot;&#151;


<br>
(a)   includes being under the influence of alcohol or a drug, whether taken medicinally, legally or illegally;


<br>
(b)   excludes intoxication which was not self-induced.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_53"></a>The noble Lord said: I believe it would be for the convenience of the Committee to discuss Amendment No. 24 with Amendment No. 18. The amendment deals with the presumption of contributory negligence in cases of intoxication.
</p>

<a name="51220-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>The Minister referred to the New South Wales model. It is useful for the Committee to know that the Minister has studied that model because it is directly relevant to our discussions. Another possible import from New South Wales would be to set out a formal position to deal with claimants who are drunk or under the influence of drugs. I refer to the case of <i>Radcliffe </i>v<i> McConnell Jones and the</i> <i>Governors of Harper Adams Agricultural College</i>. That and a number of other cases demonstrate that we must have consistency in our judicial opinions. On 7 November 1997 His Honour Judge Brunning found the agricultural college 60 per cent liable for the claimant&#039;s tetraplegia, although it was a breach of statutory duty case. The 19 year-old student, Luke Radcliffe, had dived into the shallow end of the college swimming pool. The issue was whether the occupier of a swimming pool which was closed for the evening was liable for the injuries of a trespassing adult. The claimant had been drinking but was not completely drunk, but he dived deeper than he intended and was severely injured.
</p>

<a name="51220-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>In that case the Court of Appeal overruled His Honour Judge Brunning and said that he had made errors of fact which affected the judgment he had reached. The judge had made errors of law as well in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC268"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC268</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that he did not define the risk from which the claimant was entitled to be protected. The risk was that in diving the claimant might hit his head on the bottom of the pool. That risk was common to all swimming pools and was obvious to all adults. In many ways that case is useful in demonstrating that although we may look at existing decisions, quite often they differ, as the noble Earl said. You are never certain what will be the finding of the court.
</p>

<a name="51220-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>Imagine the trauma for the agricultural college&#151;his Honour Judge Brunning found that the claimant had succeeded. Indeed, in the Court of Appeal, one of the judges said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;It is unfortunate that a number of high spirited young men will take serious risks with their own safety and do things that they know are forbidden. Often they are disinhibited by drink and the encouragement of their friends. It is the danger and the fact that it is forbidden that provides the thrill. But if the risk materialises, they cannot blame others for their rashness&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>That was a pretty sensible decision in 1998.
</p>

<a name="51220-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>In 2003, his Honour Judge Bowers in the case of <i>John Simon Donoghue </i>v<i> Folkestone Properties Ltd (2003)</i>, despite previous decisions, held that Folkestone Properties were liable to Mr Donoghue in the circumstances of the case. Mr Donoghue had decided to go for a swim in the harbour shortly after midnight on 27 December 1997. He dived into the sea from a slipway, struck his head on an underwater obstruction and broke his neck. His Honour Judge Bowers said that Folkestone Properties was liable. In reaching that decision the judge applied <i>Tomlinson</i> v <i>Congleton Borough Council</i>. He said that there was a known danger and that Folkestone Properties could reasonably have been expected to offer Mr Donoghue some protection against it.
</p>

<a name="51220-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>It is probably important at this moment to explain to the Minister that although <i>Tomlinson</i> seems to be a very clear-cut decision, on a very key issue the decision was split. One of the judges found that Mr Tomlinson was a trespasser, whereas the other four judges decided that he was a visitor. It demonstrates, certainly in the Donoghue case, that as Folkestone Properties approached the case, it must have felt reasonably secure in the knowledge of Tomlinson and <i>Ratcliff</i> v <i>Harper Adams Agricultural College</i> that they would secure. I hope I have been able to demonstrate to the Minister how important it is to get these clauses absolutely right. In that case, fortunately, the Court of Appeal decided that His Honour Judge Bowers was wrong, but the trauma and the cost of taking that case to the Court of Appeal reinforces a number of points that have been made by Members of the Committee.
</p>

<a name="51220-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>The amendment makes it clear that a defendant does not owe a greater duty to a claimant who is intoxicated. In addition, it will be assumed that a claimant has contributed to his injury. I have no wish to enter the controversy about the new liberalised drinking laws, but there is no doubt that the Government are taking a step forward in allowing 24-hour drinking that may well result in increased cases. I have spoken to many Ministers. Some feel that it may or that it may not. Others are absolutely adamant that there will be no increase at all. But, given the new laws, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC269"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC269</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

it would be a substantial achievement if we could clarify the law to such a degree that it is no longer necessary for cases to go to the Court of Appeal.
</p>

<a name="51220-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>I have imported a provision from the New South Wales model, which sets out exactly what happens in these circumstances. It is fascinating to remind oneself that the provision in New South Wales was introduced to address the expense of defending claims by young men who dived into shallow water when drunk.
</p>

<a name="51220-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I believe that the amendment that I have tabled makes the situation very clear. I shall quote Lord Justice Potter in the case of <i>Jepson </i>v <i>the Ministry of Defence</i>.


</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>It seems reasonably clear, but we could benefit from the example of New South Wales by putting it beyond reasonable doubt. I evidence my argument with the two cases I quoted where the judge at first instance found for the claimant. I beg to move.

Is nothing available to guide judges in reaching this sort of conclusion that we might look at to understand better how some of these judgments are reached?

I had not seen that letter but I am happy to say that, since proceedings started this afternoon, I have got hold of a copy and I take note of what the Minister said. She refers to Tomlinson and says that it is important that a proper balance is struck between an individual&#039;s rights and responsibilities and that, to reflect that, the law already enables the courts to take into account the claimant&#039;s behaviour and the extent to which his or her own negligence may have contributed to any injuries suffered.

<a name="51220-36_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   It is a delight to see the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, joining us. The noble Earl moved his amendments with great aplomb and extracted from the Government what we were able to do. I look forward to discussing some of those issues in greater detail with the noble Lord, Lord Greenway.
</p>

<a name="51220-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>I want to deal with the question about general guidance that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, asked me directly. The noble Lord will probably know that judges get guidance on civil law, including the law of negligence, from the Judicial Studies Board. I am not aware of specific guidance on contributory negligence, but I will find out and let the noble Lord and the Committee know. It is not something that I know at this point.
</p>

<a name="51220-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>I want to make sure that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, does not think that I have studied the New South Wales documentation, because I have not looked at it to the degree that the word &quot;study&quot; means to me.

<a name="51220-36_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   There is Christmas!
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="51220-36_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful for the noble Lord&#039;s suggestion, but I have several things to do over Christmas concerning this Bill and others. I shall add it to the list. I was rather hoping that the noble Lord would suggest a study tour to New South Wales might be a more appropriate way for me to spend my time. Perhaps the noble Lord could join me and we could make it a parliamentary occasion.
</p>

<a name="51220-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>My officials were canny enough to have worked out that the noble Lord would be looking at what David Ipp did in New South Wales. On this element, I shall quote out of context from paragraph 8.18 of his report because it is important from my standpoint:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;Furthermore, the onus of showing that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence has traditionally rested on the defendant. As it cannot be presumed that certain types of behaviour will always and in all circumstances be contributorily negligent, a reversal of the onus of proof is . . . undesirable&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>I took that to mean that one of the great difficulties with looking at issues of drink and drugs, in particular, is determining in statute precisely how we would want the courts to interpret that.
</p>

<a name="51220-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Looking at the cases that I have examined, it is clear that even though the noble Lord has pointed to a case where that might have been wrong and was then corrected, one of the joys of our judicial system is that it almost invariably finds its way to the right solution. Anything that we do to try to define these issues may have unforeseen consequences for those who are seeking to make claims. For example, the obvious <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC271"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC271</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

questions would be about the definition of intoxication and the way in which some medications have alcohol in them. Would one be persuading people to try to find out, before they even begin the claim, whether an individual might have taken alcohol at any point? We all know that if one has a glass of wine and is then involved in an incident it might have no bearing at all for some people while for others it might have some bearing. It is difficult to define this in a way that would give the right level of comfort to those involved that we would not create a difficulty that the courts currently do not have.
</p>

<a name="51220-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>As I understand it, the courts are not interested in how drunk a person might have been but in the carelessness that went alongside that and the way in which his behaviour was altered. One cannot use being drunk as an excuse for not taking care; that does not work at all. The issue is whose fault the injury was and the level of carelessness in what the individual did.
</p>

<a name="51220-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>I fear that the amendment as it stands would require the courts to consider that in every case anyone who was under the influence of alcohol&#151;and we could try to define that&#151;or another drug was, de facto, careless and that that was the cause of his injury, unless he could prove otherwise. That is a considerable shift in the law and I am not sure that I would think it anything other than too wide. I accept the premise that underlies what the noble Lords are seeking to do, which is to recognise that people who get drunk, do something stupid and are careless, need to take the consequences. It does not always mean that the fault lies entirely with them. The example I have been using all week, which I shall probably regret telling the Committee because I shall receive a competing example, is of a scout troop that decides to pitch its tents in the dark on the side of a cliff. One of the lads gets drunk and walks over the side of the cliff, which he might have noticed had he not been drunk. None the less, the troop should not have pitched the tents on the side of the cliff.
</p>

<a name="51220-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>The issue is allowing the courts to weigh up all the evidence and to come to a conclusion that puts the carelessness of an individual in the right context. I think that the 1945 Act gives the right framework and moved the law on considerably, and I would not be in conflict with it. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="51220-36_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   Going back to an earlier amendment, what the Minister said reminds me of a real example. A farmer&#039;s field of wheat caught fire and a dense cloud of smoke drifted over the neighbouring road. The first car to come across the smoke crawled through it and, having got through the smoke, stopped in the road to admire the scene. The next car went through the smoke at 60 miles per hour. The second car was clearly 100 per cent negligent, but the first car was not entirely sensible either. There can be circumstances where the claimant is 100 per cent negligent even though the other party is negligent too. One ought to recognise that there are circumstances when balancing is not what should be <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="51220-36_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I am very grateful to my noble friend for that example. We are trying to make it easier and simpler for people outside to understand their legal position. I was greatly assisted on this difficult area by an e-mail that I received a few moments ago from the Historic Houses Association. As well as making me aware of its support for this amendment, it clarified that when a claim is made there is serious concern about whether there is liability. The Historic Houses Association has 1,500 houses in its UK membership, of which about 500 are open to the public.  That is more houses than the combined total of the houses owned by English Heritage, the National Trust and its equivalents in the UK, so it is speaking with some authority. It testifies that its members are facing an increasing burden of aggressive litigation and, although some of its members stand firm and refuse to pay claims, it says that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;many others have felt forced to take a more pragmatic view, taking account of the publicity generated and the &#039;no smoke without fire&#039; assumption that often runs through the public&#039;s mind when they read of accidents in the popular or local press, and have settled out of court, sometimes at considerable expense&#151;even when the fault for the accident might be held to be with the claimant&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>So far as these amendments, particularly Amendments Nos. 17, 18, 24 and 25, are concerned, people outside are talking about the need for clarity. The purpose of this amendment was to send a signal that drink and drugs are not acceptable if one is going to be in a position where one might well suffer injury.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="51220-36_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord, but it has just occurred to me that one of the issues for the ministerial steering group is working alongside organisations that are trying to work with their members in order to make sure that they are not settling claims when they should be taking a stand. I wonder whether, through the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, I could suggest to the Historic Houses Association that it gets in contact with us because the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is sitting on my ministerial group, and it would be very interested, as would I, in looking at the issues that the Historic Houses Association has in order to see whether there is any way in which we can support it. 
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="51220-36_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   Yes, of course, and I shall suggest to Nick Way, Director General of the Historic Houses Association that he gets in touch with the Minister. It echoes the plea of my noble friend Lord Lucas: that there must be a way of guiding judges and giving them an indication which would make their decisions more certain. At least there would be a generally accepted background to their decisions.
</p>

<a name="51220-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>On drink and drugs, the amendment would send a clear signal from the Committee and the House. I am concerned about the position on the run-up to Christmas. I read in the newspaper that one-third of motorists admit to drink driving and that one in six is likely to drive over the limit this Christmas. Having <br>&nbsp;<br>

played a part in ministerial campaigns, I welcome the way in which the Government are seeking to get the message across. However, motoring groups say that the figures show that government anti-drink/drive campaigns are not working, particularly when two-thirds of motorists say that they are fine to drive even though they are over the legal limit. A total of 590 people died last year in drink-related accidents, the highest number since 1992. It is therefore a rising problem.
</p>

<a name="51220-36_para10"></a>

<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="51220-37_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral </b>   moved Amendment No. 19:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>After Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_4"></a><br>
&quot;PUBLIC AUTHORITIES

<br>
(1)   The following principles apply in determining whether a public or other authority has taken appropriate steps to meet the standard of care&#151;


<br>
(a)   the functions required to be exercised by the authority are limited by the financial and other resources that are reasonably available to the authority for the purpose of exercising those functions,


<br>
(b)   the general allocation of those resources by the authority is not open to challenge,


<br>
(c)   the functions required to be exercised by the authority are to be determined by reference to the broad range of its activities (and not merely by reference to the claim in negligence being considered by the court),


<br>
(d)   the authority may rely on evidence of its compliance with the general procedures and applicable standards for the exercise of its functions as evidence of the proper exercise of its functions in the claim being considered by the court.


<br>
(2)   Subject to subsection (3), this section extends to any liability of the authority for breach of statutory duty.


<br>
(3)   This section shall not apply to claims by an employee against an employer arising out of the course of his employment.


<br>
(4)   For the purpose of this section, &quot;public or other authority&quot; includes&#151;


<br>
(a)   the Crown,


<br>
(b)   Government departments,


<br>
(c)   NHS bodies,


<br>
(d)   local councils,


<br>
(e)   any public or local authority constituted by or under an Act, or


<br>
(f)   any person having public official functions or acting in a public official capacity (whether or not employed as a public official), but only in relation to the exercise of the person&#039;s public official functions.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_64"></a>The noble Lord said: This, too, is modelled on a New South Wales provision, allowing the courts to take into account the financial and resource constraints on public authorities when considering whether steps should be taken. The particular reason for introducing this amendment is to highlight for the Committee the background of public authorities being forced to spend substantial amounts on fighting claims&#151;money that would be far better spent on improving front-line facilities and services. They are <br>&nbsp;<br>

much more desirable activities, if I may say so. I hope that <i>Hansard</i> will recall that there was laughter from the Minister then.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="51220-37_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   It is a great phrase.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="51220-37_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   There is no provision in the Bill which addresses that point. Ministers are rightly encouraging public bodies, as the Minister just said, to contest frivolous claims rather than settling them in a search for the quiet life. But even that policy, in the short-term at least, inevitably has significant costs attached.
</p>

<a name="51220-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>In an earlier debate, I mentioned the Better Regulation Task Force report published in May last year, <i>Better Routes to Redress</i>. It included on page 6 the following point:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;Local authorities are spending a great amount of money dealing with all the claims they receive. Every claim made, however frivolous or vexatious it is eventually found to be, has to be handled. That costs money: money raised from local residents and money that could otherwise be spent on sophisticated systems in place to manage, for example, repairs to their pathways and highways&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>That observation reminds us of the need for the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51220-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Amendment No. 19 sets out:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;The following principles apply in determining whether a public or other authority has taken appropriate steps to meet the standard of care&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>The first point is that they are limited by the financial and other resources that are reasonably available. There are a number of other provisions.
</p>

<a name="51220-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>In subsection (2) of the amendment, I have sought to extend the provisions to breach of statutory duty, which is essential in the context of public authorities.


</p>

<a name="51220-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>Subsection (3) makes it clear that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;This section shall not apply to claims by an employee against an employer arising out of the course of his employment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>In effect, that excludes the application of this section to employer&#039;s liability claims. This is very much the view of the insurers of public authorities and of the authorities themselves. They have neither wanted to be, nor have they ever been, seen as second-class places of employment. That issue goes wider than simply public authorities, but we consider it best raised in this context. The proposed clause is deliberately not restricted to injury claims and would cover the range of unusual claims brought against public authorities for facilities and services offered at the public expense.
</p>

<a name="51220-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>Referring back to <i>Tomlinson</i> v <i>Congleton Borough Council</i> and to the judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hoffmann, he made it clear that he did not regard financial cost as a significant item in the balancing exercise which the court has to undertake. At the time he was not aware of the Minister&#039;s seesaw, rather he was referring to a similar situation. He continued by saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;There are two other related considerations which are far more important. The first is the social value of the activities which would have to be prohibited in order to reduce or eliminate the risk from swimming, and the second is the question of whether the council should be entitled to allow people of full capacity to decide for themselves whether to take the risk&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC275"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC275</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>I hope that the Minister will understand the reason for bringing forward this amendment. It gives us an opportunity briefly to reflect on the very substantial costs involved in frivolous and vexatious claims. I do not believe that the Bill as drafted will enable such claims to be repudiated more easily. We have to find a way to ensure that the burden on local authorities in particular and public authorities in general can be lifted. This amendment is one way of producing a situation which I believe is sorely needed at a time when public expenditure constraints dictate to local authorities the difficulty of maintaining a balance. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="51220-37_spnew3"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   I am not in favour of singling out public authorities for special treatment. This would also apply to private bodies such as schools and to the Historic Houses Association, which represents the owners of historic houses that are open to the public. I do not have one, so it does not concern me. However, the general point is valid. The private purse is no more unlimited than the public purse. If anything, the public purse can often levy higher taxes to make up the shortfall. A private organisation cannot do that, it just goes bankrupt. I do not see why this provision should be limited to public authorities. It should apply to all. Everyone has to make a financial judgment on what is possible in all circumstances, so this is a good general point to make for anyone running something that is open to the public.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="51220-37_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I could not agree more with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that it is really important for us to ensure that we recognise the implications here for all bodies, whether they are public or private&#151;here I acknowledge what the noble Earl has said&#151;when having to deal with frivolous or spurious claims that require resources to be put at their disposal in order to sort them out. That is particularly pertinent to the work of the ministerial group on local government. However, that does not mean that I do not take seriously his point about the private sector. Moreover, the voluntary sector is also critical.
</p>

<a name="51220-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>When talking to local government colleagues&#151;I work with the ODPM&#151;it is clear that two things need to be done. The first is to support organisations, and public authorities in particular, to ensure that they have the information they require&#151;dare I use the word &quot;guidelines&quot; here?&#151;to enable them to feel confident about tackling these questions and thus not give in to such claims. I know from talking to organisations in the private sector that reputation starts to play a part and it is easier for a claim to be got rid of than to worry about the publicity that might follow, and so on. So I am very interested in trying to persuade all our organisations to fight the cases that they need to fight and to recognise the ones where they need to think otherwise. That is how we want to approach the matter.

<a name="51220-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>I am delighted that the noble Lord has raised this important question. One of the great contributions to the conference held on 17 November&#151;I do not think that the noble Lord was able to be there for this part because I know that he was involved in a pensions Bill in your Lordships&#039; House&#151;was that of Knowsley Council. That was a very interesting case of a local authority which had managed to reduce its claims in one year from 1,700 to 250 and saved &#163;1.7 million in the previous 12 months.
</p>

<a name="51220-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>I do not have an aggregate figure for how much local authorities spend, but there was one example. It gave a very good description of the kinds of things it had done. It fought claims and it tried to ensure that claims were valid. I think that from one cul-de-sac of six houses there were 12 claims. They were people who were witnesses in one, claimants in another and so on. Knowsley tackled what was becoming a culture of claiming very positively. It involved the police service in doing so. It worked very hard with its housing repair department to make sure that it was doing things very quickly to prevent claims coming in. It had a wonderful and very dramatic effect.
</p>

<a name="51220-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>I cite that case because it was a great example to me of how it had done it without us, but, my goodness, if we put some weight behind the work it is doing, I think we could make a real contribution. That is my ambition for some of the work that goes on outside. So I am very grateful because the amendment has given me the chance to talk about an area of work that is not covered by the Bill. I could not agree more: it is very important. I return to the Historical Houses Association. We are working with organisations which can help get to their members and say, &quot;We will support you in trying to make sure that you accept claims that are real, and that you absolutely do not give in to claims that are not. Here is lots of information and advice on how other people have tackled this to very good effect&quot;. I am very keen to do that.
</p>

<a name="51220-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>The difficulty with the amendments&#151;the &quot;policy defence&quot; is the term that the Australians have used for this&#151;is that people make decisions on public authority spending. I understand that the courts will be mindful of that in looking at the issues. If you are a member of the public or involved in an activity, it is difficult to know what decisions have been made. I do not think we can exclude that decision-making process from the process that courts can examine. In other words, the fact that you have made a decision in an appropriate manner but you have not done a particular thing&#151;repaired a fence or whatever&#151;somehow lets you off.
</p>

<a name="51220-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>I am reluctant to go down this route because it does not take us where we want to go&#151;or, indeed, where the noble Lord wants us to go. I could not agree more with the premise that underlies this: that we need to ensure that all bodies, including our public bodies, involved in the provision especially but not exclusively of activities for young people, and people generally, understand the support that we want to give them to ensure that <br>&nbsp;<br>

they reject spurious claims and bring spending resources under control. That is for the very reason given by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, which is that that is a waste of public money, a waste of anyone&#039;s money, which could be much better used to support other activities. I could not agree more with that premise.

<a name="51220-38_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   I add to what the Minister has said. I absolutely agree that sometimes the easy thing&#151;I think that was her word&#151;is just to accept and settle. I suspect that that is negligent at some point. There is an intermediate state, which is a business decision.
</p>

<a name="51220-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>Unquestionably&#151;I am sure that we shall come to this again&#151;there are many occasions when it is much cheaper to settle than to fight to the death. Certainly it is much cheaper to settle than to go to court on many occasions. Yes, there are people who do not know that they should be defending themselves and more information should be given them to explain to them how they can defend themselves. I thoroughly approve of that. At the same time, we must think very carefully about the cost. At what point do people make a business decision? It is not a matter of who is right or who is wrong. They might decide that something could be settled for &#163;1,500 which, if the matter went to court, could not possibly cost less than &#163;5,000. That is a much more important influence than this debate has so far led us to realise.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="51220-38_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I completely understand what the noble Lord says&#151;I completely accept that such decisions are made. I used the example of reputational issues. It is another factor that people are concerned that their reputation does not suffer, and it is easier to pay up than be seen to have had a claim against them.
</p>

<a name="51220-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>In the work that I am undertaking I seek to take a step back from that and the actions of those who say, &quot;If you put in spurious claims, we will take this all the way through&quot;. We have had a couple of cases recently when people have ended up going to prison because of making bogus claims. So we can deter people completely from doing that. What was interesting about Knowsley and the reduction of cases was that the word went out that it was not worth making a claim because you were not going to get anywhere. That was why the drop from 1,700 to 250 was so dramatic. I accept that in a sense, in a local authority area, there is a captive audience of people and you can do something in one big push; it was resource-intensive at the time, but it paid off handsomely. It is much more difficult if you are an individual organisation or business.

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>I hope that through the steering group&#151;working with DTI colleagues, who are also part of the group&#151;we will set the tone. We need to get the message across so that people do not get claims that they should not, while recognising that, as the noble Viscount rightly said, you make a business decision at the end of the day as to what is most cost-effective in money and time. We <br>&nbsp;<br>

want to prevent people even from having to get to the point of making that decision when the claim is not valid.

<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="51220-38_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   I offer the Minister one more example. In a foundry in the west midlands the annual wage increase was 1 per cent less than the management had first envisaged because of the number of industrial injury claims that had been put in in the previous year. We battled it out with the representatives of the workers in the foundry and it was accepted&#151;and, of course, the claims fell. As in that case, the difficulty is often a business decision, because your insurer is always extremely keen that you should settle, if it is a matter of a squashed thumb or bruised shoulder. From the point of view of the insurance company, the business decision is to settle and not to fight to the end.

<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="51220-38_spnew3"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   There has been a lot of discussion about fighting things, but the new clause is about the courts being able to determine whether the organisation has taken appropriate steps. It is about being allowed to look at the economics of whether the organisation has put in more protection and have spent money on that, and whether it has taken enough care within the limit of its budget, or the money available. The same would apply to the public coming to visit. Are the courts allowed to take into account that it would have cost a fortune to prevent something by putting up a very expensive barrier, or something like that, or is it an absolute? Are the courts allowed to take into account the economic balance between how much it would cost against a notional occurrence and that the organisation perhaps got it wrong, because something happened that it hoped would not happen?
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="51220-38_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   Indeed, the courts can do that. One concern that I would have with the amendment, although I entirely accept the premise behind it, is that by codification&#151;which is what the amendment would create&#151;we would fix the law as it currently is, rather than recognising that it needs to develop. To go back to my original Clause 1 premise, we are not fixing things in time but enabling them to develop. So I would be concerned about that. But the courts can certainly take into account the factors that the noble Earl mentioned.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="51220-38_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I shall press the Minister a little further because this is an important debate. The Prime Minister, Mr Blair, and the Labour Party manifesto spoke clearly about the need to bear down on frivolous and vexatious claims. That is the issue before us. What are the Government going to do that will make it easier for local authorities, public bodies and voluntary organisations to bear down on frivolous and vexatious claims?
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="51220-38_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I cannot give the noble Lord the level of detail that I would like because my colleagues and I have not reached that point. We have started to pick up examples of where action taken in a particular way has had a dramatic effect to distil common concerns. For example, I am confident that the way that Knowsley council approached this&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC279"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC279</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

identifying where claims were coming from, involving the police appropriately; and looking at how it was tackling concerns about housing repair and so on&#151;provides common threads that we could suggest to all local authorities.
</p>

<a name="51220-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>I am also keen that we start to develop new and different ways that government could support local government, although I do not have them yet. We could talk to colleagues in the Home Office about where the police could best be involved, if appropriate, and look at how the courts are beginning to take this issue seriously&#151;I can think of two prosecutions so far that I have been made aware of through the press, although there may be others. I may be at an earlier stage than the noble Lord would like me to be, but I am clear that we need to find practical ways in which public authorities, in particular, can use their resources to tackle the problem in their communities. That may mean enabling them to work alongside other organisations, to develop individual approaches, or to pick up on some of the broader questions about tackling this raised by the Knowsley experience.
</p>

<a name="51220-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>That is a nebulous answer to a specific question. For me, this is about enabling us to tackle the problem by good example and practice and by using things that we know work, rather than by central government re-inventing the wheel and telling local government what it should do when there are good examples out there. That is what I should like to do in the next few months.
</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="51220-38_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   In the next few months? That is very good news. I hope that if that the Minister and her colleagues felt that some provision could be included in the Bill, which will not complete its passage through Parliament for several months, that she would be willing to consider it. The long title of the Bill states that it is to,


</p>

</ul>

</p>

<a name="51220-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>So the provision is wide enough to allow the Minister to come forward later in the Bill&#039;s progress. Does she have an open mind about suggestions that could be made by people seeking to give effect to the Government&#039;s commitment to bear down on frivolous and vexatious claims?
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="51220-38_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I always have an open mind on these issues. In discussions with other bodies, I have seen nothing that suggests that I need to use legislation to achieve this. It appears to be much more about strong good practice and clarity of message saying that frivolous claims will not be paid out on, so do not bother. That has made the biggest impact in local government. Although I have an open mind, I have seen nothing heading in my direction to add in legislation that we could not probably achieve better outside.

<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="51220-38_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   What I think that the Minister is saying is that if she were persuaded that it would be possible, she would consider it. I am pleased to see her nodding. Those who want the Bill to have greater <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="51220-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral </b>   moved Amendment No. 20:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>After Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_5"></a><br>
&quot;APOLOGIES, OFFERS OF TREATMENT OR OTHER REDRESS

<br>
   An apology or offer of treatment or other redress shall not amount to an admission of negligence.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_80"></a>The noble Lord said: I think that it was Sir Elton John&#151;who is very topical at present&#151;who, with Blue, sang,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;Sorry seems to be the hardest word&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>The amendment is intended to provoke a change in culture. It embodies the idea that an apology, an offer of rehabilitation, should not be treated as an admission of negligence. Arguably, that could lead to the biggest cultural change of all. In countless instances where something unpleasant has happened to someone, his or her main concerns are getting better quickly, receiving an appropriate apology and ensuring that the necessary lessons are learnt so that what happens to him or her will not happen to others. That is the antithesis of the compensation culture. The thinking behind the amendment also dovetails perfectly with the concept behind the NHS Redress Bill, as well as offering the opportunity to make serious progress on the important question of rehabilitation, which we all want.
</p>

<a name="51220-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>An apology can be enormously important and significant to someone who has been injured, especially psychologically, but the present system scares people off from making an apology. There is a reluctance to apologise, for fear that an apology will be perceived as an implied acceptance of liability&#151;that if someone has said sorry or words to that effect a claimant will subsequently be able to argue that such an apology amounted to an admission that can be relied on. First, I refer to the Better Regulation Task Force report of last year. At page 7, it states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;An apology can go a long way. We need to move away from the situation where an apology is seen as an admittance of liability. In a survey commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer in 2002, 34 per cent of respondents who have been affected by medical injury wanted an apology or an explanation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>The Minister will probably say, &quot;I agree, but I do not agree to the amendment&quot;. Why do we need the amendment? Despite what the noble Lord, the Lord Chairman, may from time to time say to me about my overindulgence in decided cases, there is a number of such cases. In <i>Mary Ann Slack</i> v <i>Rotherham General Hospital NHS Trust</i>, the claimant tried to use in evidence the fact that she said that the defendant&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC281"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC281</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

employee had said sorry. Citing the case on 9 October, the statement made on the half of the claimant concludes:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;on this account, she apologised for it and accepted responsibility for what had happened&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>The counter was that there was no apology because there was nothing to apologise for. So there was an unseemly dispute before the court about whether an apology amounted to an admission of liability.
</p>

<a name="51220-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>In a similar case, <i>Kay Sheldon</i> v <i>East Norfolk Health Authority</i>, on 1 August 2000, the point was made, as it is in so many cases in assessing the prognosis that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;The claimant was greatly distressed by the absence of an apology by the defendant&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>This is not just a whimsical point. In some cases, a claimant to whom an apology has been made can cite that as another substantive illustration of how they have been badly treated, which can exacerbate a claim. In the Sheldon case, the claimant&#039;s psychiatric illness had been misdiagnosed, it was alleged, by the defendant, but it was made clear that her recovery had been delayed by the absence of an apology.
</p>

<a name="51220-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>The course of justice would run much more smoothly if people could just say sorry without any consequences. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="51220-39_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Greenway: </b>   My name is attached to the amendment, but I come to it from a slightly different tack than my noble friend Lord Hunt. To make an apology is the perfectly normal, gentlemanly and natural thing to do on the spur of the moment. If one reacts with that speed, that should not later be taken as an admission of negligence.
</p>

<a name="51220-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>I return to yachting. Even when you are with friends and you know a crew well and an accident happens, you can say sorry. Often, things are happening so fast that you have time to do nothing else and things carry on. I cite another case, <i>Richards</i> v <i>Wanstall</i>, on 10 April 1995, where the owner of a small, 20 foot racing yacht was sued by one of the experienced crew members after leaving the marina. The skipper realised that the yacht had been caught by a gust of wind and could have hit a yacht moored nearby and asked an experienced adult crew member to run forward with a fender. The crew member stumbled going forward and, three months later, successfully sued the skipper for damages, claiming that he had injured his leg. After a five-day trial, the court found the skipper liable on the grounds that a reasonably careful skipper should have pre-briefed the crew on that manoeuvre and had a crew member pre-placed.
</p>

<a name="51220-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>I can tell the Committee that things do not work like that in sailing. Racing yachts&#151;it was a racing yacht&#151;go in and out of marinas all the time. In my opinion, an experienced crew would not need asking by the skipper; they would see what was happening and automatically run to do it themselves. Needless to say, that has caused great consternation in the yachting fraternity. Yachting is a rough and tumble sport. Indeed, a friend of mine has just had half of his jaw replaced, but it was his own yacht so he could not sue anyone. The record of the case does not state whether <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC282"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC282</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the skipper said sorry at the time. I often wonder whether, if he had said sorry, the five-day trial might have found the skipper negligent after only one or two days. The Bill should state that an apology or an offer of treatment is not necessarily an admission of negligence.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="51220-39_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   I support the amendment; it is extremely sensible. There is certainly a public perception that you should not say sorry, especially after a bump in a car or something like that, because it immediately prejudices your case and will be the first thing that the insurance company will worry about. If we are told that it does not matter whether or not you say sorry&#151;as we probably will be&#151;why do we not state that clearly in the Bill? We are trying to make some declaratory statements at the start of it to ensure that people understand the current law.
</p>

<a name="51220-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>On the other hand, if saying sorry makes you liable, we should change the law because, in that case, the law is an ass, because that is the natural thing that the civilised community say, and it will often stop something escalating. I recommend the words of Elizabeth France, who is head of the telecoms ombudsman Otelo, which is an alternative dispute resolution service. I remember her saying in her annual report that a lot of the time the cases are just a misunderstanding between one company and a subscriber and often just a small discount&#151;as she put it, the equivalent of a bunch of flowers&#151;will put everything straight. The person will be pleased as punch, happy with the decision and the whole, expensive procedure need not have been started at all if only someone at the beginning had just said, &quot;I am terribly sorry. We may be in the right, but you clearly misunderstood and here is the equivalent of a bunch of flowers&quot;. We should have that in any civilised society, and we should have it in the Bill because that would clear up the situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="51220-39_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I entirely agree with the spirit of the amendment. Indeed, I record my thanks to the staff at Clapham Junction station who, last time that an incident occurred, for the first time that I have ever heard said, &quot;We apologise for the inconvenience that this will cause you&quot;, rather than that horrible phrase, &quot;this may cause you&quot;, which I really hate hearing.
</p>

<a name="51220-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>It is important to consider in what form an apology must be to be effective. If my car runs in to that of my noble friend Lord Erroll and I go round to his window and say, &quot;I am terribly, terribly sorry. I was listening to the match on my phone and Chelsea just scored a goal&quot;, I think that he would be seriously upset if the new clause were in the Bill. Just because that is an apology, why should he not be able to take as evidence the facts of what I was doing? I might not repeat it when I realise the consequences. On the other hand, if you get an apology that is just, &quot;I am sorry&quot;, followed by a list of exculpations&#151;the reasons why they are not liable&#151;you would be even more upset than if you had not received an apology. You must receive an apology that says, &quot;I am sorry&quot; and then has something by way <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC283"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC283</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of elucidation or explanation that gives an understanding of what has happened if it is to be accepted as an apology.
</p>

<a name="51220-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>Take the case of my cousin, whose wife died of an infection acquired in hospital. What could that hospital have said? Sorry would have been wonderful, and the fact that it has never said sorry is a great cause of anguish. To say, as might have been appropriate, &quot;We did not notice. She seemed all right to us. These symptoms could have been something else; that was the judgment that the doctor made and it is terrible that it turned out to be something else&quot;, would be a proper apology. But how could one do that without opening oneself up to an admission of negligence? I do not know the answer; I should be delighted if the noble Baroness does.

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="51220-40_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Lucas has hit the proverbial on the head about the problem that the new clause would create. However, I start by saying that I completely agree with the sentiments that underlie what noble Lords seek. Especially in the last example given by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, one of the great things about the NHS Redress Bill that I know that colleagues in the Department of Health are keen to ensure happens properly is that it will provide redress in its widest form, including apologies. From my experience as chair of a health authority, what people often wanted was someone to say, &quot;I am really sorry&quot;. That would have made a huge difference.
</p>

<a name="51220-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>The stress and anguish that is caused in some circumstances is to a degree relieved if someone says, &quot;I am really sorry&quot;. The difficulty with translating that strong sentiment and desire for people to be sorry that something happened&#151;not to say that it is their fault, but to say that they are sorry&#151;is that it is very difficult to put into law. The danger of the amendment is that it does exactly what the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said. If you said to someone, &quot;I am really sorry that I ran into the back of your car; I was listening to the cricket; it is entirely my fault&quot;, that would not be allowed in evidence. It surely must be.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="51220-40_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   The amendment does not say that an admission of guilt after saying sorry will be ignored. The example of running into the back of someone&#039;s car is a bad one, because one may well then blurt on that one was listening to the Test match, or something idiotic like that. That is an admission of guilt. I am thinking more about someone, let us say, twisting his ankle on a step in a park somewhere and the owner of the park says, &quot;Oh, gosh, I am sorry&quot;. This step is there, and there will be a huge issue about whether the owner of the park is liable for the step or for a pothole which has grown over a while. There are lots of instances where a little word of sorry may well sort out the matter where there is not really a huge liability issue. There is a huge difference between the two things.

<a name="51220-40_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I can understand what the noble Earl wants the amendment to do, but I must tell him what it will actually do. The difficulty is that it would mean that, even if you have in the apology a clear admission of fault, it would not be allowed under the amendment. That is the reality of the way in which the amendment would work. I agree with what noble Lords are seeking to do, which is saying that we need to move to a position where saying you are sorry for something is not saying, &quot;Therefore I am guilty&quot;. I have some difficulties, and noble Lords will appreciate that in every Bill one wishes to see things in legislation that frankly I cannot see a way of putting in because they do not really belong there. The noble Earl is seeking to create almost a cultural shift of people with feeling able to apologise and not feeling that is a relevant factor in a case. My understanding is that it is not, but if the apology included, &quot;I ran into the back of your car because I was listening to the cricket&quot;, it should be, because you have said that it is your fault. Anyone who has been on the receiving end of, say, a motor accident where someone has clearly been at fault and says so is probably mightily relieved that at least the person has admitted it so he can move on with the rest of his life.
</p>

<a name="51220-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>One of the areas where this will be addressed, and where this will be of huge benefit, is in the NHS, where in so many cases it would have made a really big difference, even where it is not a case of someone having suffered terribly, but, in a sense, it has been a contributory factor. People have felt that no one admitting anything, or just saying sorry that it happened, has been a really big issue. I am not disagreeing with the noble Earl; it is just unfortunate that it does not quite work in the law in the way in which the noble Earl would wish. I would not want to rule out those apologies that go alongside the, &quot;It was my fault, I will sort it&quot; statement, which would be covered by the amendment, unfortunately.

However, I believe that because of the way in which the NHS Redress Bill is set out, it would not be appropriate to read across. It is the way in which the Bill will be implemented that will be affected in this way. But I have not read the NHS Redress Bill for a while, so it may be a mistake on my part&#151;and I suppose that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will get it before me. Ah, he has handed me a copy!

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;The big lesson from public consultations is that what the public frequently demand is not direct personal compensation. They want to know that, where something has gone wrong, lessons have been learnt and that the same mistake won&#039;t be made in the future to someone else. So, wherever possible, we want claims settled informally and quickly, without going to court&quot;.</p>

I believe that to be the case, and look forward to hearing about the other steps that will be contained in this reform package because the Minister has already acknowledged that this is but the start and that there is more to come.

<a name="51220-41_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral </b>   moved Amendment No. 21:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>After Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_6"></a><br>
&quot;APPLICATION OF SECTION 1 TO OCCUPIERS&#039; LIABILITY ACT 1957

<br>
   Section 1 applies with the necessary modifications to the standard of care required of an occupier of premises under the Occupiers&#039; Liability Act 1957 (c. 31).&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_99"></a>The noble Lord said: It might be for the convenience of the Committee if we took Amendment No. 22 with Amendment No. 21. This is the first of the specific examples when breach of statutory duty needs to be addressed by Clause 1. I recall the Minister making the general point that there is a whole number of statutory duties to which Clause 1 should not apply&#151;and I seem to recall that child protection, or something similar, was instanced. Of course, I could not agree more with that. What I seek to do now is to respond to the Minister&#039;s point and bring forward specific examples.
</p>

<a name="51220-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The Occupiers&#039; Liability Act 1957 imposes a duty to take suitable care of lawful visitors to land or premises. That Act was passed to amend and codify the common law duties of occupiers to certain persons who came upon their land. The common law distinguished between invitees, in whose visit the occupier had some material interest, and licensees, who came simply by express or implied permission. Different duties were owed to each class. The Act, on the recommendation of the Law Reform Committee, amalgamated the two common law categories designating the combined class as &quot;visitors&quot; and provided that all visitors should be owed a common duty of care.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC287"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC287</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>Although judicial views have been expressed to the contrary, it is clear from the wording of the statute that this is not simply a common law duty. It will replace the otherwise existing common law duty. Therefore, a provision relating solely to negligence&#151;here I return to the point that I made at the outset of Committee stage&#151;would not catch the liability of occupiers to lawful visitors. That would be a nonsense. Referring briefly to Tomlinson, the minority view was that a claimant had to be seen as a lawful visitor to land and therefore that the duty under the 1957 Act had to be considered. If reference is not made to that Act in the Compensation Bill, no party or court will be able to apply the terms and intention of this clause to a claim framed in terms of a breach of statutory duty&#151;as it was framed in Tomlinson.
</p>

<a name="51220-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>Noble Lords may recall my previous reference to the case of <i>Herrington</i> v <i>British Railways Board</i>, which gave rise to the 1984 Act. Therefore Amendment No. 22 offers a wider position, this time on the Occupiers&#039; Liability Act 1984, to that previously raised in connection with the commission of criminal activity. Again, it would import an equivalent to qualify the statutory duty. In Tomlinson the majority view was that, within the terms of the 1984 Act, the claimant was a trespasser. The claimant argued that there had been a breach of the statutory duty owed to him as a trespasser. The clause as currently drafted applies only to claims arising from negligence and thus would not have allowed the defendant in Tomlinson to argue that because it was providing a desirable activity, it should be able to rely on this clause.
</p>

<a name="51220-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>I turn to the whole question of footpath users who are neither visitors nor trespassers because they are there under licence. The situation is not simple, but to apply Clause 1 only to negligence and not to breaches of statutory duties is a step in the wrong direction. I beg to move.

<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_7"></a><br>
&quot;IMPACT OF NEGLIGENCE ON THE COMMUNITY

<br>
   The court shall take into account any adverse consequence to the community of a finding of negligence.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_105"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak to the amendment, if only to hear what the Minister has to say. Where negligence is found in any case it can profoundly affect any community in relation to sporting or recreational activities taking place. In the main instance it deters would-be volunteers who are frightfully important in the scheme of things in relation to recreation.
</p>

<a name="51220-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>Perhaps I may refer to one incident that was settled out of court. Had it gone to court and the person in question had been found negligent it would have had a bearing. It relates to a British Canoe Union 30-mile race down a river, which involved a narrow half-mile long cutting. A volunteer marshal was positioned at each end to warn crews entering it about any powered craft that could present a danger. A powered boat entered the cutting and four minutes later a kayak arrived travelling in the same direction. The marshal allowed it to enter on the strict understanding that there was a powered craft in the cutting and that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC289"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC289</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

crew should not try to overtake it. They ignored the instruction and overtook the boat, causing damage to it.
</p>

<a name="51220-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>A negligence claim was made against the volunteer marshal, alleging that he should have assumed that the crew would ignore his instruction and that, therefore, he was negligent. That seems to me to be a strange case to bring. Anyway, it was settled out of court on legal advice, but the volunteer, needless to say, will not be offering his services again. There is another adverse effect on people who organise local races and so on: their insurance costs go up, which is another reason for the amendment. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="51220-41_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I would just like to come back to the general question of how we enable people to make it clear that anything someone does is at that person&#039;s own risk. There is no way a marshal can restrain someone from going in. Have they always got to say &quot;No&quot;, or are they allowed to assume that a person will act responsibly? This seems to me to be a typical case. As we said the last time we discussed this, where you are dealing with adults and where the adult can take a reasonable view of the risks involved, and there is not some hidden danger that they do not know of that would require them to be prevented from undertaking something, it should be absolutely clear that if someone proceeds at their own risk that is a reasonable thing for a person in charge of an event to allow. I just do not know how it can be done, and if the noble Baroness has any views on that I would love to hear them.

<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="51220-42_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The courts are quite good at sorting out many of these issues. It is always very difficult for me to look at individual cases, as the noble Lord will accept. Speaking in general terms, the courts are very capable of determining the circumstances and taking into account all the different factors.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>I completely accept what the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, was saying about the importance of volunteers. The work that we are doing with the Home Office is particularly focused on ensuring that we get the right number of volunteers and they are not deterred by the compensation culture. The latest figure that we heard was that something like 25 per cent of people who might have thought about volunteering raised it as an issue. I have no idea how prompted they were to raise it, but none the less it is a startling figure. It is important that we equip volunteers with the confidence as much as anything that in the circumstances in which they operate&#151;provided they operate effectively, properly and with due care&#151;they will be treated properly and not be found wanting, if that is not appropriate.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>There is another side to this. We are back to my see-saws. On the other hand, particularly with children and young people, you have to ensure that the quality of the support they get when taking on activities that may be &quot;risky&quot; is adequate to ensure that they are not put at undue risk. That balance is important. Just as I have always believed that it is important that in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC290"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC290</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Bill we make it clear that we want people to participate in activities and we want to support volunteers, the quickest way to prevent people not participating is to move in the other direction and say, &quot;We are not going to have any liability so it does not matter what you do&quot;. I am not suggesting that anyone is saying that, but there is again a balancing act there. If I take off my ministerial hat and put on my mother hat, my daughter and my son participate in all kinds of things, but I know that the quality of the care and support that they get is appropriate. It does not mean that nothing will ever happen, but it does mean that when they are sailing or doing other activities they are guaranteed a high level of expertise, experience and quality from the instructors, and I can feel comfortable in them doing those activities. That is the balancing act that we are trying to achieve.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>The difficulty with the amendment is that effectively we are saying that when you have taken all the factors into account and determined that someone is liable, you can then add on at the end another factor that says, &quot;Ah, but would this have a detrimental effect on the community?&quot;. There are two problems with that. First, if someone has been found liable, we have someone who needs support or help who has been a victim, and their ability to get redress has been reduced or negated by another factor, which is not right. Secondly, it could have an effect that I am sure is not wanted, which is about making sure that activities that have a major impact on the community are properly insured, because insurance plays an important part.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>I do not want to do anything in the Bill that might push us in that other direction of encouraging people to act less responsibly. I am keen to recognise that organisations, individuals and volunteers behave responsibly, and we should support them and give them confidence. I do not want to do anything that might push us in another direction; I am not saying that it would but I would not want anything that might do so. My difficulty with the amendment is those two things: first, that it could push us in that direction; and, secondly, that it would be something to be taken into account after someone has been found liable. These are rare cases; but they do happen. Occasionally we see cases where, frankly, an organisation or individual has behaved extraordinary badly towards another, and that individual has suffered as a consequence. The courts must have the capacity to say, &quot;You are liable; you must make redress&quot;. I do not want to do anything to affect that.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>So on that basis, while I understand the underlying principles of what the noble Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord Lucas, are seeking to do, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="51220-42_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Greenway: </b>   I have listened with interest to what the Minister said, and will read it again&#151;but there is no doubt that what has happened has had a serious impact on would-be volunteers. For example, many Sea Cadets no longer sail on the sea, because it is considered too dangerous. That to me is a great sadness. Also, the second biggest teaching union has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC291"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC291</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

advised teachers not to participate in school trips. Even in the teaching profession, volunteers are involved&#151;and that can have a big effect.
</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="51220-42_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   One thing that we have been doing with our colleagues in education is checking on that issue. There is no evidence of any school trips being cancelled anywhere in the country as a consequence of these issues. The noble Lord will rightly come back to me and say, &quot;Yes, but what you don&#039;t know about are the trips that have never been started&quot;&#151;and I accept that that is an issue. But we have been careful in talking to schools to ensure that we are up-to-date with information about any trips that might be cancelled.

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="51220-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Greenway: </b>   I accept that from the Minister, and thank her for it. I do not want to press this. I was guilty of being a highly inexperienced volunteer many years ago, when I had only just arrived in Australia by a matter of weeks. I found myself being a marshal in some sort of riding event&#151;and horses and sailors do not mix. I was stuck in the middle of a dry river creek miles from anywhere, and spent the whole afternoon, during which I saw about half a dozen horses go past, thinking that there was a tigersnake hiding under every stone around me. It was a terrifying experience, in more ways than one! Volunteers are not always experienced, unfortunately, and we have to take that into account.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>The noble Lord said: We now move to Part 2 of the Bill&#151;and, in particular, Clause 2 and the provision of regulated claims management services. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if we discussed with Amendment No. 26 Amendments Nos. 32, 33 and 70.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>We rehearsed at Second Reading the background to claims management services in this context. Noble Lords may recall that the history of this lies with the move by the Government virtually to abolish civil legal aid and to set up a structure that has come to be know as &quot;no win, no fee&quot;, allowing conditional fee agreements to take the place of the previous system of civil legal aid, which was run by the Law Society through local legal aid boards. Of course, a gap was created which was quickly filled by claims management companies.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>The amendment tackles the problem in the Bill that there appear to be regulated and unregulated services. If one removes the word &quot;regulated&quot;, as the amendment seeks to do, Clause 2(1) would read:

</p>

<a name="51220-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>The present position is most unsatisfactory. The president of the Chartered Insurance Institute, Mr Peter Hales, earlier this month launched a bitter attack against claims management firms, branding them &quot;a national disgrace&quot; and blaming them for,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;the surge in unjust and vexatious complaints against life offices and advisers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The history of the matter, of course, goes back even further to when claims management firms came into the personal injury arena. The Committee will recall the television advertisement, &quot;Where there is blame there&#039;s a claim and it won&#039;t cost you a penny&quot;, which was launched on our TV screens. A whole range of advertisements appeared, mainly from organisations which were challenged in the civil courts on the amount of recompense they were seeking. The model that was represented by those claims management companies was found to be faulty. As a result of successful legal challenges, the initial wave of claims management companies such as Claims Direct&#151;I am not referring to New Claims Direct but to the former Claims Direct&#151;and The Accident Group eventually went into liquidation.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>However, there is a whole range of other claims management companies. This is a serious and urgent problem. The companies and individuals involved will try to avoid regulation wherever possible. In later debates we shall discuss the ways in which they intend to do that. I just give one example for the moment. At Second Reading the Minister said that she intended to exempt trade unions. We shall no doubt debate that at some stage. I have heard of one claims management company which is forming a trade union, having heard that trade unions may be exempted. In drawing up this legislation, we must be wary of allowing any loopholes to exist which undoubtedly would be exploited to the full.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>My contention in this amendment is that there must be a uniform standard and no gaps in the regulation. A Bill that sets up two regimes does not appear to achieve that. I point out to the Minister that there are two regimes here as the word &quot;regulated&quot; means that some people can run claims management services that are unregulated in addition to those running regulated ones.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>I contend that consumer protection is paramount. The regulatory framework must be robust and must deliver a regulator who has independence, impartiality and integrity. I recall that the Arculus report of the Better Regulation Task Force had as its very first recommendation that claims management companies should first try to move towards self-regulation, but that if by the end of 2005 progress was not made,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;the Department for Constitutional Affairs should step in and regulate the sector&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="51220-42_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>Many examples were given of how claims management companies had stepped into the gap left by the access to justice reforms. The Arculus report states on page 21 that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;the Access to Justice reforms shifted the burden of funding personal injury claims from the public to the private sector . . . This change . . . created the conditions for a rapid growth in the claims management sector&quot;.</p>

<a name="51220-42_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>The history is that the,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;sector was characterised by hard-sell advertising and direct-marketing which encouraged people, in effect, to &#039;have a go&#039; . . . Ultimately the whole sector was brought into disrepute&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-42_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>Further from Arculus at page 21,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;culminated in the demise of market leaders: The Accident Group and Claims Direct&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-42_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>However, there is a danger that the demise of these companies will lead to the possible emergence of many one-man bands. Therefore we are dealing to some extent with a moving target. That is why it is so important to set out in the Bill exactly what is proposed.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>That brings me to the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and I at Second Reading; namely, the 7th report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. It had some critical words to say about the Compensation Bill. After setting out the detail, the report concluded that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;In our opinion it is inappropriate that so many key features are here proposed to be left to delegated legislation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-42_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>At Second Reading the noble Baroness said that she intended to fulfil the expectations of the 7th report and to bring forward a series of recommendations. I hope that we shall hear more about those during the course of this and subsequent debates on the various amendments.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The advertisements continue. Perhaps I may give a further example of what is happening, and happening so fast that the position keeps changing. I refer to the activities of those who are seeking to absorb into their client list people suffering an endowment shortfall. Under the existing system, the individual has a procedure which can be followed that is completely free of charge. If they feel that they have been mis-sold an endowment policy and as a result will suffer a shortfall in the sum available to repay the mortgage at the key moment, they are entitled to bring forward a claim. Through the FSA and the ombudsman a procedure is in place for such a claim to be dealt with speedily and at no cost at all.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>Lo and behold, claims management companies have leapt into this arena. I have before me two examples of comparatively recent advertisements from two organisations that make no reference to the fact that a free service is available. I could cite many others. One advertisement states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;Relax. Getting your endowment back on track is easy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-42_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The advertisement copy states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;Keypoint Endowment Claims have a proven track record of helping thousands of people receive millions in compensation. One phone call is all it takes to get started, so get in touch today&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC294"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC294</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-42_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Another organisation states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;Endowment Compensation Assistance [ECA]. If you&#039;ve received notification from your endowment company that there is a high risk your policy will not pay out the target amount you are strongly recommended to take action now. You most likely qualify for compensation. At ECA our dedicated team of specialists know the claims procedure inside out, so don&#039;t delay, act today&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-42_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>Little boxes cover this advertisement saying &quot;genuine no win-no fee!&quot;, with a free phone number.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>On further investigation, it becomes clear that what is widely advertised as a windfall is actually, of course, a shortfall. But by the intervention of claims management companies in this vital arena, every shortfall of necessity now remains a shortfall because the company takes a fee of up to 25 per cent plus VAT that comes out of the compensation which, as we know, comes out of the resources of the policyholders. So the consumer is losing in every possible way. Many people are very concerned about what is happening. As Mr Hales pointed out, it is a national scandal.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>As the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee recommended, there is an urgent need to do something in the Bill. That committee made specific recommendations, pointing out that the regulatory structure was not known; nor was it known who was to be the regulator. The Minister helpfully explained to us at Second Reading:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;We want to be flexible about the regulator . . . and we have commissioned an independent expert to help us with that&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-42_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>She continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;the final decision on what we do will be informed by that expert advice. I am advised that the report will be with me before Christmas, and as soon as I am able to give your Lordships information about that, I will do so&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 28/11/05; col. 98.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-42_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will seize the opportunity of this first debate to give us much more information about what she proposes.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>The Minister is supported not only by this Committee, but by a range of outside organisations, which see that the time has come for effective, impartial, independent and quick statutory regulation. The Law Society, which regulates the solicitors who handle conditional fee agreements, has welcomed the overall aim of the Bill to introduce regulation to the unregulated claims market and states that it has long been an advocate of the need to regulate claims handlers to protect the public. It refers to the ample evidence over the past few years of abuses in the market and the need to provide consumer protection.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The Arculus report pointed out that a number of other attempts were being made to regulate the sector. It referred to the Claims Standards Federation as the governing body of the claims management industry. However, not all the companies joined the federation and there was unwillingness to support it financially. The Claims Standards Council then emerged, which has sought to introduce a range of safeguards for the public, but when it gave evidence to the all-party group it had to confess that it had not been able to persuade the membership to take regulation as seriously as it should be taken, so self-regulation was not possible.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC295"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC295</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220-42_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>In its report on Part 2 of the Bill, the all-party group strongly supported the Government&#039;s move to regulate the sector. It said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;If the government wants the CSC to be the new regulator it should say so now. We think the better option is to create a new statutory body in the Bill and provide the resources needed for it to succeed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-42_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>It continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;We need to speed up the timetable for the commencement of the new regime to&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<a name="51220-42_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>So there is a very serious situation and I hope that the Minister will come forward with some clear proposals for the Committee so that immediate action can be taken. However, the regulations envisaged do not address a number of vital consumer protection measures, such as the financial security of regulated companies and individuals, the control of advertising and systems for handling client money. I say that although we have not yet seen the regulations and I can only go on what the Minister has told us about them. If they do not address these vital consumer protection measures, they will be inadequate.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The timescale envisaged by the Government causes serious concern, especially in the context of companies making millions out of endowment mis-selling claims when there is a free service available. I hope that the Minister is going to give us chapter and verse on exactly what the Government are going to do. Looking back, this problem arose out of the Government&#039;s wish to move from civil legal aid to conditional fee agreements. In many ways, there has been a lack of action until now, so the Minister has a wonderful opportunity to satisfy the Committee that the Government take this situation seriously and that they are prepared to take immediate action to control this abuse.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>I have already shared with the Minister ways in which I think the Financial Services Authority could move swiftly to do something about some of the more glaring examples of abuse. I have also shared with her the need to see the Law Society dealing more effectively with abuse by firms of solicitors, in particular in failing to make clear that there is a free service available. I have also shared with the Minister a number of examples of firms where, although they are regulated by the Law Society, there seems to be evidence that they have moved into the endowment mis-selling market and are not making it sufficiently clear to individuals that a free service is available.
</p>

<a name="51220-42_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>In conclusion, I am greatly troubled by the way in which a number of companies have moved into this market and are causing further misery to individuals who have already suffered loss or injury and who have a valid claim. However, there are claims management companies that are performing a good service and looking after people to their best of their ability, and I have seen some of them in the run-up to this debate. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC296"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC296</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

But from all that I can diagnose, they are in the minority. Sadly, the majority of these companies, some of which are very small and do not have resources, have suddenly found a honey-pot. It was explained to me by an outside observer that it is almost as if they have suddenly discovered an easy way to win the lottery. Millions of pounds of valid short-fall claims are finding a route into the bank accounts of the individuals who are running these companies. That situation cannot be allowed to continue for one moment longer. I hope the Minister will give us reassurance about the action that the Government are now determined to take. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="51220-43_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for setting out so well the issues that concern not only him, but all Members of the Committee and the Government. That is why we have introduced this Bill into your Lordships&#039; House and wish to see it on its way as swiftly as possible to enable us to make the regulations and to deal with this problem.
</p>

<a name="51220-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>Let me try to address the principle of the way that we have approached it, which I hope will go some way to allay the fears expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, about the way that the Bill is set out. We want to avoid loopholes in the regulation that can be exploited by claims farmers. The noble Lord was alluding to, if not specifically saying, that some of them are very good at reinventing themselves. But we want to ensure that the response we give to this and the approach that we take is proportionate so that we do not impose unnecessary burdens on those who operate legitimately.
</p>

<a name="51220-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>We have approached this legislation by defining claims management services as widely as possible but regulate only those services that are prescribed by order. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that we want to get these regulations in place as swiftly as possible. Speaking of the fact that claims companies frequently reinvent themselves, I am grateful that the noble Lord has raised the question of a company trying to establish itself as a trade union. We cannot find it if it is trying to do that, but we are pretty certain that a claims management company would find it very difficult to meet the criterion in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 to enable them to become a trade union and therefore escape authorisation. We will consider, for the purposes of exemptions under the Bill, with the certification officer, adding a condition that when we exempt trade unions that will apply only to those who have been accepted on the certification officer&#039;s list. Noble Lords will know that trade unions can voluntarily have their names added to the list held by a certification office. We hope that that will go all the way to preventing the reinvention of claims companies in this way, and I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising that with me.
</p>

<a name="51220-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee looked at this aspect of what we were trying to do and said in their report of 24 November:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;It is for the House to decide whether or not the definition in the bill of &quot;claims management services&quot; is appropriate but it seems to us acceptable for the bill to set the outer limits and for subordinate <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_GC297"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC297</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>legislation to designate services within those limits. This is similar to a provision in section 22 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and would enable the Secretary of State to target areas which he considers are from time to time at a particularly high risk (paragraph 20 of the Explanatory Notes). But it is relevant to consideration of other provisions of the bill that all services within the definitions of &quot;claims management services&quot; may be brought within regulation by an order&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>So we believe that we have fulfilled the spirit of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, rightly pointed out, I made it very clear during Second Reading that I intend, as always, to deal with all of the issues that that committee raised and to make amendments appropriately.
</p>

<a name="51220-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>So our principle is to take the breadth and regulate down so that we are very clear as well that as new issues arise we can use regulation to tackle them appropriately, which I believe answers the points that the noble Lord rightly raised regarding how we ensure that we act swiftly when these situations occur and when companies move in, as they did on the question of endowment mortgages. We saw a flurry of activity there and the noble Lord read out the advertisements in that context. The particular order clause would be Clause 2(2)(e) and we hope that that approach will be effective.
</p>

<a name="51220-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>In terms of who the regulator will be, I did indeed say that we would have the report by Christmas. I was very tempted to say that we would have it shortly, but I fear that I have overdone that word already in this Committee. I will have it on Thursday, so I suspect that my Christmas reading sack, which is growing ever larger, will include that report and of course I will ensure that the Committee understands what the report suggests to me.
</p>

<a name="51220-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>In later amendments we will look at how we plan to set up the regulator. The only thing that I would say in advance of that is that I am very keen that we do not find ourselves unable to be flexible for two reasons&#151;first, to make sure that we can respond appropriately and put a regulator in place, and secondly that we can respond to changes, so that if we find a new area that we had not anticipated where we wished to regulate, or that the market changes, which is always a possibility, we have flexibility around a regulator.
</p>

<a name="51220-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>The noble Lord raised the question of advertising. I think I mentioned on Second Reading that we have a piece of research currently going on with the Advertising Standards Authority. I believe that I have watched all of the TV advertisements that we are discussing. From 2004 the authority has received about 20 complaints about advertisements from firms offering to help consumers make compensation claims as a result of endowment shortfalls, which is a particular concern. It is our ambition to work with the ASA to make sure that within its own regulatory framework it is able to deal with questions that are particularly pertinent in this area. But I beg the Committee&#039;s indulgence in that we need to do the research first to establish whether the Advertising Standards Authority thinks there is more to be done <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC298"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC298</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and whether it is able to do that within its own framework. I will, of course, come back to the Committee as we get more information about that.
</p>

<a name="51220-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I agree with the noble Lord that in dealing with some of the worst abuses it is very important that marketing practices such as advertising, cold calling, contract terms and credit arrangements should be properly regulated. As the noble Lord said, some of the most vulnerable people have been preyed on to capture their claims, with all the consequences that he identified. Where charges are levied, they have to be fair, reasonable, transparent and proportionate to the work involved. We trust that consumer safeguards will be delivered via the regulator&#039;s rules governing authorised persons&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, indicated, there has been a distinct absence of high standards in the sector&#151;or through general fair trading laws and codes. The source of the protection is not important; what matters is that the consumer is protected. We need to make sure that we deal with that appropriately.
</p>

<a name="51220-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>The noble Lord asked where the regulations would be going. As I have indicated, we start with a wide definition and narrow down. Certainly, we anticipate that the first order will bring within the net personal injury, employment, housing disrepair, criminal injuries compensation and mis-selling of financial products such as endowment policies. That is not an exhaustive list but I wanted to illustrate precisely where we had got to in our thinking within the principles of better regulation.
</p>

<a name="51220-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>I hope that I have addressed the noble Lord&#039;s major concerns about the way in which we have approached this. I agree completely with the noble Lord&#039;s desire to implement measures as swiftly as possible. I refer to the detail of the regulations and where we are as regards the report on the regulator. I accept entirely our need to look at issues such as advertising standards and come back to them as necessary. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="51220-43_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. She referred to the independent expert and the fact that she anticipates his report will be with her on Thursday. However, she stopped short of saying that she would arrange for the report to be made available to Members of the Committee and, indeed, to be published. Would the Minister like to clarify that aspect?

<a name="51220-43_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I did, indeed, stop short as I am not suggesting that is precisely what I am going to do. The report is written for myself and the Lord Chancellor. Of course, I am very keen that the issues within it should be made available to the Committee but I shall not promise to publish the report because it was not written on that basis and it would be inappropriate to do so. However, I believe the noble Lord will accept&#151;I say this in my usual open manner&#151;that I will make available the conclusions of that report and information that is relevant to the Committee. I do not know whether there is anything <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51220-44_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I, of course, recognise that commercially confidential information could not possibly be disclosed. But if one excludes that and accepts that the Minister has every right to exclude that, will she please assure the Committee that she will make as much of the report available to Members of the Committee as possible? We will then be better informed as we reach the later debates on the regulation of claims management companies.
</p>

<a name="51220-44_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I would not even have mentioned the report if I was not going to make as much of it available as possible. The noble Lord will accept that the basis upon which reports are written is important for those writing them, and I must respect that. But, of course, I am keen to ensure that the Committee is fully <i>au fait </i>with the direction of our thinking, even if we have not yet reached conclusions on the regulator.

</p>




<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="51220-44_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   It may be for the assistance of the Committee also if the Minister were to give a little further detail about her determination to introduce transparent charging and a number of other provisions. She will be aware, particularly so far as concerns the endowment alleged mis-selling scandal, that all the claims will have been processed and the commission taken by these companies within the next 12 to 18 months. It is unlikely that the regulator will be in place by that time.
</p>

<a name="51220-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Will the Minister at least consider whether there is any way that provisions, which would I am sure meet with the agreement of the Committee, on the transparency of charges and a number of other key issues, might be put in the Bill so that they have immediate effect?
</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="51220-44_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The difficulty with legislation in the Bill, as the noble Lord knows better than I, is whether it rules out the flexibility one wishes to have. I have a personal view as a Minister that the more we can do through secondary legislation effectively and properly within the framework, especially of what the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee says, that that enables us to develop the policy over time. The noble Lord will know too that I have a general adverse reaction to lists. My experience in any Bill I have ever done is that the minute we put something in the Bill, lo and behold somebody wants to put something else in it. It grows. We end up losing things that should be there and we leave ourselves in a more inflexible position. I do not <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC300</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

wish to be difficult about this, but that would be a difficulty in trying to think that through. We hope that the regulations will be in place by the end of 2006.
</p>




<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="51220-44_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I thank the Minister for what she said about lists. Thank goodness she is not in charge of the Charities Bill which is full of lists, and needs to be. I accept her aversion to lists. But there are certain fundamental things which should really be taken as read. I welcome her open mind on putting those provisions in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51220-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>Perhaps I may press the noble Baroness further. If these companies were giving financial advice, they would be subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority. It may well be that we can find some way of at least firing a shot across the bows of some of these cowboys by making them aware of their obligations as organisations within the financial services structure. I am not asking her to give any commitment now, but could she indicate she has an open mind on that? It might send a warning signal, particularly if she were to say that the authority will be extended to cover these companies. Although if she cannot say that, that at least as stiff a regulatory structure will be set up as already exists as though they were giving financial advice.
</p>




<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="51220-44_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I cannot give the noble Lord that commitment. I am sure that the noble Lord is not surprised by that. What I can say is that we are currently talking to the Financial Services Authority about exactly these issues, and I will keep the noble Lord updated.
</p>




<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="51220-44_spnew6"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   Could the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission come into this as bodies that could make a reference and consider this emerging and changing market where apparently there are bad practices? One of the difficulties I have is that I listened to my noble friend Lord Hunt telling me about endowment policies. I would love to see a list of bad practices and not just be referred to one. If it really is an unregulated market that is not going to settle down and has to be regulated, some clear idea of the abuses taking place in that market is a fairly essential part of the information which the Committee needs.
</p>




<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="51220-44_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I would be very happy to write to the noble Lord with as much information as I can. I think it is not only the Committee but also the consumer who needs to understand what these practices are. That is one of the issues we have to deal with; hence, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and myself both describing some of these operators deliberately targeting people at a vulnerable time, which makes it more likely for them to fall into their clutches&#151;if I can put it like that. If one looks at the advertisements on endowments, if you are not <i>au fait</i> or feel financially illiterate, which, frankly, covers a large number of the population, it seems a very easy thing to hand the matter over to somebody else and not be aware that the service is available and free.

recognise&#151;hence the way we set it up&#151;that these people move into other areas. Therefore, the ability to be able to capture that area and regulate it very quickly will be a critical part of the achievement of the Bill as we move forward.
</p>




<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="51220-44_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   There is so much to ponder and consider. This has been a very helpful debate in raising some of the more general issues that we will confront in specific examples as we move through Part 2 of the Bill. I would just say to my noble friend Lord Eccles that in many ways the abuses are already documented. They really make people feel that the shortfall, to which they are rightly entitled, is a windfall and fail to ensure they are aware that it is compensation designed to bridge the gap between the endowment policy proceeds and the sum required to pay off the mortgage. By depicting it as a windfall, the companies in question feel that they can legitimately charge up to 25 per cent plus VAT. They fail to make people aware that there is a completely free service where a valid claim is dealt with within eight weeks. A letter needs to be sent giving details and then a cheque arrives within eight weeks. It is a fast procedure set up with the co-operation of the individual companies. It is these abuses which prevent the individual receiving the compensation to which he is rightly entitled to cover that shortfall.
</p>

<a name="51220-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>There are a number of other abuses, not least failing to ensure that the individual is aware of the free service that is available through the Financial Services Ombudsman. There are a number of others. I am sure that he, like me, welcomes the Minister&#039;s commitment to deal effectively with this problem and to write to us with further details. There will be a lot of further debate about this when we return after the Recess, but I think we have made a very good start. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51220-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="51220-44_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Goodhart </b>   moved Amendment No. 27:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a>Page 1, line 18, leave out paragraph (c).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_126"></a>The noble Lord said: I have been sitting here silently for the last five or six hours. Now that we have reached Part 2 the time has come for me to speak again. I should make it absolutely clear that we strongly support the principle of regulation of businesses providing claims management services. There are clearly abuses here which need the firm hand of regulation. We shall do all we can to assist in achieving that result.
</p>

<a name="51220-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>There are a number of matters in the Bill&#151;mainly, though not all of them, of detail&#151;which in our view need explanation or cause some concern. As has already been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform has criticised severely the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51220-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>The Minister said at Second Reading that she will consider how to meet the concerns of the Delegated Powers Committee. I would like to know whether she plans to bring forward any amendments. If so, when <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC302"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC302</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are we likely to see them? If she is not planning to do so, is that not in effect rejecting the proposals of the Select Committee?


</p>

<a name="51220-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>In moving Amendment No. 27 I also wish to speak to Amendments Nos. 68, 69 and 77. This is not among the most important groups of amendments tabled by us. Amendment No. 27 is a probing amendment. The effect of these amendments is to remove all provisions from the Bill that relate to the waiver of authorisation. My question is why is a waiver necessary? Clause 2 provides for a ban on the provision of services unless the provider is authorised or exempt or has received a waiver. The exemption is provided for in Clause 4 and, under subsection (2) of that clause, the exemption can be given,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;by a specified person or a class of person, in specified circumstances, or by a specified person or class of person in specified circumstances&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51220-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>That seems to cover every possibility. Why, then, is it necessary to provide in paragraph 3 of the schedule for waiver as well, and what exactly is the distinction between exemption and waiver? Can it not be left out to make the Bill a little bit simpler so that we stick with two categories of authorisation or exemption? I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="51220-45_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. The amendment would omit the concept of authorisation being waived by the regulator. Our position is that exemptions from the regulatory regime should be very carefully controlled and should not be left to the regulator. This is, I suppose, tied up, in part, with the concept of the regulator needing to be someone entirely independent and sufficiently robust, which the current framework does not yet appear to deliver. Our view is that until we have a clear idea of what kind of regulator we will have, even on an interim basis, we cannot really consider the system of waivers by the regulator without careful checks and controls. Certainly, our preference would be for no waivers and only exemptions by the Lord Chancellor. The Bill does not specify that the regulator should be independent. Without that independence, any system of waivers is open to abuse. That is the last thing we want. In conclusion, I think the whole idea of waivers sends the wrong message, given the conduct of the sector to date.
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="51220-45_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I say to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that I intend to bring amendments forward on Report to deal with all the issues raised by the Delegated Powers Committee, although the last paragraph of the report was indeed critical. When I read it backwards, I found we were happy to address all the points raised. I have not tabled those amendments for Committee stage as I wanted the chance to explore some of the issues in Committee rather than amending the Bill beforehand.
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="51220-45_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   Whether the Minister reads the report backwards or forwards, she will come to the conclusion that the criticism is there and is substantial. Although I recognise that she has now given us a clear commitment to introduce amendments on Report, it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC303"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC303</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

would be very helpful indeed, as we go through January, if she would please allow us to have sight of them&#151;if they are available to her&#151;in good time before Report stage and, if possible, during the Committee stage of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="51220-45_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   Of course. The noble Lord will know from his colleagues who have worked with me that that is precisely what I always do. I always ensure that noble Lords have time. The noble Lord is right that they should be on the record. When I spoke of reading the report backwards, I meant that when one reads something that suggests that the Bill needs work, it is reassuring to read it backwards and to discover that one could meet all the concerns without much difficulty. That is important. I am absolutely clear that we shall do that. I have deliberately left it until Report stage as there may be other issues that might affect those amendments.
</p>

<a name="51220-45_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>I want to meet noble Lords halfway. This is one of those occasions when I have been slightly ministerial, in that I take what the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Hunt, have said very seriously. Noble Lords have both raised the issue&#151;this is not the advice that I have been given, I hasten to add&#151;about having an exemption which, in a sense, is a procedure that is very well laid out through Parliament, as it were, and then a waiver that is given to another body.
<a name="time_11"></a>
<a name="51220-45_time0"></a><h5>5.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51220-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>The only issue on which I have been won over&#151;I want to put this before both noble Lords&#151;is that there is a question of what we might call a temporary waiver, which I think I raised within my letter to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. Where a body is quite clearly going to be exempt, we are concerned that we might miss people as we go through the exemptions. We want to be able to waiver them while waiting for the exemption but it is not clear on the face of the Bill that that is what we mean.
</p>

<a name="51220-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>I undertake to go away and come back with something which says, &quot;In the event of a waiver being used, it is a temporary waiver&quot;. We can discuss very happily with noble Lords the issue of how long that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC304"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column GC304</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

might be for, but its purpose would be not to make somebody operate illegally when it is quite clear that we need to exempt them but have not been able to do so because we have not had time. It is a kind of parliamentary time point. I hope that will meet noble Lords&#039; concerns about this unknown regulator having this power and the concerns in my department that having an absolute removal of the waiver could accidentally have a detrimental affect on certain organisations, which no noble Lord would wish to see.
</p>

<a name="51220-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>I am very happy to come back and discuss this issue. As I say, I am acting in a personal capacity&#151;this is not the advice I received&#151;and I see the point very well. If I come back on that basis, I hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="51220-45_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for what she said about the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the Government&#039;s intention to provide amendments to meet its requirements.
</p>

<a name="51220-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>So far as concerns the main point of this group of amendments&#151;the question of waiver&#151;I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for his support for this proposal. The noble Baroness has gone some way towards satisfying me that there may be a limited need for a waiver but it certainly looks to me as if, to begin with, any power to issue a waiver should be time limited. I would like to see something of that kind in the Bill and some explanation. It is absolutely essential to ensure that the waiver is used only in limited circumstances and does not become a substitute for authorisation. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51220-45_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Anti-social Behaviour Orders</h3>










<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="51220-45_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My right honourable Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety (Ms Hazel Blears) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement:
</p>

<a name="51220-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>I am announcing today statistics relating to Anti-social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs).
</p>

<a name="51220-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>An ASBO is a civil order which protects the community from behaviour that has caused or is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household as the perpetrator.

</p>

<a name="51220-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>ASBOs were introduced under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and have been available since April 1999.
</p>

<a name="51220-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>ASBOs can be issued to anyone aged 10 years or over. They impose restrictions on the behaviour of individuals who have behaved in an anti-social way and protect communities from often long-standing and highly intimidating activity.
</p>

<a name="51220-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>Breach of an ASBO is a criminal offence and can lead to custody. The maximum penalty for breach of an ASBO is five years&#039; imprisonment or a fine of up to &#163;5,000 for an adult offender.
</p>

<a name="51220-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>The Home Office is notified by all courts of ASBOs issued. As I indicated I my Statement on 3 November (cols. <i>WS 52&#150;53</i>), a joint exercise between the Court Service and the Home Office is under way to refine and improve further the collection of this data.
</p>

<a name="51220-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>Data on the number of ASBOs issued are updated quarterly. New figures for the period up to June 2005 are now available. These figures show that for the period between April 1999 and June 2005 the total number of ASBOs issued (as reported to the Home Office) was 6,497. The number of ASBOs issued in the quarter April to June 2005 is 14 per cent of the total number of ASBOs issued over all quarters and represents an increase of 48 per cent on the same quarter last year. However, this represents an increase of 1 per cent on the previous quarter&#039;s figures so the rate of increase is slowing.
</p>

<a name="51220-45_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>Of those ASBOs issued, 54 per cent were to adults and 43 per cent to juveniles (3 per cent of ASBOs are age unknown).
</p>

<a name="51220-45_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>Forty-seven per cent were orders on application and 53 per cent were orders on conviction.
</p>

<a name="51220-45_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>I have placed with the Libraries of both Houses a briefing note containing information about ASBOs and the ASBOs statistics issued today.

<a name="51220-46_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Armed Forces: Skynet 5</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="51220-46_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51220-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>I am pleased to announce that we have been able to agree to a change to the already successful Skynet 5 PFI deal, to enable a revised risk mitigation approach to be adopted.
</p>

<a name="51220-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>Rather than relying on space insurance to cover satellite loss in an unpredictable insurance market, as under the original deal the revised approach is built upon increasing the in-orbit constellation. Instead of two satellites in orbit, there will now be three satellites, with a part-built fourth satellite available as a back-up to a satellite loss throughout the satellite launch phase, which ends in late 2008. The MoD requirement will continue to amount to two satellites, which means that an in-orbit spare will be available; delay in building a replacement satellite in the event of a loss would therefore be avoided. Continuous operational capability can therefore be maintained.
</p>

<a name="51220-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>This innovative approach to risk management is fully consistent with the aims of smart acquisition and it shows how a PFI deal can evolve over time, to continue to provide our Armed Forces with the best available capability at the right price.

<a name="51220-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>I am placing in the Libraries of both Houses a copy of a discussion paper, <i>The EU&#039;s contribution to the international response to the 2004 Asian Tsunami: Achievements, next steps and lessons learned</i>.
</p>

<a name="51220-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>The paper has been written by the Department for International Development and the European Commission to inform discussions at a high-level meeting in Brussels on 20 December 2005. The meeting will examine the international humanitarian and reconstruction response to the 26 December 2004 south-east Asian tsunami, with a particular focus on the EU.
</p>

<a name="51220-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>Invited participants include the European Commissioners for Humanitarian Aid and External Relations, representatives of the Council of Ministers, Members of the European Parliament, countries affected by the disaster, the United Nations, international financial institutions, the International Federation of the Red Cross and civil society organisations.
</p>

<a name="51220-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>The paper examines EU activity in three main areas: financial assistance for humanitarian and reconstruction needs; support for peace-building via reconstruction work; and reinforcing preventive measures, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS171"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column WS171</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

early warning and disaster preparedness. The paper highlights a number of issues that continue to influence the effectiveness of aid delivery. These include conflict sensitivity, co-ordination, monitoring, accountability, local ownership, communication, strengthening the humanitarian system, ensuring funds continue to flow, equity in distribution and early warning and disaster preparedness.
</p>

<a name="51220-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>The aim of the meeting is to identify lessons learned from the EU&#039;s response that could guide the international community&#039;s response in the tsunami-affected countries and in other disaster-affected countries in the future.

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="51220-46_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  States party to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) met in Geneva, 5 to 9 December. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss and promote common understanding and effective action on the content, adoption and promulgation of codes of conduct for scientists.
</p>

<a name="51220-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The states party to the BTWC agreed by consensus a politically binding report where, <i>inter alia</i>, states party stressed the need to undertake activities at the national and international levels and recognised the following:
</p>
<ul>
<a name="51220-46_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>while the primary responsibility for implementing the convention rests with states party, codes of conduct, voluntarily adopted, for scientists in the fields relevant to the convention can support the object and purpose of the convention by making a significant and effective contribution, in conjunction with other measures including national legislation, to combating the present and future threats posed by biological and toxin weapons, as well as by raising awareness of the convention, and by helping relevant actors to fulfil their legal, regulatory and professional obligations and ethical principles;


</p>

<a name="51220-46_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>codes of conduct should reflect the provisions of  the convention and contribute to national implementation measures;


</p>

<a name="51220-46_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>a range of different approaches exists to develop codes of conduct in view of differences in national requirements and circumstances;


</p>

<a name="51220-46_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>codes of conduct should avoid impeding scientific discovery, placing undue constraints on research or international cooperation and exchange for peaceful purposes; and


</p>

<a name="51220-46_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>science should be used for peaceful purposes only but has the potential to be misused in ways that are prohibited by the convention, and therefore codes of conduct should require and enable relevant actors to have a clear understanding of the content, purpose and reasonably foreseeable consequences of their activities, and of the need to abide by the obligations contained in the convention.


</p>
</ul>
<a name="51220-46_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>Further, states party recognised that all those with a responsibility for, or legitimate interest in, codes of <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column WS172</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

conduct should be involved in their development, promulgation and adoption and agreed on the value of codes of conduct applying not just to scientists but to all those involved in scientific activity, including managers and technical and ancillary staff.
</p>

<a name="51220-46_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>On the content of codes of conduct, recognising the principles listed above, states party agreed on the importance of codes of conduct being:
</p>
<ul>
<a name="51220-46_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>compatible with national legislation and regulatory controls and contributing to national implementation measures;


</p>

<a name="51220-46_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>simple, clear and easily understandable both to       scientists and to wider civil society;


</p>

<a name="51220-46_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>relevant, helpful and effective for guiding relevant       actors in making decisions and taking action in       accordance with the purposes and objectives of       the convention;


</p>

<a name="51220-46_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>sufficiently broad in scope; and


</p>

<a name="51220-46_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>reviewed regularly, evaluated for effectiveness,       and revised as necessary.


</p>
</ul>
<a name="51220-46_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>On the adoption of codes of conduct, recognising that it is important to build on and co-ordinate with existing efforts and avoid imposing burdensome and duplicative measures, the states party agreed on the value of:
</p>
<ul>
<a name="51220-46_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>demonstrating the benefits of codes and       encouraging relevant actors to develop codes       themselves;


</p>

<a name="51220-46_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a>using existing codes, mechanisms, frameworks       and bodies as far as possible; and


</p>

<a name="51220-46_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>tailoring adoption strategies according to the       needs of each relevant sector.


</p>
</ul>
<a name="51220-46_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a>On the promulgation of codes of conduct, recognising that codes of conduct will be most effective if they, and the principles underlying them, are widely known and understood, the states party agreed on the value of continuous efforts on promulgation through appropriate channels.
</p>

<a name="51220-46_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a>States party were also encouraged to inform the Sixth Review Conference in 2006 of any actions, measures or other steps that they have taken on the basis of the discussions on codes of conduct to facilitate the conference&#039;s consideration of the work.
</p>

<a name="51220-46_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a>The preceding meeting of experts held in Geneva in June 2005 had prepared the way for this political decision-making. At this earlier meeting, levels of attendance and participation were excellent, with 82 states party contributing to international discussion and sharing of expertise on codes of conduct for scientists. States party were also able to benefit from the input, expertise, and experience of a number of international and non-governmental organisations and science stakeholders. A multi-agency delegation represented the United Kingdom. Sir David King, Chief Scientific Adviser, made a well received presentation on his code of ethics for government scientists, which is currently being piloted across government. UK officials also made four presentations on different aspects of the subject.

I am sure members will join me in expressing appreciation for the work and efforts of Ambassador Freeman to achieve consensus on a report that reflected the large measure of agreement that exists on the subject under discussion. Moreover, the level of active participation and engagement over the past three years of the current work programme is an indication to us that states party recognise both the importance of the selected subjects and also the value of the work programme more generally in contributing to strengthening the convention.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a>The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council met on 8 and 9 December. The Secretary of State for Health chaired the meeting and I represented the United Kingdom. Items on the agenda relating to health were covered on 9 December. Items for discussion were: human health aspects of pandemic flu; proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on medicinal products for paediatric use; and the European Commission&#039;s Green Paper: <i>Improving the Mental Health of the Population: Towards a strategy on mental health for the European Union</i>.
</p>

<a name="51220-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a>The policy discussion on the human health aspects of pandemic flu focused on areas of EU co-operation to complement existing work on this topic. Member states acknowledged that the first and most vital step was the completion of national contingency plans. On the issue of risk communication with the public, the council agreed that, while this was primarily a member state responsibility, there was a need for clear co-ordination between member states, the Commission and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to avoid confusing messages. The Commission reported the experiences of the common ground simulation exercise on pandemic flu.
</p>

<a name="51220-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a>The council also discussed the issue of increasing production capacity for both antiviral drugs and vaccines. On vaccines, council stressed the importance of increasing the research effort into the development of new vaccines. On antivirals, Ministers agreed that building up production capacity was primarily for member states, but outlined that further consideration should be given to the available options for dealing with a pandemic influenza outbreak including the feasibility and added value of the EU holding a targeted strategic stockpile of antiviral drugs.

<a name="51220-47_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a>The Justice and Home Affairs Council was held on 1&#150;2 December in Brussels. I chaired the meeting along with my right honourable and noble friend the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor. My noble friend Lady Ashton of Upholland also represented the presidency.

It was concluded that EU-level co-operation, including Europol and Eurojust, was an important component of member states&#039; approaches to counter-terrorism. The six-monthly progress report and the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy was sent to the European Council on 12 December. The Strategy and Action Plan on Radicalisation and Recruitment were also agreed.
</p>

<a name="51220-47_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a>Following on from discussions led by the Prime Minister at the Hampton Court summit, I emphasised that the presidency was very pleased that the issue of migration had been discussed, stressed its political importance and invited the Commission to present its communication <i>Priority actions for responding to the challenges of migration: first follow-up to Hampton Court</i>. The Commission set out the three main pillars of the communication: the need for a comprehensive approach covering all aspects of migration; the improvement of operational co-operation between <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS176"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column WS176</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

member states, particularly in the Mediterranean; and the need to improve co-operation on migration with third countries of origin and transit, particularly Sub-Saharan African countries.
</p>

<a name="51220-47_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a>Member states welcomed the communication emphasising its balanced and thorough approach. Member states who intervened strongly supported the focus on Africa and the Mediterranean, though some also noted that it was important not to forget the importance of other geographic regions such as Russia and the eastern neighbourhood. Adequate resources were considered particularly important for demonstrating real political will to implement actions.
</p>

<a name="51220-47_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a>The Mixed Committee was chaired by Iceland and they invited the presidency to bring forward a compromise proposal on the exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities, including a new recital on the application of Article 11(2) (indicating that it should be interpreted so as to allow for. the exchange of information on at least minor offences linked to terrorism and organised crime) and a council declaration (noting that Article 11 would be reviewed on the basis of a report from the Commission). I was pleased to note agreement to a general approach on the draft framework decision (as in document 13986/5/05 CRIMORG 124) with the two changes agreed.
</p>

<a name="51220-47_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a>The draft Directive on Data Retention was discussed throughout the second day of the council and I am pleased to be able to say that, on this vital piece of legislation for the EU&#039;s citizens, we were able to reach an agreement as to the council&#039;s position. The new text proposed: language on the retention for the purpose of serious crime, where that term was defined by national law; the inclusion of data on unsuccessful call attempts (connected unanswered calls) only where it is stored or logged for business purposes; the exclusion of unconnected calls; limited provisions on data protection, data security; and sanctions against abuse of powers to access retained data. The European Parliament held a debate on data retention on 13 December and voted on 14 December to adopt amendments identical to those of the council.
</p>

<a name="51220-47_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a>In the area of civil justice, the council reached a general agreement on the text of the draft regulation creating a European order for payment. Member states agreed that the proposal should be limited to cross-border cases. These are defined as being those in which at least one of the parties is domiciled or habitually resident in a member state other than the member state of the seized court. This is a significant decision with important implications for judicial co-operation in civil matters. It represents an emerging consensus among member states as to how &quot;cross-border&quot; should be defined. This will help to unblock progress on future measures. The European Parliament voted on 13 December to adopt amendments identical to those of the council. This is the first complete civil justice procedure to be agreed by the EU and will make it easier to obtain judgments on uncontested claims across EU borders and so help the internal market grow further.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a>Following the consensus reached at the Informal JHA Council in September, member states agreed to a number of key principles essential to a simplified, accelerated and cost-effective procedure for resolving small claims across European borders. Among other things, the procedure will be conducted primarily in writing, with modern communications technology used when a hearing is necessary; legal representation will not be mandatory; and costs will be kept proportionate to the claim. Finally, the council agreed a common understanding on the draft directive on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters. Promoting access to justice has been a key theme of the UK presidency. Civil justice issues have rightly achieved a higher priority than ever before in recent years, and the achievements in council confirm the importance of their place in an agenda for citizens.

I noted that there had been substantial work on the draft framework decision over the past year but that it had not been possible to complete this within the UK presidency. Discussions are underway with the incoming Austrian presidency on how to take forward the need for a political debate on this dossier.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a>The Commission gave a brief update on the state of play in the technical development of SIS II at a central level indicating there were difficulties concerning the overall timetable of the project but that the Commission was committed to meeting the timetable. The Commission also noted it was open to making the draft legal instruments on the SIS II more flexible, as some of the member states wished, and was committed to ensuring the EU7 had sufficient financial support from the Schengen facility until SIS II was running in 2007.

<a name="51220-48_head0"></a><h3 align=center>EU Presidency: Structural and Cohesion Funds Reform</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_10"></a>
<a name="51220-48_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My right honourable friend he Minister of State for Industry and the Regions (Alun Michael) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51220-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a>As the Prime Minister explained in his Statement to Parliament of 19 December, the European Council of 15&#150;16 December 2005 succeeded in achieving agreement on the next EC budget for the 2007&#150;13 financial perspective. As part of the package, the member states reached agreement on future structural and cohesion funds spending for the 2007&#150;13 budgetary cycle. The deal is now subject to an inter-institutional agreement with the European Commission and the European Parliament.
</p>

<a name="51220-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a>The European Council has agreed that there should be a structural and cohesion funds budget of &#8364;308 billion, representing 0.37 per cent of EU gross national income (GNI), for the 2007-13 financial perspective. This will be focused on three objectives: a convergence objective for regions with a gross domestic product (GDP) below 75 per cent of the EU average; a competitiveness objective for other regions; and a co-operation objective for cross-border and trans-national projects.
</p>

<a name="51220-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a>The agreement constitutes an increase of 31 per cent or around &#8364;73 billion in comparison with the current structural funds budget of around &#8364;235 billion for the 2000&#150;06 financial perspective, excluding expenditure under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG). The new structural funds budget is 8.3 per cent less than in the Commission&#039;s initial proposals of July 2004. The reformed budget will enable the EU to address priorities in the new member states while still maintaining some funding for richer member states, in particular their poorer regions.
</p>

<a name="51220-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a>In summary, the European Council has agreed to allocate: &#8364;252 billion (or 81.9 per cent of the structural funds budget) to the convergence objective, including &#8364;62 billion for the cohesion fund (for member states with a GNI below 90 per cent of the EU average) and &#8364;12 billion for so-called &quot;phasing-out regions&quot; (the regions that no longer qualify for full convergence funding, but would have done without enlargement); &#8364;48 billion (or 15.7 per cent of the structural funds budget) to the competitiveness objective, including &#8364;10 billion for so-called &quot;phasing-in regions&quot; (the regions that no longer qualify for full convergence funding, and would no longer qualify even if enlargement had not taken place); and &#8364;7.5 billion (or <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS179"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column WS179</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

2.4 per cent of the structural funds budget) to the co-operation objective.
</p>

<a name="51220-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a>The Government have argued consistently that, following enlargement, it is right that the structural funds should be focused to a greater extent on the poorest EU member states. Overall the 10 new member states, together with Bulgaria and Romania, will receive a total of &#8364;158 billion in structural funds (or &#8364;174 billion including transfers to the EAGGF and FIFG). The 10 new members will see a more than 250 per cent increase in their structural funds receipts from an average of &#8364;7 billion per annum during the 2004&#150;06 period to an average of &#8364;19 billion per annum in the 2007&#150;13 period. We estimate this to be equivalent to an average increase in their domestic public sector expenditure of up to 7 per cent. In per capita terms, the new member states will receive an average per citizen of around &#8364;1,500 in structural and cohesion funds, and around &#8364;2,500 including other spending, over the next financial perspective.
</p>

<a name="51220-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a>The older EU member states (the EU15) will face reductions in spending compared with current levels, reflecting their comparative prosperity and the need to support the economic convergence of the new member states. However, the UK will continue to receive substantial funds for its poorest regions. We estimate that the UK will receive a total of approximately &#8364;9.4 billion (in 2004 prices) in structural funds receipts from 2007&#150;13, in comparison with approximately &#8364;15.85 billion (in 1999 prices) in the current financial perspective, excluding funds now transferred to the EAGGF and FIFG.
</p>

<a name="51220-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a>Of this, the UK will receive approximately &#8364;2.6 billion in convergence funding for its poorest regions. Cornwall and west Wales and the Valleys will receive full convergence funding, while the Highlands and Islands will receive phasing-out convergence funding averaging approximately two-fifths of the intervention rates for the UK&#039;s future full convergence regions. The UK will also receive approximately &#8364;6.2 billion in competitiveness funding for its other regions. Of this, south Yorkshire and Merseyside will receive phasing-in competitiveness funding averaging approximately one-third of the intervention rates for the UK&#039;s future full convergence regions. It will be for the Government, in agreement with the Commission, to decide how the UK&#039;s remaining competitiveness funding should be allocated between its nations and regions. Finally, the UK will receive approximately &#8364;0.6 billion in co-operation funding. The Government will also need to agree with the Commission how this should be allocated.
</p>

<a name="51220-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a>At this stage it is not possible to provide precise figures for the amounts to be received by UK regions. We will only know the precise figures after an inter-institutional agreement has been reached on the final EC budget and once the European Commission has produced official structural funds allocations for the UK and its regions. Our initial estimate is that Cornwall is likely to receive full convergence funding of approximately one-third higher than current allocations, west Wales and the Valleys should receive full convergence funding approximately equal to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS180"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column WS180</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

current allocations, the Highlands and Islands should receive phasing-out convergence funding of over half its current allocations, and south Yorkshire and Merseyside should receive phasing-in competitiveness funding of approximately one-third of current allocations. These comparisons are in real terms and exclude allocations that have now been transferred to the EAGGF and FIFG.
</p>

<a name="51220-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"></a>In the light of this outcome, which means that the UK and its poorer regions will continue to receive substantial structural funds, the conditions for application of the domestic funding guarantee, set out in the Written Statements to Parliament by the then Secretary of State, my right honourable friend the Member for Leicester West, on 17 September and 11 December 2003, do not apply. As those Statements made clear, the purpose of the guarantee was to ensure that our nations and regions would not lose out if the member states agreed a reform package where the structural funds were focused solely on the poorest countries, and it would apply only if the richer member states no longer received structural funds allocations in the next financial perspective. It should be noted that spending on regional development from the UK&#039;s own resources already far exceeds the contribution from Europe as a result of increased allocations over recent years. Domestic regional spending allocations will be considered further in the comprehensive spending review, taking into account the outcome of the negotiations, the needs of the regions and the overall fiscal context. The devolved administrations will receive the normal formula shares of changes in overall departmental provision.
</p>

<a name="51220-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a>As part of the reform negotiations, the member states have agreed to strengthen the strategic focus of future structural funds spending by establishing community strategic guidelines on cohesion and national strategic reference frameworks, which will set out the broad objectives for future programmes. The Government plan to consult on the UK&#039;s draft national strategic reference framework early in 2006 and, as part of the consultation, they will also seek views on the methodology for allocating the UK&#039;s competitiveness funding.

objectives of the UK Government. The UK share of the 10th EDF will be 14.82 per cent, rising from a 12.69 per cent share of the 9th EDF, reflecting our recognition of an upward trend in the effectiveness of the fund, and our commitment to increasing EU assistance to Africa.
</p>

<a name="51220-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a>I believe that this represents a good outcome for our ACP partners and I am delighted that the UK presidency was able to deliver this positive agreement after lengthy negotiations.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a>In a letter to the Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee on 29 September 2004 (a copy of which was deposited in the Library of the House), I reported that the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) was conducting an investigation&#151;Operation Gestalt&#151;into Customs and Excise&#039;s handling of a series of excise diversion frauds on the London City Bond in the mid-1990s. I can today update the House on significant developments in the police investigation.
</p>

<a name="51220-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a>HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) yesterday received confirmation that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has considered a report from the MPS relating to allegations of non-disclosure to the Butterfield review involving two very senior then serving officers, Terry Byrne and David Pickup, and also Sir Richard Broadbent, former chairman of Customs and Excise. The CPS has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to charge any of these individuals with a criminal offence and that further work on this matter would not be justified.
</p>

<a name="51220-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a>The chairman of HMRC, David Varney, has confirmed that the department will now discuss with David Pickup a return to work in accordance with the department&#039;s procedures. Terry Byrne retired from HMRC in November 2004 on reaching the age of 60.
</p>

<a name="51220-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a>I made clear in my letter of 29 September 2004, and HMRC has also consistently stated, that it would be wrong and unjust to prejudge the outcome of investigations, and that the term &quot;under investigation&quot; should not be taken to mean that charges would follow. This has been an extremely difficult and unpleasant period for the individuals concerned. It is, however, necessary that reports of serious alleged wrongdoing are properly and independently investigated.
</p>

<a name="51220-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a>The MPS&#039;s Operation Gestalt investigation continues. A total of 12 current and former HMRC officials at present remain under investigation. The department has in place established contact and welfare arrangements to support the officers affected.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a>The priority of the department continues to be to ensure that: the MPS receives HMRC&#039;s full and active co-operation with the investigation; the rights of all individuals involved are protected; and the department&#039;s ongoing law enforcement operations are maintained while the investigation is ongoing.

<p><a name="wms_st_14"></a>
<a name="51220-49_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51220-49_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_88"></a>I have decided to reduce UK budget support this year to Uganda by &#163;20 million. &#163;15 million of this money will be used to provide humanitarian relief in northern Uganda, and &#163;5 million will be held back until after the elections in February (when a decision will be taken on whether to disburse it). Overall this <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS184"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column WS184</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will cut UK poverty reduction budget support (PRBS) to Uganda to &#163;30 million, below the 2004&#150;05 figure of &#163;35 million.
</p>

<a name="51220-49_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a>The UK and Ugandan Governments signed a new poverty reduction budget support (PRBS) arrangement in December 2004 for a grant of up to &#163;145 million over three years. This arrangement links budget support to reforms detailed in Uganda&#039;s poverty eradication action plan (PEAP), including macro-economic management and governance. The criteria which guide our disbursement are drawn directly from the PEAP and include both the &quot;prior actions&quot; agreed for the World Bank&#039;s Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) and specific indicators on governance.
</p>

<a name="51220-49_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_90"></a>We disbursed &#163;35 million out of our &#163;40 million allocation in 2004&#150;05, but cut &#163;5 million due to concerns about the progress of Uganda&#039;s political transition leading up to multi-party elections in 2006.
</p>

<a name="51220-49_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a>The disbursement decision for 2005&#150;06, which has just been made, follows a further assessment of Uganda&#039;s performance. In a number of respects this is still strong. Growth in 2004-05 was 6 per cent and Uganda is on track to meet almost half of the MDG targets, although additional efforts will be required to achieve them all. Negotiations on the PRSC with the World Bank have now concluded. Ten of the eleven &quot;prior actions&quot; have been successfully completed, but worryingly a &quot;prior action&quot; on the execution of the budget has only been partially met because expenditure on public administration significantly overran. Our governance assessment has highlighted concerns about: delays in putting in place the legal basis for multi-party elections; the continuation of state financing for the movement system in a new era of multi-party politics; and more recently, and particularly worryingly, about issues associated with the arrest and trial of the leader of the Forum for Democratic Change, one of the main parties that plans to contest the election.
</p>

<a name="51220-49_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"></a>The decision to reduce the PRBS commitment to &#163;30 million in 2005&#150;06 takes into account the need to ensure that Uganda&#039;s budget is still able to finance key expenditures that are crucial to improve the lives of poor people.
</p>

<a name="51220-49_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a>The decision to reallocate &#163;15 million to humanitarian assistance provided through the UN reflects our concern about the serious humanitarian situation in northern Uganda. This is not being fully addressed by the Ugandan Government or the finance that has so far been committed to humanitarian agencies. Our additional assistance will be focused on providing food and improving access to basic services, especially healthcare.
</p>

<a name="51220-49_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a>A decision on the remaining &#163;5 million will be made after the elections in February. We will continue to monitor Uganda&#039;s performance closely. I will make a decision on our PRBS commitment to Uganda in 2006&#150;07 in the light of our assessment of Uganda&#039;s continuing commitment to the partnership objectives set out in <i>Partnerships for Poverty Reduction: Rethinking Conditionality</i>.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qn_0"></a>
<a name="51220w01_wqn0"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>Which airports in the United Kingdom have penalty schemes in operation for (a) noise, and (b) pollution; and   [HL2834]

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_1"></a>What penalties are imposed for breaches of the noise and pollution regimes by airports with penalty schemes in operation; and   [HL2835]

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_2"></a>How emissions from aircraft are measured at airports; and   [HL2906]

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_3"></a>Which airports have facilities for measuring emissions; and   [HL2907]

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_4"></a>How much money has been raised at airports which have penalty schemes in respect of (a) noise; (b) emissions; and (c) deviation from planned flight path; and   [HL2908]

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_5"></a>To what purposes the money raised from airport penalty schemes has been devoted; and   [HL2909]

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_6"></a>Whether (a) all penalty schemes at airports in respect of noise, emissions and deviations from flight paths are administered by airports themselves; and (b) there is any independent oversight of these schemes.  [HL2910]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="51220w01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   There are over 140 licensed aerodromes in the United Kingdom, and the information about their operating policies requested in a number of these questions is not collected or held by the Department for Transport. It is therefore not possible to give comprehensive information about UK airports&#039; policies in response to these questions. However, some illustrative examples of practices at larger UK airports are given at the end of this answer.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>Ambient air quality is monitored in the vicinity of all larger airports in the UK. Continuous monitoring of a number of different pollutants, which are controlled though the UK air quality objectives, is carried out near airports either through the Defra monitoring network, by local authorities or by the airports themselves. The prime pollutants are nitrogen dioxide (NO) and particulate matter (PM10) though a number of other pollutants are monitored at different locations. Data acquired are used both for compliance monitoring against limit values and in support of modelling of pollutant concentrations. Monitors are sited at various locations that relate either to the main sources or to residential areas.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>Aircraft emissions are not identified separately from other sources in monitoring work though some sites will be exposed to higher levels of aircraft emissions whilst at others it will be roads that predominate. For modelling of airport area emissions, the aircraft source emissions, like other sources, will be calculated using inventory techniques related to technical and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WA242"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column WA242</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

operational performance. Inevitably, this will be an approximation given the variation in numerous factors that affect the actual level of emissions for a particular movement.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>Moreover, it is not possible to ascribe a particular operational level of emissions to an individual aircraft. The Civil Aviation Bill does not, therefore, make provision for the establishment of emissions control schemes at airports.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a>There are currently no penalty schemes in operation at UK airports for emissions, and no current statutory powers to airport operators to impose such penalties.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a>Clause 1 of the Civil Aviation Bill would give airport operators clear powers to fix their charges by reference to aircraft emissions. BAA currently makes a charge, or offers a rebate, dependent upon the ascertained NOx emission of aircraft types using Heathrow and Gatwick airports. Given that some airport operators would like explicit clear powers to make such charges, it is not unexpected that there should be so few charging on this basis.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a>Clauses 3 and 4 of the Civil Aviation Bill would give airport operators the power to levy financial penalties on the operators of aircraft which breach noise control requirements set by the Secretary of State (in the case of airports designated for the purposes of section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982) or the airport operator itself (for other airports). There is no current statutory basis for charging such penalties.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a>At present a number of airports impose penalties for breach of their noise limits for departing aircraft, using their terms and conditions of use; some examples of these are given at the end of this Answer, along with details of the limits in question and the penalties imposed. The Government are aware of one airport&#151;Stansted&#151;that levies penalties for flagrant or persistent deviation from flight path as part of its terms and conditions of use.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a>Noise and track-keeping systems are required to assess breaches of departure noise limits and deviation from noise preferential routes. These systems are potentially costly to install and run and it may therefore not be appropriate for smaller airports to impose noise controls that require this apparatus.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_8"></a>There are a variety of ways in which airport operators may manage the noise impact of their operations, which should be selected and used in response to local circumstances. These may include curfews, restrictions on the number or type of aircraft permitted to fly at night, or overall limits on the number of aircraft movements at an airport; the Government also expect operators of larger airports voluntarily to offer noise insulation for residential and community buildings subject to certain levels of noise. The operation of noise penalty schemes needs to be seen in the context of these other measures.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_9"></a>As noted above, the Government do not collect or hold information about the funds raised by airports that impose penalties for breach of their departure noise limits, or the purposes to which those funds are put. However, examples of such information are given at the end of this Answer.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WA243"></a>

<b>20 Dec 2005 : Column WA243</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51220w01_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a>Nor does the Government collect information about how all penalty schemes are administered. However, it can be seen from the examples provided that a community trust fund is frequently established to administer grants, with local authorities and representatives of the airport&#039;s consultative committee generally included as trustees. It is also common practice for the consultative committee to be informed about the operation of the scheme. Those funds which are registered charities will receive independent regulation from the Charity Commission.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a>The Secretary of State has set departure noise limits at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. These are 94dBA in daytime (0700-2300); 89dBA between 2300-2330 and 0600-0700; and 87dBA in the night quota period, 2330-0600. BAA, the operator of these three airports, charges aircraft operators &#163;500 for an exceedance of the relevant noise limit, or &#163;1,000 if the aircraft breaches the limit by 3dBA or more.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a>The Secretary of State has also set noise preferential routes for aircraft departing from these airports. Each airport has a noise and track-keeping (NTK) system in place to monitor breaches of the departure noise limits and deviations from the noise preferential routes. As noted above, Stansted Airport imposes a surcharge of &#163;500 for each flagrant failure to adhere to a noise preferential route.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_13"></a>At Heathrow Airport, the BAA Heathrow noise fines fund has used the income generated from fines for breaching the departure noise limits to provide noise insulation for local schools and community halls; the fund is being reviewed, given that the needs of schools and other noise-sensitive buildings should be met by the airport&#039;s new community buildings noise insulation scheme.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a>At Gatwick Airport, the Gatwick Airport Community Trust is a registered charity set up in 2001. The trust receives the money raised from fining for breaches of the departure noise limits, in addition to an annual donation of &#163;100,000 per year (index-linked) until 2008 from BAA Gatwick. It grants money to projects that benefit the area around the airport, including environmental or conservation schemes and projects that benefit community life or improve community facilities. In 2004 the trust made grants for a wide range of purposes, including tree planting, play facilities in a rural community and music in residential homes.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a>At Stansted Airport, until this year the consultative committee has advised the airport on the distribution of funds raised from noise and track-keeping infringements. The Stansted Airport Community Trust Fund, a registered charity, has now been set up to deal with this. The trust is also being funded through a donation of &#163;100,000 per year from the Airport until 2012. The trust is managed by independent trustees representing local authorities in the area of the airport, and makes grants to projects that protect and enhance the social, economic and environmental well-being of the community.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para16"></a>

night (2300-0659). The minimum penalty for exceeding the limit is &#163;500, and a further &#163;150 is applied for each PNdB in excess of the noise limit.
</p>

<a name="51220w01_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_17"></a>Manchester Airport has a NTK system to monitor aircraft noise, and has set up preferred noise routes to minimise the impact of noise from departing aircraft. It has lobbied for many years for the power to charge penalties for failure to observe these preferred noise route corridors. Clause 4 of the Bill will give operators of non-designated airports this power.
</p>

The figures for beer prior to 1993&#150;94 have been adjusted to make them comparable with those of later years. The figures for cider were first collected in 1976&#150;77. One unit of alcohol is defined as 10ml of pure alcohol. Population estimates are for all ages; that is, the UK population. Alcohol clearances are by financial year; ONS mid-year population estimates are by calendar year.<br>

<a name="51220w02_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_31"></a>Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica, supported by other countries making up the Coalition of Rainforest Nations, proposed to the 11 Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which took place recently in Montreal, that emissions reductions relative to a national baseline could be used as a measure of achievement.
</p>

<a name="51220w02_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_32"></a>The UK believes the proposal is very interesting, especially given the potential for significant co-benefits for communities dependent on forests and for biodiversity, as well as for greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. There are nevertheless significant technical issues to consider, including on how baselines would in practice be defined, and emissions relative to them measured. These questions need to be resolved before this or any other proposal could provide a basis for quantification of emissions saved, and hence valuation in carbon markets. In the Government&#039;s view it is not useful to speculate about the detailed modalities for engagement until these technical issues are better understood; but clearly linkage, if participation were linked to Kyoto Protocol carbon markets, would be after the first commitment period, for which the rules are already set.
</p>

<a name="51220w02_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_33"></a>Having discussed the proposal in Montreal, the parties to the UNFCCC agreed to submit its views on the issues by the end of March 2006. The Conference of Parties requested the Subsidiary Body on Scientific and Technical Advice (SBSTA) under the UNFCCC to start consideration of the issue, at its 24th session which will be in May 2006, following the submissions. There will be a workshop on the issue following the 24th session of the SBSTA and the SBSTA will report on its findings at its 27th session, in December 2007. The UK, as part of the EU, will contribute detailed technical views, initially via the March 2006 submission, and will seek resolution of the issues in the negotiations in a manner that contributes to the objectives of the UNFCCC and helps realise the co-benefits for communities and for biodiversity.

<a name="51220w03_spmin3"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  Defra has policy responsibility for flood risk management in England, funds most of the Environment Agency&#039;s flood-related work and grant aids individual capital improvement projects undertaken by local authorities and internal drainage boards. The programme to manage risk is driven by these operating authorities; Defra does not build defences or direct the authorities on which specific projects to undertake.
</p>

<a name="51220w03_para0"></a>

</p>

<a name="51220w03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_35"></a>This funding for local authorities is a mixture of direct capital grant and supported capital expenditure (revenue) (SCE(R)). SCE(R) is approved by Defra and results in revenue support grant from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) over several years. SCE(R) replaced supplementary credit approval (SCA) after 2003&#150;04.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_36"></a>Local authorities also receive a large amount of grant and SCE(R) from Defra for capital improvement projects to manage the risk from coastal erosion.

<a name="51220w04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_40"></a>In 1999&#150;2000 1.3 million new adult passports (defined as adults who did not hold a passport as a child) were issued and in 2003&#150;04 the figure was 634,130. In 2004&#150;05 the figure was 715,644 and it is expected that 630,000 new adult passports will be issued in 2005&#150;06. The number of new adult passports issued is expected to be 592,000 in 2006&#150;07, 553,000 in 2007&#150;08, 527,000 in 2008&#150;09, 481,000 in 2009&#150;10 and 439,000 in 2010&#150;11. The reason for the decline in the numbers of first adult passports is that a large proportion of people now obtain a passport when they are a child. Therefore, the passport they receive as an adult is a renewal rather than a new adult passport. In 1999&#150;2000 the number of adult passport renewals was 1,958,526; in 2003&#150;04 it was 3,055,069; and the number of renewals in 2004&#150;05 was 2,958,191.

However, the number of passports issued to adults will not necessarily equate with the total number of identity cards issued given that people will be able to choose to apply for a stand-alone identity card. Replacement identity cards will also be issued in cases of change of name and if a card is lost, stolen or damaged.

Furthermore, the findings of research on the likely behaviour of UK nationals&#151;including passport holders&#151;was published in October 2005. This showed that demand for passports and ID cards holds up well compared with the current level of passport ownership in the adult population of 77 per cent 67 per cent of adults said they would obtain a passport/ID card package and 8 per cent. said they would obtain a stand-alone ID card at charges comparable with current best estimates of cost.

<a name="51220w05_spmin3"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  On 8 December, President Ahmadinejad reportedly questioned the existence of the Holocaust and proposed that Israel should be moved to Europe.

He called them wholly unacceptable and said they had no place in civilised political debate.

against a set of risk management targets. Trusts are incentivised in two ways: first, the level of risk management is assessed against three levels of attainment, achieving a discount of contributions into the clinical negligence scheme for trusts as attainment increases. Secondly, the risk management systems assist NHS scheme members to drive down the levels of incidents, which in turn reduces the levels of compensation claims.

The principles in this guide must be applied, with appropriate and proportionate effort, to all proposals that involve spending or saving public money, including EU funds, or changes in the use of public resources. They apply equally to policies, programmes and projects. There are no exceptions to this general requirement.

Section 111(1), specifically, deals with right of entry and allows duly authorised officers to enter any premises, in connection with suspected breaches, at any time. Section 111(5) additionally provides the authority of forced entry under magistrates warrant.

These conditions are: that it is impracticable to communicate with any person who may grant entry; that it is impracticable to communicate with any person who may grant access to the evidence; that entry will not be granted unless a warrant is produced; or that the purpose of the search may be frustrated or seriously prejudiced unless carried out immediately on arrival at the premises or vehicle.

Source: The information has been taken from the DWP Expenditure Tables.<br>
<br>

<br>

Notes: Expenditure figures are for Great Britain. Expenditure has been rounded to the nearest million pounds. Figures are estimates of the amount of benefit paid to claimants in respect of their children. Average amounts of child elements or increases, and numbers of claimants in receipt of these (both of which are obtainable from the Department&#039;s administrative benefit system data), are used to arrive at an estimate of the proportion of total benefit spending directed at children. The exact method of calculating this varies from benefit to benefit. Departmental expenditure directed at children does not necessarily equate to actual spending on children by benefit recipients. Additional spending on children through child benefit and child tax credit is a matter for HM Revenue and Customs.<br>
<br>

<br>

All figures are consistent with the 2005 Pre-Budget Report, and with expenditure information which is published on the department&#039;s Internet website at the following address: www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd4/expenditure.asp. The Internet tables have been updated recently following the 2005 Pre-Budget Report.<br>
