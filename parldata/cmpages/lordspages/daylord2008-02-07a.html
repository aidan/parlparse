The UK is also the largest donor to the UN&#146;s Central Emergency Response Fund, contributing &#163;40 million this year.

This is the second year running that disastrous floods have hit the region. This year&#146;s floods are coming close to the catastrophic 2000-01 floods which killed 700 people and displaced more than 500,000 people from their homes. The construction of the Cahora Bassa dam from 1969 to 1974 was meant to provide electricity to the southern African electric grid, but was also designed to regulate the flow of the Zambezi river and, in so doing, protect the people who inhabit the flood plains from perennial droughts and floods. The devastating floods show that the Cahora Bassa dam is not doing a great job. What are the Government doing to provide aid to develop the flood control mechanism?</p>

There have been one or two catastrophic mistakes. The House will appreciate that the issues that face Mozambique and other states in southern Africa have also been created by the most adverse weather conditions, and now we are entering the cyclone period. DfID is concerned to play its full part in humanitarian aid to deal with the emergency, but the noble Baroness is right that we need to address ourselves to the longer run issues, in particular, the resettlement of people away from the immediate  flood plain.</p>

Can the Minister also say what measures are taken to co-ordinate the many agencies that have been involved across the region, such as the International Red Cross, the World Health Organisation, the World Food Programme  and so on?</p>

We make it quite clear what our contributions are: others are more coy. I hear what the noble Lord says, but he will appreciate that getting international action in terms of openness is somewhat difficult. We concentrate on playing our full part. The co-ordination of agencies and emergency relief has been rather well done. It is never satisfactory because the demands are so huge, but it has been rather well done with regard to this emergency. We have not had great anxieties on that score. The problem, as the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, indicated, is that this is the second time in two years and the third time in seven years that the area has been devastated. That is why we need both water management and to protect people from the problems.</p>

It is right for the noble Baroness to raise it at such length. Is it correct that one of the floodgates of Kariba is about to be opened next week thereby flooding something like 800 kilometres of the lower Zambezi? Hundreds of thousands of people have already been moved to resettlement camps which will now be flooded again. Mozambique is full of disaster preparedness plans. Will the Minister accept that it is governments who are inept, the people who are suffering and the organisations on the ground that are having to cope with this?</p>

I will be as brief as possible. The noble Lord is right that for hydroelectric purposes it is probable that the gates will be opened again. That helps to generate needed electricity, but of course there are consequences much further down the river which are affecting Mozambique badly. That kind of co-ordination is extremely difficult to effect and DfID has only a marginal part to play in that.</p>

Of course, Mozambique, which was not a British colony but which became free and joined the Commonwealth, does benefit from the decisions of DfID and the Government as a whole to spend more on Commonwealth countries.</p>

At the moment you qualify for a blue badge if you get the higher rate of mobility allowance or the local authority assesses  that you are in need. We are concerned to ensure that there is more comprehensive coverage for a range of disabilities, such as the one cited by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and that the scheme is understandable and can be properly enforced.</p>

All the equipment on buses enabling people to get on and off easily is being vitiated because buses cannot get to the kerb.</p>

We have to invest in ensuring that the aviation industry works well because we live in a service economy and we need to ensure that our service economy works well in the future.

It is time that the Government in a coherent way&#151;I appreciate that there is some confusion on the Conservative Benches, but there is also a confusing message from the Government&#151;told the aviation industry that all we are asking is for it to be treated the same as every other sector.</p>

We have a comprehensive programme on research and development, and we use a range of economic instruments to encourage what might be described as good behaviour by that sector. The offsetting scheme, and the fact that we are raising public awareness, tells me that we have a coherent government strategy to tackle a major, long-term, international problem.</p>

Across the Channel in Spain, France, the Netherlands and Germany, one sees large, long-term investment in high-speed rail. One also sees Schiphol, Paris Roissy, Frankfurt and elsewhere with through railway lines to link local and national rail to international air travel. None of these projects has been carried through in Britain. The previous Government were equally culpable with the present one. Do we not want a long-term investment policy to invest in high-speed rail and direct rail links to airports?</p>

The MoD does not object to all wind farms and, indeed, gives strong advice to people in the pre-planning process who are thinking of siting a wind farm in any area. In the past three years we have objected to only 31 applications, and since 1996 we have raised no objection to 352 planning applications. We object when there is a real problem. Usually that is when there is a difficulty  over the radar line of sight.

This is not a concern only within the MoD; it is shared by those responsible for civil aviation. On occasion, NATS and the CAA have objected as well. We only do it when we have to. We think that there is a strong role for wind energy in the future. We offer advice where we can, so that people do not pursue applications for planning permission if we are going to object. We have a very big take-up and have received 4,800 pre-planning proposals from people who have contacted the MoD since 1996 and who value the advice that we have  been giving.</p>

We thought that the case for establishing a new committee was made out in respect of the scrutiny of the work of the new Statistics Board, as recommended by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, and others. However, as the proposal here is for a Joint Committee of both Houses, its implementation does not rest within the power of the committee or of your Lordships' House.

We have some sympathy with the noble Lord over the case in principle for a review of the Barnett formula. But our view was that a review of the formula was not a suitable subject for a committee of this House. We doubted whether any review would be constrained within sensible bounds and we thought that, in principle, this sort of highly politicised subject matter falls within the area of scrutiny more obviously occupied by the Commons. We thought that if a committee of your Lordships&#146; House were to be established, the extent to which it would carry influence in decision-making would be questionable.

My memorandum includes the latest figures from the Treasury, which show that the average public expenditure per head in Scotland is &#163;1,500 more than in England. That does not mean that I am proposing a committee to change those figures, but simply to review them. The method of calculation was produced some 30 years ago&#151;I was a child at the time. I want to be quite clear that this is not an anti-Scotland proposal. A review may well prove that Scotland should get those amounts, but surely, after 30 years, there should be a review.

I can completely understand why he has moved the amendment. It must be a terrible burden to have one&#146;s name attached to a formula of which one thoroughly disapproves.

I believe that this is a truly urgent matter. We are seeing the real prospect of the disintegration of the United Kingdom. Even the Conservative Members of the Scottish Parliament voted for the nationalist budget yesterday, which is extraordinary. In England, as we all know, and other parts of the United Kingdom, there is a feeling of unfairness with regard to the funding of Scotland relative to the rest of the United Kingdom. In voting for that budget, they voted for more favourable terms on care for the elderly, free prescriptions, tuition fees and a whole range of other things which apply in Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="08020782000103">This issue does not seek to reopen the question of devolution but it is essential that devolution is looked at in the context of the funding and that all parts of the United Kingdom believe that the funding system is fair and is seen to be fair. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, is asking that we look at this on a needs basis for funding for the whole of the United Kingdom, so that it is seen to be fair, and then the devolved Administrations can spend those resources as they choose. But so long as we continue with a scheme which is based on increasing the funding according to population while maintaining a baseline that reflected previous circumstances, and as long as we have a separatist regime in Scotland, which is determined to create conflict north and south of the border, the United Kingdom is in danger because of our failure to tackle this.</p>

If any such committee is established, I would suggest that it holds real and close consultations with the Scottish Parliament and with the National Assembly for Wales. Devolution has made a difference. Scotland can levy a precept. It can raise extra money to meet its needs. Wales does not have that ability.

I am concerned with matters which I regard as much more fundamental. I approach this by putting some questions to the Chairman of Committees. My first question concerns the concordat drawn up between the much missed Lord Williams of Mostyn and the leaders of the opposition, notably the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. The purpose of the concordat was to agree some internal reforms to smooth the way your Lordships&#146; House operated and a central part of it was that your Lordships could, and indeed should and would, examine fiscal matters. That was part of the concordat. Moreover, the concordat was fully endorsed by your Lordships&#146; House. Was the Liaison Committee made aware of the concordat and its endorsement by your Lordships&#146; House?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="08020782000107">My second question concerns a definitive statement on the Parliament Act that was made by the Clerk of the Parliaments at the same time and agreed by his opposite number at the other end. The import of that was that the Parliament Act did not limit your Lordships in their examination of fiscal matters at all. We could even vote on the Finance Bill, though no one would take any notice of it under the Parliament Act. What we could not do was amend the Finance Bill. Was the Liaison Committee made aware of this definitive statement by the Clerk of the Parliaments about what your Lordships could do on fiscal matters&#151;notably what the Clerk of Parliaments said the position was?</p>

Therefore, as a member of that committee, I want to urge the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, not to press his amendment today and to urge the House to adopt the report. The two strongest arguments for following the advice of the committee that your Lordships set up to look at these matters of detail come from the contributions of the noble Lords, Lord Forsyth and Lord Peston.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Peston, clearly indicated, in so doing we would be taking ourselves into an area which is not as clear and cut-and-dried as he suggests. Indeed, I suggest that if he made it at the other end of the Corridor, he would find a great deal of discomfort. I am not sure that in setting up an ad hoc committee we should not reopen a battle between Lords and Commons which some of us thought had been settled perhaps in 1911.</p>

Thirdly, do we have the Peers to sit on these committees? We can have any number of committees: as the House can see, four suggestions were made here.

The noble Lord is a distinguished former chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee so he knows and understands extremely well that that committee was set up when the late Lord Williams of Mostyn was Leader of this House explicitly in recognition of the changing role of this House. The House felt that it should start looking at financial matters from which it had been excluded for 90 years.

If we have an interest, if we have the competence, if we have the people and the resources, we should discuss them.

My noble friend had a number of problems as Chief Secretary to the Treasury in dealing with Wales and Scotland and the expenditure that arose. He finally introduced an amount of 10 per cent to be given to Scotland and 5 per cent to Wales. This dealt with the problem in a very simple way.

These are matters that people in this Chamber consider and take into account. An influence on decision-making comes from this House and it is quite right that it should.

It is as simple as this: we are confronted with four possibilities. Each person who wished a committee to be set up made their case and made it very well. I asked what they would judge success to be and how the spending of a considerable amount of money&#151;about &#163;180,000 for each committee&#151;would appear.

As I understand it, nothing has changed so far as that particular rule is concerned. Section 2 limits exactly what this House can do in relation to a certified money Bill, but it would have been possible to discuss the finances of Scotland  and Wales&#151;although of course they were not devolved in Wales in such a manner&#151;the very day after the 1911 Bill received the Royal Assent.

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="08020782000151">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, it is a great pleasure to have the opportunity today to discuss my report on women with particular vulnerabilities in the criminal justice system. The background to my report was the increase in the deaths in custody of women at the beginning of this decade. In 2003, there were  14 such deaths. In 2004 there were 13. Six of those were in HM Prison and Young Offender Institution Styal over a 13-month period. Toward the end of that period, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman for England and Wales, Stephen Shaw, was given responsibility for conducting an independent investigation into deaths in custody and he did so for the last woman who died in Styal, but he took account of the other deaths.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="08020782000152">Concurrently, there were calls for a public inquiry and the then Home Secretary, my right honourable friend Charles Clarke, decided that a public inquiry would not reveal anything not recommended or discovered by the ombudsman. But he was particularly struck by a letter from the coroner for Cheshire, Nicholas Rheinberg, who said in conducting the inquest into the deaths:</p>




<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1179"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"><a name="08020782000581">&#147;I saw a group of damaged individuals, committing for the most part petty crime for whom imprisonment represented a disproportionate response. That was what particularly struck me with Julie Walsh who had spent the majority of her adult life serving at regular intervals short periods of imprisonment for crimes which represented a social nuisance rather than anything that demanded the most extreme form of punishment. I was greatly saddened by the pathetic individuals who came before me as witnesses who no doubt mirrored the pathetic individuals who had died&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000547">This led the then Home Secretary to decide that such a review would be appropriate. I am grateful to my noble and learned friend Lady Scotland and my honourable friend Fiona Mactaggart MP, who were both Ministers in the Home Office at that time, and who asked me to conduct the review. I express my thanks to Jenny Hall and Nigel Hancock from the Safer Custody Group and the members of my review group for giving so generously of their time and expertise in helping me with my work.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="08020782000153">This was a practical piece of work drawing on research dating back to 1971, all of which pointed in the same direction, and setting out a blueprint for change involving seven government departments. It is impossible to do justice today in the time available to a 100-page report making 43 recommendations and a comprehensive response from the Government. I will concentrate on a few key issues. In 2002, 12,650 women were received into custody, and 4,100 of them were sentenced. Some 8,350 were remanded, and  66 per cent of them did not even get a custodial sentence. The average stay in prison was 42 days, which was long enough to lose their homes and their children, and they generally got neither back.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="08020782000154">The profile of women in prison is characterised by mental illness, drug and alcohol misuse, lack of educational qualifications, suicidal tendencies, no life skills and domestic and sexual abuse. In fact, I concluded that we are rightly exercised about paedophiles, but we do not seem to have much sympathy or give much attention to their victims, many of whom end up in prison. They are looked after by staff whose preliminary training was eight weeks&#146; training in priorities for a male prison, such as security. Over two-thirds of the women were mothers living with their children prior to prison. Indeed, 17,000 children a year are affected by their mother&#146;s imprisonment. These women generally pose no risk to the public and are in prison time after time. They are imprisoned at a considerable distance from home because of the relatively small number of women in prison and the geographical dispersal of the prisons.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="08020782000155">At the start of the inquiry in March 2006, I made it clear to officials with whom I worked that I started from a simple premise that has guided me ever since I became a women&#146;s organiser 32 years ago; women and men are different but equal, and if you treat them the same, the outcome is not equality. It is my passionate belief that the Prison Service has been run on the basis that it is right to treat people the same and that equality will be the outcome. But prisons are for men. That is how they are configured and run, and that is where the training comes from. Women&#146;s priorities are different. Let me give a couple of examples.</p>

Time and again, women said to me, &#147;All I want is somewhere for me and my children to live, and I do not want to be stuck in the Catch-22 of having no home so I cannot get my children back, and not having my children so I cannot get a home&#148;. Last April, the gender equality duty was passed into law by Parliament, putting an obligation on public authorities to ensure that their policies and practices do not have a differential impact on women. But I found in the Prison Service with regard to the women&#146;s estate that there was no one in charge and no corporate memory.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="08020782000157">The Government&#146;s response is a curate&#146;s egg, which is very good in parts. There is an acceptance in principle that custodial sentences for women must be reserved for serious and violent offenders who pose a threat to the public. A high-level champion for women who offend or who are at risk of offending&#151;which I recommended&#151;has been identified by my honourable friend Maria Eagle, a junior Minister in the Home Office. She is leading a subgroup of Ministers working independently but reporting to the interministerial group to reduce reoffending. I felt strongly that if that if that had been left with the interministerial group itself it would always have been the last item on the agenda, because that is what happens with women&#146;s issues.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="08020782000158">My honourable friend Maria Eagle is working with my honourable and learned friend the Solicitor-General, Vera Baird, whose professional life was almost exclusively concerned with women suffering domestic abuse and before the courts, and Barbara Follett, the Equality Minister. That is extraordinarily important because she is one of the Women&#146;s Ministers and their second priority as Women&#146;s Ministers is women offenders. They are joined by junior Ministers from the Department of Health and the Home Office and there is input from the Department for Communities and Local Government.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="08020782000159">I say to the Government that the task of those Ministers that must be supported will be to ensure that the agenda is embedded throughout government so that it survives changes in Ministers and officials. As to the gender equality duty, the National Offender Management Service, NOMS, is due to publish a national service framework for women on 1 April. It has been a long time coming. When I started my review two years ago I was told that its publication was forthcoming. This is their opportunity to disprove those civil servants who say that NOMS stands for &#147;Nightmare on Marsham Street&#148;. The NOMS leadership must ensure that, in the understandable focus on violent and dangerous offenders, women offenders are not forgotten, and we will judge it on results.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="08020782000160">The Government have decided not to establish a commission for women who offend or are at risk of offending, as I recommended, but intend instead to set up a new cross-departmental criminal justice women&#146;s unit headed by a senior civil servant. I hope that this person is very senior and can command authority. My experience is that all too often such initiatives start with good intentions, then members of a group send deputies to meetings and we end up with  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1181"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a group of junior note-takers who have no authority. My central recommendation revolves around the Together Women project and the opportunity it provides for establishing a network of women&#146;s centres taking a woman-centred approach for women who offend or are at risk of offending.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="08020782000161">I visited three such centres: the Asha centre in Worcester, the Calderdale in Halifax and the 218 centre in Glasgow&#151;funded by the Scottish Executive, incidentally&#151;which is active in the courts and has a secure facility within its premises, often for women on remand. What I saw there was inspiring. I saw women who had been in and out of prison, and some who had not been in prison but might have ended up there, like some of those women who were murdered in Ipswich the year before last. I saw those women being able to develop self-confidence, self-esteem and self-worth, three things that women prisoners do not generally have and which are the basis of good citizenship and turn people into good neighbours.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="08020782000162">It was inspirational, and cost effective because a place at the Asha centre costs &#163;750 per year. I was told by officials in the senior Home Office that the total cost of keeping a woman in prison is &#163;77,000. I know which is the better value for money. I also recommended small custodial units for women to replace the current women&#146;s prison estate over a 10-year period. All I say to my noble friend and to our colleagues in the Treasury is that it has been agreed that &#163;1.5 billion is to be spent on prison-building. I came across rather hidebound attitudes to what was considered to be an appropriate prison building. If we are going to spend that money, I suggest that at least one small custodial unit for women should be included in that &#163;1.5 billion and that perhaps it should be in Wales because there is no such facility for women in Wales. They have to go to Eastwood Park near Bristol, which makes family ties difficult.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="08020782000163">I want to emphasise that women&#146;s prisons should never be on shared sites. I say to my noble friend Lord Carter that the proposal for Titan prisons&#151;a number of prisons on satellite sites sharing services and facilities&#151;is an issue for a future debate, but there should never be one women&#146;s prison on a Titan site where the other prisons are male because there will be one ethos on that site and it will be a male ethos. All experience has shown that. I do not want that to happen and for people to say afterwards, &#147;We didn&#146;t know that&#148;. It is vital to have cross-government action.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="08020782000164">The Department for Communities and Local Government has a huge job in sorting out housing, social exclusion and intentional homelessness issues. I am pleased to say that I met my noble friend Lady Andrews in November, and I am impressed at how passionate she has become about this subject. I know that her department is now sponsoring an &#147;Adults facing Chronic Exclusion&#148; programme. There is a great challenge for the Department of Health to implement its own women&#146;s mental health strategy to improve detoxification services. Everywhere I went I was told that these services have improved in recent years, but much more is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="08020782000165">With regard to routine strip-searching, I was persuaded by prison governors on how inappropriate it is. It wastes staff time; it is corrosive of relationships between staff and prisoners; it is deeply humiliating and it is a terrible thing to do to women who have been sexually abused, which represents a considerable proportion of women prisoners. Having been persuaded by prison governors to put this in my report, I am pleased that pilots are going on and that routine strip-searching will change into a slightly more acceptable mode. I hope that the pilots will lead to strip-searches in future being carried out on an intelligence-led basis.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="08020782000166">One thing that the Government did not accept in my report, to which I draw your Lordships&#146; attention, is the right to life in Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. When the state takes somebody into custody it has an absolute obligation to preserve life. I feel strongly that when that obligation is breached and a person dies, the family should be given equality of arms at law and offered public funding to enable them to be represented at inquests. In their response the Government said that legal representation was not a requirement. I found that breathtaking. If that is the case, why are the Government always represented by senior counsel and barristers? I feel very strongly that that should be addressed. I met bereaved families and was humbled and moved at their plight. Why should they have to spend their money because the Government are at fault?</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="08020782000167">I received a letter from a magistrate on an issue that I want to raise towards the end of my comments. He wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"><a name="08020782000582">&#147;Regarding your report on women in prison, I think it is important that magistrates are challenged in their training about their attitudes to women offenders&#151;especially from the conviction aspect.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"><a name="08020782000583">I found as an operating magistrate for nearly 20 years that frequently a submerged view was that the fact that a woman was guilty was worse than if a man had committed the same crime and consequently there was a marked tendency to be harsher in administering punishment. I&#146;m of the view that this is, unfortunately, some sort of inbred, cultural phenomenon. I didn&#146;t find evidence that it was a deliberate position&#151;or even a conscious one&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000548">I think he is right. We have to ensure that in the training of sentencers a different attitude is taken. One of the women who took her life was in prison for a first offence of wounding with intent. She had been given a life sentence. I cannot imagine that that sentence would have been given to a man.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="08020782000168">What I am suggesting is popular. Towards the end of last year SmartJustice commissioned a survey by ICM, which showed that 86 per cent of people support community alternatives to prison&#151;centres where women are sent to address the causes of their crimes while doing compulsory community work. The Government can rest assured that that flies in the face of some of the stuff that we read in the press, and that taking a more sensible, civilised and more cost-effective approach to these women can turn them into better citizens and enable them to fulfil their family obligations. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

It is rather a shame that this debate comes quite so soon after our discussion last week, and that we could not have delayed it for a few months until the Government&#146;s action plan is ready. However, it could be argued that it is an issue that can never be discussed too much. On that basis we must count our blessings and take every opportunity that we can.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="08020782000170">As the noble Baroness knows, in last week&#146;s debate there was a great deal of support for her proposals, but equally it became clear to me&#151;and a number of others&#151;that, as welcome as are all those champions who have, as the noble Baroness outlined, now been appointed to look after the interests of the Corston report and its proposals, the delay in the Government&#146;s response underlines the need for a specifically independent women&#146;s justice board to ensure that sufficient action, resources and trained staff for the plan&#146;s rollout are available. To use the words of my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham, we need somebody in charge to make things happen.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="08020782000171">I want to spend my few moments emphasising just why the proposals of the noble Baroness are so important&#151;not only for women and families, but for the whole community. Increasingly, I see them as relevant to quite a number of male offenders. I stress this because I was concerned by something that the Minister said last week, and I hope that he can give noble Lords a more positive answer today. He implied that the Government&#146;s commitment to implementing the gender equality duty within the UK penal system meant that, if different prison arrangements were made for one sex only, that could be seen as sexual discrimination and would therefore be illegal. If there is any doubt about this, we should call in the noble Lord, Lord Lester, who is the expert on that legislation and could, I hope, give a much clearer definition.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="08020782000172">The Corston recommendations were made with the aim of redressing rather than entrenching inequalities. It is abundantly clear how women prisoners are currently at a disadvantage in the system. As the noble Baroness rightly said, it was designed for men a long time ago, rather along military lines, and, almost inevitably at that time, it was designed by men. Currently with prison overcrowding, we all know that a number of women&#146;s prisons have been taken over to accommodate the increasing numbers of male prisoners. Many more women offenders with children are placed further from their homes. Prison Reform Trust statistics tell us that the average distance women have to travel is  58 miles and that 60 per cent of women prisoners are placed in institutions outside their home regions. This understandably makes visiting even more difficult. As the noble Baroness said, many women in prison lose their homes and reclaiming some sort of home on their release is a major priority. One study reported that half of the women surveyed had had no visits at all. It appears that male partners are rather less active in taking children to visit their mothers.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="08020782000173">Even though the Corston report&#146;s recommendations are specifically aimed at women, as noble Lords heard

Only very few dangerous, violent women offenders must be in secure settings. The noble Baroness, Lady Corston, has already stressed this. The Corston proposals for non-violent women offenders, which she has described, will include better co-ordination of resettlement pathways, a greater emphasis on community orders and the rollout of interdisciplinary centres that can tackle complex problems, including mental health problems and substance&#151;meaning drugs and alcohol&#151;abuse. We know this from what has already been spelled out by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="08020782000174">The case for this kind of approach becomes overwhelming when one considers the potential savings to the public. A recent study by the Prison Reform Trust, in conjunction with the New Economics Foundation, estimates that, including the value of crimes prevented, the lifetime cost-savings of early intervention, with focused support, for the 2,000 non-violent women offenders would come to an estimated &#163;19.5 million, or around &#163;10,000 per female offender. Extra Government resources and support from business and the third sector are essential for the primary targets&#151;those areas of prevention, rehabilitation and resettlement&#151;if we are to make any real progress. I notice, too, that the policy update refers to some 70 partners in business, who are already helping. Thus, &#163;13.9 million is to be given, over the next three years, to funding six intensive alternatives to custody projects. We really must congratulate the Government on that, even though we would press for more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="08020782000175">It is an infinitely more constructive use of funds than earmarking &#163;2.3 billion for prison building, including plans for three Titan prisons. With all due respect to the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, this proposal has been almost universally condemned. I am rather tempted to think of the fate of the Titanic, and hope that the British criminal justice system is not going in the same direction. Surely, if prison is necessary, funds should be directed towards schemes that rehabilitate inmates and help them to lead useful and fulfilling lives on their release. Instead&#151;and I quickly refer to the horrors, if people would read them, outlined on page 4 of the Corston report&#151;women are self-harming and continuing to self-harm, and babies are being taken away.

I declare an interest as the author of <I>Securing the Future</I> and a member of the board overseeing the implementation of that report.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="08020782000179">The report of the noble Baroness highlights, often graphically, the particular issues involved in the imprisonment of women. She reviews the dramatic rise in the prison population, and the issues, which have been described, of abuse, substance abuse, mental illness and low educational attainment. We find ourselves in the same situation as a country such as Canada, where the female prison population is  5 per cent of the size of the male prison population. Interestingly, in France it is only 3.7 per cent of a much smaller population. What really shocked me was the revelation that 18,000 children are affected every year when their mothers are sent to prison. That is totally shocking. It would seem that the lower French incarceration rate for women reflects the unwillingness of the French judiciary to separate mothers and children. This is something I support, and which we should look at.</p>

<a name="80207-0004.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="08020782000180">Many issues are dealt with in this excellent report, but I would like to concentrate on four: namely, sentencing; the environment in which women are held; the programmes and support they receive, both inside and beyond the walls; and, finally, some of the conflicting priorities of stakeholders. On sentencing, many of us agree that there are simply too many women in prison. It is that simple. The only way to alleviate this is to send fewer women to prison, and to send to prison for shorter periods those whom we do send. This is easily said and frequently called for, but we are rather lacking in mechanisms to bring it about. I certainly agree with diversionary schemes, which have a key role to play, but proportionate and consistent sentences are essential. I hope that Lord Justice Gage in his Sentencing Commission review will be able to consider the needs of women specifically. The noble Baroness refers to the issue of a separate sentencing framework for women; women&#146;s issues are so distinct that I hope this is looked at.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="08020782000181">The right sentencing framework and, if we can get it, a consensus between the Government and the judiciary should, in the long term, provide us with what I hope will be an appropriate and lower prison population for women. There will be those people whom we have to imprison, and we have to make sure that we get the right physical environment. The key issue, which has been referred to, is proximity to home; 58 miles is a long way and we should be better at moving people close to home. We are, however,  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1186"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>doing somewhat better than the state of Hawaii, which sends its women to Tennessee, 4,000 miles away. The very thought of it leaves us cold.</p>

<a name="80207-0005.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="08020782000182">We also have to concentrate on making sure, in the short term, that the prison capacity we have is up to scratch. I was particularly struck by a comment of Anne Owers, Chief Inspector of Prisons, when she went to Bulwood Hall. She described it as being cramped, shabby and lacking in privacy. There is something going on here. The shortcomings in the prison estate are not new. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, when he was chief inspector, noted the same thing, I remember. We have made some progress. The women&#146;s unit at Peterborough is a move in the right direction, but what we really need are these smaller units, close to home. We have to be realistic. 10 years is probably the right length of time, but we have to set about it now. I wonder if the Minister would consider setting up a competition to stimulate new design, so that we can call across the board for what people can think of by way of design and operational plans for those people we have to incarcerate. I hope that the judging panel will have a majority of women on it. I was very taken with the point about men designing buildings for women. We want women to say what women need, and to make sure that they oversee that.</p>

<a name="80207-0005.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="08020782000183">Thinking about what we do in the prisons, we have all seen bad buildings and good regimes, and good buildings and bad regimes. One does not guarantee the other. What we have to get right is what happens inside the prisons. We have made some progress. I suspect that there is less bullying. Many of the chief inspector&#146;s reports point to increased feelings of security. These are some of the achievements of recent years, but, as ever, there is more to be done.</p>

<a name="80207-0005.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="08020782000184">Beyond the issue of decency, it is important to equip women through rehabilitation to re-enter society when they leave prison, even if that is after 42 days. Above all, the key is to give women the ability to raise their self-esteem, so that when they leave prison, they can cope with the temptations of substance abuse and peer pressure. Various programmes that are in place are beginning to give us evidence that that is happening. The programme referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, is a start in the right direction. We have two pilots, but that is not enough. We need to go faster and to make sure that we are doing these things. I strongly feel that we need to get a move on.</p>

<a name="80207-0005.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="08020782000185">Then we need to know the efficacy of each programme and to understand what does and does not work. Sometimes, we could do better. Some years ago, I was very taken by an observation made by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern. She said that Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Service had done everything right &#147;once&#148;. The secret is how to get scalability of those programmes and make sure that a broad range of women benefit from them. We should not pursue just filling course places, but also focus on outcomes.</p>

<a name="80207-0005.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="08020782000186">It is difficult for the Government to reconcile the needs of stakeholders, which are very pressing and rather difficult. Most of us probably would agree that there are four functions of prisons; namely, to punish,  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1187"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to prevent reoffending by incapacitation; to deter; and to rehabilitate. We do not have the time today to argue about the efficacy of any of that, although there is some doubt about the validity of those arguments in each case. But we have to recognise that there is some popular pressure to up-tariff, to give longer sentences and to have more people in prison. There is clearly some political debate between the parties on this. We have to weigh the rights of victims, prisoners and, above all, their families. One of the most significant points probably is the maintaining of the independence of the judiciary to make sure that the public have confidence in the sentencing structure and give it their support.</p>

<a name="80207-0005.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="08020782000187">On top of that, there is the matter of money and the competing needs of other government departments&#146; spending plans and getting enough money into the system, because there is never enough. Getting that balance right probably is the greatest challenge facing government and being able to do the right thing. Most governments want to do the right thing; the difficulty is turning it into action. On these proposed reforms, I support very much the need for someone to be in charge. There must be a point of responsibility.</p>

<a name="80207-0005.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="08020782000188">When we look at what we want out of getting the balance right, the great win is returning women to the community with a strong chance of not reoffending. Last year, I was talking to a female Congressman in the United States. She explained that she had to persuade her electors to vote on money for prisons. It was a matter of direct contact. She made a very good point when she said that when she campaigned, she gave people a simple message. Referring to prisoners in general, she said, &#147;Whatever we do, one day, these people will come out of prison. When they come out, what do you want them to do? Do you want them to do something useful; or do you want them to deal drugs to your children, rob you or burgle you?&#148;. We have a great responsibility to make sure that, particularly in the context of today&#146;s debate, women leave prison equipped in the right way. We should be optimistic. In her report, the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, sensed that there is a will for change and that the Government have accepted it. Let us make sure that the will turns into reality. In the end, wills are measured in deeds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="08020782000189">Good things are happening in England and in the rest of the world. Earlier this year I spent a day as the guest of Sheriff Wade in Henrico County, Virginia. I spent several hours in a small unit of 30 women, which was set in a larger prison. The women&#146;s stories would not have been unfamiliar to readers of the Corston report, including stories about drug use, prostitution and causing death by dangerous driving when drunk. But, unusually, this facility was largely run by the women. I sat in a circle with the women and listened to how they support each other and how the unit works. The outcomes were most impressive. As regards the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, it was a cheaper solution and was a very good service. If anyone is going to the east coast of the United States, I counsel them to look at this unit&#151;it can be done. The cost was US$67 a day,

It costs a bit less than the &#163;49,000 a year in Holloway and the &#163;36,000 a year at Styal. We should find better ways.</p>

<a name="80207-0005.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="08020782000190">In all my years working in and around the prison system, that day was one of the best. The women were sitting around in their blue uniforms and most of them were aged under 35. One of them, who had been in prison many times, said, &#147;For the first time, I will be leaving prison feeling better about myself and I will not be back&#148;, and I believed her.</p>

The noble Baroness met and interviewed many people. It was most interesting to hear about that today.</p>

<a name="80207-0005.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="08020782000193">I shall concentrate on chapter 7 of the review, which deals with the health of those vulnerable women. In the report, there are many challenges to address and I can think of no better Minister to do that than the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. He has years of experience in health. Now, as a Minister of Justice, he could not be better placed to tackle and improve these most difficult matters.</p>

<a name="80207-0005.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="08020782000194">We are discussing a topic that should be considered a priority for many reasons. There is a crisis in the prison system. The prison population is rising at about 400 a week. No one wants that, but it just seems to go on happening. Some of those prisoners will be women. On Tuesday, a meeting of the All-Party Group on Penal Affairs was told that, because of the crisis, prisoners will be locked up from Friday lunchtime for the weekend, which means that activities will be cut as well. If that happens, it will be a disaster for vulnerable female prisoners who often suffer depression and are at risk of suicide.</p>

<a name="80207-0005.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="08020782000195">I hope that the Minister will look at women in prison as being different from those in the male establishment. They are different and have different pressures. In 1997, I was asked to chair a committee which produced a report on young people, alcohol and crime for the Home Office. We had 50 recommendations. The same problems that we found then seem to be worse today. Chapter 7 of the Corston report mentions the problems of substance abuse. The number of young female binge drinkers has become widespread and alcohol abuse should be high on the agenda of public health. The alcohol strategy for prisons was long awaited, but when it came it was disappointing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="08020782000196">Drug treatment in women&#146;s prisons has improved and there are some very committed people working in this field. Again, in Chapter 7, the problem of mental health in women prisons seems to be a serious problem. But even more difficult are the problems of dual diagnosis. I do not think that enough has been said about this in the report. Unless those people who have a mental illness and an addiction to alcohol and drugs are treated in a holistic way, they may fall through the net of treatment. There needs to be trained staff who can treat this dual condition.</p>

<a name="80207-0005.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="08020782000197">During a visit to Holloway prison, some time ago, I met two nurses who said that they did not have the correct training in mental health, and they pointed out some young women who, they said, should not have been there as they were mentally ill. I ask the Minister what is to be done about this. These vulnerable women will have to be re-integrated into the community at some stage. With different PCTs involved, what systems are in place to do this? When I was on the Yorkshire Regional Health Authority and many of the hospitals for mentally ill patients were closing, I remember saying, &#147;Unless there are adequate facilities to deal with them in the community some will land up in prison&#148;, and that is what has happened. It is not a satisfactory situation. The report says that many women coming into prison have poor general health and many are not registered with a GP, and that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"><a name="08020782000585">&#147;Registration with a GP should be an integral part of the resettlement process&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000549">I agree with that.</p>

<a name="80207-0005.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="08020782000198">There are some interesting characteristics of the female prison population. Women tend to commit less crime and their offences are generally less serious. In 2004, 36 per cent of sentenced women had committed drugs offences and 17 per cent were convicted of violence against the person, as well as theft, handling and robbery. Just over 19 per cent of the women in prison are foreign nationals compared to about 12 per cent in the male estate. Of the female estate, 30 per cent is from ethnic minorities in comparison to around 24 per cent of the male estate. Women tend to have a different type of drug use from men, with higher levels of hard drug use. Women are normally the primary carers of elderly relatives and children. Around 55 per cent of women in prison have a child under 16, 33 per cent a child under five and 20 per cent are lone parents. Because of the relatively small number of women&#146;s prisons and their geographical location, women tend to serve their sentences further from their homes than do male prisoners. That can place additional pressures on important links with the family. Up to  80 per cent of women in prison have diagnosable mental health problems, with 66 per cent having symptoms of neurotic disorders; in the community, it is less than 20 per cent. Up to 50 per cent of women in prison report having experienced physical, emotional or sexual abuse. Self-inflicted deaths are not easy to predict. The incidence of self-injury among women in prison is significantly high, given that they make up roughly  6 per cent of the prison population. Approximately  30 per cent of female prisoners self-injure, compared to 6 per cent of males. The proportion of young offenders who self-injure is higher. Those are some of the reasons that female prisoners should not be locked

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="08020782000199">I agree with all the recommendations at the end of Chapter 7. The report stresses what makes these women particularly vulnerable; many will have experienced childhood sexual abuse, domestic violence, emotional and violent abuse, substance addiction and self-harm. The noble Baroness, Lady Corston, has also stressed several times that the NHS should provide health care services to police custodial suites in busy areas. That will require a 24-hour presence and, ideally, a registered healthcare worker. I hope that the report will not only be discussed but that action to improve matters around those women with particular vulnerabilities will  happen soon.</p>

Women, and particularly women in trouble with the law, need, more than most, collaboration between support services, particularly if they are drug users, have suffered abuse, have mental health problems and poor educational achievement, as many have.</p>

That will be extended to a further 20 prisons over the next 12 months, with the Department of Health. Primary care trusts now provide prison health services, including treatment services.

More than one in five women in prison are foreign nationals and 80 per cent of them are convicted of drugs offences. I ask the Minister how many of those foreign nationals are drug mules exploited by traffickers to carry drugs between countries.</p>

That is a completion rate of 73 per cent, which is very high. National Treatment Agency research on the impact of treatment consistently shows that women do better in drug treatment in terms of retention, completion and self-reported satisfaction, then men. Black women do particularly well. The National Treatment Agency is undertaking work in relation to developing the women&#146;s offender health strategy, a work stream within the improving health, supporting justice strategy that is currently out for consultation. We are doing that analysis to review how effectively the drug intervention programme is engaging women offenders. The evidence that we have so far suggests that women are experiencing a slightly better rate of engagement and retention than men. We hope to undertake a more detailed analysis of that.</p>

Issues around support for families, education and employment opportunities, housing and social care are essential to support treatment outcomes. For women, that issue needs particular attention. My noble friend Lady Corston and the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, pointed out that the dispersal issue militates against women performing well. Due to the smaller number of female prisons, prisoners are often held a long way from their homes and families. That makes resettlement and maintaining contact harder, especially if they are substance misusers.</p>

Through this and other good practice, the council states that the numbers of women going into prison is falling, with an increase for those in the women&#146;s treatment service receiving community treatment services. There is good practice around. I ask the Minister how this good practice is being shared so that there is a continuous learning cycle.</p>

The Government response has been positive about this with regional offender managers now having to consider the needs of women in their regions as part of the service level agreement negotiations with probation boards. Substance misuse must be a feature. Again, we must look to developing good practice, monitoring progress and sharing what good practice emerges.</p>

There is much being established in relation to women in the criminal justice system and many approaches to substance misuse are being tried out. I wonder if my noble friend, to whom we are indebted for this debate today, will consider bringing this issue back in a year&#146;s time so that we can assess progress. I sense there will be all-party consensus and concern, so let us look at this issue again. In the mean time I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

I believe it to be a report of monumental significance and I congratulate her on the assiduity and thoroughness of its research, the warm and sensitive humanity that permeates it throughout and the boldness and courage of its recommendations. There was a report about a century ago by Herbert Gladstone, the Home Secretary of the day, which changed the whole ethos of society in relation to prisons generally.

There are so many other matters that I agree with&#151;indeed, I agree with almost every word that has been spoken, and spoken with such authority and conviction, by all who have taken part in this debate. On sentencing, one of the most intriguing and unsatisfactory of phenomena has been this sharp rise in the percentage of women who appear before the courts who have been sentenced to imprisonment. Between 1992 and 2000&#151;and I suspect that the figures are no better post-2000, but perhaps the Minister can confirm that&#151;the percentage of women who appeared before the courts and were sent to prison went up by 500 per cent. During that time, the increase in relation to men was of a very different scale. I think it is extremely significant that during the same years, the percentage of women who were made the subject of remand in custody, pending trial or pending sentence, increased by 196 per cent, as is mentioned in the report. In the case of men, the increase was 52 per cent.</p>

I suspect that that does not do the Minister justice and I look forward to his dealing with the matter rather more fully when he comes to wind up. The justice of the situation demands not a common policy in relation to women, but a different policy. That is the only way in which equality can be brought about.</p>

I felt, as did so many of my colleagues, that there was a cohort of misery and despair that women fitted into. The reason for the criminality was not the desire to commit criminal offences&#151;it was that they were led in one way or another through strange and miserable paths to that situation. Often the pressures stem from the responsibility of family life, sometimes there is coercion from a partner and very often there is a mental disturbance, drug or solvent abuse, and so forth. Unless one accepts this to be the basis&#151;and this is the reality of the situation&#151;we will never get anywhere near doing justice to women in relation to criminal offences.</p>

It is the most powerful body, chaired by the Lord Chief Justice. The guidelines that it issues have the force of law under Section 172 of that Act.

As I said last week, over the past 12 years I have been particularly concerned about the position of women in prison. The position was brought to my notice literally within two minutes of taking over as Chief Inspector of Prisons when I was alerted to the problems in Holloway. On inspecting it 10 days later, I discovered that women in labour were routinely being chained, and all sorts of other things that I simply could not equate with the word &#147;civilised&#148; as it is understood in any country.</p>




<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1195"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1195</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80207-0006.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="08020782000223">During my years of inspection I was continually alarmed by the fact that the Prison Service resolutely refused to make anyone responsible for women in prison. The noble Baroness, Lady Corston, referred to the fact that no one is in charge and there is no collective memory. When I found that some other prisons were totally and utterly unacceptable&#151;Wormwood Scrubs, Feltham and Wandsworth to name but three&#151;we adopted the procedure that the Prison Service area manager had to produce an action plan which contained a list of our recommendations on what should happen. We named the person who was responsible for doing something about it and stated by when it should be done. That programme was copied to the Home Secretary and to me and it was updated at six-monthly intervals. After about two years I would go in as chief inspector to see what had happened under the plan.</p>

<a name="80207-0006.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="08020782000224">A follow-up inspection was essential to ensure that progress had been made and was continuing to be made. In my debate last week I called for a women&#146;s justice board&#151;a word which the noble Baroness rejected in favour of &#147;commission&#148;, which seems to be the in-word. However, she was asking for exactly the same thing as I have recommended: an action body that has responsibility for ensuring that the recommendations are brought to pass. I have looked back and read the recommendations in my 1997 report <I>Women in Prison,</I> and I find that many of the recommendations are the same. Not only did we recommend small units around the country; we actually gave as an example one such unit in America and described how it worked. But nothing happened.</p>

<a name="80207-0006.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="08020782000225">The statistics I produced included the number of women who had been abused, and people were shocked. I concluded that to handle these women properly, the Prison Service should begin with the understanding that every woman might have been abused and to behave accordingly, not the other way round. That applied particularly to male prison officers. When I went, for example, to a women&#146;s unit at Risley prison, I was concerned that it was completely and utterly excluded from everything that could be described as progress or decent humane treatment. It was an island of misery and deprivation which again shamed the Prison Service. I was extremely glad that the women were moved&#151;a move prompted by an extremely concerned member of the board of visitors telephoning me at five o&#146;clock in the evening to say that the arrangement could not go on. I was there with my inspectors by nine o&#146;clock in the morning because I was so concerned to get things moving.</p>

<a name="80207-0006.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="08020782000226">I mention that because when I hear from Ministers&#151;who are excellent and of course have something to say&#151;that the action is being devolved to a Civil Service unit, my heart sinks. That is no comment on civil servants, and certainly not on the civil servant I remember doing wonderful work as senior probation officer in charge of the unit in Holloway; there is no question of that. But the arrangement will not work as regards taking action, as we have learnt time and again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="08020782000227">When I have seen things happening in the women&#146;s estate, I have often wondered what would have happened had there been a director of women&#146;s prisons who was able to make objections. Would Bullwood Hall have stopped being a women&#146;s prison, when it was in many ways a centre of excellence for dealing with juvenile and young women and there was no other prison like it? Would Brockhill have been re-rolled when it was the only women&#146;s prison in the West Midlands with a mother and baby unit? Would Cookham Wood have been re-rolled the other day when, if anyone had bothered to go there and look round, they would have found marvellous programmes, the result of considerable investment by the voluntary sector? It now feels a very demotivated place because all its efforts have been wasted and the programmes are gone. The trouble with not having a director is that the good practice identified somewhere is not turned into the common practice everywhere. Inconsistency is therefore added to the other problems because no one is ensuring that what happens to women in Lancashire is happening&#151;or not happening, as the case may be&#151;to women elsewhere.</p>

<a name="80207-0006.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="08020782000228">I was glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, mentioned training. I have always thought that this training provision is absolutely miserable. I remember asking the staff at Holloway about training during my first inspection. They had not received appropriate training in working with women. Three weeks ago I had to go to Trinidad as an expert witness in an extradition case, and I asked about training. I discovered that in Trinidad women have six months&#146; training before going to work in women&#146;s prisons&#151;a three-month course followed by three months of supervised on-the-job training. If Trinidad can get that right, why can we not? And we complain about these things.</p>

<a name="80207-0006.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="08020782000229">This excellent report is one in a long line. I did mine in 1997. In 2000, there was the Prison Reform Trust report. I published a follow-up, A<I></I><I>C</I><I>all to </I><I>A</I><I>ction</I>, in 2001. We had the Fawcett Society report in 2004. When this report was announced to us by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, I rather cynically wondered whether, because she is such a senior figure in the Government, there might at last be some hope of somebody taking some notice of it. I am sure she recognises the volume of support that exists for all that she has said, because people have been saying it over and over again. It is therefore disappointing to find that, yet again, the Government seem not to be listening to the one thing that is absolutely needed; namely, to have someone take real action to get it done. I also welcome the number of noble Lords who have suggested that we must have a further debate to follow up on the action plan and to make certain that we maintain the momentum, even if nobody else does. I congratulate the noble Baroness on her report and I hope it will lead to the action  we all desire.</p>

I speak with no comparable authority so I shall restrict my remarks to one matter which, in the great scheme of things, may seem marginal, but I believe it has its place and should be considered along with other strategies for improving the lot of women in the criminal justice system. It is the contribution that the arts can make in the range of rehabilitation programmes referred to by, among others, my noble friend Lord Carter of Coles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="08020782000232">My noble friend refers in her report to the vulnerabilities that most women offenders have in common. She describes them as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"><a name="08020782000586">&#147;First, domestic circumstances and problems such as domestic violence, child-care issues, being a single-parent; second, personal circumstances such as mental illness, low self-esteem, eating disorders, substance misuse; and third, socio-economic factors such as poverty, isolation and unemployment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000551">We have heard a great deal this afternoon that goes to the truth of that analysis. My noble friend continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"><a name="08020782000587">&#147;When women are experiencing a combination of factors from each of these three types of vulnerabilities, it is likely to lead to a crisis point that ultimately results in prison. It is these underlying issues that must be addressed by helping women to develop resilience, life skills and emotional literacy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80207-0006.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="08020782000233">She also observes of women prisoners whom she met personally:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"><a name="08020782000588">&#147;They were noisy and at first sight confident and brash but this belied their frailty and vulnerability and masked their lack of self-confidence and esteem&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80207-0006.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="08020782000234">The development of resilience, life skills and emotional literacy is hard enough for any of us to achieve, even those of us who live privileged lives untouched by the horrors endured by many women who wind up in prison. Life is challenging, but there are experiences that can help us manage difficulties and give us some perspective on and insight into human relationships. My noble friend&#146;s report shows that damaged or damaging relationships often lie behind behaviour that leads women into contact with the criminal justice system. Some of the most effective experiences can be delivered through engaging the imagination and creativity which debilitating life events can often stifle.</p>

<a name="80207-0006.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="08020782000235">While I was preparing for this debate I came across an article published a year ago in the <I>Guardian</I> called &#147;Can opera save our prisons?&#148;. I imagine the tendency in your Lordships&#146; House would be to assume that the answer to that question is no. The article was written by a former prisoner, Rosie Johnston, who was reporting on the wonderful work of Pimlico Opera, which has been presenting musical theatre in prisons since 1987 using mixed casts of inmates and professional performers, and of Music in Prisons, funded by the Irene Taylor Trust, which runs intensive courses in prisons up and down the UK during which prisoners, male and female, work with professional musicians who, for example, help them to write songs which are then performed in front of an audience of guests, other inmates and sometimes family members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="08020782000236">Rosie Johnston emphasises the importance of this kind of work when she says of her own experience in prison:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"><a name="08020782000589">&#147;Days stacked up; units of boredom ticked off on a calendar. I went on a DIY course on which I was told how to switch on an electric light. I would have put up with a lot for an opportunity like Pimlico Opera&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000237">The founder of Pimlico Opera, Wasfi Kani, a highly respected figure in UK music and herself brought up in difficult circumstances, says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"><a name="08020782000590">&#147;If things had gone slightly differently for me, I could have ended up inside. I'm still doing the prison projects because I've seen people change&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80207-0006.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="08020782000238">In the section of my noble friend&#146;s report on education, training and skills, she observes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"><a name="08020782000591">&#147;Respect for one another, forming and maintaining relationships, developing self-confidence, simply being able to get along with other people without conflict must come before numeracy and literacy skills&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000552">That is perhaps a controversial observation but it is an honest one. As Rosie Johnston points out, many prisoners find conventional courses hard, fail to complete them and become demoralised. Consider, therefore, the fact that Music in Prisons was set up in response to arts programmes being phased out of prisons in favour of key-skills education. Music in Prisons recognises that completing a project is vital to self-confidence and notes that prisoners who cannot engage with mainstream prison education courses will often do well on Music in Prison courses. Music in Prison&#146;s work in Holloway with a group of prolific self-harmers, for example, resulted in no incidence of self-harming among course participants while the course was running and a low incidence for some weeks thereafter.</p>

<a name="80207-0006.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="08020782000239">I could give many more examples of the excellent work being done for women offenders through the arts, but I shall just mention the theatre company Clean Break, whose achievements I have extolled before in your Lordships&#146; House. Clean Break has been working for years with women whose lives have been affected by the criminal justice system, both in prisons and outside. It has warmly welcomed the Corston review, seeing it as,</p>
<ul><a name="08020782000612">&#147;a unique opportunity to effect real change in the way vulnerable women offenders and women at risk of offending are dealt with by society&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="08020782000240">I think we can all agree with that view. Some of what my noble friend's report has revealed does our society no credit. We should not tolerate the physical conditions she describes, nor should we fail to make available proper resources to address the special difficulties that women offenders often have to face. I believe that organisations such as Music in Prisons, Pimlico Opera and Clean Break demonstrate the importance of including the arts in our thinking about how we create a more humane, enlightened system of delivering justice. My question to the Minister is a simple one: will he ensure that the Inter-Ministerial Group on Reducing Re-offending takes seriously the potential value of arts programmes to offender management and works with all relevant departments, NDPBs and the voluntary sector to ensure that funding for them is sustained?</p>

That analysis was powerfully and movingly underlined by the speeches of many noble Lords in the debate on women&#146;s justice initiated last week by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. The debate today has been commendable for its focus on what we need to do rather than simply bemoaning what is wrong, important as that is. I cannot add anything to the analysis without repetition, but thinking about what could usefully be added has turned my thoughts in the direction of institutional reform and the way that we develop policy. That will inevitably take me somewhat wider than the Corston review. I hope that that will not detract from my words of welcome for the report; rather, I hope it may be seen as a tribute to the report that it has stimulated me to think about wider issues.</p>

<a name="80207-0006.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="08020782000242">My starting point, as I reflect on the discussions of criminal justice which we have had since I entered the House, is that the system is not working&#151;indeed, that it could be said to be in crisis. There is evidence of this over a range of fronts and much disquiet among your Lordships, of which the Minister will be aware. I could cite rates and levels of imprisonment at eastern rather than comparable western European levels&#151;the rates of prison overcrowding, the reoffending levels and levels of suicide in prison, and the treatment of young people by our penal system, which has attracted criticism for falling below international standards and has led some of your Lordships to question whether it entitles us to be regarded any longer as a civilised country. And that is just for starters.</p>

<a name="80207-0006.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="08020782000243">The impression of disarray has been compounded by the Government&#146;s response, which seems sometimes to be bordering on panic. Prison overcrowding is met with hand-to-mouth responses, such as early release. The only response bordering on strategy has been to build more prisons, and large ones at that, which can only intensify the problems of institutionalisation. Like building more roads to deal with traffic congestion, it is ultimately self-defeating. It is already beginning to look as though, even before they are built, those 8,000 extra places will not be enough.</p>

<a name="80207-0006.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="08020782000244">The Government, to their credit, are anxious to give the system a degree of coherence. But their instrument for doing so is NOMS, which appears to have been ill starred from its inception. It has already had to be reorganised, and the Minister still cannot tell us about its management structure. As we discussed the other day in the debate on Second Reading, the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill provides further evidence of policy making on the hoof.</p>

<a name="80207-0006.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="08020782000245">It is not, however, my intention to be adversarial. I am sure that the Minister is an excellent Minister with the best of intentions&#151;indeed with the right intentions, as we have seen in recent days as he has made clear his commitment to the welfare of the child, with an emphasis on rehabilitation, resettlement and community sentences&#151;but he has an impossible task in wrestling with a system that is in many ways out of control. At  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1200"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>all events, the closest we have come to a strategy is an attack on the symptoms rather than the underlying causes. As I say, though, I do not wish to be adversarial&#151;quite the reverse. Debates where we bash the Government&#151;however forensically and analytically&#151;and Question Times where we have a bit of sport, simply cause the Minister to put up the shutters and dig in. That may not be the best way of developing a more rational criminal justice policy.</p>

<a name="80207-0006.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="08020782000246">What has all this to do with the Corston report? As I listened to the debate last week on the need for a women&#146;s justice board, it was clear to me that the treatment of women in the criminal justice system is a problem. But it is only a part of the problem. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, called for a women&#146;s justice board, and that prompted the noble Lord, Lord Hastings, to throw out the suggestion of a black Britons&#146; justice board. It seemed to me that this could not be the way to go, with a justice board for every particular problem area in the penal system. Such a piecemeal approach does not seem to make a great deal of sense.</p>

<a name="80207-0006.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="08020782000247">It seems clear to me that we need institutional reform in our approach both to policy making and to managing the penal system. I certainly do not claim to have all the answers here or a neat solution which I can commend to Ministers with a lively sense of a job well done. I had an academic involvement with the penal system at an earlier stage of my career, but that was over 20 years ago, and since entering this House I have been all too well aware of just how out of date my knowledge has become and how much work I have to do to get back up to speed. But I ask the Minister and the Government to think seriously about the point I am making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="08020782000248">A number of possible approaches have been or could be suggested. There is the model of a royal commission. A number of people have been thinking along the lines of establishing a royal commission on the prison system, but I am inclined to think that a fundamental principle of anything we do in this area should be that it is comprehensive, holistic, overarching&#151;however you want to put it&#151;and with a view to giving coherence to our efforts in the field of criminal justice.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="08020782000249">A royal commission would have pros and cons. On the positive side, it would be able to undertake a fundamental and comprehensive review of an area of policy that has proved intractable for successive Governments. The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, has helpfully reminded us of the Gladstone report&#146;s impact in the late 19th century. A royal commission could also be much more inclusive than the present system of policy making seems to be. Would it not be better if the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, were working with the Government on the solution to these problems instead of beating them about the head from the Back Benches? It is important for the Government to be part of any mechanism adopted if there is to be any hope of their owning the solution. It is all too easy for the Government simply to ignore recommendations from bodies that are wholly outside government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="08020782000250">On the other hand, royal commissions are not always effective in setting a clear direction and enabling a fresh start with decisive action. As the late Lord Wilson used to say, royal commissions at their worst sit for years and take minutes.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="08020782000251">If we persisted down the justice board route rather than flirting with a multiplicity of justice boards for different aspects of the criminal justice system, perhaps the idea of a single overarching justice board with subsets for different areas could be investigated. Mention was made in last week&#146;s debate of a tsar. There could be more than one tsar to cover different aspects of the penal system. The important point is that any arrangements set up should include a capacity for decisive executive action to get things done.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="08020782000252">If the Minister is prepared to give some consideration to my suggestion that we should try to find a better way of doing things, he should bear five principles in mind. The first is that any anything that is set up needs to be holistic and overarching with a view to designing, building in and underpinning coherence. Secondly, it should be inclusive. Thirdly, it should have some independence from government, with a view to bringing the best brains and experience to bear on the problem but consistent with significant government ownership. Fourthly, it should be able not only to advise but to make policy. Fifthly, it should have the capacity to make things happen.</p>

First, I was delighted that my good and noble friend Lady McIntosh of Hudnall made the point about music and opera. I never miss a Pimlico opera in prison if I can avoid missing it; it has a tremendous impact. What I like about the approach of Pimlico Opera is that it is aware there could be an awful anti-climax when a performance is over and it continues to do workshops and so on with prisoners. It makes a tremendous contribution to rehabilitation, the restoration of personality and so on.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="08020782000256">My second observation is that while I normally totally agree&#151;almost to an embarrassing degree&#151; with the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, I do not agree with one remark that she made. I think it is terribly important and urgent to have a debate such as this when a report has been published. We have to build up the momentum of concern so that the level of government response takes into account that the report has a great deal of good will and specific support among parliamentarians of all parties.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="08020782000257">I congratulate my noble friend Lady Corston. I had the privilege of serving under her when she was the chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, where she did a tremendous amount to build up the reputation, impact and significance of that committee. She wrote her report with the clarity and firmness that I found  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1202"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was typical of her in the chair and which were informed by deep research and knowledge. Alongside this were her principles, conviction, sensitivity and values. I do not think that there are many parliamentarians who come up to those standards. What I also like about the report is that it is constructive and positive in saying what should be done&#151;it is not just saying what is wrong.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="08020782000258">When we in the Joint Committee on Human Rights were compiling a report on deaths in custody&#151;another deeply disturbing issue&#151;I learned a tremendous amount. The first thing was that there were very many extremely good, compassionate and concerned members of staff in the Prison Service, and I am glad that my noble friend has emphasised that point. But it was interesting that those staff sometimes became almost aggressive to us as parliamentarians&#151;saying, in effect, &#147;What on earth is this system that you expect us to operate? It is completely ill designed for the purpose of achieving rehabilitation and positive citizenship&#148;. Let me give a couple of examples. I was absolutely shocked in Holloway to hear that when the courts closed, male prisons closed their doors and the transport system gave priority to getting the men into prison, so that the women could arrive at Holloway at a very late hour, after the meals were over. It was not just the awful impact on the women prisoners&#151;staff have families and social needs as well, and they would have to stay on to handle the situation. What is more, sometimes it was only then that somebody discovered that there were children at home. I could hardly believe it.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="08020782000259">The other example is that I took on one side a senior male uniformed officer in the prison and said, &#147;Let us forget that I am here with the committee. I am a parliamentarian. What, above all, would you like me to think about when I go back to Parliament?&#148;. He said, &#147;Training&#148;. I said, &#147;But one thing that impresses me is that you are getting more training&#148;. He made an incredibly significant point when he said, &#147;Precisely. That has led us to understand how ill equipped we are for the job that we really want to do&#148;. So the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, is absolutely right&#151;we cannot overemphasise the importance of training.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="08020782000260">The other point made by staff is that prisons are full of people who should not be there at all. We will not go over ground that we have been debating in the criminal justice Bill&#151;my noble friend has been very patient and heard the debate over and again. But I passionately believe that, ideally, we should start again from scratch and design a prison system that is fit for purpose. I believe that at the moment, we are spending vast amounts of public money on trying to patch up and make work a system that is not designed for the purpose that we now understand and for the objectives that we are trying to achieve. This certainly applies to women&#146;s prisons, and the fact that tremendous things are achieved is a double tribute to the staff who operated within the system. But I cannot overemphasise the sense of frustration that they sometimes feel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="08020782000261">What we are talking about&#151;as the noble Baroness has stressed, is vulnerability. You only have to look at the beginning of the report, page 3, to see listed there the fact that:</p>

Drug addiction plays a huge part in all offending and is disproportionately the case with women ... Mental health problems are far more prevalent among women in prison than in the male prison population&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000553">I pick those points to illustrate the precise nature of the observations made by my noble friend in her report.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="08020782000262">I have a daughter who leads a team of counsellors for women with mental health problems in deprived communities. Almost every time that I meet my daughter, I have to put up with a tirade of indignation at the shortage of resources for this work. She and her colleagues can see that this sort of work helps to keep women together and to prevent the development of situations that result in prison. As a society, we have to wake up and put our money where our analysis is. If we believe in prevention, we have to finance prevention. We cannot go on with a health service in which mental health is regarded as a tail-end Charlie, fobbed off with professions of concern. It needs large resources and real priority.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="08020782000263">I conclude by drawing noble Lords&#146; attention to the excellent observation by INQUEST on the report. It stresses my points about the difficulty that women have in accessing support before they end up in prison, the difficulty that families have in assisting the care and support of vulnerable women while they are in prison, and the lack of support for women after deaths in custody. I think that this is a highly relevant, effective and important report. I believe that the Government cannot give it enough priority. I conclude with the observation that I made on one of my amendments last night&#151;that all of us have a responsibility, because we cannot expect the Prison Service to provide by proxy the fulfilment of ideals that are singularly absent in the way that we conduct ourselves in society. We have made a society based on greed and egocentric individualism, in which compassion and care have been marginalised, and then we expect the Prison Service somehow to put that right. We cannot isolate our concern here from the general situation within society and the general values of society.</p>

I am deeply grateful for this report and the opportunity today to look at their situation. A running theme of this debate is that many of these women and girls have been victims throughout their lives. My reflection on this is that unfortunately, and too often, we join in this victimisation&#151;and we should consider how unconstructive that is. A woman who has been brought up in care and separated from her mother eventually ends up in custody. Instead of being encouraged to take responsibility for her actions, what she sees is that, &#147;The state is now taking my children away from me&#148;. That does not encourage her to think, &#147;What harm am I causing myself?&#148;. Rather she will say, &#147;Just as in my previous life I have been the object for others to do things to, now the state is taking my children away&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="08020782000265">What struck me about the words used by the Minister of State, Beverley Hughes, when she launched the <I>Care Matters: Time for Change</I> White Paper on looking after children, was the repetition of &#147;stability, stability, stability&#148;. That is what all of us want for children in care&#151;stability in their lives. One paper associated with this report concerned continuity in care<I>. </I>That was the theme&#151;we want more continuity. It is a theme of the Children and Young Persons Bill going through the House at the moment. We have heard some of the facts, but perhaps I may draw your Lordships&#146; attention to a report from the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England&#151;his organisation is called 11 Million. The report states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"><a name="08020782000593">&#147;For 85 per cent of mothers, prison was the first time they had been separated from their children for any significant length of time. Only 9 per cent of the children are cared for by their fathers while their mothers are in prison. Just 4 per cent of women prisoners&#146; children remain in their own home once their mother has been sentenced&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000554">As we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Carter, around 18,000 children each year are separated from their mothers by imprisonment. Therefore, on the one hand, we have a Minister heading a department saying that children often very similar to those I have just been discussing need stability, stability, stability and continuity of care and, on the other hand, we are taking 18,000 children out of the care of their parents and causing them to lose their homes at the same time. What sense does that make?</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="08020782000266">A little while ago, the parliamentary All-Party Group on Penal Affairs heard from a young woman in care. She was in a children&#146;s home at the age of 13. One day, out of the blue, she was told that she would have to remove herself from that home as she was being placed elsewhere. The staff had been advised not to tell her that this was happening because they knew that it would be problematic. She said that that was when her years of crime began, adding: &#147;I fought those people when they sought to take me out of that home&#148;. Therefore, we need to rethink our approach in this area, where we are introducing so much instability into the lives of children who are often the most vulnerable.</p>

Perhaps I may remind your Lordships of the work of Louise Casey at the Rough Sleepers Unit a few years ago. She achieved the specific target set for her by the Government of reducing by two-thirds over three years the number of rough sleepers on the streets. I remember her pet talks in which she described vividly and passionately the need to support these people. She was often controversial. She urged people not to give money to beggars on the streets because they would only be supporting their habit and encouraging them to stay there. That was unpopular with many charities but she drove things through. She was passionate and experienced. She had been a deputy director of Shelter and had worked indirectly with homeless people, supporting their housing. She also described having been a restless teenager herself and having considered rough-sleeping, so there may be some

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="08020782000268">In her report, the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, speaks of the Asha, Calderdale and 218 centres. She says of the women there:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"><a name="08020782000594">&#147;These women were shining example of &#145;victims&#146; turned &#145;survivors&#146;&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000555">I was struck that, instead of further punishing these women&#151;although punishment is sometimes necessary&#151;and victimising them further, the centres were empowering them. The noble Baroness comments:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"><a name="08020782000595">&#147;One of the women I met there told me that she had experienced prison many times; it had taught her nothing and she said she was simply able always to blame others for her predicament&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000556">It does not surprise me that the evidence on these centres shows that they are helpful in reducing reoffending because people take responsibility for their actions and feel empowered. The noble Baroness goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"><a name="08020782000596">&#147;Asha, however, had challenged her behaviour and for the first time in her life she was accepting responsibility for her own actions and thinking about their consequences. Another women at Asha with a similar background told me that no one in prison had ever told her that her criminal behaviour was wrong and she had never faced up to this before coming to Asha ... Asha&#146;s founder believes that women can be destroyed by prison, which separates them from their children. Most women want to be good mothers and sometimes this is the only positive thing in their lives. To take it away when it is all that matters to them can cause huge damage&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000557">I recall research from the Home Office which indicated that, generally speaking, if offenders can be connected with their families and sustain relationships, that is very important in reducing reoffending.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="08020782000269">I quote once more from the report:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"><a name="08020782000597">&#147;Bringing women together at centres like Asha and Calderdale helps them to understand that others have encountered similar problems, feel less isolated and start to find solutions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000558">That takes us back very much to a debate that we had on the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill concerning alcohol treatment. We discussed the importance of former alcoholics speaking to young people who needed their help in refraining from alcohol misuse. That can be a very helpful approach. When vulnerable individuals meet people who have struggled with the same issues that they are experiencing and have come through the other side, that can be inspiring and effective.</p>

<p><a name="08020782000560">I know that these issues are very difficult but I think that the Government might do more, and might have done more in the past, looking at the research and evidence of what works and acting on it. I know that that is difficult politically but there needs to be a strong consensus between all parties on what is the civilised thing to do. I welcome the call made by my noble friend Lord Low for some sort of national debate. That echoes what the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Anne Owers, said recently in her report. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

In the past couple of days during debates on the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, we have had a lot of talk about human rights and the Joint Committee on Human Rights. During that time, I have declined to associate myself with the usual gang of suspects, one of whom is here today in the form of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, who has served on that committee. I, too, served on it for a short while and, when I knew that the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, had been charged with this task, it was evident that she would perform it with not just the diligence but the radicalism, combined with good sense, that she brought to the committee during the time I served on it. Therefore, it was a pleasure to read her excellent work. However&#151;the Minister knows that there is always a &#147;however&#148;&#151;it is a shame that the Government have taken as long as they have to move to its implementation.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="08020782000272">Since I started shadowing the Ministry of Justice and dealing with prisons, I have discovered that change is the order of the day. The problem is that change seems to be taking place in the absence of strategic leadership and with a decided lack of vision. We heard yesterday on the radio that apparently more than 50 reviews have been ordered since the current Prime Minister took over a few months ago. It would not be entirely surprising if that happened within the first year or two of a new Government. The problem is that it is happening 10 years after they took office, so we must draw our own conclusions.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="08020782000273">However, on the issue in hand today, perhaps we need to reinvent the wheel&#151;or to improve its alignment to the rest of the cart quite comprehensively. As I said, we welcomed the report for taking an in-the-round look at what needs to be done and we agree with a good number of the recommendations of the noble Baroness, Lady Corston. We particularly like her emphasis on tackling the underlying issues to do with vulnerabilities, such as personal circumstances, familial pressure points and socio-economic factors. However, we have a few reservations. One is that we regret that she sees as a linchpin of her strategy the need for interdepartmental committees rather than a more clearly delineated, stand-alone body with sufficient powers, budgets and staff to make things happen. As it is, the interdepartmental group will consist of seven Ministers or so, on whom this additional remit will be tacked on to their existing functions. A point made eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, last week in his debate on this  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1207"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issue, as well as today, is that it will be impossible for these people to do the jobs they are consigned to do well in addition to what they are now charged to do.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="08020782000274">The noble Baroness, Lady Corston, has tried to reassure us that her honourable friends are up to the job. We have no doubt that they are; the trouble is that they already have a surfeit of jobs. You would have thought that their main jobs, as Solicitor-General, Minister for Equality or Minister for Women, would be sufficiently important in scope and brief for them to need to concentrate on those. It does not sit with the importance that this area deserves to be tacked on the way it is to other roles.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="08020782000275">We particularly welcome the recommendation for the immediate creation of a commission for women who offend or who are at risk of offending. This, in our view, is critical to that logic of strategic leadership which is needed urgently to knock heads and to make the seven different departments with interests in this area come together. We would prefer, as per the original proposals, to see the commission for women established as a non-departmental public body or within the aegis of the Ministry of Justice, as we now discover it is going to be. We do not wish to be particularly prescriptive about this but suffice it to say it should be located wherever it is able to provide the strongest and most effective direction. We are therefore disappointed that the Government have only gone as far as to accept this recommendation  in principle.</p>

<a name="80207-0007.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="08020782000276">We now await a cross-departmental criminal justice women&#146;s unit, which will be working with other departments. It will, we are told, monitor progress and then report to the IMG. We fear that this unit will soon become encumbered in minutiae. It will be subsumed to different political priorities and will have as its strategic role a subordinate role&#151;we assume&#151;to the direction of travel prioritised by the &#147;prison and penal aspects of policy&#148; brigade rather than the part of the remit which deals with women at risk of offending, which we thought was one of the great innovations in the report by the noble Baroness, Lady Corston.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="08020782000277">I am aware that we also have the IMG for reducing reoffending, but the organisational chart in the report of the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, on page 79 does not provide for a link to this group. This underpins why we see the commission for women as the place for strategic direction and leadership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="08020782000278">Let me turn to the more recent changes for, as we see it, they will have an impact on where and how the recommendations of this report will go forward. We heard last week that the flagship body set up only three years ago, the National Offender Management Service, is now to be dismantled. NOMS, as we recall, was to offer management through prison and probation systems to successful release back into the community. We are told that NOMS will be stripped down and a sort of NOMS-lite will be the more focused body but:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"><a name="08020782000600">&#147;The concept of end-to-end management for all prisoners will be abandoned as the Government looks to impose cuts across the prison and probation services&#148;.</p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="08020782000279">This will be the third shake-up of prisons and probation services in seven years. We also have the result of the review by the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles. While we have seen his report, we are not entirely clear as to how many of his proposals will go forward in the way that he envisaged. We seem to be getting increasingly fragmented responses through IMGs and action plans while one theme remains constant: that Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Prisons continues to highlight the mess that exists in our prison policy. Coming to the fact that we have had two separate debates on women&#146;s justice and prisons in the last two weeks, plus the changes we have seen to NOMS and to prisons and probation services, could we get an indication from the Minister that we will get regular appraisals from the IMGs as to how the changes are bedding down?</p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="08020782000280">I am coming to the end of my time but let me briefly say that it is clear from the debates last week and today that there is much good will and concern to address these issues. We heard the plea of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, for the noble Lord, Lord Lester, to look at some of these things and I will draw his attention to this debate. We were intrigued by the views of the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, on prison design. The physical environment is undoubtedly key to issues to do with humanity&#146;s most basic precepts. I wonder if the architectural competition committee that he envisages could also include prison staff and prisoners, as both would be the most frequent users of the system. The noble Baroness, Lady Massey, welcomed the national service framework for women. Is its implementation programme still on target to roll out from June 2008?</p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="08020782000281">The debate today has been replete with innovative suggestions to promote life skills such as the emphasis of the noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh, on the arts in rehabilitation. These would be the ideal interventions to be funded by the National Lottery. I will support her plea to the Minister.</p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="08020782000282">Let me finish with the thoughts of the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, on the need for a royal commission. We are always pleased on these Benches for those on other Benches to be reminded of what true reform can look like, and Gladstone would have much to tell us on this issue today. Given the number of piecemeal studies and proposals for change, if this lot of reforms do not work, maybe we should move to a comprehensive look at crime and punishment through a royal commission. The problem is that the royal commission and anything it achieves will have come nearly a generation too late for those currently incarcerated. That will have been our collective failure as a society.</p>

I also congratulate her on her patience in waiting for some six months for first the Home Office and then the Ministry of Justice to respond to that report with what I think she described as something of a curate&#146;s egg, even if 39 and a half of her 43 recommendations seem to have been accepted.</p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="08020782000285">I also, yet again, offer my commiserations to the Minister, who has had another very busy week with two days on the criminal justice Bill, a number of Questions to be answered at the Dispatch Box, a similar debate to this last week as well as the debate on war-making powers, and so on. It raises one question: if perhaps the Ministry of Justice did slightly less&#151;this is possibly wishful thinking&#151;it might do it slightly better. Yet again, I will make my plea to the Minister that he could start by scrapping the criminal justice Bill and going away to give it some proper thought before bringing it back to this House. </p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="08020782000286">I have a number of questions for the noble Lord. I did not manage to get all my questions out last week but there are one or two I certainly want to repeat this week. Last week I mentioned the timely nature of the debate of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, in that it came so soon after the launch of the annual report of Her Majesty&#146;s inspector. I asked the Minister when the Secretary of State would be responding to that and whether we will get a chance in due course to debate that matter in this House. I repeat that question and I think all Members of the House would like to hear an answer.</p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="08020782000287">Secondly, I must return to Titan prisons and the recommendation in the noble Baroness&#146;s report, which quite rightly goes in the opposite direction when she writes about the need for more smaller, local prisons. The Government seem to have been strangely silent on that point, although I noticed that the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, whose original report suggested Titan prisons, was in agreement with her in not going down the route of Titan prisons for women&#146;s prisons but looking for smaller prisons. I also noted the point she made that even if there were to be Titan prisons, they must not be mixed. That would be a complete disaster in provision for women.</p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="08020782000288">The argument that the noble Lord put forward on Titan prisons&#151;as I understand him, and no doubt he will correct me if I have got it wrong&#151;is that they are not really Titan prisons but a number of smaller prisons on the same site. That misses the point in terms of the recommendation made by the noble Baroness that we need more smaller units. It is not so much the size of the unit, but the fact that we need something local for women prisoners if we are to help them maintain contact with their families. This point was made by a number of noble Lords. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, made it and emphasised the fact that on average each female prisoner is some 58 miles&#151;I cannot remember if that was the precise figure&#151;away from home. The noble Baronesses, Lady Masham and Lady Massey, also stressed this point. I am sure the Minister will accept that what is needed are more local units so that prisoners can be closer to home. I hope he will accept that that is why so many noble Lords have been objecting to Titan prisons. It is not their mere size that is objected to; it is the fact that, by definition, they cannot be local.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="08020782000289">I have one or two other points that I would like to put to the Minister, but I am very wary of the time and will make sure that I sit down to give him his 20 minutes to respond. First, I shall ask about overcrowding. Many of the social factors that influence criminal behaviour are broadly similar for men and women. They include mental health problems, drug addiction, education, housing and employment, yet the Government have been exacerbating overcrowding to such an extent that it is almost impossible to rectify any of those issues while women are in prison. Indeed, manifest failures in prison security mean that many offenders are getting on drugs while they are in prison. Do the Government not recognise that tackling overcrowding and reforming prison regimes are vital for reducing offending? The same could be said about the high levels of self-harm by female prisoners that various noble Lords have mentioned. Would the Minister not accept that there is a relationship between overcrowding and the number of women in prison who self-harm or commit suicide?</p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="08020782000290">Turning to bail and remand&#151;I will keep my remarks brief so that the Minister can give a full response&#151;the Minister will be aware that the Prison Reform Trust estimates that six out of 10 women imprisoned on remand are acquitted or given a non-custodial sentence. Given that, and the recent high-profile examples of offending on bail, would the Minister accept that the Government&#146;s policy on bail and remand is not being directed at the right people? I ask him to look carefully at that figure of six out of 10 women on remand who do not go on to prison.</p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="08020782000291">I have other questions and still have some three minutes to go, but bearing in mind that we started at quarter to the hour, I think, I should stop now to allow the Minister to make the full response he always makes to the House and to allow the noble Baroness to respond briefly to his remarks.</p>

I am most appreciative. I am delighted that this morning we have had an opportunity to hear from my noble friend Lady Corston. It is not surprising that her report has been so rightfully praised from almost every quarter. It is excellent, and she made an excellent speech to open this debate.

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="08020782000294">Today we heard compelling reasons about why we need to implement my noble friend&#146;s report in the way that we are doing. Vulnerabilities characterise so many women in prison: mental health problems, drug misuse, sexual and domestic abuse, concerns about children&#146;s welfare and the number of children affected by their mother being in prison. Those points are very strong indeed. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, talked about the impact on children and gave us much food for thought.</p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="08020782000295">That brings us to the question of sentencing policy. Just as I have been saying about the policy of the Government in relation to children in custody, I want to make it clear that we believe that custody should be reserved for offenders who need to be there because of the seriousness of their offending or the risk they present to others. That remains and will continue to be our philosophy. That means that a lot of emphasis must go into community provision. I agree with the points made by a number of noble Lords about the importance of prevention of reoffending programmes, rehabilitation, resettlement and accommodation. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, spoke about the contribution peers can make to help that process. That was a point my noble friend Lord Bach made in relation to the alcohol programmes when there was some confusion two days ago.</p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="08020782000296">The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, presented to us a very serious question about sentencing. The figures I have here show that although women still comprise less than 6 per cent of the prison population, in the 10-year period between 1995 and 2005, the increase in the prison population was 126 per cent for women compared to 46 per cent for men. He suggested that there were some psychological factors at play. There is no doubt that the courts have been sentencing women more severely and making greater use of custody for less serious offences. There are some signs that since 2005 that has stabilised. We have not seen another large increase since then.</p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="08020782000297">That clearly brings us to sentencing guidance, about which the noble Lord made some important points. Sentencers have to follow the law and guidelines, which already make it clear that prison is to be used only when an offence is so serious as to merit a custodial term. I also take on board the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and others, about the number of women on bail or on remand. That is a factor that we also need to look at very carefully.</p>

<a name="80207-0008.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="08020782000298">In our response to my noble friend's report, the Government undertook to re-emphasise to courts the whole question of sentencing guidelines and the availability of the community sentencing structure as an alternative. However, I will make sure that my colleagues responsible for this in the department have a clear read-out of the comments made today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="08020782000300">We had a debate last week on governance arrangements. Some noble Lords feel that an interministerial group is not the best way to approach what we all want&#151;which is concerted action to ensure that my noble friend&#146;s report is implemented with vigour and determination. But my experience is that where you have a clear aim and a lot of Ministers are involved, that is a good way to get the kind of ministerial leadership that is required. If you have ministerial leadership and commitment, you can get things done. I understand the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, that if you are also Solicitor-General or Minister for Children you have other responsibilities and you may not give the matter your full attention. But the obverse of that is that you have senior Ministers carrying out important roles. They are the very people you want round a table to make sure that the right decisions are made and that those decisions are carried through. Anybody who knows my honourable friend Maria Eagle will know that she is a very determined character. Her office is next door to mine so I know how determined she is. I have every confidence that she will give the leadership that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, so rightfully demanded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="08020782000301">I know that there are questions about the status of the senior civil servant who will lead the joint unit. That is an important question. It is important that that person has the authority to drive through the changes that are required. My belief and contention is that, with the support of the champion Minister, that determination will be shown in evidence as we develop this. That leads us to the question of NOMS, which we have debated in the past 24 hours. I want to make it clear that this is not a question of watering down the integrated approach to end-to-end offender management. It is an adjustment made necessary by the changes we have made in the machinery of government with the creation of the Ministry of Justice. The kind of split that we now have between operational management, which will be the responsibility of NOMS, and the strategic leadership in a separate directorate in the department is just what you need to get the challenge and leverage to make the changes in policy and action that we all want to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="08020782000302">The noble Lord, Lord Low, made some interesting points about the reform of the machinery of government and had some interesting ideas about a national debate.

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="08020782000303">I now turn to the question of equality and the law, because I hope that I did not confuse noble Lords last week. I was responding to the question of whether there should be a women's justice board. I said that it would replicate the Youth Justice Board. My point was that there is no separate framework in law for women as there is for young people. There would be a problem in establishing a separate sentencing framework in law for women offenders. That is where the reference to the gender equality duty is relevant, because it

My noble friend mentioned a number of exciting community project works that are being undertaken, such as the Asha Centre in Worcester and the 218 project in Glasgow. My noble friend recommended that these initiatives should be developed and replicated elsewhere, and that is what we wish to encourage. We have a cross-department initiative to examine how the services and support delivered by existing community women&#146;s services could be developed further for women offenders and women at risk of offending.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Henley, asked about overcrowding. Of course, the report of my noble friend Lord Carter of Coles enables us to deal with this in a comprehensive way, both in terms of supply-side and demand-side management. We will soon be debating provisions&#151;I will not bet on it but I hope not too far away&#151;in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. I gently point out to the noble Lord, Lord Henley, that his colleague in the other place, Mr David Davis, said in the <I>Daily </I><I>T</I><I>elegraph</I> yesterday that he thought that we should be locking up many more under-18s.

If I get this wrong they will tell me in no uncertain terms. However, the noble Lord, Lord Henley, put that to me and I must answer it. It is clear to say that my noble friend Lord Carter recommended that the Government should continue to develop a strategy that deals with the specific needs of women and suggested that future consideration should be given to reconfiguring some of the smaller prison sites to accommodate female offenders, allowing for a different approach appropriate to their needs.</p>

There is no question that the input of the primary care trust is positive but that much more needs to happen. I take the point that when people leave custody, ensuring continuity of health provision is one way in which one can make resettlement work as effectively as possible. My noble friend Lord Bradley is reviewing a number of these important matters in relation to mental health, and I know that my noble friend Lady Corston will have an input into that work.</p>

I accept that while considerable improvements have been made to gender-specific drug services in prisons, there is more that we can do, and it must remain a high priority. With regard to drug mules, my understanding is that the proportion of women prisoners under immediate custodial sentences who are foreign nationals is 15 per cent, and 56 per cent of foreign national females are serving sentences for drug exportation and importation, with the largest number coming from Nigeria. Of course, this group of women have considerably different resettlement needs from other prisoners, and more is being done to respond specifically to those needs and to help to equip those women when they return to their home country.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>
&#147;With permission, I would like to make a Statement in response to Sir Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s independent review of policing in England and Wales. Copies of the final report have been placed in the Library of the House. I start by thanking Sir  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1216"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1216</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Ronnie for his report. He has worked hard meeting and talking to people up and down the country. I particularly appreciate the work that he has done to include the voices and views of frontline officers. His recommendations are independent and are challenging to all of us, across the political spectrum, and to the police themselves. &#147;In asking Sir Ronnie to carry out this review, we were determined to find the best ways to ensure that the investment that this Government have made in extra police officers and police community support officers has an impact where it counts, with visible teams in every neighbourhood and with officers able to focus on what will really make a difference in continuing to reduce crime levels. The report is wide ranging. It deserves further reflection and discussion. It raises important questions about how working practices can be reformed, so that police officers can get the most out of their job and communities can get the best out of the police. &#147;In the area of reducing bureaucracy, I believe that we can make quick progress, and this where I will focus today. As the Association of Chief Police Officers recognises in its submission to the review, &#145;Current levels of unnecessary bureaucracy are created both within as well as outside the police service&#146;. Sir Ronnie is clear that freeing up police officers to do the job they came into policing to do requires more than simply removing paperwork, important though that is. It is not just about cutting requirements from the centre, important though that is. It requires new thinking on performance management from top to bottom of the police service, new attitudes to risk, new ways of working across the criminal justice system and new technology to support the work of policing. I accept that challenge. We are already making progress in response to Sir Ronnie&#146;s interim report from September.&#147;First, from this April, new public service agreements and targets will provide greater flexibility to focus on what matters locally, on serious violence and on anti-social behaviour, and to streamline the process that gets suspected criminals to court. Secondly, we are consulting on reforms to the working of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act that will reduce police bureaucracy and allow experienced officers to focus on their core roles by making better use of police staff. Thirdly, working with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Justice and the Attorney-General, I am piloting a range of improvements to the way the police work with the courts and the wider criminal justice system. These include virtual courts and new streamlined processes to reduce police and administrative time in preparing prosecution files. &#147;Fourthly, we are investing in new technology to make crime-fighting more effective and to save officers&#146; time&#151;including video identity parades, livescan electronic fingerprinting, body-worn cameras, and the &#163;50 million capital fund that will deliver 10,000 mobile data receivers by September.  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1217"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I want to end the days of officers having to enter details more than once, on systems that do not talk to each other. Sir Ronnie&#146;s final report shows how we can go further, and identifies further savings to the equivalent of 2,500 to 3,500 officers a year. I accept his recommendations to achieve this. &#147;I commend Sir Ronnie for his careful and measured consideration of how to reduce the bureaucracy surrounding stop and account. I agree with his proposal that we should scrap the lengthy form that officers use to record data when they carry out this critical activity. But I do not underestimate the need to build community confidence in policing. We must be able to monitor the proportionality of stops. So I welcome the proposal that we use airwave police radio technology to record any encounter, and that the simple card officers will give out to those stopped will have a phone number that they can call. &#147;We will immediately pilot this new approach to stop and account in three areas and I expect the changes to be national later this year. As the House will know, stop and account is a very different issue from stop and search, for which Sir Ronnie says, &#145;a more formal and comprehensive process is both proportionate and appropriate&#146;. I therefore welcome the work already being done by the Metropolitan Police and the Metropolitan Police Authority, in co-operation with community representatives, to produce a shorter form, which they are introducing later this month. Separately, the use of handheld devices to allow officers to input information directly and create a central record of a stop and search is cutting the average time from 25 minutes to six minutes. In view of the considerable benefits identified, I am calling on all chief constables to streamline their forms and process in the way Sir Ronnie has advocated. Both stop and search and stop and account can be powerful tools in tackling crime. So from April we will extend police powers to tackle gang-related gun and knife crime&#151;enabling officers to stop and search in designated areas where an act of serious violence has taken place, as well as in anticipation of serious violence. &#147;We can now go further in other areas of recording. Sir Ronnie proposes that we endorse a radical new approach being trialled in Staffordshire and other forces, where police are freeing up more time to deal with victims of crime by using a standard one-page form. Officers are able to use their discretion in how much further information they record, proportionate to the severity of the crime. I will ensure that this approach can be introduced nationally as soon as possible. &#147;In today&#146;s report Sir Ronnie celebrates the development and delivery of neighbourhood policing. Thanks to the hard work of forces and police authorities throughout England and Wales, there will be a team for every neighbourhood in April. More than 3,600 teams are now in place, and 16,000 police community support officers have

Up and down the country, at public meetings and in street briefings, local communities are helping to influence their team&#146;s priorities. And throughout March, people will be hearing more about who their local teams are and how they can contact them. &#147;I have asked Sir Ronnie to report back to me in six months on the progress we and the police are making to reduce bureaucracy. This spring, I will publish a Green Paper with proposals for greater flexibility for frontline officers and staff, greater reductions in bureaucracy, strengthened local accountability arrangements and a reformed performance management framework. &#147;Sir Ronnie&#146;s report sets out a powerful challenge for how we can adapt to meet the demands of 21st-century policing: freeing police officers from unnecessary red tape; giving them the skills and the tools for the valuable job they do; delivering neighbourhood policing in every area; and ensuring a better police service, for officers, victims and communities alike. Working together, it is a challenge that I am sure the police service and Government will rise to. I commend this Statement to the House.&#148;

We welcome this thoughtful and incisive report, which has appeared after considerable delay and which takes up many of the challenges that have been made about the police service and the Government&#146;s micromanagement of it. Sir Ronnie has come up with recommendations based on common-sense views on how policing ought to serve its local communities as well as tackling serious crime and security threats. He shows how changes can be made quickly, and without the need to resort to yet more legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="08020782000324">This is a thorough and fascinating report, raising as it does many issues which have been central to the concerns over policing in this country, which has moved from a robust &#147;bobby on the beat&#148;-based organisation to one which has gradually, under this Government, been throttled by red tape, health and safety straitjackets, and implausible targets, pinning police officers to their desks when they should have been out in the streets. Everyone but the Government seems to have known this but it has taken already five reviews of police in nine years, with 150 recommendations, for precious little change to be made. So first, may I ask the Minister, what will change with this report? Do the Government intend to implement all the recommendations made by Sir Ronnie, against the strict timetables he has laid down?</p>

Green Papers almost always herald legislation. Does the Minister anticipate that we will see a Bill, if it is necessary, this Session, or will important changes which require parliamentary time have to wait for the Queen&#146;s Speech, and thus roll on into infinity?</p>

<a name="80207-0009.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="08020782000326">The Government have a real job to do to convince the police and the public that they are determined to relieve the police of the desk-binding paperwork that has jeopardised proper policing for so long. They also have to convince the public that they are determined to get on top of gun, knife and drug crime, and teenage gangs. Gun killings are up by 20 per cent on last year, blade killings by 18 per cent and youth on youth crime is soaring. Two-thirds of the victims of murders in London since January 2007 were black or Asian, so the stop-and-search restrictions and reporting, which were introduced to protect ethnic minorities, have not succeeded in doing so. Will the Minister confirm that police officers will not only be empowered to stop and search for a limited period, without reasonable suspicion, when a serious crime has been committed or is anticipated but will be free to decide the areas where this is necessary? The Home Secretary&#146;s Statement limits this to what are called &#147;designated areas&#148;, so will the Minister tell us: what does that mean; and designated by whom?</p>

<a name="80207-0009.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="08020782000327">The Statement refers to reforms to be considered in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, but it is silent on those that need to be made to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which regulates police surveillance operations, and to reforms on health and safety regulations, which have resulted in the police having a risk-averse culture. Will the Minister say whether consideration can be given to amending these Acts to respond to some of the issues raised by Sir Ronnie&#146;s report?</p>

<a name="80207-0009.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="08020782000328">The report covers many more aspects of the police service than mentioned in the Statement, including more civilianisation, which had already been introduced by the Conservative Government some 15 years ago; the greater use of technology; the allocation of resources; and improvements in the management of the service. The public want to see police when they are burgled, have their cars vandalised, have their shops broken into, are harassed in the street and are frightened by yobs. They will believe that this report has been worth while when they see the changes that Sir Ronnie advises should be made, resulting in the police dealing with crime and not just logging reports without taking further action.</p>

<a name="80207-0009.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="08020782000329">I believe, too, that police officers themselves want to do and be seen to do the job for which they have signed up, and to be assured of the public&#146;s recognition of their professionalism. I hope that that will not be the last we see of this report. I look forward to this House having more opportunities to discuss the way forward. It is an important document and I hope that we will not lose sight of it.</p>

We fully support the need to reduce bureaucracy, and of course we support neighbourhood policing and attempts to create an efficient and accountable police force. It is, however, a shame that it has taken some 11 years to get to where we are. Indeed, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, mentioned, there have been many reviews on the road to this report.</p>

<a name="80207-0009.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="08020782000331">Several issues were only touched on in the brief Statement, and we understand that, but I want to draw out two or three of them. First, on the general need for reform and the hope that we can now make progress, does the Secretary of State recognise that police workforce reforms have perhaps been set back by the folly over the pay settlement? That political controversy, born of a very small pay settlement, could have been avoided and would therefore have created the conditions today for better interaction between those wanting to see reform at the top&#151;the strategic responsibilities&#151;and the police force that has to deliver those reforms. We regret that those relations have broken down.</p>

<a name="80207-0009.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="08020782000332">In the report itself much has been made of the use of technology. We hear of virtual courts, video ID parades, and 10,000 mobile data services by September. We will look closely at the details of these measures, but our concern will be that, in addition to streamlining and reducing workloads, they will impact on civil liberties, data privacy and security? One would have thought that the imbroglio on ID cards, the recent epidemic of data theft and the loss and sheer human incompetence that may well result in data being corrupted, would have made the Government slightly less enthusiastic about resorting to technology so readily. Given that Britain is becoming increasingly concerned about surveillance we expect to examine the Government&#146;s proposals extremely carefully in this regard.</p>

<a name="80207-0009.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="08020782000333">My other point relates to community confidence and the safeguards that have been introduced&#151;we understand the good reason behind them&#151;but I wonder whether the Government have thought through the confidence of ethnic minorities, which will be a key issue. The safeguards were introduced for good reason&#151;most of them in the aftermath of the Macpherson report, when we had serious ethnic minority confidence issues to deal with. We would not wish to see the expense of those safeguards being sacrificed and a further erosion in relations between minorities and the police.</p>

<a name="80207-0009.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="08020782000334">The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, mentioned designated areas, but the text in the Statement on this is rather vague. There is a crucial issue here. At what level and on whom will the responsibility for designation lie? Our concern is that the designation can apply in anticipation of crime being committed. Anticipation is a matter of fairly fine judgment that needs to be borne in mind in the light of the particular circumstances. We have found with other measures that have been introduced in the past couple of years that the level at which these steps are taken is not immediately transparent, and tracing the flow of where responsibility lies becomes extremely obscure.

As a backdrop, I should say that as someone who lives in Hackney and who does not recognise some of the views on Hackney in newspapers, and so on, perceptions are very important. On the introduction to Flanagan&#146;s review, it is important to put all this in a context. He states:</p>
<ul>

<ul><a name="08020782000613">&#147;central spending on policing has risen by nearly &#163;5 billion&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000563">He says that this,</p>
<ul><a name="08020782000614">&#147;has resulted in a 25% growth in the overall police workforce and a 10% increase in the number of police officers&#148;.</ul>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"><a name="08020782000602">&#147;These additional resources have undoubtedly contributed to a significant improvement in performance, with crime falling by a third since 1997 and public confidence in the police, which had been falling consistently since 1982, rising since 2003-04&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="08020782000337">I quote that because the perception of what is said in the media is sometimes very different from reality, and it is worth bearing that in mind. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, talked about common sense. She is correct. All my experience of things such as the application of health and safety and the application of&#151;for want of a better word&#151;bureaucracy is that if there is good leadership and people are willing to take a certain amount of risk at the top of their organisation, these can be applied with much less impact. Sir Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s report shows very clearly that a considerable amount can be done straight away, without needing any legislation or anything else at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="08020782000338">The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked about what work is going on. Certainly, work has gone on since the interim report. I mentioned in the Statement that there are a number of areas where we are already putting things right and moving to correct some of these areas that enhance bureaucracy and have stopped people getting out on the streets. Quite correctly, as we can all identify, the population wishes the police force to be out on the streets to look after us. I go back to the point that there has been, generally, an increase in police numbers and a feeling among the public since 2002-03 that they are doing better. Part of that is to do with the local and community police forces, which have been a huge success and are covered in some depth within this document.</p>

As my colleague, the Home Secretary, said in the other place, we are taking action straight away on stop and account. There is a classic example of the ridiculously  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1222"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1222</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>long document that really is not needed. Did central Government say that this document, in all that length, had to be produced? I do not believe that we did. We said that certain things had to be recorded and we all understand why those things have to be recorded. Some stem from the Stephen Lawrence trial and the work that was done after that. It is interesting that Sir William Macpherson, who was in charge of that inquiry, is very content with the Sir Ronnie&#146;s views in this report about what needs to be recorded. It is quite clear that simply being able to call on the new Airwave radio net to say that you have stopped someone, recorded their name and ethnicity, and given them a card to say how you can be contacted, is a far better way of doing things, Police forces can achieve this themselves if they look at what is required. Some of it takes a certain amount of leadership. Yes, there is stuff from central government as well, but we must all apply ourselves to this.</p>

<a name="80207-0009.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="08020782000340">The Green Paper will be published this spring but I cannot give a precise date. We want to move quickly on the things that are recommended here. We will consider the full range of recommendations on legislation. We cannot act on some of them straight away; clearly, we need to consider those. We will bring forward any legislation that is appropriate. I am aware, and share the concern of the House, that there is too much legislation in lots of areas. I would like to see that rationalised. We have to look very carefully at it. We clearly have to look at this and review. As regards the designated areas, raised by both noble Baronesses, I will get back to them in writing; I am afraid that I do not know the details of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="08020782000341">We have accepted straight away what Sir Ronnie says about increased civilianisation, and about technology and management. These things have to be done very carefully. There has been a lot of civilianisation already. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said, this started under the Conservative Party and it makes a lot of sense. There is no doubt that a fully trained policeman is very expensive. I know, from my experience, that it has happened in the armed services, because a fully trained soldier, sailor or airman is very expensive and we have done a lot of civilianisation. It makes sense to do this, but it has to be done very sensitively. To have 2,500 to 3,500 extra officers available to deploy on the streets is quite dramatic and will make a difference, even across the whole country.</p>

The Government recognise very clearly the vital and hard work that police officers do. This is highly complex in terms of their overall package and how we are going to stage pay reviews. We are looking at doing so over a period of three years. One can always look at a specific area and say that they deserve more. There are issues to do with overtime, what work is done, and all of these things. It is unfortunate that some of the police feel that the Government do not appreciate the work that they do. We very clearly do; there is no doubt whatever about that. When one is in public service, at times this comes around. I remember in the late 1970s   


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1223"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1223</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that that was exactly the feeling we had in the armed services. We felt that we were not paid enough money and that nobody liked us. It was rubbish; clearly people still thought highly of us, but that is the way these things go sometimes. We have to make sure that we get in place a package that makes sense for the police, that is good for them and their families, and that the nation can afford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="08020782000343">I know that there is a great deal of concern about surveillance in a number of quarters. From my experience, there is no doubt that people feel safer when CCTV cameras cover an area. It is unfortunate, but they do. Equally, I am afraid that people are not very nice. You may hear, for example, a group of lads say, &#147;Camera&#148; to each other, because they know that they are being watched. We have to balance those things carefully. None of us wants masses of surveillance. We would love not to have any of it. But I am afraid that that is not the world we are in. Therefore, we have to do a careful balancing act. The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, is absolutely right&#151;we do not like that and we have to look at it very carefully.</p>

<a name="80207-0010.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="08020782000344">She was also correct about reliance on technology. My goodness me, my life has been scarred with relying on technology and one cannot always do that. I prefer to rely on people, but technology can save money and enable you to do things more quickly, and we have to try to get that right. We have got better  at it, but it is right to raise the issue and we need to look at it.</p>

However, it should be put in the context of the past 10 or more years. On looking at the 1990s and the early year or two of this century, public confidence in the police was declining, mostly because their response to the public was not as good as it should have been, whether in terms of answering conventional telephone calls, dealing with 999 calls or perhaps, above all, in the clear-up rates for crimes.</p>

<a name="80207-0010.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="08020782000347">In recent years, that has changed around, most notably, on clear-up rates, but also in the police response to the public on the telephone generally, which is very important. I no longer get the complaints that were almost endemic in the 1990s. This is an important continuation of that process and I very much welcome what my noble friend said about the message to the media. It is very easy to knock the police, particularly when a dramatic event goes wrong. But, overall, the improvement in the clear-up rate and the amount of crime, and their response to, and their behaviour and interaction with, the public is so much better than it was that we should be congratulating them and moving forward on the basis of this report.</p>

By that, I assume he means independent of government. I wonder whether the Minister could help this House to resolve a conundrum. I understand that when Sir Ronnie sent his report in draft to the Home Office, it included a graph which showed that public confidence in the police was declining. When the report was published, after Home Office Ministers indicated that they had not had any involvement in its substance, that graph was missing and was replaced by a graph which showed that public confidence in the police was rising.

It is extremely damaging that anyone should pay any attention to leaked things, particularly something that is leaked from a report that will come out in public anyway. It is not as if it is whistle-blowing; it is something else. Therefore, I have not read it myself and I have paid no attention to it.

I want to comment on the minority ethnic population, mainly as chair of the advisory panel on the community&#146;s response to stop and search. There is widespread concern about the disproportionality of stop and search within minority ethnic communities. My committee, which was established to advise the Home Secretary on stop and search, has made comments on reducing bureaucracy and on increasing the accountability of the police for disproportionality, some of which have been mentioned in the report by Sir Ronnie Flanagan.</p>

Perhaps the Minister would comment on the introduction of the practice-orientated package, particularly by the Metropolitan Police, which does not have a good enough record on disproportionality; the improvement of intelligent use of stop and search, and a clear definition of what intelligence is&#151;that is, the involvement of the community in the engagement of stop and search; and an increase in the availability of information, particularly to young people, on their rights when they are stopped and searched. We found through much research and consultation, particularly with BME communities, that these measures, if applied just to the Met would reduce disproportionality of stop and search tremendously.</p>

We arrived at some of the bureaucracy to ensure that we were able to monitor and look at ethnicity and other issues. The proposals around stop and account will still allow that to be done and it is necessary that it is done. Interestingly, the records on stop and account show that a far larger number of white than black or other ethnic people were stopped. The figures on stop and search are rather different, and it is an area of concern. I do not know the detail of the package that the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, is talking about and I will get back to him in writing. It is a very important issue. The intelligence on stop and search depends a great deal on the local community&#151;that is why I am so pleased with the way that local community policing has gone, because that is the way to get to the root of these issues.

The police clearly need help because of the constraints on the costs of employing enough police. We have in this country something like 100,000 postmen. I suggest that each  of those be equipped with a radio and that their vehicles be equipped with CCTV and they be used as additional eyes and ears for the police. If they do not want to co-operate, they do not have to but if they volunteer to join the scheme, they would get a little bonus of &#163;100 or &#163;200 for every time they spotted or stopped a crime.</p>

I have not had the opportunity of reading the report, so if I am wasting time, I apologise in advance. I will just mention two things; the first is about the community support officers. The village where I live contributed financially to get the first community support officer, in the days when it was a substantially controversial issue. We were well satisfied. I suspect that, if it can be done, some increase in their authority would go down extremely well with the public. There are limitations on it and there is scope for improvement, providing it does not tread too far upon the responsibilities of the police. That brings me to my second point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="08020782000357">If I have experience in anything, it is probably in trying to analyse and define duties, and the devil is always in the detail. The classic example is that there were woodworkers and there were metalworkers. Then somebody had the bright idea that we should bond wood and metal and we had a real problem. I suspect  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1226"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1226</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that we are seeing whether there are police duties that can be devolved or shared in some way. Civilianisation is a classic example. I recall from my days on the Audit Commission coming across police car pools run by policemen that could very well be run by civilians. There is clarity about that division, which cannot be denied, but in day-to-day duties, it is very often difficult. One does not want to create a situation in which a policeman says, &#147;I&#146;ll do this&#148; and somebody else says, &#147;It&#146;s my responsibility&#148;. I hope that in looking at duties, great care is taken to ensure that it is practical as opposed to theoretically desirable.</p>

As regards the police community support officers&#151;we now have about 16,000&#151;we have to be careful about increasing authority for them. However, the Home Secretary, with ACPO and the APA, has actually commissioned a review of the PCSOs and whether authority can be increased will be considered.

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="08020782000359">With regard to civilianisation, I go back to what I said earlier. There is considerable merit in doing this in some areas, because there is no doubt that there are jobs that, just for historical and other reasons, are being done by highly trained police officers which actually do not need police officers who have been trained with all those full powers. I came across a similar thing in the Armed Forces where soldiers, sailors and airmen did things that could be equally well done with civilians. Civilians are much cheaper when it comes to doing these things, so it makes sense for us to get value for money. It will also enable us to get more of the scarce uniformed and fully trained officers on the street. I say scarce, but there are actually 140,000 of them&#151;we have spent &#163;5 billion extra on police numbers.</p>

It has been a long journey. We were at a low ebb following William Macpherson&#146;s inquiry in to the murder of Stephen Lawrence. The work which has been done subsequently&#151;the investment put into improving community relations&#151;has relied not only on the police and police-community relations but on the increase in the number of black and minority ethnic police officers on the street. That visibility has become quite important. There was also an acknowledgment on the part of the police service about the fact that they were getting it wrong; that they were racist; there was institutional racism; they were picking up black and other minority ethnic young people in particular, because of their colour and ethnicity.</p>

However, I also have no doubt that if there were more black and ethnic minority police officers, they would be inclined to be more ruthless in stopping and searching some of the people on the streets like themselves, because they would feel less vulnerable to accusations of racism.

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="08020782000368">I find it worrying to hear that someone dare not say he wanted to join the police force because of the mosque. It shows some of the peer pressure and the importance of the prevent strategy, as part of the counterterrorist strategy into which it leaks. It deals with the use of language and a raft of other things. Someone from that background is therefore able to serve in the police force because we have shared values and it is important that they are there protecting them. That is a message that we need to get across. I agree wholeheartedly with what the noble Lord says, and we must make sure that the police reflect our society.</p>

The comments of the public were interesting. There is no doubt what they want: police men and women and community support officers on the beat.

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="08020782000370">The one thing police men and women hate more than anything else is the time wasting that has resulted from the excessive form-filling, and the inability to get on with the job of catching criminals and policing the neighbourhood. I also agree with the Minister that, if we want to retain the confidence of the communities, we need transparency and accountability. It is not bureaucracy that protects communities, but transparency and accountability, and a confidence in communities in feeling that this new approach&#151;which I believe to be the right approach&#151;will benefit all the community.</p>

<a name="80207-0010.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="08020782000375">The noble Lord said: My Lords, sometimes Governments get policies spectacularly right. The decision to restore free entry to our national museums in 2001 was one such example. The move may be likened in the field of the arts to the Labour Government&#146;s striking move to grant independence to the Bank of England. This leitmotiv policy, buttressed by lottery, millennium and increased revenue funding in the arts, led the Museums Association to say that it is one of the things that has enriched Britain in the past 10 years. We owe particular thanks to, among others in your Lordships&#146; House, the noble Lord, Lord Smith, the then Secretary of State, who hopes to join us later this afternoon.</p>

<a name="80207-0010.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="08020782000376">The figures speak for themselves: the number of museum visits has doubled, the number of overseas visitors trebled, and the number for art galleries has scarcely lagged behind. The profile of those who have come into our museums since 2001 is as telling. There has been an increase of 79 per cent increase in children&#146;s visits, 54 per cent for black and ethnic minorities, and 21 per cent for C2s, Ds and Es. There are some who say that the policy has principally favoured the middle classes&#151;but I rejoice if their numbers, too, are swelled. Why not? Later on I will look at those who are still under-represented and at the almost three in five of our citizens who still walk past our museums and never take a second look.</p>

<a name="80207-0010.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="08020782000377">Why is it important to fill our museums and art galleries? Not just because they are magnificent repositories of our history and culture, not just because they calibrate our pulsating engagement with the wider world, not just because they instil an appreciation of all the arts, nor simply because they support an industry that employs many people and stimulates revenues from the plentiful overseas visitors&#151;nor just because museums such as the V&amp;A and the Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery have aided the second phase of our industrial revolution by fostering the study of innovation and design&#151;but principally because museums open the Pandora&#146;s box of the mind and blow the winds of the imagination that swirl around and enrich every one of us,  whether child, student, parent or pensioner, for the rest of our lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="08020782000378">But free entry brings some problems in its wake. Some privately run museums have experienced consequential drops in visitor numbers, especially when cash-tight schools inevitably divert to free museums. Other museums which lie near to free national museums are likewise embarrassed. My own local Ellesmere Port boat museum, now part of the National Waterways Museum, has suffered from its proximity to Merseyside&#146;s outstanding national museums, currently revelling in free entry and in their year as European Capital of  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1230"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1230</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Culture. The boat museum feels doubly aggrieved. It is a national museum but does not enjoy free entry. It also reaches a unique audience&#151;the very people the Government otherwise espouse as part of broadening the museums&#146; visitor profile. The boat museum interprets Britain&#146;s industrial past and yet promotes the modern leisure uses of our former working canals. The unique and unparalleled National Football Museum at Preston likewise deserves free-entry status. It may be the first museum that a visitor ever visits but its pre-eminent collections and interpretations ensure that it will not be their last. I invite my noble friend to say what the Government might do to help, perhaps by granting private museums a free week&#146;s entry as they propose to do with theatres, or through direct aid for educational visits.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="08020782000379">The most testing consequence of the successful free-entry policy has been the need for increased running and maintenance resources arising from the press of increased numbers and also from the increased and very welcome lift in activities prompted by free entry. Not only has the independent charity, the Art Fund, alluded to the challenge; so, too, has the Commons&#146; 2002 DCMS report. In wholeheartedly upholding the policy, it nevertheless thunders that,</p>
<ul><a name="08020782000615">&#147;since the Government have called the tune, it must keep paying the piper&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000565">I ask my noble friend to respond.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="08020782000380">Whatever else, museums need certainty about continuity of funding. The wonderful stimulus given to the museum world by free entry has also, meritably, seen an explosion of ideas on income generation, the undertaking of imaginative reinterpretations of permanent collections, an increased number of exhibitions, and investment in both staff and infrastructure. Compare our museums with those in France, where wonderful collections are hampered by ancient entry fees and poor interpretation. It is no wonder that the French are now studying the free-entry arrangements in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="08020782000381">Another germane but troubling development is the charge now being imposed on visitors to our great historical churches and cathedrals. As congregations fall these museums too must command better support from the public purse, as well as a rethink of their flanking role at the heart of established communities. </p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="08020782000382">We must build on free entry and renew our efforts to entice the almost three in five of our citizens who do not see museums as part of their daily lives. Groups typically under-represented include people from the black and minority ethnic groups; people from social groups C2, D and E; those among the disabled who are hampered in fully appreciating our museums; the geographically isolated, typically found in rural areas or regions such as the East Midlands which are under-endowed with museums; and business people whose work never persuades them to ponder that a museum might help their small businesses. I was recently heartened to discover that the British Library now has an active programme to help small businesses fill the gaps in the marketplace by the provision of knowledge and ideas. How logical that is, once someone has thought of it. Curators, too, get a buzz from such cross-fertilisation of ideas. After all, many small museums are akin to small businesses.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="08020782000383">Children should perhaps command our greatest focus because they are the museum-goers of the future and will repay heavy investment now. The welter of hands-on technologies that now bestrew our museum spaces stand in sharp contrast to my early experience of some of the wonderful museums in Oxford, where the prevalent philosophy was more hands off than hands on. It was easier to play ducks and drakes on the River Isis outside than penetrate the wonders of the Pitt Rivers within.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="08020782000384">Surely Roy Clare, head of the MLA, is right in saying that retelling the human stories underpinning the artefacts displayed in our museums should always be paramount. An exhibition at Greenwich of the beautiful amulets worn by plantation slaves still needed the human story behind it to be explained, thereby drawing in a new audience interested in learning about Britain&#146;s engagement with the slave trade. All our museums&#146; collections should highlight the human as well as the academic.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="08020782000385">Sometimes, it is something simple that draws people in. We who are museum literate seldom pause outside a museum to assess how welcoming or forbidding are its portals, but we need to be sensitive to the mental barriers that keep people out. Let me offer an example of imagination and the taking of risk. A visit to Christchurch Mansions in Ipswich revealed an exhibition of paintings from the permanent collection chosen by Ipswich Town footballers, with a short appreciation by the players of their favoured picture accompanying it. Not only had the exhibition brought in the footballers, playing on unfamiliar away ground; it also brought in young fans ever anxious to pick up tidbits about their favourite forward. It also brought in the parents who&#151;and how familiar a tale is this?&#151;had never entered the museum on their doorstep.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="08020782000386">The disabled, too, are not infrequently rebuffed. But here, too, an imaginative response can transform matters. I am very happy to support Vocaleyes, a charity which helps the visually handicapped to enjoy the theatre by supplementing the dialogue heard on stage with judicious contemporaneous description of the action. Now, Visualeyes is doing something similar in our art galleries and museums, enhancing the experience for the visually handicapped. Nor is the description service confined to the museums&#146; paintings or artefacts, which themselves may provide a tactile experience for the visitor. Visualeyes also provides a tape, to be listened to before the proposed visit, describing the physical layout of the museum and even the nearby restaurants or bars&#151;all designed to enhance the visitor experience.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="08020782000387">I conclude with a series of suggestions and questions. Could my noble friend give more details about the proposed 2008 government paper on developing a national museums strategy? What areas will it cover, and what are its objectives? What proposals might come forward on collecting accurate data on those who come to our museums&#151;and on the many who do not come, to find out why they stay away? How will such research be done without creating paperwork for museums that wish to focus on curatorial duties and welcoming the public? To what extent will the 2012 Olympics be embraced by such a review?</p>




<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1232"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1232</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80207-0011.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="08020782000388">What more can HMG do to encourage our curators to perform the double role of looking after valued museum artefacts and interpreting them for the visiting public while always emphasising the human story that lies behind nearly all such artefacts? Surely such an approach is indispensable if we are to cast the net wider in search of those who might interest themselves in our outstanding collections. Does my noble friend agree that museum boards and staff need to redouble their efforts to persuade a sometimes reluctant public that museums are not just the preserve of the privileged, white middle classes? To that end, should not the governing boards of museums and galleries themselves more accurately reflect the UK&#146;s mixed profile? And with respect to staff, should we not do more to encourage both existing staff and new recruits to curating to expand their professional horizons, perhaps by exchanges between national, regional and local museums&#151;and, indeed, with those abroad, especially in Europe and America? A practical start might be more Clore fellowships, which are currently oversubscribed by 16 to one.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="08020782000389">There is also a case for improving salary levels and pay structures in the profession. Unlike nurses, the staff may not save lives, but they certainly improve them. Will my noble friend devise strategies to secure a better balance between national, regional and local museums and galleries? At the moment there is a postcode lottery whereby a Londoner is privileged to the disadvantage of country dwellers and those who live in towns short of museums. An active programme of travelling exhibitions, plus outreach London galleries such as the wonderful Tate Liverpool, would mitigate that disparity. It is also true that interesting and varied travelling exhibitions have enormous potential for encouraging new audiences as well as repeat visits.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="08020782000390">One beneficial though perhaps counter-intuitive aspect of the free-entry policy has been the spur to entrepreneurialism within national museums. For instance, the Tate now generates 60 per cent of its own income. How does my noble friend propose that we build on this entrepreneurial&#151;indeed, risk-taking&#151;approach and cascade down good ideas to other, slumbering museums and galleries? What do the Government consider are the possibilities of using digital technology and the internet to bring in new visitors? This is clearly a point of entry for many young people who are more adept at surfing online than standing in line outside unwelcoming museums.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="08020782000391">Will the Government provide more cash for museums, perhaps linked to rewarding risk-taking, to match their general thrust of building stable communities? After all, the best local and national museums reflect established and developing communities. Greater use of these public places for meetings unrelated to the arts would be another way to bring people into museums. Why not, for instance, use galleries to perform citizens&#146; ceremonies for those who have pledged to adopt Britain as their home country?</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="08020782000392">The generation of income for our galleries and museums leads me to the fertile field of encouraging donors&#151;the subject of an excellent address last week by Minister of State, Margaret Hodge. Only 4 per cent  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1233"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1233</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of charitable giving is steered towards the arts, and two-thirds of that stays in London-based institutions. We need to do more to bring the worlds of business and the arts together. But how about explaining to boardrooms that concern for the arts can be their business? Government can promote this by dusting off the Goodison report and devising a conducive tax regime. They should be more forthcoming in acknowledging beneficial giving through the honours system or, indeed, by encouraging museums to use donors&#146; names to adorn the institutions they have supported, as has football entrepreneur, John Madejski, at the Royal Academy.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="08020782000393">In conclusion, the Government have blazed a magnificent trail in their enlightened policy of according free entry to our national museums. As the Prime Minister tellingly said, our party is best when it is at its boldest. Let us build on this magnificent start. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

As well as having been the Member of the European Parliament for Liverpool following the first direct elections in 1979, and in that capacity having helped to secure regional funding for the then very small maritime museum on the dockside, I subsequently became a trustee of the then National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside, now known as the National Museums Liverpool, and I continue to serve on its development trust. Again like the noble Lord, Lord Harrison&#151;perhaps not today but on previous occasions&#151;I rejoice in the fact that Liverpool has been designated European Capital of Culture this year. That designation has greatly helped to give a focus and a deadline and additional funding for some of our long-term projects in relation to the museums and galleries.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="08020782000395">In that respect, I point in particular to the transatlantic slavery gallery within the Merseyside Maritime Museum, to which the noble Lord referred. It was reopened and extended in August last year with perfect timing to coincide with International Slavery Remembrance Day and the special recognition of the anniversary of the abolition of slavery in this country. I also point to the World Museum Liverpool. Anyone who has been there and watched the faces of children going around the exhibits, which are interactive and very attractive to young people, will have seen what a terrific success it is. In addition, there is the Museum of Liverpool Life, which is still being worked on.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="08020782000396">Museums can be magic. I believe that they are a vital part of our educational process and, indeed, of our cultural life, particularly in the current dialogue on intercultural activity. The fantastic improvements in display and attractiveness and in the use of technical methods to put messages across are absolutely mind-boggling. Whenever and wherever I travel in the world, whether for business or pleasure, one of the first things I do is to find out how to access the local museum so that I can begin to feel more at home and more in sympathy with the environment in which I find myself.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="08020782000397">Perhaps I may go back to the many debates and Parliamentary Questions that we had in your Lordships&#146; House in the 1990s on the subject of free admission to museums, when we sought more government support and funding. Then, Liverpool had, and I think still has, the only national museum outside London, and admission was free, except for special exhibitions. However, in part because of the VAT issue&#151;your Lordships may remember that it meant that, without charging for admissions, museums could not reclaim on their VAT expenditure&#151;we were very much out of pocket. Very reluctantly, as trustees, we decided to make a modest charge in order to be able to reclaim that substantial VAT figure. We made the best possible use of season tickets, family tickets and multiple tickets as well as making special arrangements for schools and special interest groups. Interestingly, once the charges were administered, at the beginning attendance at some of the smaller and less well known locations went up. There are eight different parts to the museums and galleries in Liverpool and people obviously thought they would get the best value possible out of the admission ticket they had paid for. Eventually numbers flattened out.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="08020782000398">I was delighted when the Government decided in 2001 to give additional financial support to enable National Museums Liverpool as well as the other national museums in London to revert to a free-entry policy. The noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport, as well as the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, before him, was very much involved in this successful process.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="08020782000399">Widening access by skilful marketing and ever more attractive display techniques has, as well as the free entry, led to dramatic increases in numbers, especially of schoolchildren. The fact that the national curriculum encourages schoolchildren to attend museums as part of their coursework has been an additional advantage because, once someone is used to going to a museum, they will increasingly go to a museum somewhere else which may not be on their doorstep. By the same token, the in some cases costly requirements of access for disabled people are often not thought about when considering the running costs of museums and galleries but are vital, especially where the museum&#146;s collection is housed in an old and historic building.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="08020782000400">Turning to wider horizons, to see how people cope in other countries, I think that it is vital that museums&#146; policy should have an international flavour because co-operation between museums, exchanges of exhibits and so on can very much improve displays in any museum. It also encourages us to remember that we have a common cultural heritage in certain parts of the world; I refer in particular to other European countries. Can the Minister give us any comparative data on national museums in other countries? Tourists such as myself sometimes have to pay very high admission charges there, whereas tourists in this country visiting our national museums have free access in the same way as everybody else. I do not know whether any study has been done on this but I know that, in the Council of Europe, there is a move to encourage free admission to museums on the basis of the valuable contribution they can make to international understanding and good will as well as to education in general.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="08020782000401">I, too, will be very interested to hear about the Government&#146;s strategy for the future of museums because of the importance they have in our society. Raising the profile of museums and their collections can also be greatly helped by the international award system. I would like to mention in particular the European Museum Prize because, as a member of the parliamentary delegation to the Council of Europe, and as vice-chairman of that institution&#146;s culture and education committee, I have been very involved in the award of that prize. Your Lordships may be aware that that prize is awarded annually. This year&#146;s winner is interesting; it is the Arctic museum in the most northern part of Norway&#151;north of the Arctic Circle&#151;which seems appropriate in this International Polar Year, given all the issues of climate change on which we are focusing. This country has won the European prize from time to time. The National Conservation Centre in Liverpool won about seven years ago. It is brilliant not only at providing the much needed skills and services for conservation and preservation, but at giving access to the public to see how its conservation work is carried out without interfering with the conservation work that individuals are carrying out.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="08020782000402">Just over a year ago, the Churchill Museum in the Cabinet War Rooms was awarded the European prize. Everyone who has been there will realise that it was an obvious candidate for the prize not only because of its subject&#151;the war in Europe&#151;but also because of the way the new technology and other displays make it so easy to follow and to go into any aspect of that period in depth. That brings me back to the subject of this debate: free access. When I went to the Churchill Museum with a few overseas friends whom I had invited to see that splendid museum, I was horrified to find how high the entry fees were and to be told at the end of the information on the headphones that the Cabinet War Rooms, which are part of the Imperial War Museum, receives not a penny of government funding. The Cabinet War Rooms is obviously coping very well with the situation because its numbers are going up. I look forward to hearing the Government&#146;s plans for their future strategy for museums and would like to know whether they have any plans to encourage museums for which there is no question of direct government finance to help and support sponsors or benefactors who would be prepared to provide funding. If we are agreed that the cost of admission affects the number of people who feel able to go into some of those museums then something must be done, certainly about the Churchill Museum. I look forward to hearing from other speakers in this debate and, especially, from the Minister about what further plans the Government have and in what other ways they intend to support museums other than the national museums.</p>

I am not sure how scientific a survey that was, but it is the case that when visiting a museum or gallery one is now part of a crowd.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="08020782000404">The statistics support the experience. Visits are up by 87 per cent since 2001, thanks to the Government&#146;s policy of free admission to DCMS-sponsored museums. Here we also have to acknowledge the part played by the noble Lord, Lord Smith, as well as that played by the noble Lord, Lord Howard. Capital investment due to lottery funding and the renaissance in the regions programme, which has transformed regional museums and galleries, has meant that many more people are able to benefit from the enlightenment as well as the pleasure that these institutions offer. Of course, this in turn benefits society in furthering people's understanding of the communities, of the nation that they inhabit and the world as a whole.</p>

<a name="80207-0011.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="08020782000405">Britain has historically recognised this. The British Museum was the first museum in the world. Created in 1753, it was free of charge and its intent and aim was to foster knowledge and understanding&#151;to explain that instead of dwelling on what makes us different we should see how we overlap. The British Museum continues to achieve that. A year or so ago, the building of Durga attracted large numbers of Bengalis, both Hindu and Muslim, from throughout the country&#151;different parts of the community in the United Kingdom understanding how they fit together.</p>

But despite these achievements, as the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, said, there is still a problem with what he referred to as the &#147;profile&#148; of those who enjoy our museums and galleries. Certain groups still feel excluded. As Sir Brian McMaster said in his recent report:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"><a name="08020782000603">&#147;One of the biggest barriers to audience engagement is the notion held by many that the arts are simply not for them.

</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000566">A breakdown of those who visit the museums and galleries in increased numbers shows that many are tourists and many are schoolchildren on repeat visits&#151;both to be welcomed. Less happily, numbers from lower income groups and ethnic communities are going down.</p>

This will be a unique opportunity for museums and galleries across the UK to expand audiences, inspire the young and broaden the profile of those who visit them; but it needs money. We have suggestions about where extra money can be found for lottery good causes, and consequently for the Olympiad. One is a gross profits tax for the lottery, and the other is a crackdown on lottery-style games, so-called &#147;grey&#148; games which, through imitation, dupe people into spending their money on games other than the National Lottery. We believe that those proposals could raise significant amounts.</p>

The compensation received by those museums and galleries that used to charge for entry is inadequate. On top of their loss of income from admissions, they face increased running costs due to a greater number of visitors, which is the Catch-22 of success. Grant-in-aid to English national museums and galleries will increase from &#163;302 million this year to &#163;332 million in 2010-11, which is an increase of only slightly above inflation. The fact is that costs have risen at a rate higher than inflation. That does not just mean a problem with infrastructure and salaries, but with the fundamental issue of acquisitions.</p>

My noble friend Lord Smith invited my noble friend Lord Evans to investigate the problem and make recommendations to us and he produced his report in 2001. The noble Lord found much heroic good practice, but the scene he examined was one of widespread depression, poorly-funded museums and falling numbers of visitors. In many museums displays were stale, the routines of documentation and conservation were lagging, museums were working in isolation from one another, their staff lived off miserable salaries and had poor career opportunities. Many museums in the regions were lacking vision and self-belief as sources of inspiration, places of learning and community spaces.</p>

<a name="80207-0012.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="08020782000420">The renaissance in the regions strategy enabled funding to be distributed through some 41 museums and museum services in nine regions. Leading museums were identified as hub museums in each region and became centres of a system of collaborative museums. What has happened as a result? There has been a 55 per cent increase in visits to those museums, a 19 per cent increase in the number of schools making visits to museums and 30 per cent of school visits have occurred in the 20 per cent of most deprived wards. Over 30 per cent of visitors&#151;if your Lordships will forgive me for using this jargon&#151;have been drawn from the C2/DE socio-economic groups, and black and ethnic minority groups and disabled people. By 2006-07 13 and three-quarter million visits had been made to the hub museums&#151;more than 800,000 children had been on school visits to them and a not inconsiderable number of those children brought their families back on subsequent visits.</p>

To give one example, shortly a bust of the Emperor Hadrian is to be loaned by the British Museum, first to Tullie House museum at the western end of Hadrian&#146;s Wall and later to Segedunum in the Tyne and Wear museums at the eastern end of Hadrian&#146;s Wall.

I am referring to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, a national voluntary scheme to ensure the recording of archaeological finds made by members of the public, particularly by metal detectorists. I am pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, will speak shortly. I dare say that he will have something to say on this subject, and I believe that the House will accept as authoritative what he has to say on archaeology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="08020782000426">Before 1997 a kind of anarchy prevailed. Amateur archaeologists and metal detectorists roamed the country in search of trophies and there was no system for reporting and recording. I pay tribute to Dr Roger Bland of the British Museum, the progenitor of this scheme, who was seconded to the DCMS and advised on the establishment of the scheme. The Portable Antiquities Scheme is led academically and administratively by the British Museum and employs 39 finds liaison officers across the country. By 2006 a code of practice for responsible metal detecting had been agreed between detectorists, archaeologists and landowners. As of now, more than 317,000 objects have been recorded in the largest such database in the world. There is worldwide scholarly interest in this scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="08020782000431">The Portable Antiquities Scheme issue illustrates a wider systemic difficulty. Nationally we have an incoherent, fragmented and still grievously underfunded system of support for our museums. The national museums themselves are not without their difficulties, as the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Hooper and Lady Bonham-Carter, have already said. Funding for museums comes from central government, the lottery, local government, some from Europe, museums&#146; own earned income and fundraising, trusts and foundations, corporate giving and individual philanthropy. It is good that there should be a plurality of sources of funding, but we need a concordat about respective responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="08020782000432">The welfare state model of funding for culture, the assumption that everything important will be paid for by the taxpayer, will no longer work&#151;if, indeed, it ever did. The respective responsibilities of all who can produce funding need to be negotiated, established, promulgated and maintained. That is a challenge for the Secretary of State for Culture. The Treasury and the DCMS need to agree definitively what is the role of central government and then perform it, predictably and reliably. We should have a debate on the appropriate role for local government. We certainly cannot drift on like this. I would like to see a statutory duty on local government, such that every citizen will live in an area where a local authority has an obligation to maintain a museum service. That is the case where public libraries are concerned, but the experience of public libraries also teaches us that it is not much use willing the end if you do not will the means. Without adequate funding, the promise is hollow.</p>

Alternatively, should the same money form a fund to be distributed by the MLA in response to bids by local authorities? If that were to be the case, the MLA would become a true funding council. The question of whether to fund free entry for local authority museums would be one for the Government to face and answer one way or another. The difficulty about making the MLA a true funding council is that the national museums have never wanted it to be, and the DCMS has so far agreed with them.

He believes that we should support lifetime giving of works of art and culture, as the noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter, mentioned. He believes that the most effective stimulus to new giving would be the ability to offset the gross value of the gift of a cultural object of pre-eminent quality against income before payment of tax. He also tells us that there should be urgent reforms to gift aid; there should be reform of the complex and restrictive regulations on so-called benefits offered to donors; and there should be reforms to allow larger donors of cash gifts tax relief on the entire amount, not just the upper rate.</p>

We would have local museums with new boards of trustees, including people with leadership and business skills, newly energised, confident and increasingly self-sustaining.

Without prejudice to this glorious diversity, the challenge for DCMS leadership is to draw the disparate realms&#151;the realms of the national museums, the local museums, university museums, the armed services museums, and the independent museums, and the realms of the National Museums Directors&#146; Conference, the Museums Association, the Universities Museums Group, the Association of Independent Museums, and indeed English Heritage and the National Trust&#151;into a more coherent system with proper funding opportunities for all and accepted patterns of mutual support and responsibility. The Government have promised us a strategic document on the future of museums. I hope that in it they will set out a truly a national vision for our museums.</p>

Let us not forget that that policy was unflinchingly pioneered by the trustees of the British Museum over many years and was vigorously advocated by the Art Fund. Here, I must declare an interest as a trustee of the Art Fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="08020782000441">Britain&#146;s standing in the world of culture, the visual arts and material culture is undoubtedly very high indeed. It has been enhanced by the achievements of our millennium celebrations; by the construction of the British Museum&#146;s great court with its wonderful dome, and all the facilities and access, which have been made easier in the British Museum; by the National Portrait Gallery extension; and, not least, by the great success of Tate Modern, as well as Tate Britain. When we are talking about broadening access, what a pleasure it is to go to the Tate Modern, in particular, on any day and see the hoards of young and youngish people&#151;not just school parties or tourists, but people mainly of a young age range&#151;and the notable ethnic mix really using that facility.</p>

The success of the Turner Prize is perhaps an element of that, which of course has been facilitated and sponsored by the Tate. So it is no surprise or coincidence that British sculpture holds an unequivocally high position in the world today. That is not for just the agreeably wild shores of Brit art, but also for sculpture of a more traditional&#151;in today&#146;s terms&#151;nature, as expounded or as demonstrated by some of our really great figures of an older generation, such as William Turnbull or Sir Anthony Caro.</p>

I have four questions for the Minister. It is true that the committee on the export of works of art does a good job in putting a stop on, or advising the Secretary of State to delay, the export of works of art of importance. It is a great satisfaction that Turner&#146;s &#147;Blue Rigi&#148; was secured for the nation through a national campaign last year.</p>

<a name="80207-0012.htm_para32">
<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="08020782000444">My first question is: are we doing enough in the field of contemporary art in particular? I had the wonderful experience of going to the Royal Academy of Arts this morning, paying my admission fee&#151;I have no objection to that&#151;and seeing the extraordinary collection mainly of two Russian collectors, Shchukin and Morozov. In one room, you can see paintings today by Matisse, Picasso and Gauguin, and, in the next room, by C&#233;zanne, which were accumulated in the first decade of last century. They exceed by far the totality of this country&#146;s holdings of paintings by those artists over that period. It is lamentable that our national collection in modern art of the first 50 years of the 20th century is weak and threatens to be weak also in contemporary art of the 21st<sup></sup>century. The Art Fund has developed a scheme, Art Fund International, where it has set aside &#163;5 million to aid galleries in this country to acquire contemporary art and the beneficiaries will be Birmingham and Walsall, Bristol, Eastbourne, Glasgow and Middlesbrough. That is a step in the right direction, that I hope noble Lords will approve. But are we doing enough to secure contemporary art? I am interested to hear what the Minister will say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="08020782000445">My second question echoes that posed by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport: what about the tax regime? As the noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter, said, should we not have a tax regime that genuinely favours the acquisition of major works of art by our national and regional galleries and museums? Can the Minister really argue that we have one? I am interested to see if he tries, but I will be very interested if he will tell us that the Government are taking seriously Sir Nicholas Goodison&#146;s proposals and other such proposals, which certainly need to be implemented, if we are not to continue to fall behind in our national acquisitions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="08020782000446">My third question, and I feel fairly optimistic about the Minister&#146;s answer, is whether the due diligence guidelines are being followed. <I>Combating Illicit Trade: Due D</I><I>iligence </I><I>G</I><I>uidelines for </I><I>M</I><I>useums, </I><I>L</I><I>ibraries and </I><I>A</I><I>rchives on </I><I>C</I><I>ollecting and </I><I>Borrowing C</I><I>ultural </I><I>M</I><I>aterial </I>is one of the real achievements of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. I would like to hear how these matters are being monitored. We have escaped the scandal and the shame of some museums in the United States, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which were so lax in their due diligence guidelines that they found themselves collecting looted art and have been obliged to return that art&#151;antiquities, mainly&#151;to the countries of origin, including Italy and Greece. I am happy to say that we have escaped that situation but I would like to be assured that we are going to continue to escape it. I believe that our national museums and galleries are run with an integrity that far exceeds that of some

I would refer in pejorative terms to the Getty except that it has now adopted due diligence guidelines that meet high standards, but the other institutions I mentioned have not done so.

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="08020782000447">My other concern is the fastest growing area of acquisitions in recent years&#151;namely, portable British antiquities. I was very pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, made a major point of this issue. One of the great achievements in British archaeology and in the museums of Britain since the passage of the Treasure Act 1996 has been the implementation of the Portable Antiquities Scheme and the appointment of the 39 finds liaison officers. In 2007, 97 per cent of treasure finds were recorded by a finds liaison officer, of which about 50 per cent were acquired by museums. This is probably the major source of museums acquisitions in any area at the moment. It is a matter for pride that it is being done in a systematic way that respects the archaeological heritage of this country. It is notable also that it has been done in a modern way, with online access to finds. There were 82 million hits in 2006 on that online resource. Also&#151;and I think the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, already made this point&#151;it has a broadening effect. Those people participating in the Portable Antiquities Scheme are from a wider social base than those who visit museums. I heard him say that 46 per cent of visitors to the nationwide series of &#147;Fabulous Finds&#148; days organised by the Portable Antiquities Scheme had not been to the museum where they were being hosted before.</p>

<a name="80207-0013.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="08020782000448">That is exactly what we want. It is the point that a number of noble Lords have made. We want to bring more and more people into our museums so that they are not just a middle-class preserve. It is striking also that 47 per cent of finds recorded with the Portable Antiquities Scheme have been recorded by finders in social classes C2, D and E. That compares with 32 per cent of visitors in those classes to museums. Somehow, the Portable Antiquities Scheme is being more effective in broadening access to the whole system than are the museums themselves. This is warmly to be welcomed.</p>

<a name="80207-0013.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="08020782000449">It is a matter of real concern that the success of this scheme is under threat on financial grounds. Economies have to be made, but I note that there is an Early Day Motion in another place on this topic. It is a real concern that there is a risk of a cut of three out of the 49 posts of this service, which has been so recently set up and which we can all regard as one of the most conspicuous successes of the present Government and their Department for Culture, Media and Sport. I pay tribute to noble Lords opposite, including the noble Lord, Lord Smith, who were part of the move to bring these things about. The whole system of archaeology in this country has improved in recent years with the accession of the United Kingdom to UNESCO and with the passing of the relevant legislation, the Dealing in Cultural Objects (Offences) Act.</p>

There is a real concern that the optimism of the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, may not be fully sustained in the outcome. A success like this needs continuing nurturing and input. It would be an irony, on one of the few issues where I as a speaker from these Benches can unreservedly congratulate the Government, if this success were undermined by negligence on the Government&#146;s own behalf.</p>

I cannot go back into history, to the time of my grandparents, but I can visit, say, the National Slate Museum at Llanberis. I can see the conditions in which people worked in those very difficult times&#151;and I could go on and emotionally describe how hard it was for people then and their families.

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="08020782000459">As has been mentioned, museums in England have been free since December 2001. In Wales we were eight months ahead of you. In April, under the leadership of the then Minister for Culture, Jenny Randerson, a very good friend of mine, we had free admission to our museums and art galleries. We wondered if it would work. Although we thought that there might be some additional people, in the first year, 2002, there was an 87 per cent increase, similar to that first year in England. The National Slate Museum in Llanberis, for example, had 53,000 visitors the previous year but 144,000 in 2002. Free admission made it possible for everybody to go. We thought that there would be an increase but it was far more than we ever imagined. In 2001-02, a total of 764,599 people attended the nine museums. We thought that the figure would increase to 800,000. Instead it soared to 1,430,000, and the increase has continued. I am told that last year&#151;just this morning I spoke to the Minister concerned about it&#151;there were 1,535,000 visitors.</p>

Noble Lords will already know about that.

It is fascinating to hear how it also has the support of everyone who has spoken in this debate. I am sure that when the history of this Administration comes to be written, this will be seen as one of their finest legacies. I am so pleased that my noble friend Lord Smith of Finsbury is here listening, and I hope he will contribute to the debate in a moment. I have two unpaid interests that I should declare. Last year I was appointed to the board of trustees of both the National Football Museum in Preston and the National Museum of Science and Industry, which covers the Science Museum, the National Media Museum in Bradford, the collection at Wroughton in Wiltshire, the National Railway Museum in York and Locomotion, its outpost in Shildon.</p>

<a name="80207-0013.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="08020782000462">The figures quoted for the increase in visitor numbers at the national museums since the abolition of charges are absolutely startling. In a letter published in the <I>Guardian</I> last June, the directors of a number of museums quoted a figure of 30 million more visits, an 87 per cent increase, to museums that had previously charged for admission. In the case of the National Football Museum, the introduction of free access in March 2003 has led to an increase in visitor numbers of 177 per cent; that is, over 100,000 visitors each year. Free admission has also led to huge increases in the numbers of children and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds visiting most of the museums. Locomotion, the National Railway Museum&#146;s site at Shildon, and the National Football Museum in Preston score particularly highly in these regards. In 2005-06, the latest year for which figures are available, 64 per cent of the visitors at Locomotion were from social classes C2, D and E, compared with an average for DCMS-sponsored museums of around 19 per cent. At the National Football Museum the figure was 42 per cent. Since the introduction of free access, a significant number of people from the Asian community of Deepdale, the area in Preston in which the museum is housed, are now frequent visitors and users of its education and outreach programmes.</p>

<a name="80207-0013.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="08020782000463">Free entry has undoubtedly been a success, and, as I said, there is a settled political consensus that it will continue. I note for example that when Ed Vaizey MP, shadow Minister for Culture, was interviewed by the <I>Parliamentary Monitor </I>in July <I>2007</I>, he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"><a name="08020782000607">&#147;We support free entrance to our national museums&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="08020782000464">Against that background, this is a good moment for the Government to think more deeply about what the national museums are for and what they want from them. A great achievement of the present Government in respect of the national museums and galleries was starting a proper dialogue with them about their purpose. Such dialogue did not exist before 1997 but it is now reflected in the outcome targets identified in the funding agreements, all of

There has been a good debate between the museums and the DCMS over these targets and the Government are now recognising that museums are about much more than the numbers of people coming through the door, important though that is. Museums now agree targets that, for example, relate to the Government&#146;s desire to broaden audiences to include those who have typically felt excluded from the type of experience they offer and to the extent to which the museums are delivering tailored education programmes to young people and to broader audiences.</p>

<a name="80207-0013.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="08020782000465">On attracting the socially excluded, some museums have delivered splendidly. These museums tend to be those which cover science, technology, industry, transport and, of course, sport and football. However, I am sorry to say that the big national art museums have a long way to go before they make a real difference to their middle-to-working class visitor ratios because they are still very much bastions of the middle class. That some museums have shown their ability to attract a broader audience is very good news. It fits in, too, with another concern of the Government: that we should inspire young people with an interest in the world of science and technology.</p>

<a name="80207-0013.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="08020782000466">But it is puzzling that, having measured performance against these government concerns, funding does not seem to follow success. The previous Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, James Purnell, and the new one, Andy Burnham, in his former role as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, deserve warm congratulations on ensuring that the three-year funding settlement for the national museums has sustained spending power in real terms in what is undoubtedly a difficult funding environment. But why is there not some recognition of the museums that have demonstrated their ability to deliver government agendas? If we are really serious about getting a broader audience to our national museums, we should be focusing funding on those which succeed and show the potential to succeed further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="08020782000467">The success of the National Football Museum has been achieved with core revenue funding from the DCMS which, until this year&#146;s settlement, had not increased by one penny since 1 April 2003. One consequence is that it and other smaller museums, such as Locomotion at Shildon and, before its recent closure for refurbishment, the People&#146;s History Museum in Manchester, can afford only a tiny marketing budget. As a result many people are still unaware of the museums&#146; existence and that they are free to all visitors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="08020782000469">I wonder whether the Minister would agree that there is a gulf in policy between setting objectives that envisage lively and well-managed museums able to deliver the breadth of government education agendas to an increasingly diverse audience of young people nationwide and a funding regime that sustains the status quo&#151;namely, well-funded art museums in London serving an audience that, frankly, does not reflect the nation as a whole. I know that the DCMS is sensitive about comparisons such as these, but can it be right that grant in aid per C2DE visitor to one of the principal art museums in London is around  11 times that for the National Railway Museum? In other words, it costs the Government 11 times as much to get a C2DE visitor into the former as it does to get one into the NRM&#151;yet we know that the National Railway Museum can deliver experiences and education programmes of at least equal value to young people.</p>

<a name="80207-0013.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="08020782000470">My message to the Government is that they must not rest on their laurels over free entry because, having delivered extra visitors, the opportunity to deliver on their priorities and objectives is not being met to anything like its potential. One key reason is that the grant in aid for the national museums&#151;once the compensation for free entry has been deducted&#151;has not kept pace with inflation, and certainly not with their hugely increased usage following free entry. The cost of education programmes, events and activities through which the museums deliver for the nation rises proportionately with the number of visitors. So although they have more visitors, they are unable to provide the quality of service that those visitors deserve, and the positive programmes that could engage those broader audiences are not being delivered to anything like their full potential.</p>

<a name="80207-0013.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="08020782000471">In practice, while absolute numbers of C2DE visitors have risen with free entry, so have those of ABC1s, and at many museums the proportionate mix has not changed much. We know that the national museums cannot sit back and rely on grant in aid. Sponsorship, grant aid from charitable trusts and lottery funds are hard to get, but the vast bulk of the capital investment that goes into the nationals comes from these sources. As a consequence, they deliver tremendous value for money to the taxpayer. There has been a welcome increase in government capital funding in the new funding agreement, but it is starting from a very low base. The vast bulk of this new money&#151;&#163;50 million&#151;is going to the Tate for its expansion. The Tate is a wonderful museum, but it is taking a large share of the total, whereas the share for other national museums is much more limited. For example, the National Museum of Science and Industry has got only &#163;13 million over three years for all purposes&#151;expansion, renewal and building maintenance. There are no funds for anything like an acquisition programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="08020782000472">The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, referred in his speech to tourism. I hope that the DCMS will have the vision to appreciate the real potential offered here by the national museums and galleries. The DCMS is good at setting objectives for museums, but I find it strange that while it also has strategic responsibility for tourism in the UK, it does not seem able to join that up with using its power as the owner of heritage attractions to help build the country's tourism business. We know that tourism depends to a very significant degree on our heritage. The department is responsible for a huge portfolio of that heritage, including&#151;particularly relevant to today's debate&#151;national museums. Yet it is difficult to see that there is a national plan for using this resource to help deliver the economic benefits of tourism, particularly tourism from overseas.</p>

<a name="80207-0013.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="08020782000473">My final point is: should there not be some plans for investment in the national museums&#151;other than the Tate, and particularly outside London&#151;to encourage overseas tourism? I should like to see more vision and more joined-up thinking from the department. I should also like to see the department working with the regional development agencies to deliver investments which sustain and enhance our reputation as the home to world-class museums and galleries. We have a huge amount to be proud of in our national museums and art galleries. I just feel that we could be doing more to exploit that potential and achieve more income and more visitors from overseas. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="08020782000481">We have heard how the decision in 2001 to introduce free admission to the permanent collections of the DCMS-sponsored museums and galleries in England that charged for entry has been a resounding success. It is good that we have the architects of that policy in the House with us today. We on these Benches supported that step very strongly and I applaud it today. I declare an interest as an avid and regular visitor with my son to many of these superb museums.</p>

<a name="80207-0014.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="08020782000482">I was particularly moved by the speech of my noble friend Lord Roberts, who spoke about the personal impact and importance that a visit to a museum can have. We have also heard what has resulted from the free admissions scheme. Figures published by the DCMS last June showed that there were nearly  7 million extra visits to England&#146;s national museums and galleries which had formerly charged compared with the year before entry charges were scrapped. The most impressive increases in London were in the South Kensington museums. In the regions there were huge rises in Liverpool, the Natural History Museum at Tring and the National Railway Museum in York. It was therefore no surprise that the directors of the 22 nationally funded museums all wrote strongly in support of free admission in a letter to the <I>Guardian </I>last June. This was in response to some ill advised speculation by the now Olympic spokesman of the Conservative party referred to earlier, Hugo Swire. Needless to say, he was overruled fairly fast by his leadership and contradicted by the Conservatives&#146; own arts task force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="08020782000483">The CMS Select Committee report in December 2002 on the free admission scheme did conclude&#151;this is where a number of noble Lords who, as well as applauding the original decision, were so wise in their caution about the future&#151;that the compensation package agreed for the department was based on what seemed to be a modest, even conservative estimate in the likely rise in visitors. For example, in the case of the Natural History Museum, compensation was set to reflect a 20 per cent rise in visitor numbers. It therefore did not take sufficient account of an increase in visitor figures. It is also always the danger

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="08020782000484">The cost to the Government in specific grant in aid to the 22 museums increased from &#163;4.2 million in 1999-2000 to &#163;35 million in 2003-04. A separate amount is not paid currently but funding for free admission is taken into account in the allocation of all funds to all DCMS-sponsored museums. It seems that the current figure is &#163;40 million. Certainly that was the figure stated when the Government published the figures last year. That figure surely does not keep pace with inflation.

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="08020782000487">I can understand the DCMS euphoria. After all, there were fears that museums faced a cut of 7 per cent. Where they right, however, to be quite so buoyant? The last phrase is also extremely important in the context:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="08020782000488">We know that in general the free admissions policy has been a success. As I said, we applaud it from these Benches. But there is the question that many noble Lords have raised today of whether the policy has really led to a sufficiently diverse visitor base in these national museums. Although it is widely regarded that free entry has provided additional access&#151;indeed the director&#146;s letter states that an extra 16 million children have visited museums since they were granted free entry in 1998 and the number of visits from people from lower socio-economic groups has risen by  6.5 million in 2004-05&#151;the public sector agreement targets for increasing the take-up by a wider and more diverse range of visitors into museums by 2 per cent are not being met, as was revealed in a recent parliamentary Answer to my honourable friend Don Foster on 4 February. The DCMS&#146;s own Taking Part survey, the results of which were published last December, demonstrates this.</p>

<a name="80207-0014.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="08020782000489">We would far prefer not to have these targets, but given that they exist, what resources from the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review are being used to ensure that they will be met in future?</p>

<a name="80207-0014.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="08020782000490">Then we come to whether free admissions are sustainable in future. There will always be a danger that the policy&#146;s success in attracting visitors will make the compensation paid by the Government inadequate to cover it. That means that the cost of funding free admissions eats into the budgets available for mounting exhibitions, buying new treasures and targeting those sections of the population yet to embrace museum-going, as my noble friend Lady Bonham-Carter said. I hope the new strategy referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, and others will address that, and I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say. On these Benches, we do not believe that the enjoyment of culture should be limited to those who can afford to pay for it. Free admission is vital for promoting and allowing access.</p>

<a name="80207-0014.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="08020782000491">Then there is the effect of free entry on other sources of income for museums, since they need to find alternative ways of raising the extra money. With free admission, trading income has increased significantly, and it is good to see that private sector sponsorship has increased significantly. I recently went to a presentation by Colin Tweedie of Arts and Business, who stated that private contributions to the museums sector now amount to &#163;85.55 million per annum, a rise of 37 per cent since the previous year, which is one of the biggest rises in any of the arts sectors. He said that the growth of museums and galleries, which is obviously one of the great successes in the past 20 years, has been the absolute storming of the private sector&#146;s relationship with museums and galleries. That is quite some testimony. However, as my noble friend Lady Bonham-Carter said, with the right incentives for giving we could do even better.</p>

<a name="80207-0014.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="08020782000492">I have just a few further issues to raise with the Minister. First, Renaissance in the Regions has been mentioned by a number of noble Lords. Visits to hub museums have increased enormously since 2002-03, as the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, described. The targets to increase the number of contacts between school-age children and regional museums and to generate additional visits by new users, predominantly from social classes C2, D and E and ethnic minorities, have been exceeded with ease, as the CMS Select Committee said in its <I>Caring for our Collections </I>report in June 2007. As the Select Committee said, I hope that the national museums will continue to build relationships with non-hub local and specialist museums and that, in order to meet their targets, they will take a leaf out of the outreach success of the Renaissance hubs.</p>

<a name="80207-0014.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="08020782000493">The noble Lord, Lord Howarth, raised an important question about the future role of the MLA. In the context of the Renaissance in the Regions scheme, it needs to be pointed out that even hub museums that are of major national significance are not as well funded as those directly funded by the DCMS. A good example is the Ashmolean Museum. It is one of four university museums in Oxford that make up the Oxford University museums hub. The Ashmolean is a major draw for tourism in Oxford. It contains the University of Oxford&#146;s collections of art and archaeology, which are the largest and most important in any museum outside London. As they have collections of national significance, such museums cannot help comparing their financial situation with that of museums funded  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1255"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column 1255</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by DCMS. It is very clear that they are trying to run equally ambitious enterprises on a fraction of the funding available to national museums which, in some cases, have neither such rich collections nor as many visitors. The comparisons demonstrate that in the funding that a museum such as the Ashmolean receives per visitor compared to many non-London museums. Museums such as the Ashmolean are modestly funded for the comparable job that they do. For them, an ideal long-term solution would be funding from the DIUS to cover the university work that they do&#151;carrying out and supporting teaching and research as well as the conservation of the university&#146;s collections&#151;and funding from the DCMS to help them to realise their plans for access and outreach that would enable them to expand on the opportunities provided by Renaissance funding.</p>

<a name="80207-0014.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="08020782000494">I now turn to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, although I feel that the noble Lords, Lord Renfrew and Lord Howarth, have already dealt with that in considerable detail. There are great concerns, which are shared by my noble friend Lord Redesdale, who has also taken considerable interest in the fate of the PAS. Whether it was an afterthought or whether it was a deliberate cut of 25 per cent in real terms over three years, I hope that Ministers in the DCMS are vigorously looking at the matter. I understand that a review is being carried out and I very much hope that the solution mentioned by noble Lords of the British Museum taking over the scheme will be realised, but it cannot do that without adequate funding. It is a vital scheme. We have heard about the access benefits and the success that it has had in attracting new visitors. We must ensure that that so recently instituted scheme is preserved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="08020782000495">On these Benches, we strongly support free admission and giving the widest access possible to our museums and galleries, but we need to be vigilant in making sure that there are proper resources to make that possible.

I do not need to rehearse the important stature that national museums occupy in public life. These institutions set aside things of public value. They preserve our national heritage and ensure that works of art, artefacts and natural phenomena continue to enrich our understanding of the past, present and future.

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="08020782000499">At first glance, museums seem to be thriving:  80 million people visited museums last year. Recent research suggests that 43 per cent of people living in England have made at least one visit to a museum. The increased funding by the DCMS has had an obvious impact on museum attendance and is certainly to be welcomed. Yet, on closer inspection, it is not quite as rosy as the Government would have us believe. The DCMS has a direct relationship with only a small number of registered museums in the UK&#151;the national museums and those funded by the Renaissance in the Regions programme. That constitutes only 22 museums throughout the country. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="08020782000500">National museums seem to be always centre stage but other categories of museum do not receive direct government funding, and they have been mentioned this afternoon. Local authorities and independent charities fund museums throughout the country. Do the Government map the level of their support? What has been done recently to encourage support for the museums and galleries that do not receive direct funding?</p>

<a name="80207-0014.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="08020782000501">While attendance is up, there is a danger that it might not be for long. Acquiring new pieces for their collections is vital to many museums. In evidence given to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, Sir Nicholas Goodison, the former chairman of the National Art Collections Fund,  said that a new acquisition generates tremendous excitement and,</p>
<ul><a name="08020782000623">&#147;enormously enhances the educational possibilities, the local pride in the collections and so on&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000574">This was pointed out by my noble friend Lord Renfrew. Yet as important as that is that it is being disregarded by the Government in light of the many resources being diverted away from lottery funding. Many museums see the current funding for acquisitions as reaching a crisis. In 2006, the Art Fund, an independent charity of which my noble friend Lord Renfrew is a most respected trustee, published a detailed survey of the collecting activity of museums. He found that while museums believe that collections must be continually renewed for a museum to survive and prosper, nearly all said that inadequate core funding was currently a barrier to collecting.</p>

<p><a name="08020782000575">Does the Minister accept that assessment? What  is he doing to reverse the diversion of lottery funding away from the arts, which was one of the lottery&#146;s core aims?</p>

<a name="80207-0014.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="08020782000503">It is unacceptable that while the Government may trot off figures about increasing attendance, a closer look reveals that the situation is much bleaker than imagined. Inadequate funding for acquisitions means static collections and flagging interest. Additionally, the higher number of visitors bring with them higher costs for maintenance, thus further depleting resources that could be used for collecting. Does the Minister consider it important to support museum acquisitions? I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s answers to several questions that were asked by my noble friend Lord Renfrew. What studies have the Government made of the tax provisions of other countries that promote private support? Does the Minister agree that a key part of encouraging people to visit museums is for them to have high-quality exhibits? Does he share my concern that the difficulties in acquiring works of art will eventually impact on visitor numbers? We support the Portable Antiquities Scheme and we think that it is an excellent organisation, but if the funding is frozen for the next three years, which seems to be the case, it will wither away, particularly if it has to lose some of its staff.</p>

<a name="80207-0014.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="08020782000504">The funding problem looks worse when we consider the money that has been diverted to the Olympics. The Government&#146;s raid on lottery funding means that arts and heritage now receive &#163;200 million less in annual lottery funding than in 1997-98. When the first budget for the Olympics was announced, the published breakdown of where the money was coming from revealed &#163;410 million that would be taken from the current National Lottery good causes. The revised budget published in March last year revealed that an additional &#163;675 million would be transferred from the lottery after 2009. This means that the arts are now contributing a staggering &#163;160 million to the 2012 Olympics, &#163;90 million of which is to help with meeting the overspending that has trebled the Olympic budget since London won the bid.</p>

<a name="80207-0014.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="08020782000505">Thankfully, the Government have conceded that there would be no further raids on good causes to fund the Games. The result is still shamefully inconsistent. As Graham Sheffield, chairman of the Royal Philharmonic Society put it, the Government are,</p>
<ul><a name="08020782000625">&#147;one minute praising the arts sector to the skies, the next, nicking hundreds of millions of pounds from the arts to balance the books on its inadequate budgeting for the Olympics&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020782000576">However, we welcome the Government&#146;s announcement today, whether it is real or in line with inflation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="08020782000506">The sales of Olympic land, which will be used to reimburse good causes for these diverted funds, is fine and I hope that it happens, but it is likely to take up to 10 years. Will there be any money to tide over the lack of money going towards museums? Do the Government expect it magically to bring arts and heritage back up to speed after a decade of slashed resources?</p>

Does the Minister understand the widespread concern that the diversion of funds from the arts will compromise this? Is this a missed opportunity? Indeed, missed opportunity seems to be the overarching theme of the Government&#146;s approach to funding for the arts. The state alone cannot fund all our great museums. We need to harness a wider range of resources. City profits have been increasing but corporate donations have not risen to match. The richest 20 per cent in the UK give a mere 0.7 per cent of their income and the poorest give four times as much. What have the Government done to encourage philanthropy?</p>

<a name="80207-0014.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="08020782000508">In 2004, Sir Nicholas Goodison recommended tax relief on lifetime donations of works of art to national museums. According to Giving USA 2004, the private donations in the United States in 2003 were something like $13 billion. What is the Government&#146;s current thinking on these proposals? My noble friend Lady Hooper asked some extremely penetrating questions on the subject and I look forward to the answers. We support the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and the noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter. According to a recent survey by the Museums, Libraries, and Archives Council, at least half of those museums surveyed would like more volunteers. What steps are the Government taking to encourage people to volunteer to help in museums and galleries? Even small donations help museums but is enough being done to encourage them? Is there any scope for increasing the visibility of donation boxes? Some of them are in excellent places and highly visible in museums but I have also seen some tucked away round the back. They should all be very visible at the exit.</p>

<a name="80207-0014.htm_para29">
<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="08020782000509">Indeed, do the Government have any plans to assist museums in promoting donations on a more immediate scale? These are of course just a few ideas but will the Minister agree that they are so far missed opportunities? The essential point is that though there might be instances where museums are receiving more money from the Government and numbers are going up, this is by no means the whole picture. If we are to continue the great tradition of public museums in this country, a more dynamic and more robust approach is needed to safeguard our national heritage. Though there might be instances of success, museum funding seems flawed. I mentioned at the beginning the opening of a museum some 300 years ago. Of course I was referring to the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford, as also mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, which has been there for 300 years. I am delighted that it recently received &#163;15 million in lottery money to partially fund a redevelopment. Let us hope that this will be enough to preserve at least this great museum and enable it to continue being the leading focus of culture and heritage in Oxford and for many miles around. I shall also mention the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, and the Walker in Liverpool, which has already been mentioned, and&#151;dare I say&#151;a little museum I know well called the Higgins museum in Bedford, which is full of amazing objects. They are all valuable and they all need much greater support.</p>

His experience in this field is widely known, but that is true of all noble Lords who have spoken in the debate.

While no doubt legitimate criticisms, large and small, have been made during the debate, it is easy to forget that by providing free admission to our national museums and galleries in 2001, the Government effectively absolutely transformed the position. Some will say that it is one of the great cultural achievements of this Government. I would go further and say that it is one of the great achievements of this Government in any field.</p>

They all played important roles in this successful policy change. That it has been a success is best indicated by the ultimate test of whether a policy is a success, which is when the official Opposition come round to adopting it&#151;here they have done so. There was a little wobble or two last year with the loss of a shadow Minister or two, but they have come round to supporting it. Despite the criticisms made by the noble Lord, Lord Luke, I understand that the official Opposition would not change the policy of free admission if they were ever so fortunate to come back to power again.</p>

Visits to the nine museums that used to charge have doubled. These figures alone demonstrate the success of the policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="08020782000514">I shall spend a minute or two reminding the House of the history of free admission. As the noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter, reminded us, some of our great national collections, such as the British Museum, have always been free. But during the 19th and early 20th century, a number of museums introduced some form of charging. For example, the National Gallery&#151;assumed by many to have always been free&#151;introduced charges on certain days of the week to reduce the number of visits to enable artists to study works more closely and make copies of them. Post-war cultural policy saw the reintroduction of free entry to all national collections. However, in the 1970s, the then Conservative Government reintroduced charging through the Museums and Galleries Admission Charges Act. That policy came into effect in 1974, but thankfully was scrapped within three months by the incoming Labour Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="08020782000515">Unfortunately when the Conservatives came back into power in 1979, they demonstrated their determination to abolish the principle of free access by permitting national museums to charge. This policy, along with real terms cuts in grant-in-aid led to nine national museums introducing charges during the 1980s and 1990s, including the three south Kensington museums, which saw a drop of around two million visits per year as a consequence. By 1997, visitors to national museums had fallen to fewer than 24 million. Ever increasing charges meant that some of our museums were in danger of becoming bastions just for the elite. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Luke, will forgive me if I will not take any lessons from the Conservatives on this issue of the great tradition of our public museums.</p>

<a name="80207-0015.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="08020782000516">When we came into power we pledged to scrap admission charges, which we did. In 1999, we introduced free entry for children; in 2000, free admission for those aged 60 and over; and in December 2001, free entry for all. Additional grant-in-aid was provided to the nine charging museums to compensate for the loss of income. Not only that, but we amended the legislation on VAT to allow national museums to recover the tax. This was worth &#163;22 million in 2005-06.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="08020782000517">The lottery has had a major impact over the years. Since 1994, the museums and galleries sector has received more than &#163;1 billion from the Heritage Lottery Fund, one-third of its total budget. Research suggests that the combination of government compensation for admission charges and lottery funding has had the biggest impact in terms of visitor numbers. The continued success of the lottery means that the more than &#163;700 million in new funding will be available from the Heritage Lottery Fund between 2009 and 2012. Many of our national museums will, we trust, also be playing a key part, with our support, in delivering a successful Cultural Olympiad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="08020782000518">We should not forget that this Government have also invested significantly in regional museums through the Renaissance in the Regions programme. Nearly &#163;150 million has been invested in England&#146;s regional museums since 2002, to raise standards, broaden access and provide a comprehensive service to schools. This programme is having a huge impact, as many noble Lords have told the House. School visits are up by 18 per cent and the number of children taking part in activities at museums has increased by more than 120 per cent.</p>

<a name="80207-0015.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="08020782000519">Headline increases in visits do not tell the whole story. The increase in visits to some of the national museums that used to charge is spectacular.

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="08020782000523">During the Comprehensive Spending Review, we recognised that safeguarding free admission was a top priority, not only for us, but for the boards of our national museums and the public. A convincing case was made for funding and, as a result, despite what everyone knows to have been a very tight spending round, we have been able to offer our museums inflation-proof increases in running cost grants and, in many cases, significant increases in capital. We have also provided additional funding for new facilities which will enhance the museums&#146; offer, bringing in even more visitors. This includes help towards the running costs of the new Museum of Liverpool, which will be a world-class museum of social history when it opens in two years&#146; time, and the costs of the V&amp;A&#146;s new education centre. As has already been mentioned, &#163;50 million has gone towards the new extension to Tate Modern, now the most visited modern art gallery in the world, and perhaps one of the greatest successes of all that we have talked about today. We have also provided an inflation-proof settlement for the renaissance programme to ensure that this continues to provide vital support to our regional museums.</p>

I know that that is a disappointment not just to my noble friend, but also to others who have support for other museums. We encourage them to continue their dialogue with the department and with the MLA, which is working with the trust to help strengthen and develop its business model and secure additional funding from a range of sources. I understand that the Minister for Culture, Margaret Hodge, has also offered a further meeting to discuss the museum&#146;s future.</p>

My noble friend Lord Howarth also asked about that. I cannot give much more detail, but the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council has been charged with developing this strategy and will publish it in the next few months. My noble friends Lord Harrison and Lord Faulkner of Worcester and the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, asked about devising strategies to obtain a better balance of funding between national, regional and local museums. It is inevitable that there will be some imbalance of funding for national museums, because most are based in London. However, 80 per cent of the renaissance programme funding goes to regional museums that are outside London and the south-east. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="08020782000527">My noble friend Lord Harrison asked whether museum boards and staff need to redouble efforts to persuade a sometimes sceptical public that museums are not the preserve of the privileged white middle class. The answer of course is yes. Museums have increased their effort to attract a wider range of visitors to the traditional museum, which can be seen in the fact that visits by people from BME backgrounds have increased, as have visits from different socio-economic groups.</p>

<a name="80207-0015.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="08020782000528">But should not the governing boards of museums reflect more accurately the profile of the country as a whole? I answer my noble friend Lord Harrison by saying, yes, we agree wholeheartedly that museums have made some progress on increasing board diversity, but there is much more still to do. My noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester asked about the comparative costs of attracting lower socio-economic groups. It is difficult to make direct comparisons between museums. There are many factors that determine visitor make-up, including local demographics. The costs associated with running museums vary considerably because of the nature of the collections and the building costs.</p>

We are actively exploring ways of encouraging greater philanthropy in the sector. As noble Lords will know, the Tate, the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery have benefited this year from major bequests and donations. There are a number of successful tax concessions in place, including acceptance in lieu and conditional exemption. Under acceptance in lieu, 38 objects valued at &#163;25 million went to our national collections in 2006. We need to encourage more take-up of the concessions that I have referred to. The Heritage Lottery Fund has awarded over &#163;150 million for acquisitions and more than &#163;56 million for archive and library acquisitions across the country. It created a &#163;3 million fund per annum from last year to support museums and galleries in that area. However, there is a problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="08020782000531">The Government are extremely grateful to Sir Nicholas for his recommendations in the Goodison report, which has been referred to. As I understand it, the majority of them have already been implemented. We share his view and objective of encouraging greater philanthropic giving to cultural institutions. We want better use made of existing incentives. To that end, the Treasury is undertaking a consultation with the charitable sector on measures to increase the take-up of Gift Aid. In addition, the Government keep all taxes under review and we will continue to try to identify ways to increase the uptake of existing forms of tax-efficient giving. I could not agree more with the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, about the importance of acquiring contemporary art. Given the current inflated art market, public money alone cannot be expected to secure major acquisitions. We are working hard to encourage private donations, and he will know about the recent successes.</p>

The MLA is reviewing the scheme and will consider options for future funding in the context of wider priorities for museum collections and public participation. If it brings comfort to those who want to see the scheme continue to succeed&#151;that is a universal feeling around the House&#151;the DCMS, the MLA and the British Museum are in discussions about the issue, as we speak.

The answer is that this is a matter for local authorities, but two-thirds of Renaissance museums, many of which are funded by local authorities, are free, including the one which I know best in Leicester, which is an excellent museum. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred to the poor imbalance of funding between Renaissance museums against national museums. I need to point out that Renaissance itself was not devised as a funding programme for all museums. The programme has been developed on the principle that investment should benefit audiences rather than institutions, hence the focus on investment into larger museums serving major centres of population. Are we considering the future funding of smaller museums? We will consider that as part of the McMaster Review and the next spending review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="08020782000534">I must move to my conclusion quickly. Has free admission worked? The answer from around the House is yes. We do not think that will be changed, whichever Government are in power. Many more people are visiting and from a broader cross-section. The National Museums Director has already been quoted during the debate. In his recently published and widely welcomed report on excellence in the arts, Sir Brian McMaster acknowledges the success of free admission. In fact, he is so convinced of the success of the policy at broadening cultural engagement that he has recommended that the principle of free entry should be extended to the arts for an annual free tickets week. We think this is a very exciting proposal and are considering how we might make this a reality in the hope that that idea has great support in the House.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000010">The noble Lord said: The Grand Committee now turns to the important question of transfer. Clause 18 and Schedule 5 deal with that part of the Bill&#146;s endeavours and attempts to change the system. The amendment in my name and that of my noble friend is linked with Amendments Nos. 104 to 107 and 220.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08020796000011">I hope that colleagues will not hold it against me if we spend a little time on transfer. Clause 18 and Schedule 5 relate to an important part of the operational success or otherwise of this policy; the computer platform is also crucial in that respect. I invite the Minister to tell us as much as possible about the transfer process. The last time this was seriously considered was in another place. Time has moved on. Of course, not everything will be settled, because there are still some questions to be resolved by the commission. That is right and proper and we understand it, but perhaps there have been further developments that would give us a little more information about what is to happen when this unfolds in a few short months&#146; time.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08020796000012">Some points that I made in passing earlier in Committee resolve into two questions. First, if the software releases that the Minister has been telling us about, characterised as PR1 and due to be put in place some time in this financial year, were to be delayed beyond Easter 2008, or all their specification problems were not ironed out before then, or if there were problems with stuck cases or anything like that&#151;and there is a finance release coming behind PR1, so there are two important bits of software development on which the transfer depends&#151;would the Minster&#146;s default position be that he would consider delaying the whole timetable of change? My worry is simple and relates to what happens if the

We have been there before and do not want the same result.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08020796000013">My second question is about the continuing use of the child support computer system&#151;the original system that runs old cases. As the National Audit Office report of 2006 reminded us, if the child support computer system is required after 1 April 2008, the agency&#151;and/or the commission in future&#151;will have to renegotiate the arrangement with the supplier, EDS, to establish who will meet any additional costs of extending the use of the system further. So my second question is about the platform to enable the transfer to be achieved successfully. Who is paying for CSCS and when do the Government expect the last old cases&#151;those that are run on CSCS&#151;to be shut down and transferred to the new statutory maintenance scheme? As far as I understand it, some of those cases may run to 2013, at least in theory. These are important technical questions that the Committee would benefit from knowing a little more about.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08020796000014">The amendments are probing amendments, save Amendment No. 107, which refers to the need for regulations on the introduction of the transfer proceedings to be dealt with under the affirmative procedure. That is an important issue, to which I shall return.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08020796000015">I want to look at the background, so that I can ensure that I understand what is going on. I stand to be corrected on this. I am not trying to demonstrate any great knowledge here; I am just struggling to understand what the proposals are. Under the Bill, the two existing schemes are to be closed down and the cases will be transferred to the new statutory maintenance service, floated off into voluntary arrangements between parents or, in effect, parked in a new cash transfer service. One of those three options has to be an outcome for all existing cases under the two schemes. This much I think I understand.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08020796000016">However, previous attempts at bulk migration do not give us any confidence that we will not, unless this is carefully thought through, repeat the mistakes made in years gone by. The 2006 National Audit Office report on the failure of the move from the old system to the new system in 2003 rather grandly said that the system had to be abandoned because the,</p>
<ul><a name="08020796000566">&#147;pre-requisites in terms of system and business stability had not yet been met&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020796000445">A few short months before the new transfer, can we be sure that those prerequisites have been met for the redesign of the system that is to be deployed by the new commission? The 2006 White Paper said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08020796000457">&#147;We do not underestimate the challenge of moving to a single system, and previous attempts to move clients between schemes have highlighted the complexity and risks involved&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000017">Given what the NAO said about what went before and the White Paper&#146;s assessment of what we are facing, it is important that we take time to understand what is going on.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08020796000018">The details that we have to date could be described as sketchy. We still have a lot to understand about how the transition will be managed between the

We need to know that before we can be confident that that will all work.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08020796000019">The abolition of Section 6 later this year is expected to lead to a reduction in the number of cases dealt with by the statutory scheme even before the new maintenance service begins to operate. In 2009-10, parents who are still in the existing two schemes will be offered the three options that I referred to. From 2010-11, new applications for the statutory scheme will be accepted and the process of transferring existing cases will begin.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08020796000020">My point is&#151;and I seek clarification on this&#151;that parents using the existing scheme will, wherever they go, have to opt in to the new scheme if that is what they want. There is a formal application process but, if that is not completed, they are not in the scheme; if a formal application is not made within a set time, the commission will be entitled to close the case and liability for maintenance will stop. That is a danger point, which people who are advising those who may be in this situation later this year need to understand; they need to make their clients&#151;non-resident parents and parents with care&#151;fully aware of that situation.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08020796000021">I acknowledge and agree with the protection that, if two parents disagree, the parent wishing to use the new service has the advantage and wins the day if there is a contest. That is welcome and reassuring, but the knowledge of having to opt in and the procedure for opting in need to be made abundantly and patently clear to the people who are currently in the system if we are to be safe in the knowledge that people can best take advantage of what we propose.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08020796000022">The memorandum from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee that accompanies the Bill talks about the transfer being a complex and detailed process and about the exact requirements not really emerging until the process is well under way. It talks about the exact process of how and by what means an individual parent shall decide to opt in and about whether more precise data can be given on the type and number of cases involved. That is a good point, but it is difficult to assess the type and number of cases involved.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08020796000023">Mr Plaskitt, the Minister in the other place, admitted that a number of behavioural uncertainties make it difficult to make robust estimates of future flows and the future case load. He is right, but that makes the planning of the transfer process that much more difficult and more hazardous. He told Members of Parliament:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08020796000446">In that regard, the department has undertaken a dedicated telephone survey of existing CSA clients on their future choices&#151;admittedly, as I have said, even though people may not yet be in a position to make rational and detailed choices. The survey, which

Those figures are low enough. On further and better questioning, however, the researchers concluded that only 15 per cent of all parents with care could be considered likely to make their own arrangements under the new system. That figure concerns me and should concern other Members of the Committee. I would be grateful for any reassurance on that from the Minister.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08020796000024">We discussed earlier in Committee the Government&#146;s working assumption that the number using the commission&#146;s statutory collection and enforcement services will fall from 1.4 million cases to around 1 million. That automatically assumes that the number of those using the voluntary arrangements as opposed to anything else will rise by about 40 per cent&#151;from 500,000 to 700,000. Forty per cent is a big and optimistic figure. Moreover, I cannot find in anything that I have been given any information on the expected numbers to opt for the proposed cash transfer payment system as opposed to either the voluntary system or the new CMEC set-up.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08020796000025">All that is taking the long way round to say that we need a lot more information, that a lot of planning needs to be done and that we need to be sure when we make a start to this change later this year that we have done everything that we conceivably can to anticipate problems and to make things easier for the client group. Parliament has a duty, subject to the requirement on the new commission to put the final touches to all this planning and to implement it once it is properly constituted, to pause and ask diligently exactly what planning is in hand and to satisfy itself that this has some prospect of working.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08020796000026">Amendment No. 107 is a substantive amendment on an issue that I feel strongly about. While I understand the imperative to move quickly because the scene is fast evolving and I know that affirmative resolution procedures always hold Ministers back&#151;or at least, that is how they see it&#151;a great deal is riding on this three-year period. Schedule 5 certainly provides for regulations setting out how the commission is expected to approach the process. The regulations are lengthy because they need to set out phasing and timing requirements, the principles for determining the order in which parents are asked to choose, the procedures involved, overall scheme time limits and where applications are to be made. All these things are welcome, but we must consider them under the affirmative procedure if they are to be meaningful and if Parliament is to have a chance to track the process with the leverage afforded by that procedure. Negative procedure leaves the parliamentary scrutiny process with one hand tied firmly behind its back.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08020796000027">I understand the need for speed, but if we begin grabbing at change it suggests that we are not in the position that we want to be in. We should introduce  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC619"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column GC619</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this in a consistent and planned way&#151;one that does not require panic measures. For the life of me, I cannot understand why we need to or even should accept the negative resolution procedure for this set of regulations. This is where the introduction of CS2 failed: in the transfer to and implementation of the new scheme, it all fell over. Parliament is entitled to insist on this; even if the process takes a little longer, we will be more reconciled to it so long as there is a chance to monitor it in detail. Through the affirmative procedure, we are able to hold the Government to account. Parliament can also offer help and advice with the process in the way that only it can. So Amendment No. 107 is not probing in nature; it is a substantive amendment. We may want to return to it if we cannot get the Minister to think again.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08020796000028">On Amendment No. 220, the Minister will say that paragraph 2(2)(e) of Schedule 5 allows for regulations that would require the commission to have a strategy. This amendment would strengthen that requirement by putting a direct obligation on the Secretary of State to ensure that all parents in the system are kept well informed about the transfer arrangements. I think that that should include a personal information communication to each parent, but I anticipate that the Minister will respond by saying that that would be too bureaucratic, too costly and too slow. However, we need to think about this carefully.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08020796000029">Amendment No. 104 deals with the principles that will determine the order of transfer. I can see that paragraph 2(2)(c) allows for regulations to specify those principles, but this is a probing amendment, because I want to explore the Government&#146;s thinking here. The discussion in the other place did not take us much further beyond what had been set out in the White Paper in 2006, which pointed clearly to ensuring that we are driven by child poverty considerations and putting the poorest families first. The commission will look at this issue, but it would be helpful if the Committee could understand what further thinking has been done. Amendment No. 104 gives us a chance to do that. I am particularly worried, as are members of the Select Committee in another place. The Minister will have seen the comments in the fourth report of the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee on child support reform. Having taken evidence from the chief executive/commissioner designate, the committee was worried about the operational difficulties of taking on the priorities that he was suggesting and said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08020796000459">&#147;This means that the transition should be planned with administrative efficiency at its heart. We appreciate that the Government wants to focus on support for the poorest families first. We are, however, concerned at the CSA Chief Executive's comments that C-MEC may prioritise the old scheme nil assessment cases. This approach may be misplaced effort and result in little additional child maintenance for parents with care. We would welcome clarification on this aspect of the Government&#146;s proposals&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020796000447">There is obviously a vein of concern in the Select Committee report that I share, and it is referred to in Amendment No. 104.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para22">
<p><a name="08020796000030">On Amendment No. 105, it is patently clear that the transfer must not disrupt maintenance payments.  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC620"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column GC620</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That is obvious, but some ministerial reassurance that that will be guaranteed would be helpful.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08020796000031">Penultimately, Amendment No. 106 deals with transitional protection and tries to flesh out exactly what the prescribed adjustment will mean to a maintenance calculation on transfer. It is a probing amendment. Transitional protection is obviously necessary, but it can complicate bureaucratic and administrative systems to a high and damaging degree. If we do not know exactly which cases will remain in the statutory system and which will leave, we need to know a little more about how the Government see the commission using the power of a prescribed adjustment, because it could impact quite severely with big increases or decreases in maintenance or liabilities in future. We need to understand how that power will be used properly.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08020796000032">Finally, and briefly, Amendment No. 102 was my desperate attempt over Christmas to think of some way to deal with the legacy of the outstanding backlog while all that happens. Whether David Henshaw is right or wrong, I fear that the Bill is asking the new commission to do an enormous amount of work in the transfer process at the same time as it continues with its ongoing work to try to keep pace with everything that has gone on in the past. The amendment was a cockshy at trying to find some way to reduce the workload. Of course, it is practically impossible, because it would be unfair and unreasonable to refuse to alter a non-resident parent&#146;s liability if it were dramatically increased or decreased; the amendment was just an attempt to make the point again that, if we are not careful, the work that the commission is being asked to do&#151;to deal with the day-to-day work and the legacy case load, as well as to make this important transfer&#151;will pull down the whole pack of cards.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08020796000033">These are very important issues. I am sorry that I have laboured the point, but I hope that people understand that the attempt is merely to try to ensure that we do not make the same mistakes as we made last time. I beg to move.</p>

They are in the centre of the two brackets: Amendments Nos. 102 and 220. As the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said, transference has proved to be a veritable nightmare for the CSA. It would be helpful first to establish from the Minister not how many cases have been transferred but how many have not. I suspect that there are an awful lot.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08020796000035">On Amendment 102, as I understand it, under the Bill, some non-resident parents will get an awful shock quite soon, because HMRC data will become available to CMEC and a reassessment will presumably be made. I am talking not so much about single transference as about, in a sense, double transference. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, is interested in transferring the original cases and the 2003 cases to the new CMEC formula under the Bill. Before that, an element of transference will be going on anyway. The Minister might say that it is not true transference, but it is certainly an alteration. I do not think that there is any doubt about that.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para27">
<p><a name="08020796000036">The whole point of the amendments to which I have put my name is to understand exactly how the new scheme will take over from the old one. The last I heard was in a letter to someone, possibly even to me, from the Minister. It gave the impression that he did not have the slightest idea. He said that it would be a matter for CMEC when it got around to it. That, at least, was honest, and I am sure that he can confirm it today&#151;although perhaps he would not like to use exactly the same words as I just did. With two different child maintenance payment schemes running concurrently at present, how can he assure the Committee that a third will not again cause hideous confusion for CMEC or, even worse, for the parents due for maintenance payments, whether those payments are in to the parent with care or out from the non-resident parent? That is extremely important. </p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para28">
<p><a name="08020796000037">My real worry, though, lies not with the ensuing confusion so much as with the effects of that confusion. There is a possibility&#151;not to put it any more strongly&#151;that the non-resident&#146;s liability for payment could be lost in the transition between the former scheme and the current scheme. Does the Minister see that in the same light as I do&#151;does he see it as a problem? Does CMEC plan to put in place any mechanisms that will prevent that from happening? Can it, or he, guarantee some sort of transitional protection to parents as the commission implements yet another scheme?</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para29">
<p><a name="08020796000038">At present, regulations under Schedule 5 will be subject to negative resolution, as the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said. That is on the basis that the process by which cases transfer will take around three years and that issues may emerge requiring changes to be made quickly. I agree, given the importance of transitional arrangements, that it is right that the regulations governing the process should receive the positive approval of Parliament before enactment. There should not be much difference in speed between affirmative resolution and negative resolution, except that regulations made under negative resolutions come into effect on the day that they are laid. I cannot imagine that the speed requirement will be such that four to six weeks would not be appropriate before the regulations came into effect. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, that this is such an important subject and will affect so many people that it is right that Parliament should discuss the regulations before they become operative.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000039">With regard to the prioritisation in Amendment No. 104, clearly the principles are not in any particular order. None the less, CMEC will have to have some idea of the order in which it will transfer the various cases. Does the Minister have any thoughts on that, or will he say yet again that it will be a matter for the commission? The interesting thing about Amendment No. 220 is that it is not necessary if the noble Lord and I get what he has suggested; namely, the affirmative procedure.</p>

The first relates to transition. Will he help me to understand Schedule 5 more clearly? As I take it, there is a case load in the two statutory systems. Should an NRP have a new relationship under the new, third system, that will potentially require a recalculation for the parent with care in one of the existing statutory schemes. At that point, that case will be pulled over to the new system. Can I take it from my noble friend that it will not be assumed that that existing statutory case, irrespective of activity in it, will go automatically into the voluntary system? I would be horrified if that were to happen.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0001.htm_para32">
<p><a name="08020796000042">If somebody is in the statutory system and is taken by default into the new system because a new case under the new system affects them and their income has to be recalculated&#151;for example, the person concerned may go from supporting one family to supporting two&#151;there must be a presumption in favour of the statutory system unless the person chooses to go into the voluntary system. With a new case, one could argue that it is different: the person concerned is going into it with their eyes open. But it seems unwise to tell somebody who is in the statutory system that they are to go into the voluntary system unless they choose to opt in to the statutory system. Will the Minister clarify that? My apprehensions may be groundless.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000043">My second question arises from some of the statistics in the briefing, which made me raise an eyebrow. Has the Minister reflected on the implication of the fact that twice as many non-resident parents as parents with care want the voluntary system? Can he think why? I can suggest several reasons: they think that they will get a better deal; they think that they will pay less money; they think that there will be less pressure on them to pay; and they think that they will be able to hug knowledge and information that she&#151;the parent with care&#151;will not have and which will allow them, to a degree, to control what they pay. The question obviously belongs to other debates as well, but if there is any statistic that should alarm the Minister about the potential for the voluntary system to be grabbed by NRPs, if they can, it is the one that I have just given. It can mean only that NRPs will seek to get a better deal for themselves. The perception is not necessarily shared by the parent with care. This frightens me.</p>

I would say that if I were in their position.

I shall deal first with the two questions raised by my noble friend. The first was the proposition that there is an existing case under either the first or the existing scheme and that, under the new arrangements, there will be another relationship and a link with that earlier case. The specific question was whether that would automatically force that first case into the voluntary system&#151;</p>

The question was whether that would automatically force the first case into the voluntary system irrespective of whether the second parent with care was in the statutory system. The answer to that is clearly no. There would not be an automatic deeming that the first case was in the voluntary system. Quite how the mechanics will work during the transitional period will need to be sorted through, but the general principle&#151;this touches on a point raised by my noble friend at Second Reading&#151;is that in linked cases, if I may use that term, one arrangement may well be voluntary by choice and another may be in the statutory system. I could take my noble friend through how the arithmetic works, but perhaps we could do that outside the Committee.</p>

Perhaps he could enlighten us a little more. We have family A in the statutory system. A new family, family B, comes into the system. Family B, the second family, chooses to go for the statutory system. What is then the presumption about family A? Is it that the family will be pulled over into the statutory system but can opt out into the voluntary system if they wish, or will the presumption be that they will go into the voluntary system unless they opt out and go into the statutory system? Secondly, if family B has opted for the voluntary system, what then happens to family A? In other words, where is the presumption?</p>

In the first case, if there is a non-resident parent and a parent with care, if neither wants to stay in the statutory system, that arrangement does not have to stay in the statutory system. Similarly for the second case&#151;I am not sure whether we are talking about a common NRP or a common PWC&#151;where there is a common NRP. If, for that arrangement, both want to be out of the system, both would be in the voluntary system; if one of them chooses to be in the statutory system, they will be in the statutory system. There is nothing to preclude a common NRP having a voluntary arrangement in respect of one relationship and a statutory arrangement in respect of a second relationship. I know that that raises questions about how the arithmetic works. I can summarise it on the assumption that they are both in the statutory system, although the first case in the voluntary system would not be adjusted for a change in the arithmetic. If that became unaffordable, presumably a parent would choose to opt in to the statutory system.</p>

First, there are more children&#151;there is another relationship, but with a common non-resident parent. As I understand it, that automatically affects the calculation. The subsidiary question that I think the noble Baroness was asking was: in that case, assuming that they do not opt out of the system at that point, which formula will be used? Will it be the new CMEC formula or the 2003 formula? I suspect that, for the first three years, it will be the 2003 formula, not the CMEC formula, because the CMEC formula will not really be up and running, except for new cases, and that could not be described as a new case.</p>

If I have understood my noble friend correctly, in a new case involving a second family in the voluntary system with a NRP shared with a family in the statutory system, the statutory figure would remain unaffected. All that they could get is the head space of the difference between, say, two and three children, which might be 5 per cent net, 4 per cent gross, as opposed to divvying up the full sum between them. That would be grossly unfair to the second family. That suggests that for any new family coming into the new scheme, if there is any linked case, the only way that they can get a fair apportionment of resources, especially if the first family chooses to stay in the statutory system, would be for them also to go into the statutory system. Otherwise, they could get only the head growth for the extra child, not share the apportionment between the two families.</p>

Let us start with a situation where the non-resident parent has two relationships, the first one of which is currently in one of the statutory systems, either CS1 or CS2, and there is another parent with care involved. I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, that if two children have to be dealt with under the formula where there  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC625"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column GC625</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was only one before, that will affect the percentage that applies to the non-resident parent and the sum must be divided among the number of children involved. However, that affects only the amount that is then due to the parent with care who is in the system; it does not of itself drive an adjustment to a voluntary arrangement.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0002.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08020796000054">If it were the other way around so that there was a voluntary arrangement to start with and a new arrangement with the same non-resident parent, and the second relationship resulted in a request to be in the statutory system, the calculation on the percentages to be applied to the non-resident parent&#146;s income would be driven on the basis of two children. Whatever sum is produced will be divided by two for each of the two children. The parent with care who is in the system would get that amount, but it could not force any adjustment to the pre-existing voluntary arrangement, regardless of whether that arrangement involved a higher or a lower sum. It may be that that would cause the parties to seek a renegotiation of the voluntary arrangement. If the renegotiation is not successful, there is an option for the non-resident parent to bring the case within the statutory system so that the formula would apply to both situations. This would not of itself disturb a voluntary arrangement. Although clearly the number of children being supported in the system would affect the calculation, it would not be applied to the voluntary system.</p>

Let us say that the non-resident parent is supporting two children at a net level of 20 per cent of his income under one of the statutory schemes. He goes into a new relationship that produces one child. That would mean that his total contribution under the net formula would be 25 per cent. If the second family goes into the voluntary system, would that family get merely 5 per cent, the difference between the 20 per cent already going to the statutory family and the total net percentage required to support three children, which is 25 per cent? Would the statutory family remain unaffected at 20 per cent because the second family was in the voluntary system or, despite that, would there be a presumption that the 25 per cent total would be divided up pro rata, in which case the second family would get a little over 8 per cent? Which of those two would apply in the voluntary system, and what would be the case in the statutory system?</p>

The non-resident parent is paying 20 per cent for two children in the statutory system and now there is a new family. Normally he would be required to pay 25 per cent in total, so the difference between the old and the new assessment would be 5 per cent. Would only the extra 5 per cent go to the second family, or would the entire 25 per cent be reapportioned?</p>

That amount, whatever it is, would be divided between the three children. There would be an adjustment to the statutory arrangement for the first two children so that the parent with care would get two-thirds of 25 per cent. In relation to the one-third, there would be no effect on the voluntary arrangement. Whatever the voluntary agreement was would drive what the payment is. If that became unaffordable in the light of the adjustment, it would be open to either parent to bring it into the statutory system. In that case, the 25 per cent level would apply and would be divided into three with two-thirds going to the parent with care and one-third to the other parent.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000059">I hope that that has dealt with the point. All sorts of combinations can affect this. It is more likely that it will hit cases the other way around, where there is a voluntary arrangement to start with and then someone comes into the statutory scheme. The same principle applies. You take account of all the children who are involved in maintenance. That drives the formula and the percentage. It is divided up among those children and is adjusted only for those in the statutory scheme. My noble friend also asked whether, if there were an arrangement under the new basis of assessment in 2010, that would drag an existing arrangement under the previous scheme across to the new formula. I believe that the answer is yes. Obviously when we get to 2013 there will be only one formula. I see reassuring nods from the back.</p>

If someone starts off in the old scheme and a new scheme case is linked to it, that drags the case across on to a new basis of assessment. There will be differences and fewer complications under the new arrangements. Some of the complexities around linked cases will fall away because under the new system the CSA&#151;or CMEC&#151;will not police the benefits system as it does at the moment. That will be the job of Jobcentre Plus. Therefore, ordering cases around the NRP will make some of the processes easier. That is the principle involved. I hope that that has clarified matters.

<p><a name="08020796000072">Within Schedule 5 we have made provision for regulations to require the commission to develop a scheme for the movement of existing customers to the new statutory maintenance arrangements. The process by which cases transfer will commence in 2010 and take around three years. The provision is for negative regulations, but I hear the strength of the argument and will take this away. I believe that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not have any problem with what is proposed. It is usually focused on challenging when it believes that the affirmative procedure should be used. I might return to this, even if we change the procedure for the first set of regulations. I understand the point.</p>

It is essential not only that Parliament can scrutinise the plan, but also that parents understand the choices that will be available to them during this transfer period. A communication programme to support parents through this process of transition will start in 2009, enabling the first case transfers in 2010.

The amendments differ in their effects, but I understand that they are probing by nature. By freezing ongoing case activity, we run the risk of not addressing any urgent changes of circumstances that may be required. For example, if someone paying an assessed amount of maintenance lost their job, all action on reassessing their case in line with their new circumstances would stop. I do not believe that this is a fair situation to present to anyone, nor do I believe that it is the intention of the amendment. Unfortunately, some incomes do not keep pace with prices; therefore, to base an assessment on what someone earns as opposed to what prices are is a much fairer way of doing things. Additionally, we know that there are many cases that have a current liability of nil. For these cases a percentage increase would have no effect and the nil assessment would remain in place for the length of the transition process.

<p><a name="08020796000077">Amendment No. 104 stipulates that certain cases should be given priority in the move to the new HMRC data-based assessment during the transition period. In the White Paper, which has been referred to, we laid out guiding principles for the approach to transition. These are to focus on supporting the poorest families first; meet parents&#146; needs by empowering them to make informed choices; minimise disruption and provide a seamless service for the move to the new regime; and ensure that the approach is practical and achievable, learning from the past.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0002.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08020796000078">As the Committee will be aware, we have consistently stated that it is right that the commission should consider the order in which cases are moved. This gives the commission time not only to plan but also to take account of the scale of the task and the nature of the cases involved. Only the commission will be in a position to know about its levels of other work and available staff resources. It would therefore be inappropriate for us, at this stage, to dictate to the commission how to carry out this major administrative challenge.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0002.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08020796000079">We know from previous attempts at reform of the child maintenance service that a large scale movement of cases is a complex and time-consuming process. I am sure that the Committee will agree that it would be prudent to let the commission, having learnt the lessons from the past, assess for itself the right order for the movement of its customers, the right plan of action and the right point at which to begin the transition. It would not, therefore, be appropriate to dictate any priorities on the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0002.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08020796000080">Amendment No. 106 would remove the facility to allow for a set of prescribed adjustments to be applied to the new formula assessment in certain cases, where the new calculation based on HMRC data differs significantly from the existing liability. This could have the effect of either a marked increase or a marked decrease in maintenance paid or received for either parent. By removing that facility, we run the risk that either parent may not have sufficient time to adjust to a change in their maintenance payments. That could create significant hardship and is not consistent with our intention to minimise disruption during that period.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0002.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08020796000081">I think that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, raised the point that some adjustments could be quite significant, as some of the assessments are based on data that are quite old. That is right, so it is important to have a mechanism to potentially smooth the impact of that. Similar arrangements were introduced when the current system was changed from the first one, although they turned out to be quite complex and difficult to manage. A good deal of thought needs to be addressed to this. Without such a mechanism, some parents with care and non-resident parents could hit difficulties. I recognise that the prescribed adjustments regime currently administered

That is why the commission will need time to develop detailed plans to introduce a new and simple way of handling such instances. However, to have no facility and no flexibility would be in no one&#146;s interests.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0002.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08020796000082">It is for similar reasons that I cannot agree with Amendment No. 107, which would make all regulations made under Schedule 5 subject to the affirmative procedure. Once the transfer process is under way, the commission will be able to see how it is taking shape and may need to make changes at fairly short notice. As any changes will require regulations, making them subject to debates in both Houses could introduce unacceptable delays, which could have detrimental effects for the parents involved. Notwithstanding that, we ought to think seriously about changing the initial set of regulations, but I will revert to that matter on Report.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0002.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08020796000083">Finally, Amendment No. 220 would require the Secretary of State to set out in regulations the strategy for informing parents of the details of the timetable and arrangements for transfer to the new arrangements. It is our intention to be completely transparent about how the transfer process will work. We will make that information available to honourable Members so that they can raise any concerns at that time and before the transfer to new arrangements begins. Honourable Members and noble Lords, I should say&#151;I saw the Chairman bristling at that. You can see where this speaking note originated.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000084">It is essential not only that Parliament can scrutinise the plan but also that parents understand the choices that will be available to them during the transfer period. We are committed to minimising the disruption to parents in that period by providing a seamless service for the move to the new arrangements. We are also concerned that this amendment, were it to be accepted, could build delays into beginning the process of moving cases to the new maintenance arrangements. That could prevent children from benefiting from the movement to new maintenance arrangements at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000085">I shall try to pick up some of the other points that have been raised. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked about the computer system for the old scheme cases. He said that he thought that the contract ran out in 2010. He is pretty well informed, as usual, but there is a right to extend that as required, which it almost certainly will be. Cases will remain on that system until, possibly, 2013.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0003.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08020796000086">The noble Lord also asked about the releases under PR1 and how that will affect things. It is vital, and the CSA recognises this, that any new releases should be fully tested. To date they have been extensively tested and we believe that PR1 will be delivered in time to ensure that the indicative timescales in Section 6 that I referred to last time can be adhered to. I stress that it is not just CSA systems that need to be adjusted; Jobcentre Plus is being worked on as well because of the changes around benefits and the removal of Section 6 compulsion. Those systems have to cope as well.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000087">I shall take a little step back. It is implicit in the discussion that we have already had that the transitional process proceeds as follows. The first issue is the removal of Section 6. By the end of 2008, on the basis of current plans and timing, there will be a choice for all parents as to whether they stay in the system or enter the system. In 2010 the transition of cases from the first and second schemes to the new scheme, for those who wish to stay in the statutory scheme, will then begin. It means that, for a period, three different schemes will run, but we will end up in 2013 with one scheme, in which everybody will be on the same basis of assessment. The transition is not brief, but it is right to build in time to make sure that it can be done effectively and that we avoid some of the difficulties that have been encountered in the past. It is currently proposed that people will have formally to opt in to the statutory system. That is being looked at by the commission but, if that is where we end up, it is important that parents who wish to stay in the system are supported in doing so.</p>

Let us be clear that we want parents to have the choice. We want those who are currently in the system to have the choice whether to stay in it just as anybody else will have the choice. We had a philosophical debate about whether we were encouraging voluntary arrangements as a broad principle. I think that it is clear that that is where we are, but it is not inconsistent with making sure that those people who want and choose to go into the statutory system are fully supported in doing so. The mechanics by which they end up in the system are a secondary issue; the principle is that, on the basis of information and support, that is what people choose to do. We must do everything that we can to make sure that that is where they end up.</p>

The Minister is obviously right in saying that we will move to one statutory scheme, but we are creating one statutory scheme plus a voluntary scheme. Those in the

We will substitute different complexities for those that we have now. Although the Minister has been helpful, I am still not persuaded of the appropriateness of the interface.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0003.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08020796000093">Perhaps I may have one last go before I shut up on this and we perhaps revisit the issue in some other way. Let us assume that somebody is in the statutory scheme and remains in it. They have two children and receive 20 per cent of income net. Under a new case in the voluntary scheme, as the Minister said, they would be entitled to approximately 8 per cent or one-third of the other&#146;s total liability of 25 per cent. Under that new, voluntary case, they would have to know not only the other&#146;s income but also all the details of the existing case on the statutory system to be aware that they were entitled not to 15 per cent net, which they might recently have thought if they were the only case, but to 8 per cent net because an existing case was on the statutory system, which they, being voluntary, had no way of knowing about or accessing. The second family, in the voluntary scheme, may well get short-changed because of a lack of knowledge and bargaining power in the equation.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0003.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08020796000094">Let us take a second case as an example. It is a brand-new case coming into the voluntary system. One child is involved and the non-resident parent agrees the equivalent of 15 per cent. That is fine and everybody is very happy. There then comes a second child in the voluntary system. The first person asks, &#147;What is going to happen?&#148;. Are the two women expected to get together over a cup of tea and divvy up the money? How will each of them know what they can reasonably ask from the non-resident parent without them knowing about the other and what the other is getting?</p>

<a name="80207-gc0003.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08020796000095">There are real problems with the alignment of a voluntary system with a statutory one and with the alignment of one voluntary system with another. I absolutely agree that in many cases there is no problem with there being a single, one-off voluntary system where there is an agreement to pay. However, the moment you move beyond that&#151;we saw this with all the problems with the old CSA&#151;we are simply substituting different sorts of complexity, without the parent with care necessarily being able to have formal knowledge based on what the statutory bodies have collected from her.</p>

However, to return to the first of my noble friend&#146;s examples of what a parent with care in the voluntary scheme will be entitled to, the starting point is that they would have a voluntary arrangement for something to which the two parties agree. If that negotiation could be successfully concluded and sustained, it would involve some discussion about the non-resident parent&#146;s other commitments. At the end of the day, if the new parent with care is not satisfied with where a voluntary agreement is heading, they would test the statutory scheme and see what came from it.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0003.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08020796000097">We acknowledge that there are challenges for parents with care to obtain information, particularly when relationships have been fairly transitory. That is why

I hang on to the point that people are encouraged to enter voluntary arrangements with which they are satisfied. They then negotiate between themselves, with the help of the information and support service. Where the NRP already has commitments, whether under the voluntary system or the statutory system, I imagine that they will inevitably mention them as part of the discussion and potentially dampen the outcome. However, if the parent with care is not satisfied at any point, the recourse to the statutory system will settle in. That is the protection in the scheme.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0003.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08020796000098">Let me see whether I can address the other points. Perhaps I concluded on what the broad transition was and how we reach 2013. My noble friend also talked about the disparity between the views of NRPs and PWCs. That is a real point. It is not fair to say that the NRPs will inevitably prefer a voluntary arrangement to the statutory system because they will get away with less. Many of them are bugged by having to be in the system at the moment, particularly when it has not really produced more cash for their kids. That drives some, but I accept not all, of the behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000099">I hope that I have dealt with the queries about the IT systems. I stress that it is for CMEC to decide ultimately which system it ends up with. Inevitably it will start off with the system that is there at the moment and will live with that and with the enhancements that will be made through PR1 through much if not all the transition. As I said, however, that is something for CMEC to decide in the future.</p>

I do not have the absolute number, because we said that we would transfer cases only when the new IT systems could cope with that. We know that they have not been able to. Inevitably, cases are drawn across into the current scheme when they are linked under the sort of arrangements that we have been talking about.</p>

These things are kept under review, but we must ensure that there is capacity and flexibility in the system to deal with what comes from these arrangements.

It is perfectly reasonable to get it to oversee and deploy the plan in the legislation, but we have had much bad experience of this transitional process. This is my final plea. I am encouraged by the Minister saying that he would think about the affirmative resolution procedure being used at parliamentary level, at least in the initial stages of this transfer. If we do not get this right, the organisation has no chance of success. It is carrying a package of legacy issues, which we all understand.

<p><a name="08020796000116">Amendment No. 103 and our opposition to the Question that Clause 24 stand part of the Bill have been tabled to garner a little more clarity about enforcement proceedings and the role of the parent with care within those enforcement proceedings. Amendment No. 103 would allow the parent with care to do four things: to make representations in respect of the appropriate enforcement action; to be involved in the enforcement action taken by the commission; to be permitted to attend enforcement proceedings; and to take their own enforcement action in certain circumstances. That is currently prevented under the two existing child support systems.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0003.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08020796000117">It is often the parent with care who has the necessary information in respect of the non-resident parent&#146;s financial circumstances. Especially in the early months following separation, the parent with care will know of any assets held by the non-resident parent, which may mean that the appropriate enforcement action to be taken should include an application for a third-party debt order or a charging order or whatever&#151;the various sanctions that are available to the commission.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0003.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08020796000118">That information is rarely released by a non-resident parent to the Child Support Agency. Notwithstanding the effects of the interrelationship between CMEC and HMRC, that position is likely to continue in the future. It is often a lack of knowledge of the non-resident parent&#146;s circumstances that leads to a delay of appropriate, or indeed any, enforcement action being taken. Does the Minister not think that, as the remit of the commission is to secure payment with minimum delay, the parent with care should be involved in that process and should be in a position to make representations that will achieve that aim? Would it not help the commission to have the advice of the parent with care? How does the Minister justify the rather unusual situation that the person who generally has financial interest in payment being secured is the only person prevented from making representations about how such payments should be secured? I find it odd that the existing formulation prevents the parent with care from taking any enforcement action in his or her own right, even if there is a complete failure by the child support organisation, CMEC, to take enforcement action, which, therefore, results in a financial loss to the parent with care. I cannot believe that that is  really a situation that the Minister wants. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000121">I can dispose of Amendment No. 187 expeditiously. The Committee may know this, but it may be worth asking a couple of questions about the difficulty of enforcement of some of these maintenance payments in arrears in the United Kingdom. In a previous incarnation as a country solicitor in Scotland, I always found it immensely difficult to get hold of people to enforce a matrimonial aliment and other orders if the absent father left the jurisdiction of the court. Under the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1972 it was certainly possible to enforce a maintenance order made by the UK courts on behalf of a UK resident, and it had to be registered because of the procedure involved. That can eventually be deployed in courts in other countries. It is a complicated process. It is known as the REMO procedure and a CSA website gives helpful details of it. It is cumbersome and difficult.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0003.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08020796000122">There are two hopeful signs on the legal horizon. The first is that the Hague convention looked at this in November 2007 and a new global convention on international recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance was finalised. That new Hague convention was intended to provide a much reduced bureaucracy&#151;a swift, cost-effective more accessible and fair procedure&#151;to allow international recovery. The convention was signed by the United States immediately. I think that it is expected that the European Union, through the Commission, will commit all EU countries to the convention shortly.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0003.htm_para22">
<p><a name="08020796000123">I understand that the European Union has looked at this matter separately. I know a little bit about it because I sit on your Lordships&#146; Sub-Committee G, which looks at social policy. In 2004, the Commission published a Green Paper on this matter. In 2005, it published an impact assessment to look at different options. The aim is to replace the diverse provisions that underpin reciprocal arrangements between EU countries with a specific regulation that deals with international maintenance cases. Will the Minister confirm that Britain intends to sign up to the new Hague convention and, if so, when will CMEC and its client group be able to take advantage of its provisions? Will he confirm that the European Union is likely to agree with a specific Council regulation? More generally, what additional steps can the Government take to allow child maintenance orders under the CMEC provisions to be directly enforced abroad? In this global day and age, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that this will become an even bigger problem than it has been in the past, as foreign travel and people&#146;s movements around the globe become more extensive and prolific.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000124">Perhaps I may say a few words about Clauses 26, 27 and 28, which relate to curfew orders, prison provision and driving licences. These penalties are now more or less discredited. Curfew orders are a nugatory waste of space, time and effort. They will provoke non-resident parents who set their face against the Act to look for curfew orders, which will not in any way, shape or form be a deterrent. I can understand that they give comfort to the red-top, tabloid press, which will say that the Government are being tough on deadbeat dads and other such nonsense, but they are a distraction and discredit the proper work of the commission, which is to get money out of non-resident parents if they refuse to pay or delay in doing so. Curfew orders create much administrative distraction and displacement of activity. In the court of public opinion&#151;let us disregard human rights challenges under the European convention&#151;they are more trouble than they are worth.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0003.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08020796000125">The same is true of prison provision. As with curfew orders, putting people in jail costs the taxpayer extra money, but it gets no extra money for the parent with care. It does not affect liability positively for anyone. I would be much happier if we removed the provision for imprisoning people for these offences and concentrated on some of the important improvements that the Government are making, such as attacking joint accounts. It is important to concentrate on what produces money, what avoids human rights legislation cases and the core activity of the commission.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0003.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08020796000126">It is my experience that, if one takes away someone&#146;s driving licence, they just drive anyway, which has perverse consequences for those who have accidents because that person is driving uninsured. I do not have evidence or figures for that. It is always easy to say of the enforcement powers in the three clauses, &#147;Well, the Government or the commission will have them available. They are always a prospective threat and that might make people a bit more responsive to their duties and legal responsibilities&#148;. For my money, I would rather we had a cut-down, nuts and bolts, reduced revision of the way we attack sources of money, because the public perfectly well understand that if money is owed, you attack the money source. People find it difficult to understand why people are sent to jail at vast cost, even if it is only for a short time. Never mind the high principle of human rights; from a practical point of view, this is a distraction and it does not work. I am very sceptical about it. We should do something else with the time of the staff in order to realise money for parents with care. I hope that the Government will think carefully about this.</p>

If someone is in regular employment and there are money resources, the situation is straightforward. You can put a direct debit on the account via the employer and get the money.

<p><a name="08020796000128">No one wants to take a passport away, no one wants to take a driving licence away and certainly no one wants to see someone go to prison. I presume that we would all much prefer to see community sentences and the like. But there have to be sanctions if even the statutory system is not to be voluntary, let alone to allow the voluntary system to remain in effect. The difficulty is that those who are reluctant to pay and fail to do so are often precisely those who do not own a house, so we cannot get a garnishee order; they do not have goods worth seizing, so bailiffs cannot be used; and they are not in regular, steady PAYE employment on which a direct debit can produce a flow of money. Where do you go except to the individual concerned?</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08020796000129">I agree absolutely with the noble Lord that no one wants to do this. It is counterintuitive to go for a prison order which stops him working, a curfew order which makes him angry or the removal of his driving licence which runs the risk of him driving uninsured. But if we do not have access to the individual&#146;s financial resources, and with this difficult group we very often do not, where do we go, apart from saying that there are no sanctions to apply? That is why I hope that my noble friend will persist in this. I hope that the success of the new system and CMEC will mean that there will be no need to use these sanctions, but I believe that they are necessary as a back-up in order to get some non-resident parents to take their responsibilities seriously.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08020796000131">Amendment No. 103 would give the parent with care the right to make representations to or attend any enforcement hearings. It would also allow the parent with care to apply directly to the court or the tribunal for enforcement action. I recognise that this is an issue of major concern and indeed I welcome the chance to debate it. The parent with care&#146;s role in enforcement was discussed in the other place and was raised by the Select Committee on Work and Pensions. It is therefore something about which we have thought long and hard. I accept entirely that the commission needs to engage the parent with care when taking enforcement action against the defaulting non-resident parent. Indeed, it would be beneficial for the parent with care to disclose to the commission any information that he or she may have that is relevant to the non-resident parent&#146;s financial situation. But we need to remind ourselves of the commission&#146;s role. Once a case has reached the state maintenance service, the commission is responsible for taking action to enforce payments. However, it has to be mindful of the position not just of the parent

It also, of course, needs to consider the welfare of any children that may be affected.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08020796000132">The commission&#146;s role is not solely to be the representative of a single parent with care. It is not the same relationship as a solicitor would have with a client. Where enforcement hearings are held in open court, the parent with care is able to watch proceedings, although they have no right to make representations to the court. I understand that, in practice, magistrates&#146; courts usually hear such cases in the family court where the magistrates have the power to exclude persons not directly involved in the case. The court does have discretion to permit a person who has adequate grounds for attendance to be present, but they would still have no right to make representations. It is hard to see what the parent with care could add to assist the court in reaching a decision.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08020796000133">In relation to the parent with care taking their  own court action, there are a number of practical considerations. In order to streamline the enforcement process and to allow the commission to take swift and effective enforcement action, a number of the provisions in the Bill have been made administrative&#151;for example, deducting money from bank accounts, issuing liability orders and removing passports&#151;which adds to the current administrative provision of applying a deduction-from-earnings order. Were parents with care able to pursue the enforcement of maintenance through the courts, these administrative measures would not be available to them. With these additional powers, we are confident that the commission will take enforcement action within a reasonable time&#151;that is the nub of the issue here&#151;which will make it unlikely for the parent with care to feel the need to take independent enforcement action through the courts, particularly as there are opportunities for them to make what information they have that may assist the case available to the commission. There is also a real danger that, if the commission and the parent with care had concurrent or interchangeable abilities to enforce, there would be risk of overlap and duplication, which could cause confusion and increase costs.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08020796000134">Equally, enabling parents with care to enforce the commission&#146;s maintenance assessments might provide the commission with a perverse incentive to divest itself of difficult cases, leaving parents with care or legal aid to meet the cost of enforcement. If legal aid was not provided, a two-tier system would be created where only parents with care with the financial means to do so would have this option open to them.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08020796000135">The obligation to pay child maintenance under the Child Support Act is not a civil debt in the normal sense. In deciding whether to take enforcement action, the commission must not only have regard to the interests of the parent with care, but consider the position of the non-resident parent and the welfare of all the children involved. It would not be appropriate to allow parents with care to take their own enforcement action. However, I accept that we must

<p><a name="08020796000136">Amendments Nos. 179 and 180 would set out in primary legislation that the non-resident parent has the opportunity to make representations to the commission before it makes an order to administratively disqualify him or her from holding or obtaining a travel authorisation. It is of course important that non-resident parents are able to make representations to the commission before such a serious form of enforcement is imposed. We intend that the non-resident parent will have the opportunity to put forward any representations on receipt of the notice that they receive from the commission of the intention to disqualify him or her from holding or obtaining a travel authorisation. A requirement to this effect will be set out in secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08020796000137">The Government acknowledge that disqualifying a person from holding a travel authorisation is a very serious measure.

<p><a name="08020796000142">Amendment No. 181 would set out in primary legislation that the commission must consider the impact on the non-resident parent&#146;s ability to pay the outstanding child maintenance should he or she be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence. I agree that it is important that, before such a measure is imposed, consideration is given to whether a non-resident parent needs a driving licence to earn a living. That is precisely why new Section 40B(A4)(a) in Clause 28 as well as existing legislation on how the current process operates make it clear that the court should, in the presence of the non-resident parent, inquire whether the driving licence is needed by him to earn a living. I appreciate that noble Lords may therefore question why the commission is not duty bound to consider this as well before making an application to the court. However, including such a provision in the legislation is not necessary.</p>

The Child Support Agency, or the commission in the future, will make an application to the court based on a determination of the facts at hand. Where the agency or the commission are aware of the non-resident parent&#146;s occupation, this factor will be taken into account in determining whether an application will be made for disqualification. The CSA or the commission is highly unlikely to ask the court to disqualify the non-resident parent from driving if the non-resident parent&#146;s ability to earn a living would be seriously affected. This would not be in the best long-term interests of the children and it would be against the commission&#146;s main objective. Ultimately, however, it will be the court&#146;s decision. The court has the power to summon the non-resident parent, to issue a warrant should he or she fail to appear, and to inquire in that person&#146;s presence whether he or she needs a driving licence to earn a living, before it reaches a decision. I should also point out that the existing driving licence provisions have been in operation since 2001. In the vast majority of cases, the non-resident parent receives an actual or suspended sentence. Clause 28 simply restructures existing provisions.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08020796000145">Amendment No. 187 would enable the Secretary of State to make regulations allowing the commission to recover maintenance payments from non-resident parents who have moved outside the United Kingdom and do not remain in the commission&#146;s jurisdiction by virtue of Section 44 of the Child Support Act 1991&#151;an issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, in some detail. That section gives the CSA currently, and the commission in the future, jurisdiction where all parties to the maintenance calculation are resident in the United Kingdom, except in prescribed circumstances where the non-resident parent may reside abroad but is employed in the services of the Crown; in the forces, including as a reservist; by a company registered in the UK; or by a body of prescribed description. I agree that it would not be right for non-resident parents outside these limited exemptions to escape their financial obligations towards their children by moving abroad, but I am pleased to inform noble Lords that this is generally not the case.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08020796000146">The United Kingdom has a system for administering international child and spousal maintenance cases. There are a number of international conventions and agreements&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, referred to these&#151;which allow maintenance claims from UK-resident parents to secure payments from non-resident parents who move abroad. International agreements include the Hague conventions and EU law, and of course arrangements are established under the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1972.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08020796000147">In essence, the system works by UK courts sending details of the maintenance liability to a foreign jurisdiction where the claimant is resident in the UK. The foreign jurisdiction then applies its domestic collection and enforcement mechanisms to recover the amount due. Those mechanisms in turn refer the maintenance received to the claimant. The process is reversed where the

Where a non-resident parent is or moves outside the Child Support Agency&#146;s jurisdiction, a maintenance calculation cannot be made or pursued. The parent with care must then either reach an agreement for maintenance provisions with the non-resident parent or apply to their local magistrates&#146; court or family proceedings court to secure maintenance from an ex-partner living abroad.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08020796000148">The UK has reciprocal agreements with over 100 states and territories to enable such claims to be made and recently established a new bilateral agreement with the USA to extend the arrangements there. There is currently an EU proposal for a new regulation&#151;referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood&#151;on such claims in Europe, which the UK hopes to be able to opt into at the conclusion of negotiations. I have no precise data on when we expect those negotiations to be concluded. I am also pleased to inform the Committee that a new global Hague convention on family maintenance was successfully concluded in November 2007, which we hope will further extend the coverage of such arrangements in the future.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08020796000149">I realise that Members of the Committee may be concerned about what happens to any outstanding arrears that the non-resident parent may owe when he or she moves outside the commission&#146;s jurisdiction. I do, of course, have the greatest sympathy with parents with care who find themselves in this situation, but it would not be possible for the commission to take direct action to recover the money owed, nor could the arrears be included within any subsequent international maintenance order made through the courts.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08020796000150">I am sure that Members of the Committee will understand that we cannot apply UK domestic legislation across international boundaries. We could not, for example, give the commission the power to apply a deduction from earnings order against any person where the employer is not registered as a company within the UK. It is simply not possible. Nor is it currently possible under the terms of the 1972 Act to include arrears of child maintenance accrued in the UK within an international maintenance order. We do not, however, rule anything out in the longer term; this may be something that we can address at a future legislative opportunity. It may also be the case that, should the non-resident parent have any property within the United Kingdom, the CSA or the commission could apply for a charging order against that property, notwithstanding the fact that the non-resident parent may reside outside the UK. We will certainly continue to investigate that possibility. I hope that Members of the Committee will appreciate that an adequate system for dealing with non-resident parents who move abroad already exists, albeit with the caveat concerning arrears that I have just mentioned</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08020796000151">Amendment No. 213 would give the appeals tribunal the power to question the underlying maintenance calculation when considering a liability order appeal. By the time a liability order is made, the non-resident parent will already have had opportunity to appeal to the tribunal against the maintenance calculation at the  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC643"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column GC643</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>point when it was made; there are also provisions for late appeals. This amendment would allow the non-compliant non-resident parent a second bite at the cherry. It could delay enforcement action and be additional work for the appeals tribunals. We are, however, putting appropriate safeguards in place by providing appeal rights based on those matters that magistrates can currently consider when making a court liability order. The appeals tribunal will have the opportunity to question whether the person is liable, whether they have failed to pay an amount of child maintenance and if the amount of the liability order exceeds the amount of maintenance owing. It is important to remember that a liability order is made because the non-resident parent has failed to pay. If we give them another opportunity to challenge the maintenance calculation, it will be another opportunity to delay payment for their children. We know, sadly, that some will use every opportunity to do that.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08020796000152">Finally, on the Government&#146;s Amendment No. 219, following concerns raised over the recovery of historic debt as this Bill has progressed through the other place, we are introducing this amendment to ensure that all new and existing powers to collect child maintenance can be used on debts of any age. We have previously amended regulations so that there is no longer a six-year time limit for an application for a liability order on debt that accrued on or after 13 July 2000. However, some debt had already reached six years of age before then and so is still subject to a limitation period. We estimate that this pre-July 2000 debt accounts for more than &#163;700 million. It can currently be collected only through a deduction-from-earnings order and not through court-based recovery methods.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08020796000153">The amendment ensures that, when the provision for the new administrative liability order comes into force, the same enforcement mechanisms&#151;liability orders, deduction orders, deduction-from-earnings orders&#151;can be available for use on all child maintenance debt regardless of the date on which it accrued. However, the new administrative liability order will not be used in relation to pre-July 2000 debt as a matter of course. Because this debt was previously time-barred as far as court action was concerned, it will be important to consider in each case whether enforcement action is justified.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000154">I shall speak as briefly as I can to the issues raised under clause stand part and deal first with Clause 26 and curfew orders. As both my noble friend Lady Hollis and the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, recognised, those are at the extreme end of our enforcement process, but they are important. Clause 26 enables the Child Maintenance Enforcement Commission to make an application to the court for a curfew order where the non-resident parent wilfully refuses or culpably neglects to pay maintenance. Curfew orders are intended to serve as an effective alternative to committal. They should not interfere with the non-resident parent&#146;s ability to earn a living and should allow him or her to continue with any pre-existing contact or custody arrangement with the children. That is an important point. At the same time, however, they will provide a powerful incentive to co-operate.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0004.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08020796000155">Furthermore, it is envisaged that the use of such powers will contribute to changing the culture of non-compliance and demonstrate that the commission will take strong measures to deal with it swiftly. The length of the curfew order will be at the discretion of the court. Electronic monitoring has been operating throughout England and Wales since 1999 and is run by private companies. About 15,500 persons are subject to electronic monitoring at any one time; about 58 per cent of people complete a curfew order successfully without any enforcement action being applied.</p>

I am not sure that I could say that that will be the situation in every case. In any event, our estimate is that there may be 700 to 750 cases per year maximum to which the orders might apply, so it is a relatively small percentage of the likely total case load of the CSA. It would be pretty much a last resort, but preferable to committal proceedings, where there are the issues that I outlined, such as the ability to continue with contact arrangements. I have perhaps said enough about why we think that those are important provisions and why we want to retain them in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000158">The noble Lord also referred to committal to prison under Clause 27. The Child Support Agency can already apply to the court seeking to have a non-compliance non-resident parent committed to prison for a maximum of six weeks. The clause simply restructures the existing provisions to be consistent with other provisions in the Bill. The clause will aid the effective operation of the existing committal provisions and we certainly want it to stand part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000159">On disqualification from driving, the CSA can currently apply to the court to seek to have the non-resident parent disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for up to two years. Again, the changes to the driving disqualification panels align amendments to the existing committal orders, the new legislation on curfew orders and the administrative power to disqualify the non-resident parent from holding or obtaining travel authorisation. That is an important part of our armoury to ensure that we have effective compliance.</p>

It is quite hard to get enforcement procedures that bear on the parent when he does not have property but that do not stigmatise the child. With a lot of debt collection, you can use an element of naming and shaming, public display and so on. It is precisely to protect the children that you cannot do that in this case, which is why we are short of penalties.

As I said just now, we must be satisfied that the appropriate legal place is used for each of these sanctions, whether in the case of the original application or, in the case of these amendments, in the right of appeal. They change the place to which a person may have a right of appeal from a magistrates&#146; court or a sheriff&#146;s court in Scotland to a tribunal. The latter is a panel of much narrower judicial scope and typically has a specific remit. It can make more informed and sensitive decisions when dealing with fragile child support negotiations and demands. The tribunal also provides an important benefit in that it creates an alternative route from that of the magistrates&#146; court and thus prevents everyone with a grievance clogging up that court system. I do not know whether the Minister has had complaints about that recently, but certainly complaints are made to us quite regularly that the magistrates&#146; courts are overstretched. We must be absolutely certain that their use is appropriate in every case when we consider the various sanctions and mechanisms for sanctions in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

Amendments Nos. 108 to 110 apply specifically to appeals against a decision by the commission that there is no good reason not to apply a deduction from earnings order as a basic method of collection. They would mean that the appeals would be heard by a tribunal and not by the magistrates&#146; court, or, in Scotland, by the sheriff, as currently proposed in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000176">Where regulations are made allowing deduction from earnings orders as a basic method of collection, they will include provision for such an order not to be made where there would be good reason not to do so. In deciding the most appropriate method of collection, the commission will consider any representations from the non-resident parent. Matters to be taken into account when considering what constitutes a good reason will be set out in such regulations, but it is envisaged that they will be related primarily to concerns about privacy issues. An example might be where a non-resident parent is employed in a family business and wishes to keep any details of child maintenance private. The intention is for the commission to pilot the approach of using deduction from earnings orders as a basic method of collection. The criteria for what constitutes a good reason will be further developed from lessons learnt from the pilot if this policy is to be fully rolled out.</p>

We have therefore decided to adopt a consistent approach on appeal routes for deduction from earnings orders and to continue with the magistrates&#146; courts, and with the sheriff in Scotland.</p>

This series of government amendments, which touch on Clauses 21 and 22 and Schedule 7, relates to deduction orders. Before dealing with the specifics I want to take a moment to reflect on the importance of deduction orders as a whole and give the Committee a taste of how I expect them to be applied.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08020796000191">At present, the first action the Child Support Agency can take to collect child maintenance from a non-compliant non-resident parent is to impose a deduction from earnings order. Where this is not possible or proves ineffective, the next avenue is enforcement through the courts. Orders for deductions from accounts will provide the commission with a further quick and effective method of ensuring child maintenance reaches those to whom it is due. They will come in two forms.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08020796000192">The regular deduction order can require financial institutions to remove money from an account on a regular&#151;normally monthly&#151;basis. That can be in respect of ongoing maintenance, arrears or both. Lump sum orders will operate by first requiring the freezing of an amount up to the maintenance arrears. That will allow for representations to be made as to why the specified lump sum should not be removed from the account, but at the same time it will protect the sum from being moved. Once a final order is made it will operate to remove the amount due in a single deduction. However, if there are inadequate funds in the account the order can stay in force and be used against future deposits.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08020796000193">I know that the Committee will already be aware that during debate in the other place, the Government accepted that there would be a benefit to revisiting the reach of deduction orders. We have consulted widely with the finance industry as well as across Government, and we accept the current drafts are too cautious and leave unacceptable loopholes. So we have removed most of the exclusions from the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08020796000194">That said, we recognise that removing money administratively is a very serious step to take. This is particularly the case when other parties may be involved, which is why we feel we must ensure that joint accounts are specifically safeguarded. Similarly we must think very hard before putting a non-resident parent&#146;s business at risk. With this in mind, while we have removed exemptions from the face of the Bill, we will use secondary legislation to limit the use of joint, and certain business, account deductions. However, if over time it is apparent, that moneys are being diverted into these accounts to avoid a deduction order being imposed&#151;that is, if we have evidence to suggest that non-resident parents are organising their finances to avoid these provisions, and hence their responsibilities&#151;we will come back with affirmative secondary legislation to close loopholes.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08020796000195">We have also considered the effect of lump sum deduction orders specifically on businesses of non-resident parents. It is not our intention to apply such orders to those accounts that are used solely for the purpose of running a business. We feel that if used on such accounts, the process of freezing funds to impose lump sum deduction orders could put too

That could jeopardise the income of the non-resident parent and his or her ability to pay maintenance. So, again, these accounts will be excluded by regulation.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08020796000196">In recognition of the significance of these measures, we intend that appeals against deduction orders will be heard, as I have intimated, by the county courts, with the exception of appeals against joint account deductions, which will be heard by the High Court. We continue to consult the Scottish Executive to determine the appropriate route for such appeals in Scotland. In addition to these changes, we have also ensured that the making of regulations providing for rights of appeal is mandatory. This further demonstrates our commitment to safeguarding the rights of the individual while addressing the need to ensure child maintenance is collected.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para22">
<p><a name="08020796000197">In brief, the extended remit of regular and lump sum deduction orders will allow such measures to be taken against funds held in deposit, current and business accounts held in sole names. It will also allow for such deductions from joint accounts but only where regulations have been made for that. This will significantly extend the ability of the commission to collect maintenance from those who currently make it difficult to do so.</p>

Indeed, they fall rather neatly into two halves. If CMEC is to have this power, any&#151;any&#151;account may be appropriate in certain circumstances. I originally thought that, by removing the word &#147;current&#148; in Amendments Nos. 111 and 112, the Minister was doing just that. However, as he said, further examination shows that the first half of Amendment No. 117 pushes the decision on which account is appropriate into secondary legislation in new Section 32(3A)(b). That pricked my interest, because delay is not necessarily the right thing to do. I assume that this statutory instrument&#151;or series of statutory instruments, as appropriate&#151;will produce the safeguards the Minister has been talking about. However, will current accounts be included or excluded? That is a fair question.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08020796000200">On Amendment No. 120, the credit in a joint account clearly belongs to all the account holders. Would subsection (5)(a) not be better expressed by referring to &#147;account holder or holders&#148;? I suggest this as a simplifying drafting amendment. Would that not cover all types of account, whether held by a single person or group of people? That is appropriate, because Amendment No. 121 says that all the account holders must be informed that money is to be withdrawn from the joint account due to the activities&#151;in this case, the non-payment of maintenance&#151;of one of them. The Minister clearly believes that this will put added pressure on the defaulter because the others will complain to him immediately. In general, he must be right. However,  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC650"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column GC650</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what about the non-resident parent in a new relationship, with or without children, with a joint account? Is it not likely that the other account holder&#151;the new parent with care, although in this case it is a couple&#151;will object strongly to the money being withdrawn? Would this not add substantially to the number of appeals?</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08020796000201">Amendment No. 124 adds to the pressure, as the deposit holder is allowed to take fees as it would for any other standing order. I assume that the Minister envisages that these amounts from the various accounts would be taken by standing order. The other account holders would be able to get at the defaulting non-resident parent in question. Amendment No.125 compounds this. As far as Amendment No. 127 goes, why is the deposit taker himself being allowed to go to appeal? I simply do not understand that.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08020796000202">In Amendment No. 130, it is not appropriate to have a may/shall debate, but only to comment that if all these chances for the withdrawal of money from accounts are not in the Bill, they must&#151;must&#151;be in the statutory instrument. Amendment No. 134 is a sensible provision defining the parameters of the statutory instrument, although new subsection (1A)(a) is perhaps a little vague and my earlier comments apply.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para27">
<p><a name="08020796000203">As far as I can see, all the new provisions in Clause 21 are duplicated in amendments to Clause 22, as I said at the beginning, which covers lump sum deduction orders, so the same questions apply. To save time, I am happy to allow the Minister&#146;s answer to cover both clauses, unless he wants to give one that is pertinent to one clause and not to the other, although I doubt it.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para28">
<p><a name="08020796000204">Amendment No. 156 deserves comment. It would be quite wrong if the account were to be stripped by the other account holder, and I hope that these two long amendments will prevent that. However, seven days&#146; grace is given before the maintenance due starts to be paid. This will give time for asset stripping so what will happen then, especially if it is done by the non-resident parent? Is this to be a criminal offence?</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para29">
<p><a name="08020796000205">I am afraid I do not understand the reason behind Amendment No. 164 and the removal of proposed new subsection (4), or, indeed, proposed new Section 32G(9). It may be my inattention to detail but why is it still needed? Is it because it duplicates earlier amendments? The same question applies to proposed new subsection (7) on page 16 in Amendment No. 167. I shall have to study the rationale for the other amendments but I hope it will not be necessary to return to this at a future stage of the Bill.</p>

In addition&#151;I do not know whether he made any reference to this in his earlier remarks&#151;but in relation to both the current account and the lump sum deduction orders, the proposed regulations in Amendment Nos. 117, 134 and 156 contain caveats which state that regulations will specify that an order cannot be made in respect of

As that applies to both current account and lump sum deduction orders it would be helpful&#151;the Minister may have glancingly referred to this earlier&#151;if the Minister could let me know, if not today then at some other stage, exactly what those exclusions were designed to try to catch. Otherwise they take away the rationale for my later Amendments Nos. 115 and 174. I am wholly in agreement with the general thrust of these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000208">On the issue of removing the term &#147;current account&#148; from the text, this is because, when we thought about it, focusing only on current accounts was not very helpful, particularly as these days a number of people will have deposit accounts, investment accounts, current accounts and moneys swept between them. It was not potentially going to catch very much. This caused us to recast the arrangements and to differentiate not so much in terms of accounts by and large, but between regular deductions and lump sum deductions.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para31">
<p><a name="08020796000209">Regular deductions are those which are likely to be taken monthly. They could be related to arrears as well as current liabilities, but they would be taken routinely. Obviously there are different considerations in respect of lump sum deductions, which touch upon arrears. That is the basis on which this is structured.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000211"><b><a name="80207-gc0005.htm_spnew10"><a name="08020796000658">Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I do not think anything proposed here would preclude more than one go at a lump sum. But there is a distinction between them. If there is a lump sum which deals with arrears, and then arrears subsequently build up again, another process for another lump sum would be perfectly possible.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para32">
<p><a name="08020796000212">The noble Lord is quite right to say that there is a limit in these arrangements that states that the account cannot go overdrawn. But you can have more than one bite at the lump sum; you can take it in tranches when there is funding in the account. Also, of course, the first stage of the lump-sum process is a freezing of the accounts. This at least keeps the accounts whole so that the assets cannot be dissipated very quickly. Although a process may be underway, that does not preclude alienating the assets in the interim. But the processes being administrative, they should be speedy and limit the scope for that.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para33">

It could have all sorts of ramifications for the wages bill, for dealing with suppliers and for the survival of the business. So that is quite a difficult one.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para34">
<p><a name="08020796000214">The same considerations do not arise with the protections that you need when accessing other accounts for regular payments. We plan to continue the current kinds of constraints where&#151;for example, for deductions from earnings orders&#151;you cannot take more than 40 per cent of a person&#146;s net income. So there is a limit on what can be taken in any event. Obviously, it is more likely that that kind of constraint would be aligned with what routinely goes into a business account if it is reflective of income.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para35">
<p><a name="08020796000215">There are difficult issues around joint accounts, particularly in the kind of situation to which the noble Lord referred, where you have an NRP with a new partner and they have a joint account. Sometimes the past relationships and past obligations are not necessarily known and the extent to which the new partner would want to share resources in that joint account may raise some issues. When we get to those regulations we will need to think them through in some detail.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0005.htm_para36">
<p><a name="08020796000216">On deductions from earnings orders, it is not only the bank accounts where money is held that can be accessed; potentially, money held by accountants and solicitors on behalf of individuals can be accessed as well.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000217">The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked which accounts might be excluded.

<p><a name="08020796000218">I am conscious that I have dealt only with some of the quite detailed points that have been raised. I should like to read the record and revert in more detail so that noble Lords are satisfied. Obviously what we are trying to do here is to add significantly to our powers of enforcement, particularly, following on from the point raised by my noble friend earlier, in view of how difficult it is in some circumstances to reach NRPs who will not pay.</p>

In moving Amendment No. 114, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 115 and 116, 119, 126, 135, 137, 140, 141, 145, 147, 149, 151, 155 and 158. All the amendments in this group enforce limits on the commission and narrow its broad parameters into what I hope are specifics. The need for such amendments suggests once again how the Government these days will shy away from including any detail on the face of legislation, thus allowing themselves a free rein when making secondary instruments&#151;not for the first time during our proceedings on this Bill. I do rather object to that. A large number of these amendments are drafting amendments intended to define the proposals made in the Bill more strictly. Thus &#147;the account&#148; will become,</p>
<ul><a name="08020796000569">&#147;any account held by that person&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08020796000451">and &#147;third party&#148; becomes &#147;licensed deposit taker&#148;. In every case that I have used the phrase &#147;licensed deposit taker&#148;, I am not absolutely sure that that is what the words &#147;third party&#148; actually mean in the Bill. It is confusing to use the same word or phrase in totally different contexts. Precision is important because without it, room is created for error and confusion, which could ultimately impact negatively on the child, something we all want to avoid.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0006.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08020796000229">Amendments Nos. 119 and 126 would ensure that the Bill denies the non-resident parent the opportunity for malpractice. Has the Minister considered that a non-resident parent may seek to avoid paying his child maintenance fees by transferring his account to another bank? I have just commented briefly on the electronic transfer of money, so perhaps he would like to consider that at the same time. At the moment the transfer happens, the money is lost to the system so far as CMEC is concerned. I have proposed the former amendment to prevent any Houdini tricks and the latter to consider that this might be a circumstance in which an application may be made to the commission for it to review an order.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0006.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08020796000230">I turn now to a more detailed examination of Amendment No. 181. This is a provision to safeguard against the possibility that the actions of CMEC could restrict parents from fulfilling their financial responsibilities to their child. The Bill should do everything possible to facilitate parents to provide sufficiently for their offspring; it should never hinder the ultimate objective. Noble Lords will be aware that CMEC&#146;s power to confiscate a driving licence is one that the CSA currently holds. In relation to my earlier argument, I must first welcome the fact that a confiscation would occur only after recourse to the courts. I am not opposed to penalising errant parents who refuse to meet their responsibilities&#151;</p>

In light of the government amendment, of course, this amendment will no longer be appropriate, as the amended clauses will now remove such exclusions. Following on from that, Amendment No. 114 also seeks to extend the scope of deduction orders to all accounts. As we have made clear, we intend to expand the remit of deduction orders, but we do not think it appropriate from day one for deduction orders to be used on every type of account. As I outlined earlier, we would like to see accounts such as those held by more than one person for the purposes of business initially excluded by secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0006.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08020796000234">I hope noble Lords will agree that although increasing the remit of deduction orders in the Bill is a positive way to enable the commission to collect more maintenance, it is important to allow sufficient opportunity to consider carefully how far that remit should be extended. I trust that this also addresses the issue raised by Amendment No. 115, which seeks to expand the current account deduction orders to any joint trade or business account.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0006.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08020796000235">Amendments Nos. 137, 140, 141, 144, 147, 149 and 155 would prevent lump-sum deduction orders being used in relation to anyone other than licensed deposit takers. During consideration of this group of amendments, we have been unable to find any reference to licensed deposit takers in current legislation. I think that the term used to exist in old banking legislation, but went out in the mid or late 1980s. As a result, we are not quite sure how critical it is.</p>

We are currently further investigating those funds not held in accounts that might be prescribed for the purposes of lump sum orders. However, the amendment would mean money held on behalf of the non-resident parent by, for example, lawyers and accountants would be inaccessible to the commission. That was probably not intended, but it would be the import of the amendment.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0006.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08020796000238">On Amendments Nos. 119 and 151, I assure noble Lords that in both instances the clauses already achieve what the amendments strive for in that there is already a power to include in regulations a requirement on the deposit taker to provide details of when an account is closed. Indeed, the banks have an obligation to notify the commission if the NRP closes the account or opens other accounts, where that information is available to the banks.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0006.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08020796000239">In the case of a lump-sum deduction order, the greatest amount at which the order will be set is the amount of arrears stated when the order was first made. It cannot be increased beyond that amount and is intended to be collected in one payment rather than over a period. However, it is acknowledged that the order will continue where there is an insufficient amount available to be deducted in that one payment. Again, we touched on that earlier.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0006.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08020796000240">Amendment No 126 would remove the power of the Secretary of State to provide in regulations for the circumstances in which a request may be made for a review of a deduction order. It is worth noting that this particular subsection is extended as part of the Government&#146;s amendments. It now includes a regulation-making power to provide a right for the parties affected by an order imposed, including joint account holders, to request a review. This is not an appeal.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0006.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08020796000241">The amendment would allow regulations providing for the order to be varied, but only on the initiative of the commission. It would not allow for an application for a review by the non-resident parent. At this stage, we envisage that the right to request a review will be available in cases of hardship or a significant change of circumstances. We are however happy to hear views on the appropriate grounds for review. All the regulations relating to this clause will be subject to the affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0006.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08020796000242">Finally, Amendment No. 116 seeks to require the commission to impose an order that applies to maintenance arrears, to ongoing maintenance, or to both. In reality, however, these are the only three options. The current drafting is permissive in recognition that we give the commission the option to use regular deduction orders to collect both past and future maintenance. I therefore urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I still find the idea of the third party extremely confusing. Perhaps the Minister might look at that again. If closing one account and opening another took place in the same financial institution, that would be obvious, and CMEC would be informed if the order had that effect, which I am sure it will. However, if one transfers from, let us say, Barclays to NatWest, that is a totally different matter, and the defaulting non-resident parent would continue to be in default of their obligations until the system caught up with them. That is not a very happy arrangement.</p>

As part of this group I propose government amendments which enable the freezing of non-resident parents&#146; assets. I hope that my explanation of these amendments will cover the point raised.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0007.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08020796000314">In Committee in another place, the Government agreed to consider an amendment that would provide the commission with a power to apply, in appropriate circumstances, to the court for a freezing order. Following that consideration, the Government agree that this would be a useful addition to the commission&#146;s enforcement tools. The government amendment would apply where there is evidence that a non-resident parent is about to dispose of assets or remove them from the commission&#146;s jurisdiction with the intention of avoiding payment of child maintenance. It would enable the commission to apply to the court for an order freezing those assets. Indeed, we propose to go one stage further. The government amendment would also enable the commission to ask the court to satisfy the disposition which had already been made. The court will also be given the power to make consequential directions and orders as it sees fit to give effect to the order.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0007.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08020796000315">The number of cases in which the commission will have firm evidence of the non-resident parent&#146;s intention to dispose of his assets is likely to be very small; nevertheless, the provisions will enable the commission to act quickly to secure maintenance where such evidence comes to light. It will act as a deterrent to non-resident parents who would otherwise be prepared to enter into transactions to prevent enforcement of their parental responsibilities. </p>

<a name="80207-gc0007.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08020796000316">I recognise the sentiment behind Amendment No. 174, but, as I said, is the same as what I have just outlined. As drafted, the power to freeze assets as described would be a step too far. Not only would there be practical and operational difficulties for  the commission, the commission would be given administrative powers comparable to those operated by the High Court but without appeal rights. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would give the commission the power to make an administrative order which would freeze all assets and it would apply equally to those assets owned wholly or jointly by a non-resident parent and could be applied as soon as a payment for child maintenance had been missed. The freezing order would remain in force until the outstanding arrears had been settled. That provision does not contain any safeguards in relation to the exercise of this power, nor is there a right of appeal, as I said.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0007.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08020796000317">In considering whether the proposal is proportionate, we need to bear in mind that the commission will have several additional enforcement options that are not currently available to the Child Support Agency. They include, as we have discussed, lump sum deduction orders, which will allow the commission to freeze and then seize assets from a number of different types of accounts. I believe that the collection and enforcement provisions will go a

<p><a name="08020796000333">The Minister said in correspondence that most people require travel documents such as a passport on relatively few occasions during the year, such as when taking foreign holidays. Clause 25 states that CMEC, and presumably any employee of one of its sub-contractors in the private sector, must consider before imposing an order whether the non-resident parent needs a travel authorisation in order to earn a living. But there is no mention in the Bill of family illness overseas or, indeed, any other consideration. It was the unanimous view of your Lordships&#146; Select Committee that confiscating someone&#146;s travel documents is a sufficiently serious step that it should be overseen by the courts.</p>

Indeed, the Select Committee said that it is not obvious that the scheme of the Bill&#151;an administrative decision followed by a right of appeal with suspended effect&#151;will meet the Government&#146;s policy goal of avoiding an inevitably drawn-out court process any better than a straightforward power for CMEC to seek an order from a magistrates&#146; court.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000335">The amendment will be succeeded at future stages of the Bill by further technical amendments, but its purpose today is to require CMEC to apply for an order from a magistrates&#146; court which is consistent with the judicial oversight envisaged by other sanctions in the Bill.

Although the withdrawal of a passport can be an effective measure to force non-resident parents to stop neglecting their obligations, it should not be within the competence of the commission to decide on that matter as the Bill proposes. It had not occurred to me that this administrative arrangement might extend to what my noble friend referred to as a &#147;sub-contractor&#148;, and I wonder if he is correct in that.

Therefore the administrative liability orders being introduced by the Bill are, on the whole, fully understandable. However, withdrawal of a travel order authorisation goes beyond affecting a person&#146;s financial status and interferes with one of his civil rights: the freedom to travel abroad. That remains the main argument for leaving the decision about a passport withdrawal, along with a driving licence ban and a curfew, to the courts. The reason to do so is that all administrative decisions should have strict, limited and accurate legal bases, while any interference in civil freedoms&#151;of which the liberty to travel is one&#151;should be undertaken under the rules of law which are more complex than a simple administrative scheme would allow.

I am surprised, to start with, that in paragraph four the Minister stated that the commission is well placed to make both that judgment and that of the appropriateness of passport surrender. Why? Since the Child Support Agency performed badly and on many occasions was unable to collect information about the absent parent&#146;s financial status, there is a serious threat that the new body will have neither the adequate capacity to collect the details of the person&#146;s life nor the competence to assess in what ways a passport ban would affect his or her life.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000339">Elsewhere, the letter comments that CMEC staff will have additional training before handling cases. Gosh, will they not need it? They need it just to prepare a case for the courts, but in a case that will almost inevitably be appealed from the word go, they will need it even more. I would assume&#151;again, the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;that that training would be of a lesser sort, as the Bill envisages administrative action.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08020796000340">A point that has concerned all the committees that have examined the matter has been the assumption that a passport authorisation withdrawal has fewer consequences than a driving license withdrawal and can therefore remain an administrative decision, as the letter states in paragraph nine. That is simply an unjustified generalisation. It must be thoroughly recognized in what way a travel ban is going to affect the passport surrenderer&#146;s everyday life, in exactly the same way as the court does before ordering driving licence withdrawal. That is the main reason why the decision on a passport ban, as well as the driving licence, should belong to the courts.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08020796000341">Moreover, the argument presented to defend the position that the passport and driving licence bans have different results is what I believe is called argumento dicto simpliciter, a misleading deduction when the examples given&#151;such as that the passport ban is allegedly not affecting third parties&#151;are used to lead to one general conclusion, when in fact they are too trivial so to do. Opposite examples proving that third parties can be affected by the travel ban exist and can be given, such as going abroad not only for holidays but for serious medical treatment, or sustaining other family links because one of the non-resident parents may well have family abroad&#151;but will not be countenanced.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08020796000343">Paragraph 11 of the letter explains that the main reason for introducing an administrative passport ban is to &#147;take quicker and firmer&#148; action against the non-resident parents for not fulfilling their obligations, whereas paragraph four, to which I have already referred, states that the withdrawal decision will not take effect until the person to be affected has time to appeal. Obviously, in those circumstances, it will defeat its very objective. Does the Minister really believe that anyone placed in the position of an administrative order for the withdrawal of a passport will not appeal? I cannot.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08020796000344">Paragraph 12 does not do the Minister's defence of this disgraceful proposal any good at all. Of course, tackling child poverty is one of the Government's priorities. Although that is clearly right&#151;we have referred to it several times during the course of our debates&#151;there is no link between the smoother flow of maintenance and introducing a passport ban, whether or not achieved administratively. Also, it is claimed in the paragraph that non-payers should understand how serious the consequences of evading their responsibilities may be, but it does not show why exactly an administrative passport ban should result in such greater awareness. The passport ban ordered by the court would just have the same effect. I am not objecting to the introduction of a passport withdrawal per se, but to the inappropriate way of achieving it.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000345">To sum up, administrative travel authorisation withdrawal would be an exceptional way of interfering in civil rights, but I am afraid that the Government's explanations are not yet convincing enough to allow them to put this administrative modus operandi in the Bill. Unfortunately, we are in Grand Committee and neither my noble friend nor I can do anything about it at this stage. However, I observe the threat with which my noble friend concluded his speech, and am in total agreement with him.</p>

It would prevent the commission from administratively disqualifying the non-resident parent from holding or obtaining a travel authorisation, and would require the commission to apply to the court for such an order.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08020796000348">While I acknowledge the concerns of Members of the Committee on this particular provision, I hope that I can convince them that the proposal in the Bill is the right way forward. First, however, I stress that the Government believe that we owe it to children who are not being financially supported to take swift and effective measures which may not always be appropriate to other forms of debt. I am sure that the whole Committee will agree that, when dealing with the hard core of non-compliant non-resident parents, the commission should be allowed to take robust action. We are firmly of the view that the threat of imminent action will be much more potent than the threat of a drawn-out court process. We believe this holds good, despite the fact that the order would not take effect until the time for appealing had expired.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08020796000349">In putting forward this legislation, the Government have investigated what enforcement measures international child support jurisdictions employ. As has been referred to, both the US and Australia make use of a form of administrative passport surrender or travel ban in order to encourage compliance with child maintenance payments. This was highlighted by the Work and Pensions Select Committee in their January 2005 report on the performance of the CSA, which recommended that the department further examine passport removal as a potential child support tool for use in this country. Indeed, that committee had a distinguished chair&#151;whose name escapes me just for the moment.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08020796000350">Based on the experience of those other countries, we are of the view that the administrative disqualification of non-resident parents from holding or obtaining a travel authorisation will deliver fast and effective enforcement against those who have the financial means to pay child maintenance but refuse to do so. We have balanced the risks of doing this administratively with safeguards for the non-resident parent. In addition to the appeal provisions, a number of safeguards exist and have been included in the Bill. They will ensure that this measure is targeted against those who will not, as opposed to cannot, meet their financial obligations to their children.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08020796000351">I also emphasise that, where an appeal has been filed, the order would be stayed&#151;as has been acknowledged&#151;pending the hearing, determination or withdrawal of that appeal. Thus, the person affected would have the opportunity to access an independent and impartial tribunal before any civil right was directly affected by the surrender of the passport. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked me whether I believe that someone would appeal in every instance. I do not think that is necessarily the case; if someone acknowledges that they have the cash and the commission is intent on pursuing collection, that may just be the point at which they do what they should have done previously and cough up.

<p><a name="08020796000352">We have heard a lot about individuals&#146; civil rights, but what about the rights of children to be properly maintained? What about the obligations and responsibilities of parents? We should bear in mind that if people deliberately delay paying the maintenance that is due, that could have a significant impact on the well-being of their children. The fact that it may take years&#151;many years, in some instances&#151;to collect the cash does not mean that there is ultimately no impact on the children. Many children may be in poverty now because that maintenance is not flowing when it should, and while collecting later may be some comfort, it does not alleviate the problem that arises in the interim.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000353"><b><a name="80207-gc0008.htm_spnew3"><a name="08020796000710">Lord Skelmersdale:</b> That might very well be so. We are not talking about this being the only sanction available to CMEC and therefore to the advantage of the parent with care. This is one of a range, two components of which automatically have to go through the courts first. I hope the Minister will come on to that point shortly.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000354"><b><a name="80207-gc0008.htm_spnew4"><a name="08020796000711">Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Indeed, I will come on to that. It will also be emphasised that when an appeal has been filed the order will be stayed, so the person affected will have the opportunity to access an independent and impartial tribunal. Additional safeguards include the requirement for the commission to assess the impact on the non-resident parent&#146;s ability to earn a living prior to imposing the order.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08020796000355">The question of health issues was raised, such as when a family member needs to get medical support and treatment outside the country. There is no reason why that could not be taken into account in the determination of the application of this measure. It is not a requirement that the commission does this; it is a discretionary power. It does not need to be written into new Clause 39B(4) of the Child Support Act, but there is no reason why we could not think about emphasising the point. It runs right through the Bill that there is always an overriding requirement to consider the welfare of all children involved.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08020796000356">I stress that the commission must also assess whether the non-resident parent has wilfully refused or culpably neglected to support his or her children. That is the same test as is currently applied by the court when the CSA makes an application for the non-resident parent to be committed to prison or disqualified from driving. We are dealing with situations where the non-resident parent cannot pay. If the individual is so intent on going on holiday or travelling abroad and doing what they want to do, the remedy is in their own hands: they must pay what they should. It rests with them. It is not as though this is a restriction on anyone for life. It is very much in the hands of the non-resident parent, who should fall within the ambit of this provision only where it is clear that they can pay. All they need to do is pay and this is abrogated straight away.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08020796000357">Furthermore, the commission must consider the welfare of any child likely to be affected by the decision, which includes the children of the non-resident parent and members of his or her new family. In order that the commission meets its objective, we need to have a

This measure will be used only after other, lesser measures to recover the outstanding maintenance have been tried but maintenance remains outstanding. Those who seek to deliberately evade their responsibilities to their children must understand the seriousness of their failure to provide their children with financial support.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08020796000358">I realise that the Select Committee on the Constitution raised a number of concerns, and the Government have already issued their formal response. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, referred to it. In summary, we believe that administrative passport surrender will be an effective form of enforcement and deterrent for the reasons I have set out. I appreciate that the committee has posed legitimate questions about the relative importance of the individual in terms of holding a passport and the fact that such decisions are normally made by judicial determination, but I reiterate that we do not underestimate the important role a passport can play in an individual&#146;s ability to earn a living, and the Bill makes it clear that the commission must consider that before imposing the order. We also argue that the commission is best placed, through its prior dealings with the individual, to make the decision on whether the non-resident parent has shown wilful refusal or culpable neglect to pay maintenance.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08020796000359">I shall expand on that. It is the commission in its dealings or lack of them with the non-resident parent that knows the history of the case, the basis of the assessment, the number of occasions when deduction from earnings orders have been defeated by someone changing their job, and the whole process by which a non-resident parent may have sought to avoid other enforcement mechanisms by prolonging his or her appeal. Under the wider range of enforcement powers, that information will be available to the commission, which will be able to make a judgment on whether the individual is intent on seeking to pay what is due or simply seeking to avoid it. It knows well, from a long track record of dealing with people who are intent on avoiding their obligations, when people are seeking to do that rather than when they cannot fulfil them.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08020796000360">I distinguish that because there are issues around the withdrawal of travel rights from, for example, people involved in soccer hooliganism. The court does that because the court would have been involved in the process of dealing with those people for what they have been up to prior to that. We are dealing here with a situation where the commission has been trying to deal with this individual; it knows their track record and what they have done or not done, so it is best placed to make these judgments&#151;which, at the end of the day, are subject to a right of appeal and a process before the court. There is a balance in all of this, and that balance should rest with the right of children to be maintained by non-resident parents or parents with care. I hope noble Lords will be assured of the merits of this proposed action and feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

However, there is some superficial comfort available in the DWP notes on secondary legislation arising from the Bill, which state that the regulations will specify that the parent with care will need to agree to the payment being offset against liability. During the debate in the other place, in the Public Bill Committee, my reading of it was that the Minister, Ms McGuire, expressly did not say that. As I understood it, she said that the regulations will specify that the parent with care must have agreed to the other sum being made. She went on to say that it would not be appropriate to seek the parent with care&#146;s agreement for the payment of the offset when

<p><a name="08020796000374">This is a potential area of dispute, as I know to my cost from a previous incarnation as a Member of Parliament. The non-resident parent often argues that a particular sum that has been offset has been received by the parent with care, but it was for an item of expense that had nothing to do with child maintenance. That happens quite often.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0008.htm_para33">
<p><a name="08020796000375">My contention is that the right of appeal, if at all valuable, should be available to both parents; for the non-resident parent if the commission decides not to offset and to the parent with care who does not accept a determination to offset. That seems to have been rejected in the Public Bill Committee on the basis that it would not be appropriate to allow appeal rights in respect of any discretionary decisions. Providing an appeal right is likely to create a delay and a layer of complication and bureaucracy. That was maintained on 11 October in col. 365 in the Public Bill Committee. My contention is that appeals tribunals exist precisely to allow fresh scrutiny of discretionary administrative decisions. To deny the right of appeal to the parent with care, who stands to lose child maintenance which she is owed and who disputes the said payment by the non-resident parent or the reasons for it, risks, in my view, a potential prima facie breach of Article 6 of the Human Rights Act. It is important to get this ironed out now. There is confusion in my mind about the policy intention and I am still seized of the need to try to secure as much protection as we can for the parent with care in circumstances where power to treat liability as satisfied is being considered by the commission.

<p><a name="08020796000388">The clause has two parts. In the first part we are seeking a power to enable the commission to offset maintenance liabilities between parents of the same children. We envisage that this will occur mainly where a child is living with one parent but later goes on to live with the other. We generally refer to these as &#147;role reversal&#148; cases. If maintenance arrears are due to the first parent with care, the provision will allow the commission to offset them against his or her maintenance liability on becoming the non-resident parent. That will prevent situations that currently occur, where parents complain that they are being chased for maintenance even though the other parent owes them maintenance.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08020796000389">In the second part of the provision, we are providing a power to enable the commission to offset payments made from time to time by the non-resident parent to third parties, against their maintenance liability. That is intended to cover situations where a non-resident parent makes a payment that will be beneficial to the child&#151;for example, an urgent electricity bill&#151;on behalf of the parent with care, perhaps before he is due to pay his maintenance. Without such a provision, where such a payment is made the non-resident parent is still legally required to pay the full amount of maintenance, which means meeting his liability twice. We want to allow the commission to be able to adopt a sensible approach  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC675"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column GC675</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that reflects arrangements agreed between the parents and to offset the payment against the maintenance liability where it is appropriate to do so.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08020796000390">For both parts of the provision, regulations will set out parameters within which the commission can use the power. In respect of payments made to third parties, that will include the types of payment that will be appropriate for offsetting, such as the one-off payment of a utility bill. Most importantly, it will be made clear that the parent with care must have agreed to the payment being made in the first place. It will then be up to the commission to decide whether to offset the payment against the non-resident parent&#146;s maintenance liability. In all offsetting scenarios, the welfare of any children affected by the decision should always be considered.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08020796000391">These amendments seek to afford appeal rights when the commission decides to apply offsetting in these scenarios, and Amendment No. 182 seeks appeal rights in respect of both parts of the provision and only for the parent with care if they believe that the decision is not in the best interests of the qualifying child. Amendments Nos. 183 and 212 seek to provide appeal rights specifically in respect of the offsetting of payments made to third parties, and that no action is taken until sufficient time has elapsed for an appeal to be brought. I must make it clear that before making any offsetting decision, the commission will discuss the implications with both parents and it will consider any representations made, including whether the welfare of their children may be put at risk. We do not believe that it would be appropriate to allow appeal rights in these limited situations which relate to the collection of child maintenance. In making a decision, the commission will be required to balance the needs of both parents and all children affected, and that will include children being cared for by both the parent with care and the non-resident parent.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08020796000392">As with other matters relating to the collection of maintenance payments, if either the parent with care or the non-resident parent is still not happy with the way the commission decides to apply these provisions, they may apply for judicial review of the decision. I know that that is something of a long stop, but I hope that the noble Lord will feel reassured that there is enough protection and engagement along the way to avoid the necessity of strictly technical appeal rights and that there is the opportunity for both parents and, more importantly the children involved, to be fully protected.</p>

I do not think that a huge number of cases will reach this kind of territory, but there is a weakness in the system. If CMEC has an overriding duty to consult and try to reach agreement, that is fine, but, in the event of a disagreement, resorting to judicial review is slightly ludicrous. Taking a sledgehammer to a nut comes to mind, as my noble friend said earlier. For the avoidance of doubt in a small number of cases, I still believe that an ability to go to a tribunal would be the better course. This is an unfettered use of discretion unless there is an appeal, so I still have some concerns about it. However, I will look carefully

The draft regulations relating to Clauses 30 and 31 give some comfort in that the permission of the parent with care will need to be sought. The amendments have been tabled to see whether this provision should be in the Bill. On reflection, and having seen the draft regulations, they are probably enough. But if the Minister could say a word about how the consultation on the draft regulations is going and how the Government&#146;s policy is developing in this area, that would be extremely helpful.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000400">On the other amendments in the group, and others to be moved by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, Amendment No. 188 seeks to appoint inspectors, which harks back to the old days of the CSA when we aspired to having named officials looking after individual cases. It became clear quite early on that that aspiration could not be fulfilled because of the administrative burden that it would put on the organisation. I do not know what the policy is now, but it used to be possible to appoint inspectors, to invite them to do individual case work and to look at other things with which they were tasked. This is a probing amendment to see whether inspectors have any new role or any new dimension that could be deployed in the new set-up that is being rolled out with the new commission.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08020796000401">Amendment No. 200 deals with trying to protect the interests of the child and the parent with care when it comes to interests and fees. Perhaps the Minister will say a word about that. I shall spend a moment or two on the issues that are raised by Clause 32, which causes me real concern. I listened to the discourse on the Minister&#146;s evidence to the Commons Public Bill Committee and, reading between the lines, he was less than enthusiastic. His tone was guarded when he talked about whether Clause 32 would ever be resorted to.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08020796000402">I have real concerns about the principle of parcelling up arrears and debts and sending them to people outside the public service to try to recover, as is envisaged in the clause as I read it.

Clause 32, however, goes too far. The parents with care, whose debts might be parcelled up and handed out, would not be particularly comfortable with procedure either, although they might not know that much about it. Unless the privatisation of transferring arrears&#151;bundling them up and parcelling them out&#151;is going to become a core objective, there is a great danger that this will become an unpopular and, probably more importantly, unsuccessful part of the commission&#146;s business compared with what can be done under existing public service arrangements.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08020796000403">All the evidence that I have seen to date suggests that the private collection of debts is no better&#151;indeed, it is arguably worse&#151;than the efforts of existing Child Support Agency professionals who do this work. It is specialist work; it takes a lot of expertise, it requires a lot of careful work, and you have to be assiduous at working out the detail of pursuing people for arrears and outstanding debts. I fear in my heart that, if we let Clause 32 go and are not careful, it will create all sorts of difficulties which would not be sensible or useful. Unless the Government are going to make this a major new plank and encourage the commission to make it a major new way of dealing with things in the future, they should think again. On that basis, I beg to move.</p>

It was tabled to ensure that, before taking a decision under new Section 41E(1) in Clause 31 to extinguish liability in respect of arrears of child support maintenance, the commission will take into consideration the welfare of the child or children in respect of whom the arrears of child support maintenance are due to.</p>

It should be quite a long time. They may, of course, not be going to university. None the less that gives an age range of 23 to 25 when it might be appropriate in most cases to write off the arrears.

It is a considerable power that could have a considerable impact on a child. Can the Minister therefore tell me now, and not during consideration of secondary legislation, what might be the circumstances to nullify parental liability and when it would be unfair or otherwise inappropriate to enforce liability in respect of arrears? To my mind, the Bill gives the commission the power to be both judge and jury in its own case. We need some hard and fast ground rules, decided by Parliament and written into the legislation, rather than decisions left to the discretion of CMEC on this occasion.</p>

The obvious example is where the person is dead, although that may already be covered by regulations. They may have moved abroad, and you have spent five or seven years trying to trace them without success; you have exhausted reasonable avenues of pursuit. Yet, as I understand it, Sir John Bourn and the NAO, perfectly properly under the rules, would not allow that debt to be written off. It is like an incubus on the organisation.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000410">If I am wrong, I will be glad that the noble Lord tabled his probing amendment, but I take it that this puts uncollectible debt on to the same basis on which local authorities work. They have to use their best endeavours and act reasonably, but there comes a point at which it is not reasonable: it clutters up the books and the bodies held responsible for debt that is not collectable, and appears to cloud and muddy the financial figures. If that is the situation, as I would expect, I hope that my noble friend can give us those reassurances. If it is not, then the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has a point of real substance here.</p>

The provisions in Clause 30 will enable the commission to negotiate and accept settlements between parents where arrears of maintenance are due and a non-resident parent makes a reasonable offer to pay less than the total amount owed in full and final settlement of the whole debt. Amendment No. 184 would place on the commission a requirement to obtain the written consent of the parent with care before it accepts the part-payment of arrears in full and final settlement of the whole amount. This was raised in Committee in the other place, and a related issue has also been raised by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee concerning parent with care consent with regard to the sale of debt.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000413">In response to those concerns, it is my intention to table a government amendment on Report that will put into the Bill that PWC consent will need to be obtained under Clause 30, and under Clause 32, which provides for the power to transfer arrears. I trust that this step will help to allay any concerns which Members of the Committee may have on this issue.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08020796000414">Amendments Nos. 185 and 186 relate to Clause 31, which provides the power to write off arrears. Amendment No. 185 would place on the commission a requirement to request and receive written consent from the parent with care before it extinguishes liability in respect of arrears. The CSA has a substantial amount of current debt: &#163;3.7 billion. In his report, Sir David Henshaw recommended that we should seek powers to write off debt that may appear to be unrecoverable, but we decided against seeking such a broad power. There are, however, circumstances where it is appropriate to write off debt and where it would be unfair or otherwise inappropriate to try to enforce payment. It is therefore our intention to prescribe in regulations the precise circumstances where write-off can occur.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para22">
<p><a name="08020796000415">The prescribed circumstances will be limited to cases where there is no continuing maintenance liability and the parent with care has expressly asked the commission not to take action to recover the arrears, where the parent with care has died, or where the non-resident parent has died and the debt cannot be recovered from the estate. I think Members of the Committee will agree that, in the circumstances I have just outlined, the commission will either be acting in accordance with the express wish of the parent with care, or will have no option other than to write off the arrears.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08020796000416">As I have said, we will write off debt only where it would be &#147;unfair or otherwise inappropriate&#148; to enforce the arrears. The &#147;unfair or inappropriate&#148; test will usually be satisfied where the prescribed circumstances apply, but will also provide extra protection to ensure that the debt is written off only where the commission has properly considered all the circumstances of the case. For example, it might decide not to extinguish the debt if it suspects that the person with care has come under pressure from the non-resident parent. I assure Members of the Committee that the Government have absolutely no intention of writing off debt that is due to be paid to a parent with care against their wishes. However, there is already a sufficient safeguard in the Bill to provide that, where a parent with care wishes a debt to be recovered, it is not written off, and that the detail of the process of writing off debt should be set out in regulations.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08020796000417">Amendment No. 186 would place on the commission a specific requirement to consider the welfare of the children in respect of whom the arrears are due when it decides to extinguish child maintenance arrears. I agree that the commission must consider the welfare of children, but it is unnecessary for this to be provided for in Clause 31, as we have discussed on a number of occasions today. Section 2 of the Child Support Act already goes wider  


<notus-date day="7" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC680"><b>7 Feb 2008 : Column GC680</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>than the proposed amendment. It requires the Secretary of State, when exercising any discretionary powers given to him by that Act, to have regard to the welfare of any child likely to be affected by his decision. That duty applies equally to all children in the households of both the parent with care and the non-resident parent. It will apply equally to the commission when it takes over the Secretary of State&#146;s functions. This means that when a decision to extinguish maintenance arrears is taken, the existing child support legislation already safeguards the welfare of children affected by that decision, and we do not believe that there is a need to repeat what is already a statutory obligation to provide.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08020796000418">Amendment No. 188 would provide for regulations to enable a parent with care to request the appointment of a named inspector to expedite recovery procedures when maintenance arrears have fallen behind by more than two months. As noble Lords will be aware, our intention is that the new commission should be an NDPB that has the flexibility to shape its services and adapt its policies in the light of developing experience. The new clause proposed in Amendment No. 188 would curtail that flexibility from the outset by obliging the commission to organise its work in a particular way. Not only would that place a restrictive burden on the new organisation before it starts, but it has practical implications in that it is more likely to slow down the recovery process than enhance it. We intend that the commission should be able to develop its own operating model and have the flexibility to harness the skills of private and voluntary sector partners in delivering its services. Should the commission find that it wishes to contract out part of its recovery service, the requirement in the Bill for an employer-named individual would be an unnecessary obstacle. In summary, the new clause would prove a burden to the organisation and in practice would not improve the customer&#146;s experience or the recovery process.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08020796000419">The final amendment in this group is Amendment No. 200, which concerns Clause 40. This clause relates to the:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08020796000565">&#147;Extinction of liability in respect of interest and fees&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020796000453">The amendment would require the commission, when writing off liability due to unpaid fees or interest, to give the parent with care written notice and a right of appeal to a tribunal on the grounds that extinguishing the debt would not be in the best interests of the child for whom the liability is due. I should explain the background to this clause. Regulations made in 1992 under the 1991 Act provide for the charging of interest on maintenance arrears and the charging of fees in respect of the assessment and collection of child support maintenance. The agency stopped charging fees and interest in the mid-1990s, and these regulations were repealed in 2001.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para27">
<p><a name="08020796000420">On the debt that had built up as a result of parents not paying remains, the total amount of debt from unpaid interest is around &#163;1.9 million, but we expect that in individual cases, the amounts will be very small.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para28">
<p><a name="08020796000421">In the case of debt as a result of fees charged, the amount is around &#163;12 million, which would accrue to

The purpose of the power in Clause 40 is to ensure that interest or fees that accrued under the 1992 regulations will be extinguished. In effect, it is a one-off tidying-up provision. It is our intention to notify parents when debt from unpaid interest is written off, as we believe it would be unfair to raise the unrealistic expectations of parents with care that such debt could now ever be recovered. Creating a right of appeal against this decision would only introduce yet another stage and make the whole process protracted and drawn-out without any reasonable prospect of ever recovering this debt, which could be over 10 years old. It would therefore be inappropriate to give a right of appeal to a parent with care in the context of what are in essence good housekeeping provisions that will enable the commission to manage debt more effectively.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0009.htm_para29">
<p><a name="08020796000422">I shall pick up on some of the other points that were made. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, commented on Clause 32 and the transfer of debt. A bit of market testing was done around this issue to see if the market had an appetite for taking on a tranche of the agency&#146;s current debt and whether it was likely to provide value for money. Bearing in mind that if it were possible to get some cash to parents while the children are still young, that might be something to be welcomed. However, perhaps not surprisingly, the result of the work showed that while there may be some market interest, it was more keen on what might be called the low-hanging fruit, which would need to be parcelled up with liability orders and thus would be relatively easy to collect. With the wider range of powers that the commission will have, it should be much better placed to enforce such orders.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000423">We discussed the benefit of retaining the clause. On balance, we believed that it was appropriate to hang on to that prospect, but who knows what will happen in future? The noble Lord is right to probe. One acknowledges that there is no great and early appetite to see this as any significant solution to collecting the money. However, given that we want to keep open as many options as possible to get more money, we thought it was worth continuing to include it.</p>

We also know that a seven-day warning letter, which is sent by the agency to inform clients that their case is about to be transferred to debt collection agencies, can produce quite a good response. That itself triggers collection, and gets more money to more children. I do not have a ready figure on the number of cases involved, but we will certainly see whether we can provide one.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000425">My noble friend Lady Hollis asked about the scale of recoverable debt. I agree with her analysis.

Obviously there are particular issues to address, which is why we want there to be the opportunity to negotiate in cases where interim maintenance assessments have been in place.

My initial thoughts are that, although it is totally appropriate to seek to get the consent of the parent with care before writing off the debt that was due usually to her, this should not be an out-and-out veto, because otherwise the commission would continue to be landed with uncollectible debt because of a veto of the parent with care. I therefore reserve my position.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0010.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08020796000428">The same applies to the transfer of arrears. The Minister&#146;s definition of the expression clearly means something rather different from mine when I came into the Grand Committee this afternoon. I shall look at this very carefully, because as I said I have some slight initial reservations about the consultation with the parent with care.</p>

<p><a name="08020796000429"><b><a name="80207-gc0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="08020796000731">Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> For clarity, let me help the noble Lord. On the transfer of arrears, we are looking at the potential to sell a tranche of debt. The agency or the commission would get the money for that and there would be a basis on which to distribute it to parents with care, although we do not believe that that is likely to be a significant runner, if a runner at all. If it was, however, the specific consent of the parent with care would and should be required for the debt that was transferred.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0010.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08020796000430">On write-offs under Clause 31, the noble Lord is right that there are some circumstances in which the parent with care should not have a veto&#151;for example if the non-resident parent or the estate cannot pay or does not have the wherewithal to do that. I also stress that there will be circumstances in which the parent with care may have given consent, but if the commission feels that the parent with care has been unduly got at and pressured to give that consent, it would have to comply with that agreement and would not necessarily have to write off that debt.</p>

<a name="80207-gc0010.htm_para6">

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para0">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"><a name="08020767000013">The 2008 report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) has now been published. I wish to express my thanks to the chairman and members of the review body for their report. I am pleased to confirm that the AFPRB's recommendations are to be accepted in full, with implementation effective from 1 April 2008.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para1">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"><a name="08020767000014">In line with the AFPRB recommendations, the basic military salary for officers and all other ranks will increase by 2.6 per cent. In addition, the AFPRB has recommended an increase to X-Factor of 1 per cent and a restructuring to increase the amount  of X-Factor paid to officers at lieutenant-colonel, colonel and brigadier (and equivalent) ranks.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para2">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"><a name="08020767000015">The rates of specialist pay (including flying pay, submarine pay, diving pay and hydrographic pay) will also increase by 2.6 per cent. The Government have also accepted the AFPRB's recommendation to introduce additional targeted financial retention incentives for nuclear submarine watchkeepers, army vehicle mechanics, Royal Artillery, RAF Regiment gunners and firefighters and a new category of specialist pay for explosive ordnance disposal personnel to tackle specific recruitment and retention issues.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para3">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"><a name="08020767000016">The Government remain committed to the independent pay review body process.

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para9">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"><a name="08020767000024">I have today laid amended Education (Student Support) Regulations, making changes in the way we support prisoners undertaking full-time higher education courses.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"><a name="08020767000025">The education of offenders is an integral part of strategies to reduce reoffending. Improving the skills of offenders, helping them to move into jobs, is likely to help break the cycle of reoffending.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para11">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"><a name="08020767000026">Offenders are encouraged to study at all levels, including courses offered by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). We estimate that about 590prisoners are currently studying on part-time distance learning courses, usually provided by the Open University. A smaller number of students study full-time in higher education. They must satisfy attendance criteria agreed by the HEI and the prison governor by, for example, securing release on temporary licence (&#147;day release&#148;). All prisoners released on temporary licence are subject to regular and rigorous risk assessment by the governor.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para12">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"><a name="08020767000027">Financial support for students attending full-time higher education courses is provided through the Student Loans Company (SLC), in conjunction with relevant local authorities which assess entitlement in accordance with the student support regulations. Support comprises loans for tuition fees and loans and grants for maintenance. Payments for tuition fees are paid by the SLC directly to HEIs.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para13">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"><a name="08020767000028">It has been brought to Ministers&#146; attention that there is a long-established but unjustifiable provision in the student support regulations that has allowed prisoners on full-time courses in higher education to receive financial support in the form of loans and grants for maintenance.</p>

Nor do I believe that it is an appropriate use of public money.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para15">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"><a name="08020767000030">Last week, I suspended all student support payments to prisoners with immediate effect. While I am examining this further, I am laying amended Education (Student Support) Regulations today to enable me to prevent any further payments of maintenance support being made. These regulations will come into force on 28 February 2008.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para16">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"><a name="08020767000031">I have taken a number of further immediate steps to ensure that no further successful applications for maintenance support can be made by prisoners.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para17">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"><a name="08020767000032">The Permanent Secretary of my department is today writing to higher education providers, requesting that they immediately inform the SLC when offering a prisoner a full-time place at their institution. With the support of the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, the Deputy Director-General of the Prison Service has instructed prison governors to identify all prisoners currently undertaking full-time higher education and to inform any such prisoners that they must not apply for maintenance support. In addition, as soon as the amended regulations come into force, all prison governors will be instructed to inform the SLC if an offender within their establishment is offered a place to study full time in higher education, or is currently a full-time student. These measures will enable the SLC to identify all future applications from prisoners, and assess them in accordance with the amended regulations.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para18">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"><a name="08020767000033">I have also instructed the SLC to continue to identify and review all current and past applications, as well as live cases. We will then provide a complete estimate of the number and cost of payments and our investigations will ensure that all legal requirements were properly complied with.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para19">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"><a name="08020767000034">The decisions of HEIs to accept prisoners as students, and the decision of prison governors to allow their attendance, are taken at local level. The student support regulations do not require an applicant to identify themselves as a prisoner. Nor do regulations provide explicitly for the circumstances of a student who is subsequently subject to a custodial sentence. Individuals may also successfully apply for student support while in prison for courses that they take up on release. In addition, since full-time student support was introduced in 1962, prisoners have not been specifically excluded from these regulations. As a result, there is no central list of offenders studying full-time HE courses. Current estimates of the amount of support received are therefore provisional. We have identified 91 prisoners who have received a total of &#163;250,000 of repayable maintenance loans, and &#163;120,000 in maintenance grants in the 2007 calendar year.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para20">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"><a name="08020767000035">Our preliminary investigations suggest that, since current SLC operational systems were put into place in 1998, approximately 250 prisoners have received up to &#163;250,000 in maintenance grants. Where prisoners have received loans, these will be repayable in the usual way. These cases will be examined on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0001.htm_para21">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"><a name="08020767000036">I am minded to conclude that support for offenders studying in higher education, which remains a proper government objective, should be provided through regulations made specifically for that purpose. In consultation with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, I have asked the Permanent Secretaries of my department and the Ministry of Justice, drawing on the wider resources of the Civil Service,to oversee the SLC&#146;s review of cases, in conjunction with relevant local authorities, officials from my department, the Ministry of Justice and the Prison Service, and to make recommendations to me about the management of support for offenders in full-time higher education.</p>

Following those discussions, I have agreed to their proposal that, once the agency is established, a sub-committee of the HCA board should be set up with specific responsibility for London. The board will be chaired by the Mayor, and the vice chair will be the chief executive of the HCA. The London Boroughs will also be actively involved through participation on the sub-committee and involvement in the delivery of individual schemes on the ground. The sub-committee will be supported by a team comprising the London staff of the HCA and staff drawn from the London Development Agency. The team will be able to draw on the resources and assets of both the HCA and the LDA in meeting London&#146;s housing and regeneration needs.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"><a name="08020767000065">In December 2006, the department consulted on proposals to revise the charges for use of the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing. The consultation noted that: without any charges traffic levels would be substantially higher than they are now, leading to extensive congestion; that even with the current charge levels, usage levels are leading to regular congestion and occasional very severe congestion; and that without action the likelihood of severe congestion will increase.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0002.htm_para1">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"><a name="08020767000066">The consultation document proposed: an increase in tolls for those paying by cash; substantial reductions for those choosing to pay on account using a DART-Tag to register their charge; and the removal of night time charges for all vehicles, when congestion is less of a problem. The intention was to continue to apply an effective pricing signal given growing congestion pressures while at the same time providing an incentive for more people to opt for alternatives to paying cash, thereby easing flow through the charging booths.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0002.htm_para2">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"><a name="08020767000067">In the run-up to the consultation exercise suggestions were put forward that local residents should benefit from a substantial discount for use of the crossing. The Government invited views on these suggestions.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0002.htm_para3">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"><a name="08020767000068">Substantial numbers of people expressed a desire to see a local discount scheme.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"><a name="08020767000069">On 2 April 2007 the department announced that it would develop a local discount scheme for further consultation, noting that any scheme had to be fair to both local residents and the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0002.htm_para5">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"><a name="08020767000070">I am announcing today our proposals. These are that:</p>
private cars should be eligible for discounts when used by residents of Dartford and Thurrock local authority areas;there will be a &#163;10 annual registration fee which will entitle residents of these areas to 50 free one-way journeys per year. Thereafter journeys will be charged at 20p each. (London charges the same annual &#163;10 fee for those who make use of their residents' discount scheme) andto benefit from the discount residents will need to register annually and apply for an electronic &#147;tag&#148; that is fitted in the windscreen of the nominated vehicle. The tag will be provided free of charge but a &#163;10 charge will be levied for replacement of lost or damaged tags.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"><a name="08020767000071">The Government&#146;s intention is that the discount scheme should be implemented alongside the other changes to the charging regime on which we consulted in December 2006.

Therefore the current arrangement, under which a proportion of revenues from the crossing (&#163;1.75 million) is made available to help deliver integrated transport policies in the Dartford and Thurrock areas, would be discontinued.</p>

<a name="80207-wms0002.htm_para8">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"><a name="08020767000073">The consultation document will be published next week and copies will be placed in the Library of the House. The consultation exercise will run for 12 weeks from the date of publication.</p>

However, by increasing the productivity of other cranes, Southampton Container Terminals Limited (SCT) has continued to serve the larger turnaround vessels from China and the Far East, minimising the impact on customers and the supply chain.</p>

<a name="80207w0002.htm_para13">
<p><a name="wa_stpa_28"><a name="08020769000098">SCT are working with the crane inspectors and the HSE to ensure that the affected cranes are phased back into operation as soon as possible. In addition, two new &#147;super post panamax&#148; gantry cranes are expected to become operational during June 2008. On this basis, it is unlikely that the incident will have a significant impact on UK container capacity beyond the short term.</p>
