It reminds us that these statistics are not regularly collected, which is a weakness in itself. It is well known that time spent in a children&#146;s home is a major predictor of offending behaviour, so what steps are the Government taking to ensure that the children of women prisoners do not become looked-after children? Bearing in mind that women are often remanded in prison on relatively minor charges, are the Government implementing the recommendation of the Corston review that women should be remanded only after consideration of a probation report on the impact on their children?</p>

I will ensure that my department considers that point. We are consulting on the Corston recommendation. The noble Baroness is right to refer us to the poor outcomes for many children in care. Many of the children of women prisoners find themselves in care. My department and the Department for Children, Schools and Families reviewed this matter. Although the review found no conclusive evidence to show that imprisoning parents of itself causes poor outcomes

What is being done to improve visiting arrangements&#151; a Home Office survey showed that half of the mothers had had no visits&#151;and communication between children and their mothers? Sixty-two miles is the average distance from home for mothers in prison; the distance is 50 miles for men. What are the Government doing about that?</p>

<a name="80521-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="08052171000019"></a>Of course, we need to do everything that we can to encourage visiting. There is an Assisted Prison Visits Unit and there is help for those relatives or partners who receive benefits or are on a low income. Prisons are encouraged to undertake special children&#146;s visits. There is a target for women prisoners to have children&#146;s visits four times a year, which gives an opportunity for the child to have more contact with their mother than would be the case with ordinary visits.</p>

What help is being given to those caring for the children of prisoners when they are kept at home, which is clearly more desirable than putting them into care, where such carers can be properly supported?</p>

The report of my noble friend Lady Corston focused on the need for smaller units closer to women&#146;s homes. We are considering that carefully. The noble Baroness is right that there has been an increase in the number of women in prison. That has now stabilised. I should emphasise that the law makes it clear that prison sentences should be given only when the offending behaviour is so serious as to merit a custodial term. Clearly, we must ensure that that is kept in mind at all times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="08052171000044"></a>The noble Lord asked why we selected from the 12 available CCS technologies. We had to select one. We can proceed only with one. We are talking &#163;1 billion a time, which is big money in anybody&#146;s terminology. We had to ensure that the competition was effective. Demonstrations are extremely expensive. It was not realistic to expect one country to tackle them all. I hope that noble Lords will be delighted to hear that we are just one of three countries in the world&#151;Norway and America are the other two&#151;which are even going down the path of a demonstration project on carbon capture and storage. We chose post-combustion capture because it is the most globally relevant technology. It can be retrofitted to existing installations&#151;Kingsnorth may well benefit from it in the future&#151;and it is likely to be relevant particularly to the future major emitters of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels. I include in that specifically the technology transfer that we can achieve with China.</p>

Why is it, therefore, that I have been told by Ministers that the substantial proceeds from auctioning the allowances under the Emissions Trading Scheme cannot be used to provide these incentives but have to be surrendered to the Treasury? Surely what the Minister has just described from the Gulf is an example of how they are using their energy revenue to encourage development in low-carbon systems. Why cannot we do the same?</p>

It is very easy for Abu Dhabi to hypothecate when they provide something like 20 per cent of the world&#146;s fossil fuel revenues and have little call on that money. Here, the money goes into the Treasury and is used to promote so many different initiatives. But the noble Lord is not exactly accurate when he says that we are doing not a lot. We are supporting one of the world&#146;s first commercial-scale CCS demonstration projects, as I mentioned. That is a significant commitment at &#163;1 billion a throw. We are already supporting an oxyfuel project under the carbon abatement technologies demonstration programme. We are also supporting 15 other clean coal technology projects supported by the Technology Strategy Board. That is all using taxpayers&#146; money. It is not true that we are doing nothing.</p>

In that light, with just one demonstration project, are the Government not putting all their eggs in one basket? Would it not have been better to have a couple more projects looking at pre-combustion technology and not just at carbon capture and storage, as welcome as that is?</p>

This is not the only game in town but it is the one that we have chosen; there will be many others round the world. The advantage of pre-combustion is that it is slightly cheaper, and the problem is that you cannot retrofit it. With so many coal burners around the world&#151;and I have in mind the developing world especially&#151;the ability to use technology, which has yet to be completely perfected, to retrofit on to coal burners will be very useful. Britain will play a leading role in selling technological solutions to climate change around the world. This type of technology is one of the things that I sell round the world for this country. It is something where we can win. On that basis, I suggest to the House that we have made the right investment decision.</p>

Is she aware that many people of limited means are prepared to spend their hard-earned money on private treatment? That is their choice. Yet if all but the richest people, who can more easily afford to pay fully for private treatment, transferred entirely to the National Health Service, would that not completely wreck the NHS by overburdening it?</p>

It would be wrong for me to discuss individual cases, although I have some information about that one. I reassure the noble Baroness that our guidance is quite clear that, when a patient who has previously received private healthcare seeks help from the NHS, they should be treated in the same way as any other NHS patient and offered treatments based on their clinical need. Their previous status as privately funded patients should, as far as is practical, neither disadvantage them nor allow them to access NHS care in a preferential way.</p>

That deserves to be celebrated and preserved, and is why the principle is supported by all the main political parties. If patients want to pay separately for private healthcare, of course they can. However, creating a premium NHS service by allowing people to pay the NHS for treatments that are not offered to all would indeed lead to patients receiving different NHS care, not because they had different clinical needs but because one person could afford to pay a top-up and another could not. This would make nonsense not only of the founding principles of the NHS but of the 10 core principles which the Opposition signed up to and are as vigorously in favour of as we are.</p>

In my meetings with Burmese Ministers I pressed them to remove obstructions to the international aid effort. The situation has improved but it was clear from my discussions with NGOs and UN experts operating in Burma that the scale of need is enormous and too little aid is getting through too slowly.

After all, the last visit by a British Minister was over 22 years ago and it was only possible in this humanitarian emergency to put aside the long held political objections we have to that regime and its behaviour. But I assured the Ministers I met that obviously dialogue and co-operation around this humanitarian emergency, if successful, might open channels of communication and trust which were previously not there.

An air bridge has now formally opened between Bangkok Don Muang Airport and Rangoon, which will allow a steady acceleration of flights. Those flights will remain British and American, and will be provided by all donors. In addition to aid through this funnel of the ASEAN/Asian route, there will continue to be aid through British NGOs and British aid directly through UN agencies. The British NGOs are doing a remarkable job of expanding access already. On sanctions, like so much else which falls into the political realm, the time to draw lessons will come later.

The fact that the Government of Burma have given ground and allowed this to happen equally reflects that they understand that they face an international community to which they cannot ultimately say no. Equally, it gives us pause for thought as to whether the approach briefly adopted last week of trying to come in through the Security Council is the right way to handle a humanitarian situation of this kind. We have got there through putting politics aside and engaging in intense humanitarian negotiation. We need to bear in mind that this proved more promising than the attempts to batter down the front door of the Security Council.</p>

We will not have as many western experts as we would ideally want. It was the fact that the offer to deploy western experts on a wide scale had been so resisted by the Burmese that led us to pursue this other route, but western experts will be there as part of the UN team that is deployed and as part of Save the Children, Merlin and the other British NGOs and indeed American and western NGOs operating in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08052171000079"></a>The risk of secondary infection remains huge and we are in a race against time. This less-than-perfect funnel that we have created is nevertheless ratcheting up aid, and we will need to keep a close focus on whether it is ratcheting up fast enough, because there is a risk of cholera or other water-borne disease. Five thousand square kilometres are still flooded. The incidence of diarrhoea among children is rising alarmingly. We should not be complacent. This is going to be an extremely difficult operation.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_2R0"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="08052171000002"></a>Energy Bill</h3>

<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="08052171000089"></a><a name="80521-0003.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80521-0003.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08052171000319"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office &amp; Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Lord Jones of Birmingham):</b> My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. Of the many challenges we face, few can be more significant or more urgent than tackling climate change and maintaining the security of our energy supplies. International Energy Agency projections indicate that global energy demand is set to increase by 53 per cent between 2006 and 2030, in turn driving a 55 per cent increase in carbon dioxide emissions over the same period.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08052171000090"></a>It is clear that we need decisive action at home and abroad to tackle these major issues, including driving forward significant new investment in energy infrastructure. The IEA forecasts that between now and 2020 $20 trillion of investment will be needed to meet these challenges. The UK itself will need investment in around 30 to 35 gigawatts of new electricity generation capacity over the next two decades, around two-thirds of which will be required in the next 12 years. We also need new import and storage infrastructure as the UK becomes increasingly dependent on imported energy. These are large scale and long term investments, and the investment decisions taken over the next decade will be critical in determining how successfully the UK and the rest of the world move towards a secure, low carbon energy future.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08052171000091"></a>The Government set out their strategy for tackling these challenges in the 2007 Energy White Paper. This Bill is one of the key legislative strands for implementing that strategy, alongside the Climate Change Bill, which noble Lords have already considered, and the Planning Bill, which is currently in the other place. The objective of the Energy Bill is to help to deliver an environment that will encourage investment not only to maintain the UK&#146;s diverse energy mix but also to make that mix increasingly low carbon. The Bill will update the legislative framework to reflect the availability of new and emerging low carbon technologies, meet our changing requirements for security of supply infrastructure, and ensure suitable protection for the environment and taxpayer as our energy market fundamentally changes.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08052171000092"></a>I turn now to the specific measures. The Bill is split into six parts. Part 1 relates to offshore gas  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1473"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1473</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>importation and storage. This country currently imports around 20 per cent of its gas, but that is probably going to rise to up to 80 per cent by 2020. As we increasingly rely on international energy markets, our strategy for ensuring secure energy supplies must evolve. We must not be dependent on unstable and possibly sometimes conflicting economies elsewhere in the world. Part of this evolution will be a growing need for new offshore gas storage and import infrastructure. It is important to ensure that there is a clear regulatory framework which will support the private sector investment in this type of project. Current offshore legislation was designed largely for the oil and gas production that has dominated the last half century, and as a result there is no single piece of legislation that covers the kind of new offshore gas infrastructure that this country now needs. The current regulatory process is therefore complex and a barrier to new investment from the private sector. Clauses 1 to 16 create a new regulatory and licensing framework specifically designed for offshore gas storage and offshore liquefied natural gas unloading projects. This will allow us to simplify the regulatory process, create greater clarity and, importantly, provide certainty about the way forward for investors from the private sector.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08052171000093"></a>This part of the Bill also creates a new regulatory framework for offshore carbon dioxide storage projects. It is clear that fossil fuels will continue to be part of the UK&#146;s diverse energy mix for a long time to come. The IEA predicts, under the most optimistic scenario, that fossil fuels will still provide around 38 per cent of global electricity in 2030. The successful development of carbon capture and storage technology is vital if we are to achieve a low carbon future. Clauses 17 to 35 will establish a licensing framework that allows the storage of carbon dioxide under the seabed. This is a key part of enabling the long-term development of CCS. Through this Bill and the Government&#146;s demonstration project&#151;I remind noble Lords that we are one of only three countries in the world undertaking this type of demonstration project, the other two being Norway and the United States&#151;our aim is to drive forward the development of a technology that has the potential to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel power stations by as much as 90 per cent.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08052171000094"></a>Part 2 focuses on renewable electricity; that is, electricity generated from renewable sources. The Government are committed to an increasing role for renewables in the UK&#146;s energy mix and want to build on and strengthen the existing renewables obligation&#151; the RO. The changes to the RO include the power to band the obligation to allow differentiated levels of support to technologies. That will help to promote the more rapid deployment of a wider range of renewable technologies. It will include more support for technologies such as offshore wind and less for those technologies which are more cost-effective, such as landfill gas, helping the UK to see electricity from renewable sources grow over the medium to long term.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08052171000095"></a>The RO has been highly successful. Since its introduction in 2002, we have seen renewable electricity more than double, from around 2 per cent to more than 4 per cent of the electricity generated in  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1474"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1474</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the United Kingdom, with a further 18 gigawatts now in the planning systems. By 2010, in some 20 months&#146; time, alongside exemption from the climate change levy, the RO will be worth around &#163;1 billion per annum in support to the renewables sector. Our reforms will make the RO 30 per cent more efficient in terms of renewables deployment in the period from next year to 2015. As a result we expect to see the electricity generated by RO-eligible renewable sources triple between now and 2015.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08052171000096"></a>The Government expect offshore wind to make a significant contribution to renewable electricity in the United Kingdom in the future. We already have plans, potentially, to open our seas to up to 33 gigawatts of offshore wind energy, subject to the outcome of a strategic environmental assessment of the seas surrounding the UK. Underpinning these ambitions, the Bill will also ensure that we have the infrastructure in place to transmit offshore renewable electricity to the onshore grid. To help enable that, we must establish an effective regulatory regime for offshore transmission. The Energy Bill<I></I>will add to existing powers in order to ensure that Ofgem can run cost-effective and efficient competitive tender exercises for offshore transmission licences. Introducing competition in offshore transmission infrastructure will help to avoid unnecessary delays and cost to the development of offshore renewables projects, and ultimately reduce risk and support investment. Noble Lords will have seen from the Energy Bill impact assessment that our analysis indicates that a competitive tender process for the construction and operation of these transmission assets could reduce costs by between &#163;230 million and &#163;400 million on investments of around &#163;2.5 billion.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08052171000097"></a>Part 3 of the Bill covers the decommissioning of energy installations. While one of the objectives of our energy strategy is to create the right environment for investment, the Government have a responsibility to ensure that both the taxpayer and the environment are adequately protected. Noble Lords will be well aware that it is the Government&#146;s view that new nuclear power should have a role to play in the UK&#146;s energy mix. New nuclear power will contribute to the diversity of our energy supplies and will definitely help to reduce carbon emissions. The developers and operators will have to fund, build and operate any new nuclear power stations. They will have to meet the full costs of decommissioning and each operator&#146;s full share of waste management and the cost of disposal.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08052171000098"></a>The new legislative framework that we are putting in place through Clauses 42 to 65 of the Bill will ensure that all operators have in place a funded waste and decommissioning programme, approved by the Secretary of State, before operation of the specific power station commences. The programme will have to set out a costed technical plan for how a developer proposes to decommission that station and a financial plan for how those costs will be met. It will be a criminal offence to operate a new nuclear power station if a programme such as that is not in place.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08052171000099"></a>As part of their approved programmes, and to ensure that potential investors from the private sector fully understand the level of their potential liability,  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1475"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1475</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Government committed, in the nuclear White Paper, to establishing a fixed unit price for disposing of waste from new nuclear power stations. This will be based on the expected costs of waste management and disposal and will include a significant risk premium. Clause 63 gives the Secretary of State the power to implement that.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08052171000100"></a>The regulatory structure we are putting in place through the Bill is just one of the measures we announced in the nuclear White Paper earlier this year to facilitate the building of new nuclear power stations. Together with the clauses in the Bill, these measures will ensure that nuclear is available as an investment option to companies alongside other low-carbon technologies. Neither will be crowded out from the private sector investment mix.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08052171000101"></a>This part of the Bill also strengthens the existing decommissioning regime for both offshore renewables and oil and gas installations. Developers already have an obligation to ensure that redundant offshore installations are decommissioned properly to protect the marine environment and to ensure the safety of other industries, such as shipping. Provisions in the Energy Bill will strengthen the existing regimes, including, for example, ensuring that funds put aside for decommissioning are expressly protected for that purpose, even in the event of a corporate insolvency.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08052171000102"></a>Part 4 of the Bill covers a number of issues related to the oil and gas sector. The UK still meets around two-thirds of its energy needs from the UK continental shelf, but our ability to continue to maximise domestic production economically will depend on how we incentivise production through a regulatory framework. The Energy Bill makes minor amendments to the oil and gas regulatory framework to reflect the evolving commercial environment, including the growing number of smaller players on the UK continental shelf. The proposals in the Bill, supported by business, will help to ensure that we can continue, efficiently and effectively, to manage the UK continental shelf. To that end, we are making minor changes to the oil and gas licensing regime, including, for example, taking a power partially to revoke a licence in the event of the insolvency of one, but not all, of the parties to that licence. That will benefit consortiums of companies where one party defaults but all the others in the consortium are able to continue.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08052171000103"></a>In addition, to enable fair access by all parties, we are extending the coverage of the existing upstream oil and gas infrastructure third party access regime and introducing a similar procedure in relation to oil processing facilities.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08052171000104"></a>Part 5 deals with a number of areas of legislation. That includes an enabling power to underpin the rollout of smart meters to medium-sized businesses, in the first instance, and then potentially to all energy consumers, smaller businesses and finally the 44 million domestic consumers. Part 5 also deals with a range of more minor legislative changes, including rationalising energy policy reporting requirements and aligning them with the new requirements that are being introduced as part of the Climate Change Bill. Part 5 also gives effect in legislation to the transfer of  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1476"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1476</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>electricity safety functions from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to the Health and Safety Executive and the transfer of the technical regulation of gas and electricity meters from Ofgem to the National Weights and Measures Laboratory.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08052171000105"></a>Finally, the Bill also updates the regulatory framework for nuclear security, thus ensuring that we have stronger sanctions to prosecute people attempting to steal the most sensitive information from specific designated sites. The recent restructuring of the sector means that sensitive information related to uranium enrichment may now be stored off licensed sites, such as a research facility. These provisions will mean that, no matter where this type of sensitive information is held, it is properly protected, including through the availability of appropriate sanctions.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08052171000106"></a>The provisions of the Bill will further improve our regulatory framework so that our energy market can operate more effectively, we can ensure that we have the right environment to encourage timely investment and we can increase the diversity and the low-carbon nature of our energy supplies, ensuring at the same time that we have security of that supply in an ever-changing and often dangerous world. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

We have long awaited the great Energy Bill, but this is only a small part of the energy picture. The Marine Bill, the Climate Change Bill, the Planning Bill and a future nuclear waste Bill are all vital to securing Britain&#146;s long-term energy supply and climate change strategy. Even that list leaves out measures that are vital to that strategy, including feeder tariffs, smart metering&#151;which I notice the Minister mentioned today&#151;and other measures to help domestic customers experiencing fuel poverty, and a carbon capture regime that includes liabilities.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08052171000109"></a>While we on this side of the House welcome the proposal for a nuclear decommissioning fund, there are no measures on nuclear waste.

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08052171000110"></a>On Second Reading in another place, my colleague, the shadow Secretary of State, Alan Duncan, while welcoming the broad thrust of the Bill, criticised several specific measures. He said that the Government&#146;s handling of carbon capture and storage&#151;known from here on in as CCS technology&#151;had been poor and that it was not clear what provision, if any, the Bill made for liabilities. While he praised provision in the Bill for banding the renewables obligation, he said that the proposal did not go far enough to enable the UK to meet its EU renewables target. He also regretted that no provision had been made for feed-in tariffs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08052171000111"></a>The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have each pointed out that what is most controversial about this Energy Bill is what is not in it. They used the miscellaneous section of the Bill in the other place  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1477"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1477</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to try to generate debate about such important provisions as feed-in tariffs, smart metering, prepayment meters, electronic electricity devices, social tariffs and the role of Ofgem. I have no doubt that the Government will hear forceful argument from all sides of the House on these important omissions, both today and in Committee. Ten years&#146; dithering over energy and consultation after consultation and now, as the Minister says, there is no time left to waste.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08052171000112"></a>The Minister himself has admitted that the UK faces a looming energy gap. Approximately 30 per cent of the UK&#146;s existing capacity will shut over the next 20 years. All our nuclear power stations except for Sizewell B are scheduled for closure, and many older coal-fired power stations will be forced to close under EU law. It will leave a significant capacity gap.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08052171000113"></a>The United Kingdom used to be a net exporter of oil and gas, but by 2004 it became a net importer of gas and last year became a net importer of oil. UK gas production peaked in 2000 at 108 billion cubic metres and has since declined by about 1 per cent every year. From 2008 a rapid decline in production is forecast. The Government have estimated that imports could be meeting 90 per cent of gas demand by 2020 and admitted that the UK&#146;s reserves of gas have declined faster than they expected&#151;how vulnerable this makes our country, our industry, our homes and our economy.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08052171000114"></a>The UK currently imports only 7 per cent of its overall gas requirement but that is expected to rise, as the Minister said, to 40 per cent by 2010 and 90 per cent by 2020. More widely, the European Union currently imports 52 per cent of its gas, a proportion that is steadily growing. The European Union is already the world&#146;s leading importer of such resources, and the Government estimate that by 2020 we may be reliant on overseas resources for 80 per cent of our energy needs.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para24"></a>

Companies and consumers alike faced a gas and electricity price shock in the winter of 2005-06 as the margin between supply and demand was too tight. Then, in February, there was a fire at the UK&#146;s largest gas storage facility. By March 2006 a cold snap across Europe and insufficient gas flow through the interconnector led to a gas balancing alert being issued by the national grid. We were suddenly faced with the possibility of gas supply interruptions&#151;unplanned, with nowhere else to turn.</p>

Domestic bills have risen by 35 per cent in real terms in the past seven years. Bills for medium-sized firms have risen by 50 per cent in two years. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform set a target to eliminate fuel poverty in vulnerable households and now the total is likely to rise. Despite a target set by Labour to reduce carbon emissions by 20 per cent, emissions are higher now than when Labour came to power. What a mess. The quicker the Government take action, the better. We will, of

Let me start with some questions for clarification.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08052171000117"></a>The Energy Bill contains a framework for CCS, but what use is it without provision for liabilities? What does the Minister plan to do if the Scottish Parliament blocks plans to build a new nuclear power station in Scotland? Do the Government have any plans to change the nuclear safety targets for a new generation of nuclear power stations? According to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the migration of skills has placed a severe strain on its ability to find, recruit, train and retain the number of skilled employees it requires to assess and approve the different types of reactor that are seeking a licence. What are the Government doing to address this?</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08052171000118"></a>The Government have recently voiced their support for three major international agreements which all have higher ambition levels than the targets in the Climate Change Bill&#151;the G8, the Vienna climate change talks and the European Council spring summit. Why have the Government not put the same level of ambition on our own home-grown Bills?</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08052171000119"></a>During debate in the other place the Minister announced several forthcoming government consultations, including ones on carbon capture readiness, a renewable energy strategy, and environmental and social guidance for Ofgem. Surely these consultations should have taken place before the Bill was published. The noble Lord, Lord Jones, is a Minister of action&#151;surely he is not going to let the Executive hold up the Government&#146;s business any longer than he has to.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08052171000120"></a>Whatever I have said so far, we are where we are. We must work with what is in the Bill, limited though it is. I make a plea today on behalf of the whole House. The Minister prides himself on travelling the world, banging the drum for Britain and British products&#151;and he is very good at it. But unless he stays put and sees the Bill through all its stages, there will be no products to sell. To paraphrase Lord Grey of Fallodon at the end of the First World War, &#147;The lamps are going out all over Britain, and we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime&#148;.</p>

The papers in the Library are full of the future spot price of oil, which has hit a record high. That is rather unfortunate, as many traders believe we are reaching a point where oil scarcity will become the order of the day. In that light, the Energy Bill is most welcome.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08052171000122"></a>At first glance, the Bill seemed extremely uncontentious, partly because most of the issues we are most interested in have been left out of it. That seems unfortunate. However, even though the Bill will probably go into Grand Committee, I hope that the Minister does not take that as an indication that there will not be a good deal of consensus on a number of areas between both opposition parties as well as many Back-Bench Labour Members and Cross-Benchers before we send it back to the House of Commons. In fact, we will be sending  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1479"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1479</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it back to the House of Commons to look at areas it has not scrutinised due to the rather strange system there whereby important issues can be neglected and not called for debate. We have a wonderful system here whereby issues are debated on their importance.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08052171000123"></a>That, I think, will be crucial and the Minister should take it particularly seriously. One issue on which the Government faced a vote was the subject of one of the largest Back-Bench rebellions in this Parliament. That rebellion will gain traction if the proposal is returned from this place. I therefore hope that the Minister can look at feed-in tariffs with an eye to adopting the measures rather than the confrontational politics. Feed-in tariffs are not a political issue.</p>

<a name="80521-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08052171000124"></a>We will be focusing on a number of important issues which should be added to the Bill because of timing. Having just sat through debates on the Climate Change Bill, we are greatly concerned that we are running out of time to introduce technologies and act as a world leader. As the Minister stated, we must develop these technologies in short order if we are to meet our climate change commitments. I therefore hope that the Government will look at a number of these issues with a view to reducing carbon.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80521-0004.htm"/>


<a name="80521-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08052171000125"></a>The first issue we are particularly concerned about, which will take a good deal of the Committee&#146;s time, is the feed-in tariff. I have dealt with this for a number of years, introducing a Private Member&#146;s Bill, the Renewable Energy Bill, four years ago, which raised it. I went to the DTI and discussed it, but there was absolutely no interest whatever on the part of the Government; it was seen as a small or non-issue. Of course, the Government are entirely right: it is a small issue, but that is due to their inaction. In France and Germany, for example, whose Governments have taken a great deal of interest, feed-in tariffs have become a major component in meeting their renewables obligations. The Government have said that renewables are being taken seriously, but I see little action on the ground. Without mechanisms to ensure that this area grows, small, or even larger, renewables will not become economically viable, with economies of scale driving their prices down so that they become an everyday feature of life.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08052171000126"></a>If the Minister cannot consider feed-in tariffs now, maybe he could write to me on what the Government see as the power level to be considered. You could have an unlimited feed-in tariff, but many speakers talk about microgeneration and go up to a much larger scale. It would be interesting to discover the Government&#146;s view on a level for feed-in tariffs. They are dealt with differently in Germany&#151;we have the ROC system over here&#151;so it would be interesting to know how the Government see the level affecting the market in ROCs.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08052171000127"></a>The second issue that I am particularly keen on, which, strangely, was not raised in another place, is the change in the primary responsibilities of Ofgem as regulator. It is important that Ofgem considers carbon a major issue and a primary responsibility. It has been argued that Ofgem deals with the market, competition and supply. However, I have spoken to a large number of energy companies over the past few  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1480"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1480</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>years, and they constantly ask how they can invest in new generating capacity if they do not understand what the carbon regulations will be. Carbon, therefore, has completely skewed the market in new generation because, as it has not been dealt with in the right way, there is little confidence in those public sector energy companies that will fill the gap in the energy market over the next few years.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08052171000128"></a>I realise that we now have a Committee on Climate Change, but it will only be making recommendations. We really need to add carbon into the regulator, Ofgem, so that other market mechanisms must take the role of carbon into account. While it would be easy to say that ETS will be the panacea to solve all of our problems, I do not believe that will be the case&#151;and if not, it would be much more helpful if Ofgem were to deal with it. This is particularly important because BERR, in its former role of DTI, has completely ignored carbon as an issue that has to be dealt with aggressively, and has therefore sidestepped its responsibility for it.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08052171000129"></a>Another area we will be looking at is that of carbon storage and capture. As was stated in the Question earlier today from the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, it is unfortunate that the Government have chosen one pilot project. I understand the costs, but we have the opportunity to invest in technologies that could make us a world leader in an area with massive market potential. Look at what happened with wind turbines: we missed an opportunity when we could have been in the forefront. The Danes took wind turbines and now have more than 60,000 people working in that industry. One problem that we now have, especially with offshore where, as the Minister mentioned, there has been a massive expansion, is that we do not produce the turbines ourselves. Therefore, the shortage and growing queue for the turbines to be produced drives up the price of those that we are installing. That is no small consideration when the London Array will be the largest offshore turbine farm in the world, so it is unfortunate that this country had no stake in producing those turbines.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08052171000130"></a>Smart metering is the other major area which we will be looking at and, since the Government have brought forward an amendment, the Bill now includes it. However, I was particularly concerned with the Minister&#146;s choice of words. He said that customers will &#147;potentially&#148; be able to put in a smart meter. Perhaps that is a change in policy, for in a speech of 19 November 2007, the Prime Minister said that,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08052171000226"></a>&#147;For every household over the next decade there will be the offer of a smart meter that will allow two-way communications between the supplier and customer, giving more accurate bills ... and making it easier for people to generate their own energy through micro generation and sell it onto the grid&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052171000219"></a>In that speech, the Prime Minister stated not only that smart meters will be available to everybody within 10 years, but that feed-in tariffs will also be part of that. Is the Minister now saying that that is potentially not the case? The issue that we will raise on smart meters is that, while the clause is fine as far as it goes, there is nothing to make sure that the Government actually bring them about. We will, then, look to introduce a clause giving a timescale under  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1481"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1481</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which smart meters should be brought about. That is only fair for the energy companies, because there is an enormous amount of investment for them to meet, and for them to be given no specific timescale to work to will cause uncertainty in the market, potentially raising costs.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08052171000131"></a>In these debates on energy, I often talk a great deal about nuclear issues. Many of your Lordships will be glad to know that I am very happy with the Bill&#146;s provisions for nuclear, although I might raise a couple of probing amendments over potential subsidy in the market and whether the Government are getting full cost for the planning gain on land surrounding present British Energy sites, because the new sites will be built next to the old ones. However, that is for a later date.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08052171000132"></a>I am particularly annoyed about the omission of a renewable heat obligation. I have spoken to BERR and the DTI about it on numerous occasions and it has been raised in many debates. It is almost immoral to leave it out, considering the implications for carbon. I very much hope that that issue will be considered as the Bill proceeds. In order to meet our renewable obligations by 2020 without legislation including renewable heat, will the department add renewable heat into their figures? Some of the documentation gives the impression that renewable heat will be added into the figures to meet our renewable target, but there does not seem to be anything in the Bill which gives us hope that renewable heat will be a government priority.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08052171000133"></a>Leaving social tariffs out of the Bill is another rather unfortunate omission. In an age when electricity prices have gone up considerably in the past few weeks, and will go up even further, the failure to include social tariffs to protect those, especially the old and vulnerable, who will increasingly suffer fuel poverty is unfortunate. Another measure that is not included in the Bill, but which I hope to look at, is energy storage. Energy storage for electricity is becoming a major field in America where it is being looked at as a new technology that could iron out the spikes in grid demand. It would be helpful to include provision for that. We are considering the Energy Bill. I cannot see there being an energy Bill in the next term of Parliament, which means that the next Bill to be enacted will be two to three years down the line. If we do not have clear guidance in regulation in many of these areas, new technologies will suffer badly, which will have massive climate change implications.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08052171000134"></a>This is an interesting Bill and Grand Committee will be a relaxed and consensual way of dealing with it, but the Minister should be under no misapprehension &#151;come Report, we will ensure that it will go back to another place for further consideration.</p>

I start by declaring an interest as a director of Infinis, the renewable energy company.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1482"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1482</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08052171000136"></a>Unless and until the scientific consensus shifts and produces either new insights or new solutions, the world must make rapid progress towards low or no carbon means of supplying energy. Unavoidably, human kind will in due course have to meet its energy needs by harnessing the power of the sun, or the gravitational pull of the moon, or the turbulence of the weather, or the heat in the earth or the awesome energy locked into every atom in the microsecond that the universe was first created.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08052171000137"></a>In the foreseeable future, however, it is hard to imagine anything other than our all remaining hungry for energy. The Minister gave some chilling statistics. We can be far more energy efficient, but the notion that we will be able massively to reduce our energy needs appears to me fanciful and at odds with all the evidence. We will not want to stop seeing at night, or to stop being warm in winter, or to stop travelling for business or pleasure. It is likely, however, that the cost of producing energy from non-carbon sources will be high, that the price of energy will rise substantially and that its use will become ever more of a luxury.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08052171000138"></a>Britain cannot be proud of its progress on energy issues, not just over the past decade but over the past few decades compared to other leading countries. We are laggards in nuclear power, having allowed our capacity to diminish and not to grow. We are near to the bottom of the hierarchy of nations embracing renewables. As a result, in the short term we have no choice but to burn even more of the world&#146;s finite and diminishing stocks of hydrocarbons to supply Britain&#146;s future energy needs. At least in the medium term, we will remain net importers of energy, with weak hedging of national risk against the incalculable vicissitudes of a troubled world. As the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, reminded us, we are far too exposed, and we have not managed our energy security risk prudently. This Bill is a welcome step, but it is a small step on the way to a position of which we can be more proud. I suspect&#151;this note has already been struck by other noble Lords&#151;that we will need to return to these issues again and again in the coming years before we attain a steady equilibrium.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08052171000139"></a>We shall have to establish that the Government&#146;s framework for nuclear offers sufficient incentives for resurrection and for growth. Nuclear brings attendant risks, as we all know, which are significant and which must be managed; but nuclear must none the less be a major source in the future of our and the world&#146;s energy needs. The energy market untrammelled would just produce black smoke. If we want an energy policy that meets our environmental and security objectives, self-evidently Governments have to intervene, and we shall have to pay more for our energy. Subsidy is hard-wired into the system. In nuclear, we have to hope that the Government&#146;s hands-off policy in passing almost all the risk to the private sector will work and that it will lead to a substantial growth in nuclear power. If it does not, we shall have to think again quickly and consider whether the Government need to shoulder more of the risk, particularly the risk of future Governments adding to the cost of owning a nuclear plant.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1483"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1483</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80521-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08052171000140"></a>As for renewables, it is very hard&#151;indeed, for me, it is impossible&#151;to see how Britain can meet Europe&#146;s targets and our own, or even come close to them. That should concern us, because those targets are not now plucked from the air but are rooted in the science. There are, beyond the Government&#146;s reach, important reasons why our progress in meeting our renewable energy targets will be slow. Some of the renewable technologies&#151;for example, offshore wind or biomass&#151;are still not robust, though I am sure that they will soon become so. As the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, reminded us, some of the technologies that are tried and tested are experiencing worldwide demand, so there are now significant supply bottlenecks.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08052171000141"></a>There are many other impediments in the way of reaching our renewable targets that the Government can affect. First, our planning regime is very costly for renewable energy suppliers, and it generally moves at a snail&#146;s pace. We have to hope that the proposed new planning legislation will enable a more timely and cost-effective means of reconciling competing global, national and local objectives.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08052171000142"></a>Secondly, agencies of government, particularly the MoD, as well as other public agencies, need to curb their understandable instinct to object, except on the most material of grounds. Thirdly, our onshore grid was designed for a different power era, and we need to inject some urgency into ensuring access for highly dispersed renewable energy providers.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08052171000143"></a>Fourthly, the Government must be wholly reliable in setting down and keeping to the economic framework that they set if investor confidence is to be maintained in this sector. If the April 2009 date for the new renewable regime were to slip, for instance, it would wholly undermine many investment projects already under way, undertaken on the reasonable assumption that it would not.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08052171000144"></a>Fifthly, compared with best practice in other countries, our incentives for renewable heat do not match those for renewable power. As a result, an enormous amount of heat from our power stations and large plants escapes into space, when, as others have already suggested, it could be used to supply neighbourhood heating systems. Sixthly, again unlike some other countries, we lack a system of feed-in tariffs for microgenerators of renewable power.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08052171000145"></a>The Bill, I am sorry to say, addresses only some of those issues. Given the disproportionately high burden overall that EU renewable energy targets will place on renewable electricity generation in the UK, and given the gulf between where we need to be and where we are, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the Government will need to revisit their renewable energy policy even before the ink is dry on the Bill.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08052171000146"></a>Finally, renewables policy in the next phase may need to focus even more on the natural advantages enjoyed by the British Isles. As the main bulwark against the fierce North Atlantic, a high proportion of Europe's wind blows across our shores. For the same reason, we are buffeted by power for ocean waves. With a huge and complex island coastline, we have access unparalleled in Europe to the push and pull of tidal forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08052171000147"></a>We have a national interest, therefore, in ensuring&#151;if it can be done&#151;that economic technologies for harnessing those energy sources are developed as quickly as possible. As we all understand, however, progress on the national front is not a sufficient condition of real progress on climate change. We will resolve the issue of burgeoning carbon emissions across the planet only if we act globally. That means above all that the EU, the US and other rapidly developing countries must come together to put a global and ever-reducing cap on carbon and institute a regime of carbon pricing and trading. As a nation, we must do all we can to foster that coming together, but we will have the moral authority&#151;let alone a moral compass&#151;to lead that debate if we put our own house in order first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08052171000150"></a>The greatest security challenge for the 21st century will be the competition for natural resources, primarily water, food and energy. Global warming, population growth and increased competition for resources from elephant emerging economies make that inevitable.

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08052171000151"></a>There is nothing new about resource nationalism and the desire of producing nations to keep control of the lion&#146;s share of the profits from their oil, gas and other natural commodities. We have been here before as recently as the oil spike of the 1970s. As the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, pointed out, with or will reaching a record $129 a barrel and with future prices touching $140 a barrel at least until 2016, the era of cheap energy seems well and truly over for the foreseeable future, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Birt. There is, however, no real evidence that we have reached peak oil, but the global level of competition for dwindling resources and ever more investment-intensive extractive processes in often-hostile political and geological territory is increasing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08052171000153"></a>It is relatively uncontroversial to say that the UK&#146;s energy profile is going through a transition.

I am proud to have been involved in drawing up the 2007 Energy White Paper that looked to address many of the energy issues before noble Lords today.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08052171000156"></a>Before turning to the Bill, it is worth dwelling on the wider energy context. As I have mentioned, large portions of the world&#146;s proven hydrocarbons are located in politically unstable or unpredictable environments. Some 80 per cent of oil and gas resources are controlled by national Governments. Security of supply is an issue, and we need to ensure that we do not become dependent on any one country or any one form of energy.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08052171000157"></a>As your Lordships have already heard, the EU imports about a quarter of its gas from Russia alone. The UK will import around 80 per cent of its gas supplies by 2020. Yet the greatest threat to security of supply remains the slow-down in energy investment and production in Russia and the former Soviet Union.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08052171000158"></a>The North Sea is a maturing asset, but there is still much to play for. With some 16 billion to 25 billion barrels of oil remaining from the UK continental shelf, we should not squander the opportunities that they afford us.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08052171000159"></a>The Government must look for greater co-operation with the energy industry and look to provide adequate investment, incentives and an effective decommissioning regime. The Bill takes the right steps in providing the framework for storage and exploitation capabilities. We must also to look to cultivate other indigenous energy sources such as clean coal, which was mentioned earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. Those should be developed alongside government support for pioneering a wide range of carbon capture and storage technology, which the Bill provides, through the licensing of offshore carbon dioxide storage.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08052171000160"></a>The Bill takes a number of sensible steps. It provides a regulatory framework for our evolving energy infrastructure; it provides for new technologies such as carbon capture and storage and for smart meters; it makes licensing provisions for decommissioning energy installations and provides for offshore electricity transmission. Importantly, it creates the conditions for investment in offshore gas storage. In today&#146;s volatile gas market, it makes a lot of sense to increase the UK&#146;s gas storage capacity. However, the Government must have regard to the need to develop long-term energy supply contracts, as witnessed on the Continent, if they want to ensure security of supply and avoid the level of volatility in energy prices that we are seeing today. European energy liberalisation will not suffice.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08052171000161"></a>The Bill tightens the regulations for nuclear waste management for the next generation of nuclear power stations. The Government&#146;s nuclear waste management proposals are welcome, not only in themselves but also in addressing public concerns about nuclear waste. Nevertheless, the Government should accelerate the programme of securing the UK&#146;s legacy nuclear waste and boost the number of nuclear inspectors.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08052171000162"></a>As already noted by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, the UK will lose a third of its generating capacity during the next 20 years as low-carbon  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1486"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1486</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>directives kick in and existing nuclear power stations are closed. Nuclear currently accounts for 18 per cent of our generating capacity. Most of our existing stations are due for retirement within the next 15 years, as my noble friend the Minister indicated. Current estimates project a need for between 30 and 35 gigawatts of new-generation capacity during the next 20 years.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08052171000163"></a>If we are committed to making any new capacity low carbon and wish to avoid a new dash for gas, a new generation of nuclear power stations must be brought online. This would complement the developing renewable sector alongside greatly improved energy efficiency. I still remain to be convinced that as much is being done in the latter sphere as necessary to meet the Government&#146;s ambitious targets.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08052171000164"></a>The Government&#146;s provisions for smart meters in the Bill are to be welcomed, not least for ending the inequities from pre-payment customers. I know the Government are consulting further with a view to roll out for medium businesses by early 2009. I hope we will hear a similar announcement on rollout to small businesses and domestic consumers later this year, along with a commitment to a definitive timetable.</p>

<a name="80521-0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08052171000165"></a>On biofuels, last year world wheat prices rose 77 per cent and rice 16 per cent. With Indian and Chinese appetites growing, EU and US biofuel programmes are taking cereal and farmland out of the food supply chain and diverting resources into meeting biofuels targets instead. As a result, we are seeing food riots across the developing world and steep increases in food prices and inflationary pressure at home. I know that the Government share these concerns and I hope that they will put pressure on the EU either to revise its 2020 10 per cent biofuels target and/or look to alternatives.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08052171000166"></a>We also need a frank discussion on renewable energy targets, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Birt. Renewable energy currently accounts for 2 per cent of the UK generating capacity. There have been great strides in this area. Yet the 20 per cent target by 2020, agreed under the German presidency, looks quite frankly unrealisable, even with a reduced target of 15 per cent for the UK. A seven or eight times increase in renewable energy in the UK between now and 2020 is frankly not achievable. The Government need to take this on board and come up with a workable solution, one based on more than just pure aspiration. Buying carbon credits abroad will be a costly cop-out. They should reconsider their opposition to feed-in tariffs. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, on this matter.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08052171000167"></a>From the excellent speeches we have already heard and those that will surely come later, a picture will emerge. We do not want to be looking over our shoulder in 20 years&#146; time unsure of our energy supplies. Equally, we do not want the next generation of decision makers to blame our current leaders for failing to reduce our carbon footprint. We have a clear choice: develop a diverse energy portfolio drawn from clean, affordable and low-carbon energy sources, or sleepwalk into an energy crunch. It will be with us soon enough if we fail to act. For some countries such as South Africa, energy shortages and

This will all play out against the backdrop of potentially devastating climate change.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08052171000168"></a>There is a fashionable phrase doing the rounds in Europe at the moment: act today to save tomorrow. From the Bill before us today and the broader legislative package that the Government have proposed, we are witnessing a significant gear-change that tries to achieve just that. The Government do not yet have all the answers but taken together this Bill sows the seeds for a low carbon economy while working to ensure security of supply. For that, Her Majesty&#146;s Government should be commended.</p>

<a name="08052171000169"></a><a name="80521-0005.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80521-0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08052171000326"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, most speakers hitherto have ranged a little wider than the provisions of the Bill&#151;quite properly because, as everyone has said, the Bill deals only with some of the matters which we need as a country to address. The Bill as it stands is a mixed bag and so will be my speech. I am following other noble Lords in that. The measures outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, in Parts 1 to 4 of the Bill, about gas and CO2 storage, renewable obligation certificates and decommissioning are all much as expected. All are urgently necessary and essential for the development of these sources of energy.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08052171000170"></a>Before I turn to the Bill&#151;there are some provisions that I particularly want to look at&#151;I shall talk about what I have called the new kid on the block. When, last year, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority awarded a substantial decommissioning contract to a company called Energy Solutions, of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the United States, I am sure I was not the only one to be taken by surprise. Indeed, I tabled a Question, which I showed last week to the managing director of that company, and he laughed.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08052171000171"></a>Since then, I have made it my business to learn about the company. I am quite satisfied that its presence in the UK and its remarkable record, particularly on decommissioning and dealing with waste, is enormously important and gives rise to two issues of fundamental importance to our immediate energy policy.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08052171000172"></a>First, as recently as the nuclear White Paper last January, there seemed to be a widespread assumption that we were talking about replacing our decommissioned nuclear stations and that we might not therefore be planning for more than about four or five new nuclear reactors. Further, because of the need to avoid what I call the AGR mistakes&#151;seven different designs for seven different stations&#151;there was a widespread view that we needed to go for one design and replicate it to get all the benefits of scale. EDF&#151;lectricit&#233; de France&#151;and British Energy, perhaps in partnership with E.ON of Germany, have been seen as strong contenders for this. Their project would be based on the EPR reactor designed by Areva.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08052171000173"></a>Since then, however, we have had a very important speech by John Hutton, the Secretary of State, on 26 March. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08052171000227"></a>&#147;I don&#146;t want to see just a like for like replacement of nuclear capacity in the UK ... But energy security and climate change should provide the push for a significant expansion of nuclear in the UK in the coming decades&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1488"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1488</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08052171000220"></a>He went on to offer the promise that this could lead to 100,000 new skilled jobs. Many people have interpreted this, quite rightly, that this does not mean only four or five new nuclear power stations; it means, if anything, eight, 10 or possibly 12. This is why the arrival of Energy Solutions is now very important. It has publicly announced its intention&#151;and that of its partners, RWE Power International of Germany, and Westinghouse, which we still regard as American, although it is Japanese-owned&#151;to enter the market with a series of AP1000 reactors, which is the Westinghouse design. They may use not British Energy sites but sites that are being cleared by the NDA. They have mentioned Wylfa in Anglesey, Hinkley Point and even possibly Bradwell. There may be others.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08052171000174"></a>If there had been only one competitor in the UK market, I would have envisaged every prospect of a competition investigation, perhaps by the OFT, by the EU, or both. Ofgem will be able to offer initial advice, but it has told me that such a process could not take less than six to nine months. We cannot afford that delay. Now with the prospect of two entrants into the market, however, there will be competition. Although we do not expect Ministers to comment at all on the present negotiations, which are clearly highly market-sensitive, can they say whether having two entrants, with different partners with different reactor designs and based on different sites, obviates the need for any competition investigation? That is the first point.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08052171000175"></a>My second point about Energy Solutions relates to the contribution that it could make to managing our waste. I am told that it has been having detailed discussions with government departments, the NDA, the Environment Agency and the other regulators&#151;the HSE and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate&#151;which hold out a real possibility of a step change in the plans which have hitherto been projected by Ministers, as approved by CoRWM, for dealing with our waste. Energy Solutions has told me that, while spent fuel and the waste from fuel reprocessing must go into a deep repository in this country, much of the so-called intermediate waste does not need to be managed in that way but can be either recycled for use in new nuclear build or transported to Energy Solutions&#146; own disposal facility, called Clive, in the Utah desert. I have no means of ascertaining this, but it claims that this could lead to substantially lower costs with a significantly smaller repository for new-build waste and so save us a great deal of money.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08052171000176"></a>I should like to ask the Minister a detailed question on the Bill. Of course we cannot decide; we have not even got the White Paper yet on waste. But Clause 45 in Chapter 1 of Part 3 of the Bill&#151;this is the chapter which includes the funding of decommissioning and waste that many noble Lords have talked about&#151;allows for the modification of an approved programme for funding and disposal. If the regulators approve a significantly less costly process of decommissioning and waste disposal, which is the offer held out by this company, will that clause allow the Government to modify an existing approval so as to allow the companies to reduce significantly the amount of money that they have to set aside for funding the obligation? I totally

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08052171000177"></a>I turn to the other end of the energy scale&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="08052171000178"></a><a name="80521-0005.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80521-0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08052171000327"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> My Lords, I have been following the noble Lord&#146;s novel argument with some interest. My only concern is that the proposal that he is referring to will have to be the subject of a fairly rigorous competitive process, organised by the NDA at least, following on from what the NDA is presently doing. Is the noble Lord not putting too much emphasis on one company&#146;s option which is to be the subject of very rigorous competitive analysis and adversarial attacks by other companies as well? It seems that he is embracing the first one that comes along.</p>

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="08052171000179"></a><a name="80521-0005.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80521-0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08052171000328"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord makes a very sound point, but as I think we will see when we get the White Paper on waste, which we have been promised before the end of this month, it is a very long-term programme. It will be a long time before we are able to embark one way or the other on a waste programme. Of course these things will need to be rigorously examined by the competition authorities, if that is relevant, and certainly by all the regulators and by the Government. I would not expect anything less. All I am saying is that on the information which I have, there seems to be something here of which the Government should take careful note. I know they are being apprised of this because I have been told that.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08052171000180"></a>Noble Lords will not be surprised by my next point if they remember the debates we had in January on the arrangements for reducing emissions from domestic properties&#151;the so-called CERT programme. In our debates on that, one of the key provisions was for the energy companies, in seeking to reduce the emissions from domestic properties, to provide 40 per cent of their savings from the target group, which includes everyone on benefits, tax credits, housing benefit and so on, and, rather surprisingly, pensioners; and I declared an interest. Those present in the House when we debated that order will know that I felt that it was entirely wrong that the companies could not be told who was in the target audience. When asked who the people are and where the households are, the answer given was that the information is protected by data protection.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08052171000181"></a>At the end of April, a very important fuel poverty summit discussed many issues, including not only the social tariffs mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, but also the CERT programme and prepayment meters. There was clear recognition that there has to be a system for identifying the households. I have received a letter from Sir John Mogg, chairman of Ofgem, who, shortly, will join this House, which is admirable. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08052171000228"></a>&#147;Our remit and the focus of the Summit was on how to target and make more productive the help available by suppliers to the vulnerable and fuel poor&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052171000221"></a>I warmly welcome that. Recently, when I asked the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, when that would be, he said that it would be very soon. I hope  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1490"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1490</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the noble Lord, Lord Jones, will be able to give me a more precise answer. I shall certainly return to this matter in Committee.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08052171000182"></a>An issue which appears to be in dispute between members of the Government is whether this will require further legislation&#151;for instance, an amendment of the Data Protection Act. If further legislation is needed, why cannot that be done in this Bill? Do we have to wait until the next Session of Parliament before we can have a Bill to deal with that? I really would like an answer to that.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08052171000183"></a>Transparency is another issue that I have pursued on every Bill we have had on energy. Why cannot the extra costs imposed by climate change legislation be shown on customers&#146; bills so they can know what that is? Again, I am told by Ofgem that a typical domestic customer has within his annual bill &#163;31 a year for the emissions trading scheme; &#163;38 a year for the CERT programme; and &#163;10 a year for the renewables obligation, which of course falls on the customer and not on the Government. Together, that amounts to &#163;79 a year, which goes straight on the customers&#146; bills, including those of the fuel poor. Is not the first step to make that clear, so that people know what they are paying for all that? I should warn the noble Lord that I shall pursue that too in Committee.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08052171000184"></a>I would say more about the Ofgem remit but have run out of time and will have to come back to that in Committee. It has been approached the wrong way around. The right way would be to impose clear statutory duties on the suppliers and then to get that properly regulated.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08052171000185"></a>Finally, much has been said about the price of carbon as being essential for new investment, which, again, I have referred to on previous occasions. Last week, a paragraph in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08052171000229"></a>&#147;Luckily for Euro utilities, the British government is mulling an energy bill that would set a minimum price for carbon&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052171000222"></a>It is not in this Bill. Can the Minister tell us whether the Government are mulling the possibility of putting a floor price under carbon? I am sure that the industry would be very interested to know the answer to that, and so would I.</p>

A key plank of government policy for many years now has been to look for market-driven solutions and to seek to direct the market by various degrees of regulation, but keeping these to a necessary minimum. Certain aspects of commercial energy projects can be developed only in direct response to government policy, of course, and that takes us to the heart of this Bill: its provisions to encourage CCS initiatives, an expanding range of renewable technologies and a renewed investment in nuclear energy. I wish to make brief comments on each of those areas and then move on to an issue that was discussed in some detail in the White Paper but which has not featured in the current Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08052171000187"></a>One&#146;s view of CCS will be heavily determined by the view that is taken of global warming and, more specifically, the separate question of the contribution that rising CO2 levels are making to global warming. In previous debates in your Lordships&#146; House the scientifically best-qualified noble Lords among us, including the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, who is to speak next, have argued that the case is essentially proven, and the Government seem to have accepted that. In a previous incarnation I was a scientist, and from the very modest foothills of my own scientific judgment&#151;at the end of the day we all have to exercise a judgment that is amateurish in character&#151;I regard the question as in some respects still open.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08052171000188"></a>There does seem to be a greater consensus among scientists from other disciplines than among climate scientists themselves that CO2 levels are the key determinant of rising temperatures. But climate science is a notoriously imprecise and poorly understood area of science. That is because the phenomena under investigation are so large: the whole of the earth&#146;s surface, the whole of the earth&#146;s atmosphere, and the sun itself. That makes precision difficult to achieve. The history of science is littered with scientific consensuses that have come to be overturned one way or another.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08052171000189"></a>The fact that there has been a degree&#151;somewhat less than one degree&#151;of global warming over the past century does seem to be fairly clearly established. Its correlation with CO2 emissions is less so in my view, although there may be&#151;and we should probably say, &#147;probably is&#148;&#151;a link. But it is still, I think, in the realms of probability. That means that it is right to test out CCS technology on a commercial scale. This will be a hugely expensive operation. As we heard at Question Time, the cost simply of a demonstration site, much smaller than a commercial power station, will be &#163;1 billion. That is for only one out of a range of possible technologies which could be put into place.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08052171000190"></a>Given the rate at which India and China and other countries are building coal-fired power stations, more than one a week, without CCS, we need to be sure that the cost of fitting CCS is going to be realistic in the future and will not be disproportionate. One way or another it seems likely that global warming will continue come what may and for whatever reason. There have been trends over the centuries of the coming and going of global temperatures. There is a movement up and that global warming is going to produce consequences, particularly among some of the poorer in the world. Alongside the proper attention to CCS technology, there needs to be an equal attention to alleviating the consequences by flood defences and so forth. We need a mixed economy in these two areas; otherwise we could end up having very expensive CCS technology, which is something like tilting at the windmills of CO2 increases. Be that as it may; history will tell.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08052171000191"></a>Turning briefly to renewable technologies, I welcome the changes to the renewable obligations scheme which are envisaged. It does all seem late in the day as we chase the target of 10 per cent of our energy generation by 2010 and 20 per cent by 2020. It would be good to hear from the Minister whether the 20 per cent target by 2020 is still regarded as realistic.  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1492"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1492</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Leaving things mainly to the market has so far discouraged investment in what, at least in the short term, are more expensive forms of electricity generation. The renewables obligation scheme represents a major tweaking of the market to encourage the greater use of renewable sources of electricity. It is arguable that more direct and longer term planning in this area should have been in place years ago.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08052171000192"></a>Picking up on noble Lords&#146; earlier comments on the present arrangements, it seems to me that the renewables obligation process is really targeted at large-scale suppliers of energy. I think that we need a mixed economy of taking that approach while encouraging microgeneration, which needs a feed-in tariff to complement it. Encouraging microgeneration would help to change the culture in this country, which is still shifting towards a properly responsible approach to energy conservation. So there is a case for feed-in tariffs, particularly in relation to small-scale projects. Some churches with photovoltaic and other schemes are finding it difficult to set up connections to the grid for the contribution they may make.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08052171000193"></a>There is also the question of whether the encouragement of energy crops, as envisaged in the White Paper, is now slightly out of date. There is quite a bias in the proposed differential renewable obligations tariffs towards encouraging energy crops, but given the recent changes in the area of food production and the rise in food prices, I wonder whether that remains the wisest course.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08052171000194"></a>Turning to nuclear energy, I welcome the prospect of a new generation of nuclear power stations. The Bill seeks to set up a framework within which the Government can regulate new nuclear stations, and particularly in relation to the storage of radioactive waste. As I understand it, a company which owns and operates a nuclear power station will need to set aside money to pay for the storage of waste and the eventual cost of decommissioning the station and the site. In his opening speech the Minister said that operators would meet the full costs, but given that the full costs of storage potentially stretch over thousands of years and not just over the lifetime of the nuclear plant, it would be helpful to have some confirmation of what the term &#147;full costs&#148; means. Does it extend to the full costs incurred over the long period of storage that is envisaged?</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08052171000195"></a>My own view is that the present arrangements may end up slightly discouraging investment in nuclear energy, which would be regrettable. Because of the more or less equally beneficial carbon footprints of both renewable technologies and nuclear, I would prefer to have a slightly more level playing field for the two areas. We await the detailed proposals for the permanent underground storage of nuclear waste. It is difficult to see how these costs can be assessed with any confidence until we know about the actual plans&#151;a point also made by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and others. Can the Minister give us any idea of when he expects a permanent underground site to become operational? Given the subsidy which is provided for renewable generation, it would be a pity  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1493"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1493</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>if delays in agreeing arrangements for storage were to prevent companies entering the market again, not least because if we allow the nuclear component in our electricity generation capacity to fall out of the mix, that will more than represent the whole contribution, prospectively, of renewable energy until 2020. It really is a big factor in the overall balance.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08052171000196"></a>The issue which I feel should have been addressed in the Bill is that of fuel poverty. The White Paper, on page 77, gives estimates of households in fuel poverty, and the modelling was based on fuel prices in 2006. Could the Minister provide updated projections in the light of recent and projected rises in the price of oil, gas and electricity? The table showed a prospect of 3 million households in fuel poverty by 2015 on the least optimistic assumptions which were in place in 2006. How do those least optimistic projections in 2006 relate to the reality of intervening price rises for oil, gas and electricity? Fuel poverty, I suspect, will become a very significant factor in the coming years.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08052171000197"></a>The White Paper sets out the schemes which the Government have in place to assist households in countering fuel poverty, including targeted improvements in insulation and energy efficiency. Although the White Paper sets out some options that require energy companies to have adequate programmes to support their most vulnerable customers, I feel that the problem will be sufficiently serious to suggest that a more formal regulatory environment should be provided in this area to address the needs of those who are most vulnerable. It has always seemed odd that the winter fuel payment is made indiscriminately to everybody, however wealthy or poor they are. There is much more to be done in targeting those who are in greatest fuel poverty.</p>

<a name="80521-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08052171000198"></a>Finally, I offer a general comment on the direction of government energy policy and, to a degree, on the absence of overall policies in recent years. One of the difficulties is that Governments have an immediate electoral horizon of five years. Within that time they are subjected to ever more intrusive and critical investigation by other political parties, the media and external commentators. That can result in a tendency to take short-term decisions and to put off unpopular ones. That has affected both the development of renewable energy in this country and the question of replacing our nuclear capacity. Energy policy needs a horizon of at least 50 years, not five. The Bill illustrates grappling with delays in developing long-term strategies. For example, the &#147;dash for gas&#148; was essentially a short-term provision, which future generations may look back on to see our generation as burning a valuable national resource in a short time, meeting a short-term Kyoto obligation but ending up by importing&#151;probably&#151;at least 80 per cent of our gas by 2020. Other examples of the tendency to look at implications in the shorter term could be given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08052171000199"></a>In relation to climate change, we have the climate change committee, which is deliberately tasked with looking at the longer-term horizons and taking the issue at least partly out of the immediate political agenda. Whether Ofgem can fulfil that remit, if it is given to it, I am not sure, but the need for some

In its own way, this Bill represents a need for that, as did the rather acerbic comments of Allan Asher, chief executive of Energywatch, before the Commons committee yesterday.</p>

I am also a director of two renewable energy companies: blue-ng and Falck Renewables. This Bill is important but complicated. Its complexity arises not only from the regulatory and technical matters with which it deals, but from the way it intertwines with the two other pieces of legislation to which reference has been made several times already, namely the Climate Change Bill and the Planning Bill. The Climate Change Bill, which we have already considered and is now with the other place, aims to make a substantial reduction in this country&#146;s greenhouse gas emissions. However, it will be impossible to implement these changes fully without the provisions in the other Bills. We have a three-legged stool which will fall over if one of the three legs is weak or missing.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08052171000201"></a>I shall turn to some of the detailed provisions of the Bill later, but I begin by addressing what seems to be a fatal weakness in the stool as a whole, as we have it today. It is, however, a weakness that can be addressed, at least in part, within the Bill before us. As has been pointed out by the Minister, the 2007 energy White Paper established the Government&#146;s high-level energy policy. The present Bill deals with a range of detailed mechanisms by which individual projects may be supported and regulated. What we do not have&#151;I think the right reverend Prelate made this point&#151;is a large-scale and accepted vision of the infrastructure that should link the two. I shall argue that, without that vision and without certain other changes, we shall have serious difficulty in developing the low-carbon economy that we seek to achieve.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08052171000202"></a>Although a range of technologies will contribute to the new energy mix to meet the proposed 2020 target of 15 per cent of our energy coming from renewables, it is inevitable that within the electricity generation sector the greatest contribution will come from wind. Meeting that obligation will involve adding around 30 gigawatts of wind generating capacity to the distribution grid. That may be compared with the existing generating capacity of around 90 gigawatts, some of which is due to be retired as the wind capacity is brought in. That is a minimum addition, and there are several scenarios under which more wind could be needed.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08052171000203"></a>The new windmills will be built, pretty obviously, in places with the best wind. To a first approximation, that is in the north-west and around the coasts of the UK. However, the greatest demands for electricity are in the Midlands and the south. That means that there will have to be changes in the electricity distribution system that are massive in scale and cost. When discussing electricity supply, we commonly concentrate on the cost of the generation technology without realising that the investment in the grid is of the same order as  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1495"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1495</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that in the generating system. Even though demand may not change, the new system will have to be significantly larger than what we have at present. Massive interconnectors will be needed between north and south and from the windy coastal areas to the inland. This will be the largest change in electricity transmission since the Second World War, and arguably the largest change ever within the UK. Transmission systems typically have a life of 40 years, so we are speaking of system that will be with us until around 2050.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08052171000204"></a>Not only will the grid changes involve construction on a very large scale but there will be technological challenges as well. The grid will need to be intelligent enough to deal with wind intermittency. At a local level, as local generation assumes a greater role, the distribution networks will have to be able to deal with connections at different scales that sometimes connect demand and at other times provide supply. Therefore, the question is: how is this major infrastructural change to be planned and implemented? At present we do not seem to have the proper machinery for doing that, and what machinery we have is encumbered in so many ways that it cannot function effectively.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08052171000205"></a>It is instructive to consider how the machinery operates in connection with a proposed new power generation development today. Such a proposal has to receive sanction from four independent and unconnected bodies: the planning authority for the generating facility, whether it is a power station, a wind farm or whatever; the planning authority for the transmission line that connects to the grid; the national grid itself that manages all the connections and has to give its consent; and Ofgem, the body that has to give approval to any proposal to spend money on infrastructure, bearing in mind that the costs will ultimately be borne by consumers. Those four bodies have to give their approval. None of them has within its remit the achievement of the national objectives on climate change or renewable energy. All have the power either to veto projects or to seriously delay them, and to do so in ways and for reasons that do not take into account the national interest. In one sense they cannot be blamed for that, because the national interest has not been clearly defined.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08052171000206"></a>The Planning Bill should go some considerable way to dealing with the first two problems by allowing the same application to cover both electricity generation and its connection to the grid. Furthermore, by establishing an infrastructure planning commission there will be a means of evaluating particular projects in the light of the national interest. However, one should not be misled by the name of the proposed planning commission. It does not plan; it simply assesses whether any particular proposal is consistent with something known as a national policy statement. The Planning Bill discusses how such a policy statement should be established only after a process of lengthy consultation and how this statement is intended to be a definitive statement of national interest.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08052171000207"></a>The first requirement is that we should have a national planning statement for electricity generation and distribution. Such a statement may already exist, but if it does I have not been able to find it. In the  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1496"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1496</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>absence of such a statement we cannot make sensible progress on key elements of the infrastructure that is needed to make all the things we have been talking about today work. This will be required by the Planning Bill, and there seems to be no reason at all why BERR should not immediately begin consultation on such a plan. I should be grateful if the Minister could give the House an assurance that this progress will begin forthwith if it has not already done so, and provide the House with a timetable for its completion. That statement should provide the framework against which all new developments can be assessed.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08052171000208"></a>It is all very well to have a framework, but if the expenditure to implement it is not authorised it will simply remain a paper framework. Nothing will happen. This is where it is important to examine the role of Ofgem, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. This body was established in the 1990s with a view to ensuring that vigorous competition in the energy market was used to drive down consumer prices. It has to approve expenditure and price changes proposed by bodies involved in the generation and distribution of gas and electricity. The Ofgem remit has been modified to some extent in subsequent years, and today the office has such a mind-boggling array of secondary objectives to be borne in mind when making its decisions that one cannot but have some sympathy for it. In practice, Ofgem struggles to approve expenditure that cannot be demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt to have a clear, short-term and low-risk justification.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08052171000209"></a>My conclusion, and that of many others, is that although the remit of Ofgem was appropriate for the time that it was established, it is no longer appropriate today. If it is to retain its existing authority over expenditure on energy infrastructure, that authority must be exercised in a different framework. It is essential that the Bill should be amended to do that. One possibility is to do so along the lines of an amendment offered in the other place by Dr Desmond Turner but not called or debated. I will not detain the House with the details of the amendment but its essence is captured in the following brief extract:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08052171000230"></a>&#147;The principal objective of the Secretary of State and Gas and Electricity Markets Authority&#148;&#151;</p>

<ul><a name="08052171000233"></a>&#147;in carrying out their respective functions ... is to deliver a secure and sustainable energy system operating within greenhouse gas emission limits notified by the Secretary of State&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08052171000224"></a>and so on. I believe that there is considerable support, both inside and outside the House, for an amendment along those lines.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08052171000210"></a>Having devoted a considerable amount of time to what is not in the Bill, perhaps I may now turn more briefly to provisions that are there. I think that much of the Bill is devoted to what I would call sensible housekeeping, although we shall no doubt have discussions over some of the details.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08052171000211"></a>I wish to draw attention to only two sections at this stage. The first relates to the scheme for renewable obligation certificates&#151;the ROCs&#151;which have already been discussed. The proposed banding is to be welcomed. It is clear that the support needed by different renewable technologies is different and the intention to double  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1497"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1497</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>certificate allocation for electricity generated by emerging renewable technologies is to be welcomed. However, we have to recognise that emerging technologies are slow to come to market and no one will invest in an emerging technology today unless they are confident that it will be possible to deploy it on an economic scale before 2015, which is when the present scheme ends and when the Government hope that their current renewables target will be reached. If this support for emerging technologies is to have any realistic hope of bringing new modes of generation to the market, the Government will need to extend the time horizon for their introduction to 2020 at least, otherwise there simply will not be time.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08052171000212"></a>The Government probably need to extend the timescale for another reason. Many are sceptical that it will be physically possible to build the planned new wind capacity by 2015 to reach the 15 per cent renewables target. There will be no investment beyond 2015 unless the scheme is extended. I suppose that there is a consistency argument for retaining the ROC system for the future, but it is an excessively complicated and arcane system. Once the principle of banding is accepted, it is not a million miles from feed-in tariffs which are used in most other places and are a great deal simpler.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08052171000213"></a>The second part of the Bill to which I wish to draw attention is that relating to carbon capture and storage. It is certain that, whether we like it or not, we shall be obliged, as various noble Lords have pointed out, to go on using fossil fuels for power generation for a number of decades. Because coal is very different from oil and gas in its geographic distribution and because traditionally it is less expensive, it is likely that it will play an increasingly large role worldwide in electricity generation, particularly in India and China. The problem is that coal is a very CO2-rich energy source. It produces about double the amount of CO2 per unit of electricity produced as does gas. There is a vital need to develop technologies that can separate CO2 and other greenhouse gases at power stations and immobilise them, probably in suitable geological features underground. It is in our interests that we in the West should develop these technologies as quickly as possible so that they can be implemented in places where they are urgently needed.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08052171000214"></a>As the price of carbon in the European trading scheme rises, in an ideal world it would be sufficient to meet the costs of capturing carbon at power stations. Unfortunately, the lead time for developing the technology is very long. If we wait for the carbon price to rise high enough to meet the costs, the opportunity for useful deployment is likely to be missed. The magnitude of the coal problem is so great that it is fair to say that although carbon capture and storage is not a complete answer to managing emissions, there can be no complete answer without it. I welcome the attention that the Government are paying to this important technology.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08052171000215"></a>In conclusion, I reiterate three points. The Energy Bill, the Planning Bill and the Climate Change Bill must dovetail seamlessly if they are to be effective. Perhaps the Minister would inform the House about the interdepartmental machinery that is in place to  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1498"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1498</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>achieve this. Secondly, it is urgent that we have a national planning statement on electricity generation and distribution so that the infrastructure planning commission and Ofgem have a clear statement of national interest when considering proposals put before them. Thirdly, it is essential that Ofgem&#146;s remit should be broadened so that it is able to take a wider and longer-term view of the expenditure that it can authorise. It must be in a position to approve major infrastructural investment.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08052171000216"></a>In all the documents I have seen, I get little sense of the urgency of our present situation. After all the consultative processes are over, development and heavy engineering take time, and time, my Lords, is not on our side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08052178000002"></a>It is hard to take issue with the contents of the Bill as set out by the Minister. However, in common with other noble Lords on all sides of the House, I will argue strongly for the inclusion of a number of new clauses which might go some way towards offering hope of an energy strategy that could honestly be described as &#147;fit for purpose&#148; for the complexities of the 21st century. As I see it, failure to make those arguments would be a serious dereliction of responsibility to both present and future generations.</p>

It is worth recalling that our present concept of regulation was developed as a means of heading off those who argued against the principle of privatisation on the grounds of consumer protection. Needless to say, regulation has been in a fairly constant process of evolution, as the individual sectors have evolved or, in some cases, even changed out of all recognition. However, regulation is still failing to keep up with the pace of change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08052178000004"></a>Some regulatory lag is perhaps inevitable. None the less, I am of the view that at the design stage&#151;where we are at the moment&#151;we must do everything in our power to ensure that there is the right combination of rigour and suppleness within our regulatory framework to anticipate the consequences of change and, most particularly, to protect and even enhance our control over the means of supply.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08052178000005"></a>As the Bill proceeds through your Lordships&#146; House, I will argue that, in the rapidly evolving energy sector, neither the remit nor the resources available to Ofgem have adapted with anything resembling the urgency and importance of the issues they are required to address. It is also vital that we continually balance our actions in the energy sector with the overwhelming importance of our commitment to environmental sustainability. To pretend that there is some kind of either/or option in consideration of these twin challenges is entirely fatuous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08052178000006"></a>Many in this House will remember the so-called &#147;family silver&#148; speech made by the Earl of Stockton in November 1985, in which he roundly criticised the economic policy of the then Government. Last weekend, on my computer, I listened to the whole of that remarkable 30-minute speech; it is available at the click of a mouse on the Tory Reform Group website. What seems to have been forgotten is that the true burden of Harold Macmillan&#146;s speech was a call to what he described as a &#147;third industrial age&#148;, the first having been driven by coal and steam, the second by oil and the third&#151;I paraphrase because there is no hard copy of the speech available and I am afraid my shorthand proved entirely inadequate&#151;was going to have to be a &#147;post-oil economy&#148;: an economy based on what we would today term renewable forms of energy.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08052178000007"></a>Here was a 91 year-old statesman setting out a vision for our country and our world remarkably similar to that in which we find ourselves living today. He talks about laying aside our divisions, as we did in wartime, because the urgency and gravity of what we are likely to face make them a luxury we can ill afford; the issues surrounding feed-in tariffs might well be a case in point. He correctly chides us for having squandered the God-given reprieve of North Sea oil instead of using it to build a national infrastructure robust enough to deal with the many uncertainties that undoubtedly lay ahead. And remember, my Lords, the greatest threat of all&#151;that associated with climate change&#151;had barely raised its head as being among the uncertainties that he was referring to.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08052178000008"></a>Shortly thereafter, a rising politician, possibly encouraged or even inspired by Harold Macmillan's prescience, was making a name for himself writing books and pamphlets addressing many of the same issues, and in much the same way. To quote briefly from <I>Where there is greed</I>, a book published in 1989, addressing the inadequacies of privatisation in general and of the regulatory system in particular:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08052178000052"></a>&#147;There has been no substantial extension of consumer rights, no new right of redress for consumers, no new right to refund or right of representation, no guidelines or legislation for improved service or improved consumer safeguards, and little in the way of improved safety standards ... Indeed there has been very little attempt to stand up for ordinary people against the vested interests of business and vast corporations&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052178000049"></a>Later, in a speech on 12 February 1991 in the House of Commons, the same politician said that the Government,</p>
<ul><a name="08052178000054"></a>&#147;would appease the vested interests of their friends in the private sector before advancing the public interest which it is their duty to uphold ... We will ensure that the public interest is upheld&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 12/2/91; col. 754.]</ul>
<p><a name="08052178000050"></a>That young politician was, of course, the present Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. In advancing my argument for the overriding importance of a public interest test in respect of mergers and acquisitions in the energy sector I am confident of having in my corner at least two Prime Ministers. I could easily add a third&#151;Winston Churchill&#151;but that is probably another speech for another day.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08052178000009"></a>Your Lordships will remember that, some five years ago, this House successfully added a clause to the Communications Act 2003, requiring almost  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1500"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1500</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>exactly that which I and others now seek from this Bill. Few would argue against the proposition that, important as a balanced communications ecology is to an informed and stable democracy, energy security trumps it on just about any national list of priorities. That being the case, why would we even countenance passing this Bill without the most rigorous safeguards in place regarding the long-term ownership of our means of supply? The family silver, along with the furniture in the salon and the Canalettos, may well have long since gone&#151;at a heavily discounted price, I might add&#151;but it is still within our political gift to ensure that we retain discretion over whose hands all of this is allowed to pass into.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08052178000010"></a>The Minister is an old and valued friend of mine and I made him aware some time ago that I intended to raise what is, for me, an absolutely fundamental issue. I have also apologised to him for the fact that I may not be here when he winds up; unfortunately, I have to give prizes at a function. But I am pretty sure that in his notes his excellent officials will have supplied him with any number of assurances that there is no cause for worry and that any attempted amendment could easily be seen off by reference to the powers already vested in the Secretary of State. In his earlier life, however, the Minister had a reputation as a shrewd solicitor and, like any good solicitor when dealing with a matter of this gravity, he would, I am sure, always advise a belt-and-braces approach. I hope that the House will insist upon exactly that: something far more robust than any set of vaguely framed assurances or limp over-reliance on existing competition law&#151;let alone a suggestion, in desperation, that we trust the goodwill of the marketplace.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08052178000011"></a>In this vital area of our national interest, as with the financial crisis currently assailing the banking industry, I see the situation as precisely analogous to that set out in an article on lessons learnt from the credit crunch in the current issue of the <I>Economist</I>. Our long-term energy security cannot become vulnerable to what it describes as,</p>
<ul><a name="08052178000055"></a>&#147;the collective misjudgment of risk; a zealous search for yield; and the failure of oversight&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052178000012"></a>That section of the article finishes by observing:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08052178000053"></a>&#147;Regulators lack the knowledge, the clout (and often the talent) to keep up with the ... next brilliant scheme&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80521-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08052178000013"></a>As I see it, our job as the Bill passes through this House is to ensure that Ofgem and its sponsoring department have the knowledge, clout and talent&#151;as well as all of the resources and powers that they need&#151;to head off what may well prove to be the most brilliant, or even the most devious, of schemes devised by the most powerful of those global energy interests which may already be casting a covetous eye at our marketplace and, indeed, our all too obvious vulnerabilities.</p>

<a name="80521-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08052178000014"></a>If I seem overly anxious, that is only because increasingly, in the past few years, I find myself agreeing with an observation repeated last month in the <I>Guardian</I> by Professor Ulrich Beck of the London School of Economics that, in his words, the,</p>
<ul><a name="08052178000056"></a>&#147;market has shrugged off any responsibility for democracy and society in the exclusive pursuit of short-term profit maximisation&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08052178000051"></a>That, in synthesis, is precisely what I believe Harold Macmillan was warning us of 25 years ago, and what Gordon Brown was telling us 20 years ago. If it were true then, I would argue that it is even more profoundly true today. That is certainly not a political or economic reality that we can afford to bow before, as if it were some kind of force of nature, at the very moment that we are being asked to give urgent consideration to this nation&#146;s energy needs for the early part of the 21st century, and well beyond that.</p>

When, in anticipation of a strike, the Grangemouth refinery was shut down recently, motorists in my part of the world realised for a brief moment the importance of security of fuel supply. People on the whole did not panic, but it took only three days of a bit of extra topping-up for there to be no diesel at all left in our town, while a number of petrol pumps were empty. The situation was relieved only by tankers arriving in the River Forth from elsewhere. We realised, momentarily, that security of supply is crucial to our lives and not to be taken for granted. The Bill is partly about that. It may be limited to only a few aspects of our energy future but it is nevertheless necessary and is, as most noble Lords have said, very urgently needed. Taken together with the Climate Change Bill and the Planning Bill, it is the outcome of the Government at long last beginning to make up their mind and give a lead on the many practical changes that have to be made in the energy field.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08052178000016"></a>Airy discussion of global warming and the charm of renewables is comparatively easy, as we have seen over a number of years, but the reality of what has to be done, and done in time and paid for, if we are to have security of supply in the United Kingdom, is much more difficult.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08052178000017"></a>Some noble Lords may remember that not long ago two French politicians from opposing parties came to speak to an all-party group here on how France set about persuading its electorate several decades ago that their future lay in building a large number of nuclear power stations. This was achieved by different political parties coming together in a campaign to educate the public about nuclear power generation and about why it was the best way. France has no oil of its own. The people had to be persuaded, and they were. There are now 59 nuclear power stations in France generating more than 78 per cent of its electricity. That was necessary leadership. Albeit there were few alternatives for France, needs must when the devil drives, as they say.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08052178000018"></a>It is only now, as the hitherto oil-rich UK begins to realise the implications of oil and gas dependency coming to us and the likely timetable ahead, that the Government are getting down to the detail. From now on leadership will be of the essence. Great urgency is needed in developing the matters dealt with in the Bill and those not in the Bill. I shall not reiterate them as we have heard about them several times. My main point is that leadership is now  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1502"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1502</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>needed not just at Westminster but in the devolved Administrations as well. What is happening in Scotland is not encouraging. Under the Scotland Act, energy is reserved to Westminster, which is sensible. Nowadays, Scotland&#146;s energy generation is an integral part of the United Kingdom system, so the Bill applies to Scotland, apart from chapter 1 of Part 3, to which I shall return in a moment.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08052178000019"></a>The problem is that the populist minority Scottish National Party Administration, in their desire always to please and never to ask for difficult decisions, are trying to lead in two opposite directions at once. They want a much stronger economy and a Scotland better able to stand on its own feet, which is wholly laudable, but they also want a nuclear-free Scotland and aim to use existing planning powers to block any proposal for a new nuclear power station in Scotland. Incidentally, those powers will not be affected by the Planning Bill now in another place as it does not extend to Scotland&#151;I suspect, disastrously. At the same time the Administration have just called in, and blocked, planning permission for a vast 181 turbine wind farm on the Isle of Lewis which would have made a major contribution to Glasgow&#146;s electricity and would have created 400 new jobs. However, there was a row about the effect on the island&#146;s ecology so Ministers blocked it.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08052178000020"></a>Other significant wind farm developments are alarmingly slow to materialise. Clyde wind farm, promoted by Airtricity, is five years behind schedule, the local planning authority having taken three years to refer it to a public inquiry in 2006. Also stuck in a public inquiry&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, referred to this kind of thing&#151;is a huge line of giant pylons cutting through the beautiful countryside between Beauly, near Inverness, and Denny, near Glasgow. It is essential for transmitting electricity from a large number of intended wind farms to the centres where most people live, but vast pylons conflict with tourism; and tourism is crucial where the line is planned, so there is a public inquiry. It seems that, across Scotland, projects spend two or three times as long in the planning system as in England, and in the end only 56 per cent are approved, compared to 65 per cent in England, 77 per cent in Wales and 93 per cent in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08052178000021"></a>To replace outdated electricity generation in a clean, green way, in sufficient quantity and in time, is in fact probably impossible without nuclear power. Far from planning, as it might, to export electricity, Scotland is going to depend on England for supply. By the same token, Scotland in its Cairngorm Mountains has the right sort of rock for the deep down, permanent disposal of nuclear waste. However, the SNP boasts, &#147;No nuclear dumping in Scotland&#148;. It could well, given safe, proven techniques, be missing out on a lucrative new industry offering many jobs, provided by natural resources.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08052178000022"></a>That leads me to ask the Minister one question. Chapter 1 of Part 3 of the Bill, which includes the clauses dealing with decommissioning and clean-up of future new nuclear installations, does not apply to Scotland. I understand that that is because the Scottish Executive want no nuclear power. If, as  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1503"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1503</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>seems inevitable, the present or a future Scottish Executive find new nuclear build unavoidable, do they have the power under, Head D4 in Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act to legislate for themselves? If not, would it not be better, with a view to the future, to apply Chapter 1 of Part 3 to Scotland now? That is a serious question, which the Government should perhaps look at. If the Minister is able to answer now, that would be excellent; but if not could he perhaps write to me about it? It matters very much.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08052178000023"></a>To summarise, the French have shown what leadership can do in the difficult business of changing energy policy. It involves political parties taking responsibility courageously and together. In this country, that involves the devolved Administrations as well as Westminster. I hope that will soon be better understood in Scotland. For our part, I hope that this House, while improving the Bill where necessary, will give it a fair wind today.</p>

I declare an interest as a professor of climate modelling at University College and a member of the EDF energy stakeholder advisory group.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08052178000025"></a>The Government have moved a long way since the energy White Paper of 2003, which set unrealistic objectives for reducing carbon emissions solely through conservation and renewables. Now the Government have developed a sensible portfolio of energy plans, which I am pleased to hear the Liberal Democrat Front Bench now supports. Despite the views of various nationalist parties, which we have just been hearing about, my first question to the Minister is: will nuclear policy apply throughout the UK?</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08052178000026"></a>I am pleased to see that there is now greater consensus about the portfolio approach in all the major industrial and emerging countries. I am a vice-president of GLOBE&#151;Global Legislators Organisation for a Balanced Environment. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, that it has been very useful to hear the views of other countries. That consensus now includes the United States, which has become much more aware of the need to adapt its energy policy to deal with global warming.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08052178000027"></a>One should realise that certain elements of the energy portfolio will or could develop much faster than others. Hence the concept of the so-called wedge approach is a little misleading&#151;I refer to the sausage approach, because some areas will grow very rapidly and others much more slowly. For example, energy conservation, wind power, small-scale river power, carbon sequestration and very high efficiency coal/gas power stations may emerge quickly, while areas, such as nuclear power and wave power, will take longer.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08052178000028"></a>As the Minister implied, the Government now have a more flexible approach through the renewables obligation. That is necessary as we have such different timescales for the new technologies as they emerge. All those technologies present exciting challenges to the UK engineering community and industry at every level, which as other noble Lords have said, should provide a tremendous range of jobs.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1504"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1504</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80521-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08052178000029"></a>As nuclear power becomes as widespread as it is in France, it will perhaps overtake certain of those technologies. Carbon sequestration may become less significant and we should be able to dispense with large onshore wind farms&#151;a point of view expressed by the American Department of Energy. Onshore wind farms are clearly unpopular and scar much of our landscape, so I look forward to the idea of smaller, cleaner nuclear power stations, which have less impact. However, it should be mentioned that there is no trend in that direction in France, where there is not only continuing nuclear power and the building of a new nuclear power station but the rapid development of onshore wind power in many parts.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08052178000030"></a>As the Minister explained, this welcome Bill has a number of critical elements. They are all necessary if the programme of energy supplies is to be secure and produce much less carbon than we do now. As noble Lords have mentioned, this programme must be urgent as the ice sheets melt and start slipping into the sea faster even than the IPCC estimated in its report last November. The IPCC is a consensus body; if anyone on the committee suggests that things may be happening more rapidly and others object, that is not included in the estimates.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08052178000031"></a>The target of 60 per cent or, perhaps, 80 per cent reduction becomes even more essential as the global temperature averaged over the land areas, not over the land and the sea, continues to rise rapidly&#151;by about 0.2 degrees per decade. That may worsen as the greenhouse gas emissions from the growing economies of India and China continue almost unabated. Furthermore, the earth may be worsening the situation. The long-threatened extra emissions of methane into the atmosphere from the unfreezing of the Arctic tundra is beginning to be as bad as was feared, with the possibility of an extra one or two degrees of global warming by the end of the century. Serious as that effect may be, it is still not included in the rather conservative estimates of the IPCC.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08052178000032"></a>I hope that as part of their energy trading with Russia, the Government will encourage much closer scientific collaboration&#151;which, in the view of the Royal Society here and the Russian Academy of Sciences is currently rather weak. International action will be much more likely to succeed if there is agreement about the scientific measurements on which policy needs to be based.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08052178000033"></a>The need for storage is made clear in the Bill. We should make use of the oil companies' past expertise in pumping carbon dioxide for secondary oil recovery. My question for the Minister is: what kinds of European and international collaboration will there be on that technology? The implication of what we were just hearing about was a UK approach. It is important that there is widespread collaboration on this technology. Since the possibility of the gases coming out from the underground reservoirs has been raised, accurate monitoring of the sites is extremely important. Which body will be responsible for that?</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08052178000034"></a>Nuclear is a secure and well tried method for producing electricity with minimum carbon emissions. It is interesting to note that the EDF nuclear power station being built in Flamanville in Normandy is on time and on budget.  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1505"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1505</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is always commented that nuclear power is impossible economically; that is not the experience in France. The size of the site needed is much smaller than that for any other non-carbon-emitting method. That is generally welcomed by the communities where they are located, as I have seen on visits to the north-east of the UK. We see this in France, the UK and the United States. There are many supporters of nuclear even in Germany, especially for importing electricity produced by nuclear power stations in France.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08052178000035"></a>The two main technical issues which concern many members of the public are decommissioning of sites and dealing with nuclear waste. The UK demonstrated decommissioning of a small plant in the 1960s, and as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, there are companies in the United States which are greatly familiar with this. The costs are reasonable, and I understand that the industry is quite satisfied with the provisions in the Bill for its contribution to the costs. It sees a plan with solid political support going forward in the UK, and the economic case is quite satisfactory to it. Its only reservation is that the Minister may intervene in determining the decommission process. That is quite reasonable, but there should perhaps be some system for appealing the Minister&#146;s decision.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08052178000036"></a>The Bill does not deal with nuclear wastes, but I am informed that new plant will store wastes on site for perhaps 20 or 30 years before either the deep-storage facilities have been introduced, which is the policy of CORWM and the Government, or the research being funded by Euratom and around the world&#151;in which UK scientists are involved&#151;leads to new technologies for enabling nuclear wastes to be turned into other materials and elements via the so-called transmutation technology. As a result of it, wastes, instead of lasting 10,000 years in the ground, will last perhaps 100 years. Noble Lords should be reminded from time to time that storing material in the ground for 10,000 years is neither necessary nor, in the usual definition of the word, sustainable.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08052178000037"></a>The renewables obligation will encourage more renewable energy production, be it from large offshore, or small river-water, turbines. However, there is concern among the smallest operators, as I have found in speaking to some of them along the rivers of Somerset, about the rigidity of the banding scheme. An increase from a 50- to 60-kilowatt system can penalise the operator. Is there to be a fair system for such small operators to avoid disincentives? Officials in BERR who have to deal with these tricky matters&#151;I presume that they continue to be tricky under this legislation as boundaries are changed&#151;have been very open to discussion with the operators, but such a system must be introduced. It would be useful to know exactly how it would come about. Will it be by way of private discussions with officials or will there be some more open, transparent method?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08052178000038"></a>At the larger end, offshore wind schemes will as I understand it from those who are planning them benefit from the renewables obligation clause, but they are concerned about the considerable planning hold-ups in the schemes, to which the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08052178000039"></a>All the issues in the Bill pose considerable scientific and engineering problems where research is essential for greater efficiency and safety. In the fields with which I am familiar, offshore wind and some nuclear issues, the amount of research sponsored by the UK Government has been very limited in relation to the vast investment that is required. I hope that there will be the kind of expansion in energy research&#151;new organisations exist for that&#151;that will bring it up to levels proportionate with those in the United States. It is essential for the future.</p>

It is rather daunting to hear his great scope of expertise, everything from icebergs in the north down to small generators in Somerset. I am following on slightly from my noble friend Lady Carnegy who put her finger on what will possibly be the major issue in devolution questions. I will talk more on some of the smaller ones.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08052178000041"></a>The ramifications of the Bill into the fringes of devolution are great. I am glad to see in the Explanatory Notes that the Government have decided to seek a Sewel Motion. The one area stated that first gave me worry is CO2. Is the disposal of waste material from power generation really an energy matter and so reserved for Westminster&#151;particularly if it becomes a separate process&#151;or is it environmental and so first a responsibility of the Scottish Executive? A Sewel Motion is probably the best way to make sure that we are still covering the point from both angles. Presumably by this stage of the Bill, this Motion will already have been passed. Is this so and have there been other issues? Obviously there still remains the problem of obtaining the Scottish local authority of executive&#146;s agreement to planning permission for the construction of any site for that separate process.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08052178000042"></a>It is also interesting that under chapter 2, on the storage of combustible gases, the Government have ensured that land in Scotland is land,</p>
<ul><a name="08052178000057"></a>&#147;landward of the low water mark&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08052178000043"></a>whereas in chapter 3, on the storage of CO2, Scotland&#146;s authority over the territorial sea adjacent to Scotland is again recognised. This raises another question on Clause 41, on offshore transmission, which I presume has also to be considered under the Sewel convention, both for lines coming from the territorial sea to Scotland and also for any long distance underwater inter-connector. Will these all have to be subject to planning permission in the area in which they occur?</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08052178000044"></a>In Part 2, we have a great section amending the Electricity Act 1989 to make more regulation for electricity from renewable resources, though the matters in the Bill are almost entirely to do with renewables obligation certificates. I declare an interest as a farmer and landowner who, like almost anyone else, could have an interest in microgeneration in one form or another. The renewable energy question is now beginning to show up some of the difficulties, as we saw yesterday when discussing the renewable  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1507"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1507</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>transport fuel obligation. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, told us of the current review of the wider economic impacts of global biofuel production and was happy to state that currently 1 per cent of UK road transport fuels are made up of biofuels. This is still a long way short of the 2.5 per cent target for this year in order to reach the much-trumpeted commitment of 5 per cent by 2010. The Minister emphasised the need in this whole field for long-term and sustained decisions but this review coming up is a prime example of the great tendency to have headline announcements and then second thoughts. On the issues that come up throughout the Bill, it is the opposite of what is required for an activity that needs large investments and long-term stability.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08052178000045"></a>On bioethanol, I know of plans for three major production units costing many millions of pounds, which ties in with this question of renewable transport fuels. At last year&#146;s harvest levels, these would use up the equivalent of our total exportable tonnage of wheat. The Renewable Energy Association is currently estimating that much of these could be abandoned. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester expressed his concern at the effect that this use has on the price of food. I do not know whether I can reassure him by telling him that from a world total of 600 million tonnes of wheat last year, a UN paper I saw yesterday estimates that this year&#146;s harvest will be 660 million tonnes. The outstanding thing about last year was that we had a bad harvest in a great many places, which we should of course be prepared for. We should have the stocks to carry us through. The world still has a capability for producing food to a much greater level than it did last year. If we abandon our efforts to create bioethanol, we then have to buy it to meet our commitments. What is that likely to do to the conservation of tropical forests and world food supplies? It is a great dilemma.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08052178000046"></a>The Government started out on this road with a great sense that we would foster innovation, remain at the forefront of world energy activity and obtain great financial gain by being able to supply our new-found technology to the rest of the world. A main area envisaged in the Bill is carbon capture and storage. We are all in favour of this approach and it would be good to have properly thought-through regulation. In the mean time, it appears that the industry&#146;s attention is much focused on the Government&#146;s carbon capture and storage competition, which will promote one enterprise of their choice. A proposal for developing a carbon-capture facility for a gas-fired power station at Peterhead had recently been abandoned because it has been found that the Government&#146;s attention is much more focused on supporting carbon capture for coal-firing and post-combustion technology. Even this is not the best cutting-edge science. Are they not also prepared to consider parallel pre-combustion projects which can be integrated with post-combustion technologies? Has the Minister&#146;s department received any approaches from the industry for them to look at this technology?</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08052178000047"></a>Many noble Lords have expressed disappointment that there is nothing in the Bill allowing for development of a policy which would include a feed-in tariff. We have heard that the Government are frightened of the

My noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding said that the current cost of the incentivisation of renewables per household is &#163;79 per annum. Speaking in another place, a member of the Minister&#146;s own party pointed out that the feed-in tariff costs in Germany&#151;by far the most successful system in incentivising microgeneration as part of the whole renewable world&#151;is around &#163;25 per household. I cannot say whether this is in addition to other costs, but for anyone who can put up a solar panel or microgenerator this cost of &#163;25 might well offset or even give a positive outcome.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08052178000048"></a>As everyone has been pointing out, there are, no doubt, some massive hurdles to be overcome. The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, emphasised that the timescale available appears very short. The big task for those of us in Parliament is to keep our people engaged and enthused with the efficient use of energy.</p>

<a name="80521-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08052181000002"></a>I must declare an interest as a farmer and as a member of the Renewable Energy Association. I was a little perturbed by the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, about biofuels. The price of wheat in real terms was higher back in 1995. A small percentage of 0.6 per cent of the worldwide wheat stocks went into the biofuels sector. I hope that allays some of his fears.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08052181000003"></a>I have only four topics to cover. First, the ROs must be truly sustainable. We must avoid getting into a muddle like we are with the renewable transport fuel obligation, as mentioned by the noble Duke, particularly with government scientists coming out with conflicting reports. We all agree that cutting down the rainforests of South America to grow sugar, making that into ethanol and then shipping it half way round the world is pure madness. To impose a cap on co-fired ROCs unfairly discriminates against one form of renewables, and surely it would make sense to treat all forms of sustainable renewable energy equally. For fairness, equality and maximising the potential for co-firing and for reducing CO2 emissions, I urge Her Majesty&#146;s Government to drop the proposal for a cap on non-energy crop co-firing.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08052181000004"></a>My second point is about Clause 90 and the idea that electricity safety standards should be transferred to the Health and Safety Executive. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain how this will happen in reality and whether there will be sufficiently qualified personnel to deal with this aspect of the proposed legislation.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08052181000005"></a>My third point returns to renewables, but this time to what is not in the Bill. It is astonishing that the Government know that the Bill will bring only 5 per cent of renewables by 2020. Yet, a year ago, they committed themselves in Europe to at least three times that, so why have they not used the Bill urgently to introduce new measures to which they have committed us? We do not have much time to waste, as  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1509"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1509</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>other noble Lords have mentioned. It must not be forgotten that this House committed in the Climate Change Bill to securing at least 70 per cent of ambitious CO2 cuts at home. Surely it is vital that we match these targets with urgent action.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08052181000006"></a>It does not altogether surprise me that, in the Public Bill Committee, MPs from all parties took an interest in proposed amendments to secure new measures for renewables. The Renewable Energy Association and Friends of the Earth are arguing for a tariff measure that is clearly effective across Europe for smaller scale renewables to work alongside the renewables obligation. The aim is to reach the investors and technologies that the renewables obligation does not reach, with a much more user-friendly support scheme. That means not only domestic microgeneration but community-scaled schemes. There may not be many community schemes in the UK, but in countries with excellent records on renewables, such as Sweden, Denmark and Germany, communities, farmers and individuals are the major investors. I urge the Government to look again at this proposal and its clear merits for making renewable energy accessible to a far wider constituency.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08052181000007"></a>Similarly, I welcomed MPs&#146; proposals to align the remit of the energy sector regulator, Ofgem, to climate change objectives. Again, it was this House, back in 2004, that gave the regulator a secondary duty to pursue sustainable development. However, we clearly need to go further. More than 10 gigawatts of renewables are currently held up due to a lack of network access, and if we are seriously to encourage local renewables, local distribution networks need to work very differently. Again, targets mean little without confronting the bold and difficult measures needed to deliver them.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08052181000008"></a>Finally, I refer to one of the four main goals:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08052181000024"></a>&#147;To ensure that every home is adequately and affordably&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052181000023"></a>that magic word &#147;affordably&#148;&#151;&#147;heated&#148;. I have long been extremely concerned about fuel poverty and whether government help is correctly channelled to those who are most in need. I strongly believe that fuel poverty payments, especially to the elderly, ought to be means-tested. I echo much of what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester said. In fact, it does not take much to see that a fixed tariff for domestic renewables could help us to address some instances of fuel poverty. I understand that Energywatch, which supports the tariff proposal, is talking to the social housing sector about the potential for this.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08052181000009"></a>In this day and age, it is a criminal shame that there are still 4 million fuel-poor households in the United Kingdom. These figures come from a time when fuel costs were relatively stable and do not take into account the different climatic regions in the UK. To give one small example, 23 per cent of households in the north-east are fuel poor, whereas the number of comparable households in London is a mere 9 per cent. This must be grossly unfair. If the Minister were to come to my part of rural Scotland on the hottest day of the year, he would find smoke coming out of every chimney. This would not happen if he focused on an area in the south-east of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08052181000010"></a>Sadly, the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy is in disarray. The positive progress in fuel poverty reduction between 1996 and 2004 has been halted and reversed by domestic energy price increases of more than 90 per cent for gas and 60 per cent for electricity. Further onerous price increases are definitely imminent, as mentioned in all today&#146;s newspapers, which carried horrific headlines such as &#147;Consumers &#145;getting it in the neck&#146;&#148;. My major concern is that the political will may diminish as fuel poverty targets, which had once appeared eminently achievable, become even more challenging. There are worrying signs not only that targets will not be met but that the Government are resigned to this position. I hope to table amendments to ensure that this does not happen.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08052181000012"></a>After the wide-ranging White Paper and the promise of the Climate Change Bill, to which we are all committed, this Bill is rather disappointing. So far as the climate change targets are concerned, not much in the Bill will bring us any closer to achieving the demanding trajectories which the original Bill set for us and which, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, said, may be very conservative.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08052181000013"></a>I put this into a context that is slightly broader even than the one that has already been touched on. Oil prices, at $130 a barrel and rising, will indeed drive energy efficiency and a switch from carbon. However, the effect of that rise, particularly on the poor, to whom the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, has just referred, can be absolutely devastating. Fuel poverty is, as he says, rising inexorably. The Bill does not contribute to resolving that dilemma. The rising cost of energy might be desirable in terms of climate change and for fuel security and a switch from carbon, but it has enormous distribution effects on the poor. Many of the measures which government and the market direct at more environmentally desirable outcomes&#151;such as nuclear power, renewables, green taxes or an alteration of the market structure to provide a higher proportion of green energy&#151;disproportionately hit the poor. There are no off-setting measures. The Bill does not change that, but it and government policy could move a little way towards squaring the circle.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08052181000014"></a>Before I go any further, I had better declare a few interests. I am chair of the National Consumer Council, which will merge very shortly with Energywatch, which has been referred to, and I have a number of interests in fuel poverty and combined heat and power, all of which are recorded. Even when I was in the Government, I had certain misgivings about government policy. Energy policy seems to have two aspects that are contradictory and do not add up to a coherent whole. If I may exaggerate slightly, on the one hand we have a rather Stalinist obsession with grandiose, big-scale projects, and on the other we have an obsession with  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1511"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1511</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>maximising the competition, primarily to ensure that the average price reduces rather than taking into account the distribution effect on the very poor. We therefore have a combination of Stalinist economics and Ronald Reagan economics. This mixture has not delivered on any of the four main targets for energy policy, which include our social duty to reduce fuel poverty, environmental sustainable energy and fuel security.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08052181000015"></a>We need some big projects and I am in favour of the provisions in this Bill for the Government&#146;s commitment to new nuclear build, even though it will not really affect the balance until the 2020s. I am, on balance, against another big project, the Severn barrage, but I am persuadable even on that. But what the Government need to focus on rather more than large-scale power stations and large-scale projects is the area of decentralised energy, distributed energy and local production.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08052181000016"></a>Before I go on to that, my main point relates to fuel poverty, and the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, has spelt out the statistics and the progress which has been so tragically reversed in the past few years as prices have doubled. Government policy has not responded. Indeed, in a sense, it has gone in the opposite direction. The Warm Front programme has been cut; the new version of the EEC, called the CERT, now only has 40 per cent gearing to the poorest rather than 50 per cent, although it is in total an increase; and the increased focus on social tariffs, which I am gratified to see Ofgem is now taking seriously, has yet to produce any results in terms of giving better options to the very poorest, both within companies and by switching between companies. I do not blame the regulator for this. The regulator has probably improved its focus on both the environmental and social outcomes in the past couple of years or so. While I have often criticised Ofgem, I think the real problem is the direction and framework that the Government give to Ofgem. Ofgem&#146;s primary duty is still far too narrow, as others have said, and we need to interpret the sustainable development duty that was given to Ofgem in the 2003 Sustainable Energy Act&#151;and it took a bit of argument with the Minister&#146;s predecessor to get that duty in there in the first place&#151;but it has not really altered the primary focus of Ofgem&#146;s activity because it is not a direct instruction from the Government.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08052181000017"></a>We need a renewed focus on delivering social tariffs; we need extra resources into programmes like Warm Front; and we need social housing expenditure under the successor to Decent Homes to be more focused on energy-efficiency improvements. All these will require changes in the role of Ofgem and in government funding. I am very keen on smart metering, which is referred to in this Bill and which will be delivered, though on a slightly slower timetable than I think is possible and necessary. I also assume that this will subsume progress on the outrageous premium on pre-paid meters which is paid, by and large, by some of the poorest in our society.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08052181000018"></a>As well as ensuring that the social objectives of energy policy are re-emphasised, the environmental ones&#151;particularly the commitment to renewables&#151;also need to be underlined and strengthened. The  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1512"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1512</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>European target, as others have said, looks pretty unattainable on present policies and trends. I am sitting on your Lordships&#146; Sub-Committee B, which is looking at these matters. I do not want to pre-empt its decision, but it certainly looks at the moment as if that renewables target is not attainable. Indeed, in some ways, we seem to be going slightly backwards when you look at what is in the pipeline. On wind, for example, we have the combination of both government and big business decisions recently. There was the Scottish decision not to back the big wind farm up there, and a major oil company, which I will forbear from mentioning in my proximity to the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, has apparently pulled out of the Thames Array. Both those decisions are disappointing.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08052181000019"></a>Of course, the incentive system for renewables depends very heavily on the ROC process. ROCs have had some success and it is an attractive process for the big operators which trade within the ROC market. But we are still at around 2 per cent of renewables. Germany has nearer 20 per cent and Denmark twice that. We have a solely ROC-based incentive; they have feed-in tariffs. I know correlation is not causation, but I think the Government need to have another look at what is being proposed as an equivalent to a feed-in tariff. I appreciate that some other relatively successful countries, like Spain in relation to wind power, have market-based systems. We need to look at the whole picture but, in the area of relatively small-scale companies&#151;not only microgeneration but somewhat bigger than that&#151;which are unlikely to be playing in the ROC market in the long term, the certainty that a feed-in tariff gives is more likely to bring online the kind of technology at a local level that those companies will be most interested in.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08052181000020"></a>All sorts of technology&#151;local wind, solar, anaerobic digestion, farm-based or community-based biogas&#151;can be much more efficiently and certainly delivered in the light of a tariff which is guaranteed for a period of time. The economic and environmental benefit of this can be pretty substantial. We have virtually no market in biogas in this country. Germany has over 3,000 installations and they are locally based. They use feedstock, which is waste locally generated and locally delivered, and even the second-degree waste can be reused as fertiliser or fuel for the vehicles delivering the waste in the first place. So you have a benign cycle which does not impact on the rest of the economy and certainly does not deliver increases in carbon emissions.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08052181000021"></a>We need, in general, to look at more decentralised energy, CHP-based and renewables-based in particular. There are costs to the grid, as the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, has said, of connecting all these, and there could be local networks, both in relation to gas and decentralised energy. If we are worried about security of supply&#151;and we must be obsessively worried about the level of carbon emissions&#151;then the role for decentralised energy must be given greater attention by the Government and by the regulatory framework which they impose on the regulator and on the industry.</p>

As the Minister pointed out in his introduction, this Bill is linked both with the Climate Change Bill, which has gone on its way, and the Planning Bill which has yet to come. It also has links, particularly in the field of fuel poverty, with the Housing and Regeneration Bill and, as has been pointed out, with the forthcoming Marine Bill. They share a common agenda and I hope that, as the Bill proceeds through this House, every opportunity will be taken to make clear the obligation this Bill owes to the carbon reduction targets and our climate change targets. I was one of many noble Lords determined to drive the idea of climate change across departments as a necessity, as the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, so powerfully pointed out.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08052188000002"></a>Much of what has been presented in the Bill is uncontroversial and, notwithstanding the critique of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, there has been a general and widespread sympathetic voice across the House during this debate. What, however, have been voiced are widespread concerns at the missing links&#151;those energy-related measures which could, should and will, I expect, if this House has its way, be included in this Bill. The Bill has been long awaited. It comes after much dithering and delay. Of course energy policy has involved difficult decisions, but the Minister knows all about difficult decisions. He comes from business and successful business is dependent on making difficult decisions. I hope that he will bring his decision-making skills to government, who certainly need it. In this matter, time is of the essence, and big decisions will need to be made and made quickly.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08052188000003"></a>Fuel security requires that we construct gas storage. As the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, has pointed out, carbon capture and storage is also a prerequisite. On the particulars in the Bill&#151;the licensing procedures and the reporting requirements&#151;I hope that these matters will be addressed in detail in Committee. Underlying Chapter 3 is the acknowledgement that for us to begin undersea carbon storage, there will have to be amendments to existing EU directives. Can the Minister explain what these are, how far discussions have progressed and what remains to be agreed? What linkage exists within the EU jurisdiction on marine matters beyond the six-mile line, the use of submarine storage in general and offshore transmission in particular?</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08052188000004"></a>I expect many noble Lords will want to be involved in discussions on renewables. Many different aspects have been raised. Wind power generation has been by far the most visible constituent of the programme to  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1514"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>date. But co-firing is another key element. However, we see Cinderella is at the ball and if we are to have the decentralised energy policy, we need to look at photovoltaic solar power, wave power and tidal power. Will the variability in funding, to which the Minister referred, be used to encourage investment in these areas?</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08052188000005"></a>Part 2 on renewable obligation certificates will no doubt cause its fair share of amendments, probing or otherwise. But at this stage I have only one question for the Minister. What sort of specified case&#151;under Clause 37, which inserts new Section 32C in the Electricity Act 1989&#151;might be wholly or partially free of the requirement for such a certificate?</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08052188000006"></a>Like many noble Lords, I look forward to hearing the Government&#146;s objections to a feeder tariff&#151;the renewable energy tariff. The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, expressed the view that it was much more effective than the ROCs. The Minister needs to be aware, as he surely must be, that there is widespread support for such a concept&#151;not just at the 50 kilowatt microgeneration level, but for a higher level&#151;if we are to encourage investment in this important area.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08052188000007"></a>So far I have focused, as does the Bill, on energy producers. The greatest missing ingredient is the consumer. The government amendment at Third Reading in another place has provided for the introduction of smart meters, albeit without the direct enthusiasm that their introduction requires. Like the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, I am seeking a timeframe for their universal introduction to all Britain&#146;s 45 million households. Will the Minister confirm that the mandate for the introduction of smart meters, for which industry has been pressing, will form part of this Bill?</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08052188000008"></a>One of the biggest reasons for the use of smart meters is to address fuel poverty. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester, and the noble Lords, Lord Palmer and Lord Whitty, also spoke on this issue. Many noble Lords have expressed concerns. The House has heard the passion and determination with which my noble friend Lord Jenkin has pursued the issue of the supplier obligations in this matter. The Bill is silent on the social tariff. It fails to address the inconsistent way in which those who have to use a prepayment meter pay more for heat, light and energy, which cannot be right.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08052188000009"></a>This is a useful Bill, but it is surely waiting to be improved. I expect noble Lords will seek to do that and I hope that the Minister will encourage them in that objective.</p>

He offered a range of options and considerations which were sadly lacking in the two Front Bench speeches so far. It is fashionable to suggest that the Labour Government, after 10 years in office, have run out of ideas and steam. If that is what the Cameron-Clegg axis can provide as alternative solutions to our energy problems, God forbid that Labour loses the next election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08052188000011"></a>I am very pleased to participate in this debate. I have interests in energy recorded on the register. A number of the areas that I have advocated for some years are being followed and I am very pleased that there has been this change of recognition by the Government. It can be argued that this is not a lurch; it is certainly a rather slow change. The tanker took a long time to move, but we have had incontrovertible evidence of the need and the urgency from, for example, the Stern report, that a great deal more has to be done and should be done very quickly.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08052188000012"></a>It is certainly the case that we have come to the renewables issue rather later in the day than a lot of countries. We did not have renewables in the 1990s when the Conservatives were in power because we had gas. We not only had gas, we had a dash for gas. A year after the Labour Government came to power, having assessed the situation, they embarked on an embargo on gas power stations. Otherwise we would have had an even greater commitment to them and an even earlier shortfall in our gas supplies. Some Conservative speakers today seem to be incapable of remembering their own political history and the rather cack-handed way in which they went about privatisation, regulation, and, only at the very last gasp, liberalisation. It was such an ill thought through process of liberalisation that we now have no national champions to speak of, apart from National Grid, on energy in this country.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08052188000013"></a>We do not have British-owned companies which could have been capable of defending the national interest in any major way. That is not to disparage Iberdrola, RWE, e.on or EDF. But large foreign companies with deep pockets are able to acquire vulnerable British businesses and the blame lies at the door of the Conservative Party for the way in which they reorganised British energy when it was privatised.</p>

<a name="80521-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08052188000014"></a>In the first instance, I welcome the commitment to nuclear power, about which I have spoken here. The Government have a realistic programme. More will have to be done on skills. We are moving on at a reasonable pace in respect of the generic design assessment of the new reactors. I am confident that we will be able to see nuclear power being generated within the next 10 to 11 years in this country. I would hope that nuclear power will bring a degree of stability to price, because dependency on gas means that we are thrown to the four winds as far as the vagaries of the international pricing system are concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08052188000015"></a>Much has been said about gas and gas storage, which I welcome. It is long overdue and should have been set in train 15 years ago. The Government were incredibly complacent over the whole issue of gas storage over the years. Some of us on Select Committees in the other House argued with the Government that it should be dealt with as a priority. We were told that if the market was left to its own devices, everything would be for the best in all possible worlds. Pangloss has little place in the energy debates and the energy markets, and has never had much of a place. I am not advocating state direction, but I am advocating facilitation, encouragement and

However, I find it hard to believe at times that when there are all these fantastic opportunities, the entrepreneurial instincts of British business cannot rise to the challenge of building windmills or of getting their act together on what, obviously, is a very attractive and important issue; namely, carbon capture and storage.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08052188000016"></a>We are told that people take their ball away in a huff if they do not receive sufficient subsidy or incentive from Government. We are receiving in a new form the old argument about backing national champions. I thought that we had left all that behind and the idea of subsidising companies to take advantage of market opportunities when these market opportunities are so blindingly obvious that even latter-day socialists like me can see that. Anyone with a bit of wit and intelligence should be able to get something going there.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08052188000017"></a>Certainly, if the Government are going to have another competition it should be modest in scale and they should be selective in which of the two technologies they want to have judged. Broadly, I sympathise with the position that has been adopted. We will have to have a debate about the forms of tariff and the ROCs arrangements in much of the provision in the renewables area. We may have a fight about what is very little in terms of the respective merits of one option against another, but the Committee stage of the Bill will be helpful in this area.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08052188000018"></a>I share the anxieties of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, about the implications of disparate and limited, on occasions, renewable generation and the cost that that will have on the funding of the National Grid. The National Grid will have to have an alternative grid to accommodate intermittent sources of supply while at the same time having the usual motorway system to deliver the power from the baseload generators that we will have to live with in the future, whether they are gas, nuclear, or, as I hope, coal. But let us not forget that coal is an imported fuel. If we were going to restore the coal industry in the United Kingdom to even a shadow of its former state it would require degrees of training, investment and new forms of technology, the like of which we cannot begin to realistically think of at the present moment. We will have to use coal but it will not be cheap in the future. If we have the almost exponential increase in demand that we see from India and China, this is bound to impact on the price of coal at a far greater rate than we have envisaged over the past two or three years.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08052188000019"></a>That brings me to my final point. Much of what we have been talking about is in the medium to long term. However, fuel poverty, about which the noble Lords, Lord Palmer and Lord Taylor, have spoken, is with us and is growing worse. It is growing worse primarily because no one anticipated the dramatic increases in gas and oil prices and the impact that they have had: a 100 per cent increase in domestic gas prices and a 70 per cent increase in domestic electricity prices.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08052188000020"></a>There are 24 million households in the UK. I do not think that the figure is 45 million; it may be that  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1517"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1517</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>second homes owned by Members of this place or houses abroad were lumped in. I believe that the Minister said 45 million: it is only 24 million, but it is bad enough at 24 million, because if we take England on its own there are around 3 million-plus households in fuel poverty. Some 15 per cent of households in England are in fuel poverty. That means that we have to spend in excess of 10 per cent of gross income to fund the heating bills of those households to keep the house warm or the water hot.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08052188000021"></a>We know that the Government have been concerned about the matter and that tough words have been exchanged in Victoria Street. People have complained that Ministers have not been nice to these shrinking violets from the energy companies and that they have succeeded in wringing out of the energy companies an increase of &#163;100 million this year, &#163;125 million next year and &#163;150 million in 2010-11. That is in contrast to the &#163;50 million spent at the moment.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08052188000022"></a>We can argue about who is to blame for the price rises and express concern about the level of profits that these companies make, but I do not particularly want to go down that road. If there is a 1 per cent increase in energy prices, 40,000 households go into fuel poverty. But if there is an increase of 2.5 per cent, 100,000 people go into fuel poverty. If it is 25 per cent it is another 1 million. At the present moment, the Government are cutting &#163;80 million per annum for the next three years from the Warm Zones project. Somewhere down the line the Government have their priorities wrong. They are not nearly harsh enough on the utilities. It was said that if the Government did not obtain some money from the utilities they would introduce a mandatory social tariff. I do not believe that the two are mutually socially exclusive.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08052188000023"></a>I believe that we need to have a mandatory social tariff. At the moment we have a free market in utility charity towards the fuel poor: a market of such inconsistency, complications and contradictions that we can have a mix and match of any one of about four or five or maybe more forms of assistance. There are price discounts and freezes, fixed price bills and forms of cold weather payments. We could have tariffs on low income households or people living in deprived areas, or occupants of fuel poor areas; households facing difficulty paying bills; all households on supplier priority service registers and then we could have the catch-all of the elderly.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08052188000024"></a>It is not beyond the wit and intelligence of either the Government or the House to produce this social tariff and I hope that some of us can make common cause across the divide of the House to get a social tariff on to the statute book. We have to recognise that, even though there are six or seven major suppliers in the country, most of them are geographical in character. If they are offering a good policy in one area, the chances are that it is either not taken up by the poor or not available to them in other parts of the country. So it is incumbent on us to try to have a national gold standard by which companies can be judged. That can be the form of the social tariff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08052188000025"></a>John Maynard Keynes said that in the long run we are all dead. In the short term, a large number of poor, disadvantaged and elderly people will die as a consequence of their inability to afford to keep themselves warm. That is one of the saddest facts and statistics that we have in the United Kingdom. It is not the severity of our winters or the inadequacy of our social benefits; it is the fact that we have a grossly inadequate housing stock, the improvement of which, in the Government&#146;s proposals for Warm Zones, will result in reduced funding for amelioration. That is one example of the problem that we have here. We are dealing with a number of issues in a number of contradictory areas. We can talk until we are blue in the face about smart meters in the certain knowledge that it will take 10 to 12 years to run them out. The companies cannot decide which kind of smart meter they want. They do not even know which parts of the country they should start in. They do not know whether there are low hanging fruit that could be plucked quickly so that disadvantaged people could be helped. Indeed, it could be argued that those who have difficulty handling their bills and payment systems may also find it difficult to handle more complicated meters than they have now. What there is no doubt about is that if you have a prepayment meter, it is a damn sight more expensive than paying a discounted rate by direct debit. There are things we can do.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08052188000026"></a>In broad terms, I support this legislation. It can be tweaked and improved, and I welcome the commitment to increases in large-scale generation and the recognition at long last of the need to secure gas supplies and build storage facilities. It was said earlier that we are trying to construct a three-legged stool. Our job at this point is to make sure that the energy leg of the stool is as strong and effective as we know it can be. I think that the Government are making a good start.</p>

I hear his criticism of these Front Benches, which was balanced by his criticism of his own Government in certain areas. Again, I shall come to that later. One of the key impressions I have from the debate, like the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is that the Bill is comparable with the Climate Change Bill, but there was some enthusiasm for that legislation. It might not have been that strong and a number of flaws were pointed out, but people were enthusiastic about it as marking a way forward. With this Bill, there is a lack of enthusiasm and a reluctant consent to its provisions, but, frankly, it does not go far enough and it does not meet the challenges that many noble Lords have outlined. In fact, perhaps that is why I sensed from the Minister&#146;s opening speech that his usual ebullience and enthusiasm and urge to move forward were not evident to the degree that they have been on some of the other issues he has been involved in. I would say he is quite right in that.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08052188000028"></a>It is certainly the case that a number of issues in this area, such as energy security and energy supplies,  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1519"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1519</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are quite downbeat and difficult at the moment. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, mentioned the fact that one third of our energy production capacity is going to disappear over the next 20 years. We are also facing the highest oil prices in real terms in recent times. Moreover, we are moving towards net imports as opposed to net exports. Where are we in terms of renewables? We all see renewables as part of the low carbon economy future, but we know that we are near the bottom of the European league table even though we talk up our abilities in this area. We know that we will miss the Government&#146;s 2010 target of 10 per cent; that was pretty much confirmed by the Minister. We know that even where we are trying to build renewable projects, we face equipment supply problems and that British industry has no place whatever in the supply chain. We have missed the boat in that area.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08052188000029"></a>Some 50 years ago, coal provided 80 per cent of the UK&#146;s energy needs. It is now down to 20 per cent, so the position is completely reversed. But because of the issues around gas supplies, coal is now potentially starting to rise again, and yet we do not have in place standards for how new coal-fired power stations need to be built to meet potential carbon capture in the future. I was particularly taken by the fundamental point made by the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, that we have no control at all over the supplier of a huge amount of our energy, the Russian Federation. We have no control over investment levels. British industry wants to invest, but has been gradually taken out of the equation. We see a very nationalistic and chauvinistic approach to energy supplies in the Russian Federation which is going to affect Britain and the whole of Europe.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08052188000030"></a>Lastly, in terms of downbeat issues, we have the problem of timescales. Even if we get on with nuclear build and plough ahead with carbon capture and storage immediately, there will be a lag of around 15 years until those technologies come on stream. Again, that is in complete contrast to the challenges set by the Climate Change Bill where we saw ways to move forward. This leg of the stool does not come anywhere near to fulfilling what the Climate Change Bill requires. We knew it was a framework Bill and we forgave it for being that so long as it was followed by legislation on energy supplies that would fill in the gaps and ensure that we would be able to meet the very demanding targets. This Bill does not do that.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08052188000031"></a>On carbon capture and storage, the Scottish plant that was originally going to be tested is no longer moving ahead. On offshore energy, the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, mentioned that Shell has pulled out of London Array. We welcome the fact that provisions for gas storage are included in the Bill, but again it is an administrative necessity that needs to happen and is not something that is going to change the world. On renewables obligation certificates, changing the weightings for different sources of renewable energy is fine, but that will not meet the challenge of sourcing renewable energy supplies for the future. Nuclear waste is also a key area, but again it is administrative. Even on legacy nuclear waste we need to move forward with those solutions.</p>

I will not go through them all again, but the one I want particularly to emphasise has not been mentioned a great deal: it is energy efficiency. All the studies show clearly that investment in energy efficiency measures provides the best return of all the areas that seek to tackle energy issues and carbon reduction. Energy efficiency is way ahead of renewables, yet the Bill says nothing about it. We could have used this opportunity to put into legislation the Government&#146;s target for zero carbon homes by 2016, a target which not many people understand how to meet. We could have had a discussion about financing energy efficiency measures in a proper way because they have started to fall back in many areas. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, mentioned the very important point about revenues from the auction of carbon permits. Should we not ensure that the huge revenue that will come to the Government in future years really is ploughed back into energy efficiency measures?</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08052188000033"></a>I somewhat disagree with the pessimistic view of the noble Lord, Lord Birt, on our ability to reduce energy consumption. While I agree that it is difficult, in the 1980s the Japanese showed how you can effectively decouple energy use from economic growth. Indeed, over the past 10 years even in our own economy we have seen flat energy usage during periods of economic growth. Through energy efficiency measures we should be able to push energy reduction further, although the difficulty at the moment is the increase in oil consumption to meet the growth in transport.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08052188000034"></a>I was going to say quite a bit about fuel poverty, but it has been very well summarised by the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill. The fact is that energy prices have doubled over the past five years and that, whatever the figure, many millions of people will be brought into fuel poverty. In Cornwall and the south-west, fuel poverty in rural communities presents the same level of challenge as it does in urban areas.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08052188000035"></a>Ofgem may have changed its approach to many of these issues, but it needs to make its top priority the development of a low carbon society in the future. Smart meters very much tie in with fuel poverty and are, potentially, one way forward on that. I agree that smart meters are classically middle class, pushing the power to make good decisions back to consumers. That is an important part of decentralising energy-use decisions and democratising energy use. Is there not a way in which that clever technology can start to calculate for itself and find the cheapest tariffs, even for those people who do not necessarily take much interest in it day to day? That technology may be there, whether people watch their smart meter on their PC every day, or leave it there, simply to do its work every year.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08052188000036"></a>One important area is the &#163;215 pre-payment that the poor pay. As has been shown in Northern Ireland, that can disappear; it is no longer there. The other provision that is no longer necessary&#151;and it says something that it was not in the Energy Bill&#151;is the Merton principle, which gives local authorities the ability, in planning permission, to be far more stringent over a number of environmental and energy

The Government even resisted the Private Member&#146;s Bill at Second Reading but, I am pleased to say, have now adopted that Bill, which will come through in parallel, and will no doubt come to this House in due course.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08052188000037"></a>My noble friend Lord Redesdale has already referred to the Prime Minister&#146;s speech in November, which I always look back to. The Prime Minister likened the fight against climate change to the reconstruction efforts and international co-operation that took place post-1945. The Climate Change Bill, with all its targets and what it wants to achieve, clearly demands that sort of concentration. The Stern report very much said, &#147;It is great what you do over the next 50 years, but what is most important is what you do now, and over the next 10 years&#148;. This particular Bill does not meet that challenge. From all the points that have been made, there is a great deal of consensus in this House. I only hope that we can amend this Bill in a number of ways. Many Members of the other place would be sympathetic to that. It will be necessary to do so, or there will soon have to be yet another energy Bill.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08052188000038"></a>I would describe this Bill as &#147;managerial&#148;. It is not particularly focused or ambitious; it does not, in any way, go towards meeting the Government&#146;s own vision on climate change. Its challenge to global warming is tepid legislation. That is a great shame. This Chamber will make a number of changes to this Bill, which will be welcomed by many people at the other end, on both sides of the House. I look forward to working with other Members of this House, from both sides, in making the changes that we have discussed today.</p>

<a name="08052188000039"></a><a name="80521-0009.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80521-0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08052188000100"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill and the many noble Lords who have contributed such considerable expertise to this evening&#146;s debate. It has clearly shown how complicated this subject is, and how urgent the action is needed. We were told at the opening of this Session of Parliament by Her Majesty that her Government would,</p>
<ul><a name="08052188000090"></a>&#147;introduce legislation to provide clean, secure and affordable supplies of energy&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80521-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08052188000040"></a>We strongly support those words, but are concerned about whether her Government have entirely delivered upon that intent with this Bill. The Bill, as far as it goes, and as many noble Lords have said, is welcome. It sets the framework for investment in nuclear power, renewable energy, and carbon capture and storage. It also lays down some necessary structures to address the issues of gas importation and offshore storage. These are all, as I say, welcome measures. Yet, we, much like the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, feel that they do not go far enough.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08052188000041"></a>We appreciate that the Bill includes an attempt to address the framework for the importation and storage of gas. We are, as the noble Lord, Lord Birt, said, no longer a net exporter; we are, in fact, a net importer. Without sufficient storage, prices would continue their upward trajectory, as the noble Lord,  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1522"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1522</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Teverson, mentioned, continuing to hit the poorest hardest. In addition, we would face an ever-increasing energy security risk. The noble Lord, Lord Truscott, made some important points about this risk. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s view on how much of a reserve is necessary to ensure the security of our gas supply. Does he know, and if so, how should this be monitored? I hope the Minister agrees that knowing how much we need is vital, and is surely the first step to ensuring that we can get it.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08052188000042"></a>As my noble friend Lady Wilcox rightly noted, the United Kingdom faces a looming energy gap. Several noble Lords have commented on the fact that about 30 per cent of our existing generating capacity will close over the next 20 years. All bar one of our nuclear power stations will be shut down. Many older coal-fired power stations will also close, compounding the problem. This means that there will be a serious gap in our energy capacity. The Bill, as I mentioned earlier, provides a framework for nuclear investment. After&#151;it has to be said&#151;considerable delay, the Government have finally announced that they will give energy companies the option of investing in nuclear power stations. Perhaps other noble Lords will be as interested as I was to hear what my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding had to say about the fact that we might now have the potential for some genuine competition in our future nuclear industry.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08052188000043"></a>As welcome as the green light for nuclear investment might be&#151;and forgive me if I appear churlish&#151;it still seems a half-measure. This is because there is nothing meaningful to resolve the problem of the disposal of nuclear waste. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester asked how the Government would establish the cost of that. The announcement to allow nuclear investment has not been matched with any plan, or intention to develop a plan, on the deep-depositing of nuclear waste, as my noble friend Lady Wilcox and the right reverend Prelate said. The Bill claims that it will make provision for the management and disposal of nuclear waste, but as we found out from the debate on the Bill in the other place, we must wait for future legislation to address this. How do the Government expect a potential developer of a nuclear-generating site to prepare accurate financial projections&#151;essential, as the Minister, of all people, knows, to raising the necessary finance&#151;when it cannot work out the back-end cost? Surely the Minister would be the first to make the point that industry needs certainty if it is to make such substantial investments. There was some encouragement for us all in what my noble friend Lord Jenkin and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, said, but as a country we need to get to grips with all of this. Echoing my noble friend Lady Wilcox, I ask: what do the Government plan to do if the Scottish Parliament blocks plans to build nuclear power stations in Scotland? My noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour also raised her concerns about what the future holds in Scotland and, indeed, in each of the devolved Administrations.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08052188000044"></a>Meanwhile, the British nuclear industry faces a major skills crisis. This is partly the result of an ageing nuclear workforce that is not being adequately  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1523"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1523</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>replaced by graduates. According to British Energy, fewer than 6 per cent of the 100,000 people who work in the industry are under 24, with over 40 per cent of staff set to retire over the next 10 years. To make matters worse, there is the risk that skills will migrate to China, India and Russia, where demand is high and rising. According to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, as my noble friend Lady Wilcox noted, the migration of skills has placed a severe strain on its ability to attract the skilled employees that it requires to assess and approve the different types of reactor for which licences will be sought. The noble Lord, Lord Truscott, and several other noble Lords referred to that. What are the Government doing to address that? Half measures and too much dithering risk making it difficult to convert the good intentions behind the Bill into the power to boil the kettle.</p>

<a name="80521-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08052188000045"></a>There is another overarching problem here. How does all this fit into the framework of our obligations, both at home and abroad, to cut emissions and promote renewable energy? Despite the commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 20 per cent below the 1990 baseline, carbon emissions have risen, as has been widely publicised. We can commit ourselves to targets, but without a genuine vision of how to reach them we will end up in breach of international agreements, like the EU target on renewables, and British law, like the Climate Change Bill, which would require a 20 per cent reduction in carbon emissions in the next 12 years. Business as usual will result in failure; the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, referred to that.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80521-0010.htm"/>


<a name="80521-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08052188000046"></a>My noble friend Lord Jenkin referred to the remit of Ofgem and suggested how to resolve that issue. The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, referred to the need for amendment here in his masterclass, if I may call it that. The noble Lords, Lord Puttnam, Lord Palmer and Lord Whitty, also mentioned the Ofgem remit. Once again, the legislation&#146;s attempt to solve all this addresses only part of the problem. Already, in their draft legislative programme for 2008-09, hidden among an avalanche of additional legislation, the Government say that there is to be a new round of consultation,</p>
<ul><a name="08052188000091"></a>&#147;on the options for increasing the use of renewable energy, in the context of the EU target for 20 per cent ... from renewable sources by 2020&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052188000089"></a>Is this the horse wandering after the cart?</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08052188000047"></a>Take also, for example, the Government&#146;s plan to promote carbon capture and storage in an attempt to create a new generation of clean-coal power stations, to which the noble Lords, Lord Oxburgh and Lord Truscott, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester, among others, referred. The Bill certainly makes provision for the promotion of CCS and creates a licensing regime to certify them. Yet, as my noble friend Lady Wilcox said, it does not address the chance that something might go wrong. It is unclear what, if any, action would be taken against licensees who are responsible for leaks. I think the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, may have referred to that. Does the Minister not think that there needs to be some provision for liability?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08052188000048"></a>The Government&#146;s energy White Paper vowed to triple the amount of energy we get from renewable sources. We currently get 2 per cent, and my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour and the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, both referred to the size of the mountain we have to climb. Like the right reverend Prelate, I would be interested to know if the Minister believes that we will be able to increase our figure substantially in the next decade to meet our target of 20 per cent. In fact, it will need to be more than a 10-fold increase, assuming, as seems certain, that our energy usage continues to rise. Indeed, the Minister confirmed that in his opening remarks.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08052188000049"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, set out his concerns on, among other things, the cost of and the issues related to the necessary upgrading of the national grid. My noble friends Lady Carnegy and the Duke of Montrose spoke of their specific concerns about connecting Scottish renewable energy to its end users.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08052188000050"></a>The Government&#146;s mechanism for increasing investment in renewable energy is the renewables obligation, which gets an overhaul in this legislation. The introduction of banding to the renewables obligation might indeed encourage investment. We support using market mechanisms to encourage growth. The most cost-effective way to reduce emissions should triumph. We must be careful, however, that the bands do not result in skewed markets if the involvement of humans in allocating the banding results in their favourites being picked. Picking favourites will not lay the appropriate foundation for a renewable energy industry or a low-carbon economy.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08052188000051"></a>What assurances can the Minister give that that has not already begun to happen under the renewables obligation? Can he convince your Lordships that the new banding provisions will not skew the market in the future? If he has a genuine belief in the utility of the market, why have his Government resisted feed-in tariffs so adamantly? Does he not consider supporting the microgeneration of renewables to be a priority? Renewable energy tariffs&#151;as the right reverend Prelate, the noble Lord, Lord Birt, and my noble friends the Duke of Montrose and Lord Taylor, among others, said&#151;could substantially improve the status quo. We will seek to pursue these in order to encourage smaller power generators and establish the viable market mechanism needed to tackle climate change and our looming energy capacity gap.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08052188000052"></a>Much of what has been discussed today has, rightly, been about what is in the Bill, yet much of the debate here and in the other place, and virtually all the debate outside Westminster, has been focused on the issues that have been omitted. I notice that even the Government, in the shape of the Secretary of State for Defra, have already admitted that a renewables Bill will still be needed to address the necessary frameworks. In the other place, the Government conceded the principle of rolling out smart meters across the country, but, as the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, and my noble friend Lord Taylor said, they have not given a timeframe for that.  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1525"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1525</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>How are businesses supposed to plan ahead? Long-term planning requires making decisions, not putting them off for the long term.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08052188000053"></a>Another crucial omission is that of fuel poverty, to which my noble friend Lord Jenkin, the right reverend Prelate and the noble Lords, Lord Palmer and Lord Whitty, among others, have referred. The Minister&#146;s department has set a target to eliminate fuel poverty in vulnerable households, but Ministers have been forced to admit that, largely due to fuel price rises, the total number of vulnerable households in fuel poverty has actually risen in recent years. Smart metering, if rolled out properly, might help address that by making the price of pre-payment meters&#151;to which, among others, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, referred&#151;more equitable. However, as my noble friend Lord Taylor and the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, said, still more needs to be done. With the opportunity to address serious problems surrounding energy issues, the Government are in serious danger of missing their chance to help the most vulnerable.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08052188000054"></a>Essentially, the Bill goes halfway very well. We on these Benches do not seek to hold it up unduly. We ask for the co-operation of the Government and the help of your Lordships to finish the task and make certain that it provides real solutions and underpins the affordability, cleanliness and security of our energy supply.</p>

I am surprised if the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, thinks that I am not bringing to it my usual degree of enthusiasm in these matters. Perhaps I could take noble Lords back to my time at the CBI when I was director-general. Having listened to the debate today, I give noble Lords on all sides of the House some fabulous qualifications in hindsight. At times, we at the CBI just never saw the initiative and support from either side of the political domain for this enormously important issue. I am new to this House, so I hope noble Lords will forgive me if I am not allowed to say this, but I have heard some things tonight from other Benches that have made me think, &#147;You do have a nerve&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08052188000057"></a>The delay from both parties on this issue over decades is a reflection of the diverse and complex nature of the issues. The wider energy strategy that we now have to address is, in one way, the product of all that deliberation and consultation, as well as a shift in the political&#151;with a small &#147;p&#148;&#151;feeling in the country about it. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said that the Bill does not allow us to make  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1526"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1526</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sufficient progress on climate change early enough, but at last we have a Bill that is bringing forward important enabling legislation which will allow companies to make investments in such important carbon technologies as carbon capture and storage. It will push forward nuclear at last and allow, through the banding of the RO, a more rapid expansion of renewables. The Bill makes significant progress which has long been lacking across the political piece, as those in business have known and talked about for so long.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08052188000058"></a>The breadth of issues we have touched on today is also a reminder of the tensions inherent in how we respond to the challenges we are facing. We have to combine decisive urgent action to cut carbon emissions with cost-effectiveness while maintaining a competitive and growing economy. We have to ensure secure and reliable energy supplies though increasingly we know that we will rely on international markets. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, who marched through the decline of domestic gas and oil reserves. That is a statement of the obvious. An alarmist walk through our history and where we are going will do nothing to instil confidence in people&#151;businesses, overseas investors and the private sector&#151;about investment in the future. It is so very important that as a nation we pull together to deliver a secure and low-carbon solution.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08052188000059"></a>My noble friend Lord Birt, among many others, referred to the concept of this as an international issue. My noble friend Lord Truscott talked about how important oil and water were going to be in the 21st century. I make speeches all over the world talking about how the currency of power has fundamentally changed in the 21st century. Power in the 20th century was determined primarily by who had the biggest guns, the biggest armies and where they went. Power in the 21st century will be about the currency of oil and gas. I would suggest that the currency in 20 or 30 years&#146; time, and in some very surprising places, will be water. Then, there is the currency of the development, exploitation and transfer of knowledge. This country can succeed in that knowledge, that technological advance in dealing with so many aspects of climate change and security of energy supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08052188000060"></a>It is arrogance of the very worst sort if the Americas, the Britains, the Frances, the Germanys and the Japans turn to the Indias, the Chinas, the Brazils and the Vietnams and say, &#147;We got rich by fouling this planet. You can&#146;t&#148;. They will not believe us, for a start. They will ignore us, for the second. But at the end of the day we cannot allow them to be doing that. We must come to them as partners with technological solutions so that they can get wealthier and rich. By the way, that is not rocket science. If they get richer, they will buy our goods and services. But at the same time, we must make sure that we can partner with them and provide them with those technological solutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08052188000062"></a>Five areas in the Bill are key to that. The first deals with creating a fit-for-purpose licensing regime to allow the private sector to bring forward offshore gas storage and unloading projects. The second deals with plugging the gap in the regulatory framework for carbon capture and storage, creating a licensing regime for the permanent storage of carbon dioxide under the seabed. The third is reform of the renewables obligation that will triple the renewable electricity promoted by the RO by 2015 compared to today. The fourth is putting in place measures to ensure the private sector covers the full costs of decommissioning and a full share of the waste management costs of any new nuclear power stations. The fifth is powers to underpin the roll-out of smart meters to medium-sized business in the first instance, but potentially to all energy consumers. I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, that the roll-out of smart meters will continue apace. We are going to get medium-sized businesses going by November 2008. We will then roll it out over the next five years, after more consultation, to smaller businesses and then into the private consumer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08052188000063"></a>It will not happen if we do not get buy-in from all sections of our society and I suggest that that is one of the important aspects of being leaders. It is interesting that the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, mentioned leadership in France&#151;the leadership that I presume shows up so evidently in how they deal with their farmers and students. But the noble Baroness is right; they show distinct leadership in nuclear power and we can learn much from the way that their parties came together to deliver solutions which will endure for decades to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08052188000064"></a>I now turn to specific points that have been raised. First, I will deal with one or two issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox. She says that the Bill fails to specify how the long-term liabilities arising in connection with carbon stores will be handled. The enabling provisions are in the Bill. For example, Clause 20(3) allows licences to include conditions on the closure of a store, and provisions about the obligations of the licensee after closure and about the termination of a licence. Clause 30 applies to the decommissioning arrangements that currently apply to offshore oil and gas facilities, to structures used specifically for carbon dioxide storage.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08052188000065"></a>We want to consult on the detailed liability arrangements that will apply. Whatever the detail, these will ensure that the operator will be legally and financially responsible during the period that the store is licensed. The operator will be obliged to seal the store to a specified standard and remove to structures used for storage. Public funds will be protected against risks of the operator failing to meet its obligations through financial guarantee arrangements and the

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08052188000066"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, also asked whether the CCS regime should cover all of those liabilities. It does. Clause 31 relates to the termination of licences at the end of the life of the store. They allow the Secretary of State to make financial arrangements with the licensee in relation to the licensing authority taking on liability for the closed store.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08052188000067"></a>The noble Baroness also asked whether the Government will change safety standards for new nuclear power stations. In the United Kingdom we have strict, independent safety protection regimes for nuclear power and any new station will be subject to safety licensing conditions. They will have to comply with the conditions set by the regulators in connection with their licences and their authorisations. The noble Baroness also asked why the 2050 target is not an 80 per cent reduction in CO2 and only a 60 per cent reduction. The figure is set at 60 per cent because that was what the science recommended at the time. Rather than making up a new figure, we have asked the Committee on Climate Change to assess that figure again in the light of updated scientific information.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08052188000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, mentioned that the Government should introduce a renewable heat obligation. The Government are focused on heat; the Prime Minister said last November that we will be doing more on the issue. That is why we have had a call for evidence on the subject, which considered a range of issues, including financial support mechanisms and obligation in that respect. The work is feeding into the renewable energy strategy consultation this summer. But heat is complex, as the noble Lord knows, and we need the time to make sure that we get the policy right before thinking about legislation necessary to deliver it.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08052188000069"></a>I was interested to listen to the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, when he said that it was difficult for companies to factor in CO2. That is not what I hear when I go around the businesses of Britain or inward investors to the country. In a commissioned survey, 50 per cent of respondents said that it was already having a strong, or medium, impact on the decisions to develop innovative technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08052188000072"></a>Many noble Lords mentioned feed-in tariffs. It is true that Germany has been successful in deploying renewables by using a feed-in tariff, but at a very high cost. It cost &#8364;68 billion between 2000 and 2012. There are 500 different types of tariff, with 150 added every year. It is a regulatory nightmare, and extremely expensive. And, let us not forget, they have had that

We have to get this into context. If we were to change now, we would destroy the consistency and stability that business craves and private sector investors need, and we would increase the delay and the cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08052188000073"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Birt for the geographical context in which he put this situation. He raised a list of issues which will prevent the UK meeting its renewables target, including planning, radar issues and grid updates. On behalf of the Government, I wish to reassure noble Lords that we fully recognise that those are major factors. We are actively working with all the relevant parties to resolve those issues and we are making good progress. The financial framework must be consistent to ensure investor confidence at all times. That is why it is vital that we remain committed to the renewables obligation. Indeed, my noble friend said that the Government need to do more to support renewables. Too true&#151;we have always said that we need to do more. That is why we are bringing forward the renewable energy strategy next spring. But we must implement the important changes to the RO in this Bill now. Indeed, the Bill will make the renewables obligation 30 per cent more effective.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08052188000074"></a>My noble friend also said that we need to do more to support combined heat and power. Renewable CHP is already supported by the RO&#151;the new planning policy statement on climate change will, I hope, help promote that even more. During the coming months, we will be examining how to make further use of combined heat and power, including heat in a carbon context and a greater use of waste heat.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08052188000075"></a>I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, not only for his contribution today but for giving me prior notice of the issue he was going to raise concerning Energy Solutions, Inc. We will take that up over the next two or three days, but I can assure the noble Lord that if its solutions and ideas can be proven to be of use in what we are seeking to achieve, then yes, we are flexible and open to change. I would say that, wouldn&#146;t I? I am one of the most passionate believers in an open market and in the free market working to bring in speedy innovation. I assure the noble Lord that I will get back to him on the specifics of Energy Solutions, Inc.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08052188000076"></a>The noble Lord spoke about energy companies not being able to deal with the vulnerable. He also mentioned fuel poverty, as did so many of your Lordships. I guess that it would be seen as running away scared if I pointed out the obvious&#151;that that is outside the scope of the Bill. If noble Lords wish it to come within the scope of the Bill, I presume that they will put down amendments with the aim of doing so. But the Government are not sitting back and doing nothing. We have spent &#163;680 million more in the current CSR than in the previous one, especially on the initiatives of Warm Front and CERT. I said at the beginning of my remarks that I heard some things from other Benches that made me think, &#147;You have a nerve&#148;. Before 1997, I did not exactly hear the

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08052188000077"></a>I do not believe that there are 6 million people living in fuel poverty. We have got that figure down from 1997&#151;it now stands at 2.5 million but, frankly, that is 2.5 million too many. It is very important not to ignore it, especially at a time of rising energy costs, and given the lack of education and investment there is regarding insulating homes.</p>

He gave his apologies as he had to leave to attend an awards ceremony. I would welcome a meeting with him and my officials to see if we can achieve resolution of his justifiable concerns. The Government have recently examined existing powers for dealing with unattractive takeover situations of UK energy assets. We take the view that at the moment the powers in the Enterprise Act 2002 are sufficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08052188000081"></a>My noble friends Lord Hunt of Chesterton and Lord Birt asked what the Government are doing to roll out CCS internationally. We are very keen to support the EU&#146;s ambition to have up to 12 demonstration projects operational across Europe by 2015. We intend our demonstration to be operational by 2014. We are the only country in the European Union right now to have one at all&#151;the other two are in Norway and America. But we are working with our G8 counterparts to achieve the ambitious agreement arising from the G8 summit on CCS. We continue to drive that forward.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08052188000082"></a>We have created a North Sea basin task force in order to work closely with Norway to remove barriers to the deployment of CCS. We are looking particularly at storage in the North Sea. My noble friend Lord Hunt also asked who will be monitoring the leaks from any carbon dioxide stores. The operators will be monitoring while they are licensees; they will have the responsibility to monitor as they perform their obligations as licensees. But when the store is delicensed, the state will take it over and carry out any monitoring required.</p>

<a name="80521-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08052188000083"></a>My noble friend also asked whether there should be an appeals procedure for the approval of any funded decommissioning programmes in nuclear. Our position is that judicial review is the best place to hear an appeal. People who sit on tribunals are used to hearing complex and technical cases.</p>

We are committed to microgeneration: we published the microgeneration strategy in 2006; we have simplified RO for microgeneration; and we have introduced CERT to encourage energy suppliers to support microgeneration technologies. It has been announced that we will look at alternative support mechanisms to ensure that they can continue. I assure noble Lords that we will continue to put government money and initiative behind microgeneration. We have made &#163;86 million available in capital grants in the low-carbon buildings programme to reduce the cost of buying and installing equipment; that is putting taxpayers&#146; money exactly where our mouth is.</p>

There has been huge interest from companies for all sorts of CCS technologies. I have been particularly pleased in my job at UKTI to see so many companies from other countries wanting to come here, invest their money and bring their technology so that we can see both pre and post-combustion technology for CCS proceed. It has been pleasing to see what interest there is. While the Government are showing global leadership in supporting the demonstration of post-combustion on CCS technology, we hope that we can encourage more countries and companies to move on with pre-combustion as well. The noble Duke specifically asked whether the legislative consent Motion has been passed. The answer is no, but it is being considered later this month.</p>

<a name="80521-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08052194000005"></a>The right reverend Prelate said: My Lords, I am very glad to be able to bring this short measure to your Lordships today. It will help the Church in its work of supporting and encouraging marriage; it will help the clergy to welcome couples who come to them to be married in the Church of England; and it will also help a good many couples by making it easer for them to marry in a parish with which at least one of them has a special connection.</p>

<a name="80521-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08052194000006"></a>I am also pleased to be able to assure your Lordships that the measure is essentially a simple and straightforward one even though, inevitably, there are some technical details. It applies only to marriages in the Church of England, and they, like all marriages in England, are of course governed by an Act of Parliament, the Marriage Act 1949. Under that Act, it is normally possible for a couple to marry in the Church of England in the parish church of a parish where at least one of them is living, or is a regular worshipper and has his or her name on the church electoral roll. Indeed, such a person has, in almost all circumstances, a right to marry there. However, in today's increasingly mobile society, there are significant numbers of couples who wish to be married in some other parish than that in which one or other of them resides; for example, the parish where one of them grew up and where her or his parents are still living. When they come to the parish priest and ask to be married there, the parish priest currently has to tell them that this is simply not possible under the 1949 Act for couples who live outside the parish unless at least one of them worships there regularly for six months and then has his or her name put on the church electoral roll, or unless they obtain an Archbishop of Canterbury&#146;s special marriage licence.</p>

<a name="80521-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08052194000007"></a>The General Synod is very clear that it wants a parish priest to be able to welcome couples who come to the Church to be married. It certainly does not want the Church even to give the impression of putting a couple who have a clear connection with the parish through a legal obstacle course before they can be married there. The Synod gave careful thought over a number of years to the best ways of addressing this situation, and the result is set out in the measure before your Lordships tonight. It lists seven short and simple criteria&#151;what the measure terms the &#147;qualifying connections&#148;&#151;and provides that if one of the couple can show that he or she satisfies any one of those criteria, he or she will have the same right be married in the parish church, using a Church of England marriage service, as someone who lives in the parish.</p>

<a name="80521-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08052194000008"></a>I will run through these seven criteria briskly. They cover cases where the person concerned was baptised in the parish or was prepared for confirmation there; where this person has had her his or usual place of residence in the parish for at least six months, or has regularly attended public worship there for at least six months at any time in the past; where that person&#146;s parent has had his or her usual place of residence in the parish for at least six months, or has regularly attended public worship there for at least six months now or at any time in the past, provided it is during the lifetime of the person who now wishes to marry in

<a name="80521-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08052194000009"></a>The reason why the Synod chose those seven criteria was, first, that they cover the most typical cases where the problem to which the measure is directed arises in practice and, secondly, because these seven are clear and straightforward, so that it will not normally be difficult for a person who falls within one of the criteria to show that to the parish priest&#146;s satisfaction. The House of Bishops will be issuing guidance to the clergy on how to respond to approaches under the measure. That guidance will be made public. Arrangements are already being made to ensure that, when issued, it will be on the Church of England website. The House of Bishops hopes that it will also help couples by letting them know in advance how and to whom to submit their request to make use of the measure and what kind of information they will need to provide.</p>

<a name="80521-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08052194000010"></a>Of course, the General Synod recognises that there will always be some cases which fall outside those standard categories, but where one or both of the couple nevertheless have a genuine connection with the parish. However, the measure does not affect the special licence procedure, and it does not take that possibility away from anyone who could use it at present. It does not deprive anyone of any existing rights; it simply extends those rights to some additional categories of people, without amending the terms of the 1949 Act. The measure was finally approved by the Synod with only six voting against in a total vote of 258.</p>

<a name="80521-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08052194000011"></a>The Church of England sees it as not only a duty but a privilege to marry couples and to give them the preparation which will help them to make the best possible start to their married life together. This is a part of the church's ministry to the nation, to which it attaches great importance. In the House of Bishops document, <I>Marriage</I>, in 1999, among much else, we saw lifelong marriage as the bedrock of a rapidly changing society. By making a limited change in the law, the measure will help the church in carrying out that ministry. At the same time, it will be a practical help to a significant number of couples who want to commit to each other, in marriage, in a church with which they have a special connection. The measure was deemed expedient by the Ecclesiastical Committee. I therefore recommend it to your Lordships and ask the House to support the Motion that it should receive the Royal Assent. I beg to move.</p>

As we have already heard, we were happy to support it under the superb leadership of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. I am happy to serve on that committee. We found it expedient, and used that word, as the loosening up of those strict parochial boundaries of another time is to be welcomed for our increasingly mobile society. The consequent loss of community that that freedom brings often leads also to drift. It will be wonderful if families can gather somewhere other than in a hotel: somewhere where they can retain their roots, in a place that they can return to in good times and bad&#151;one for the heart and memory to return to, with the possible comfort of a priest to confide in.</p>

She guided me with great wisdom and humour through my years as chairman of the redundant church uses committee and, subsequently, the London diocesan advisory committee.

However, it is largely a temporary measure, because we are living in an age of such rapid change. We all have to look at the ecumenical scene of joint ministries and buildings being used by more than one denomination. In keeping an eye on that changing scene, is this measure really flexible enough to meet the change of the present time and the years to come? I am sure that one of our great problems is how to have an attractive Christian marriage and not trivialise it. You can marry on a beach in Cyprus, or in a hotel, wherever&#151;in Antarctica, perhaps. There

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08052194000018"></a>Here, we see that people of faith will be able to marry in a wider area than they have in the past. I should like to see people of Christian faith being able to marry in any place of worship, but that is, perhaps, the next measure. If we have restrictions, then I know, in my own circumstances, of somebody wanting to marry in a certain church and area where the registrar would ask, &#147;Sorry, do you live in that area?&#148;, so they left a suitcase of clothes in their parents&#146; house to claim that they resided there when that, in truth, was not so.

Perhaps, one day, there will be an opportunity to go a little further, for the important thing is that people should be able to be married in a church of their own faith. If further difficulties arise, other than those covered by the seven criteria, I hope very much that the church will keep that under review.

Would particular or lovely churches be swamped? Would the Church of England be able to service the measure by providing marriage preparation at a distance, as it were, encouraging connections between clergy in one place where the marriage takes place and clergy in the church from which the people came? We noted that we needed to keep the measure under review in those respects. The question of the ecumenical scene and its changes was not raised on that occasion. That is a very important point. Clearly, if we make progress, whether on the Church of England-Methodist covenant or in other ways, aspects of the measure will need to be brought up to date as we do so.</p>

<a name="80521-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08052194000023"></a>Flexibility is extremely important, as is proper preparation. The really significant element&#151;because this is the only one the Church of England can manage&#151;is marriage by a rite of the Church of England. Of course, if that were in the context of a local ecumenical partnership, where a Church of England service was taking place in Methodist premises in a parish, it would be entered in the register books of the parish concerned and that would be relevant to the measure, as it would had the parents&#146; marriage been so solemnized, as it might have been. I appreciate the noble Lord&#146;s point about suitcases. Among the main drivers for this measure is the desire to try to avoid clergy kindly agreeing to break the law, and couples pressing clergy to break the law, or breaking the law&#151;technically speaking, the Marriage Act 1949&#151;by being reduced to leaving suitcases and saying that that constitutes residence. It is precisely to make it easier for people with real qualifying connections to marry according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England that this measure has been brought forward. I am grateful for those two points&#151;encouraging us to look at it carefully as time goes on and keep it under review, and to look for any further elements of flexibility that are within our power to adopt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08052194000028"></a>The Race Relations Act 1976, of which I was an architect, forbids discrimination on racial grounds which include not only race, ethnic or national origins and nationality but colour. That definition came from  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1537"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1537</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the United Nations definition in the convention on the elimination of racial discrimination. The UK is bound by that convention which expressly includes colour. The EU race directive of 29 June 2000 refers to the right to equality before the law and protection against discrimination as a universal right recognised by various international human rights treaties, all of which include colour as a forbidden ground of discrimination. The race directive lays down a framework for combating discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin. The Government chose to implement the directive by subordinate rather than primary legislation under the European Communities Act 1972, and they did so in the Race Relations Act 1976 (Amendment) Regulations 2003.</p>

<a name="80521-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08052194000029"></a>Because the race directive does not specifically mention colour, but only discrimination based on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, the Government decided that it deliberately excluded colour. I believe that interpretation was contrary to European Union law and that the Court of Justice in a proper case would so decide. Among other things, Article 8 of the race directive eases the burden of proof in race discrimination cases, but because of the way in which the Government have translated it into our statute law, someone complaining of racial discrimination on grounds of colour has a heavier burden of proof than on other racial grounds. That absurd anomalous result was confirmed by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in Okonu v G4S Security Services (UK) Ltd last year. The anomaly was described as going even wider by Mr Justice Birtles, who said that this means that,</p>
<ul><a name="08052194000080"></a>&#147;the new definitions of indirect discrimination and harassment, the shift in the burden of proof, and the new provisions relating to the genuine occupational requirement exception will apply only to discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic or national origin and not to colour&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80521-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08052194000030"></a>When the regulations were debated here on 11 June 2003, I criticised them for disfiguring the existing anti-discrimination legislation and as being contrary to the need for,</p>

I am very glad indeed that the noble Baronesses, Lady Prashar, of Runnymede, and Lady Howells of St Davids, are both taking part in this debate. I am sure they will remember the previous work done by this House in seeking to secure coherent legislation&#151;for example, in the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 in the aftermath of the Stephen Lawrence barbarity, where we managed to persuade the Government to strengthen that Act during its passage. I refer also to my own Bill of 2003, which was passed by this House, and which drew upon the authoritative Hepple report, which won very widespread support. This House contains exceptional expertise and I am sure that noble Lords

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08052194000033"></a>In the remaining time allotted to me to speak, I would like to summarise what I hope the new law will secure in the course of its preparation and passage. The aim of law reform in this area should be to achieve an effective, efficient and equitable regulatory framework aimed at encouraging personal responsibility and self-generating efforts to promote equality. As I said, the groundwork was done in the Hepple report. There is a pressing need for clear, consistent standards. The Bill should consolidate existing law to make it more user-friendly and accessible. The Bill should establish an effective, efficient and equitable regulatory framework aimed at encouraging voluntary and easy steps to promote equality. As regards accessible remedies, individuals should be free to seek redress for the harm they have suffered as a result of unlawful discrimination through procedures which are fair, inexpensive and expeditious, and the remedies should be effective in achieving widespread change. There must be no hierarchy in the strands, and multiple discrimination needs to be dealt with.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08052194000034"></a>There need to be measures to target particular behaviour or arrangements. I will say nothing about the scope or exceptions of the Bill, because this is not the place to do so. There need to be measures to facilitate general progress towards equality, with equality duties in the public sector and in the private sector. The torturous and unworkable equal pay legislation needs to be radically reformed. There need to be measures on positive action, reasonable adjustment and public procurement.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08052194000035"></a>There are three important points about enforcement. First, there should be no levelling down of existing protection. Secondly, there should be effective individual remedies and scope for enforcement. Thirdly, there should be less emphasis on procedures and more emphasis on outcomes. The enforcement needs to be proactive. There is too much focus on eliminating discrimination by means of investigative and legal processes. The new legislation should be more proactive and less adversarial, without imposing unnecessary bureaucratic burdens.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08052194000036"></a>I am glad to see in his place the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Handsworth, because he serves on an employment appeal tribunal among other things, and he will have great experience of how the law does and does not work. To make more efficient use of resources, complicated discrimination cases need in some way to be referred up from the employment  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1539"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1539</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>tribunal, perhaps to the Employment Appeal Tribunal, to deal with them as a court of original instance. I have found that the employment tribunals are not able to deal with that in a satisfactory way. Representative actions need to be dealt with, the tribunals should be able to make recommendations for strategic changes and there need to be staggered sanctions.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08052194000037"></a>I have said nothing that should be controversial. I hope that all parties would support sensible measures of that kind. I realise that the Minister cannot give assurances about that. I ask that such points be very carefully considered by Ministers as they prepare legislation, and that they will meet Members of this House who have particular expertise to discuss those issues at an early stage, before policy is finalised. That would help to deal with this ridiculous anomaly, whereby a person who is told that he or she is treated worse because he or she is black is to have a heavier burden of proving the case than a woman, or someone discriminated against on the basis of ethnicity other than colour, or any of the other forbidden grounds. I very much hope that the Minister can at least tell us tonight that the anomaly will at last be dealt with in primary legislation.</p>

With the same spirit and commitment that he has shown when addressing bigotry, he has in his opening remarks today presented the House with a compelling case to consider. I feel that the House is already persuaded, which makes my task very easy.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08052194000039"></a>With the indulgence of noble Lords, I will bring a practical example to the attention of the House. I have been engaged in visiting schools and, from time to time, I meet young people with real problems. At one school, a sixth-former told me that he is always being stopped by the police, he is detained from getting to school on time and he feels harassed. The boy is considered to be a bright and serious student by his teachers. He asked the policeman why he was being stopped. The policeman, who was white, said, &#147;It is because you are black&#148;. I leave noble Lords to judge, but my belief is that he was stopped because of his colour. With the law as it stands, he would have the onus of proof left to him to make his case. How could he?</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08052194000040"></a>If the policeman had said, &#147;You were stopped because you are of a different ethnic group&#148; or, &#147;because of your race&#148;, the law currently states that the onus of proof, as explained by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, would be on the policeman to prove that he did not discriminate. The action has sown a seed that will make things difficult for the victim, who is left seeing his colour, which he cannot change, as a major obstacle to his development.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08052194000041"></a>The second reason I support the noble Lord, Lord Lester, is that the law should be consistent. It should deal with colour in the same way as ethnicity and race, as in the Race Relations Act. Maybe the

In the UK, we expect the law to protect all our citizens from discrimination. I believe that the Government listen, apologise for mistakes and seek remedies; so I look forward to this anomaly being treated with the same courtesy as is shown for any other transgression.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08052194000042"></a>If a dog bites you, you get a shot, and in most cases you heal in a matter of days. If you are hit on the head with a truncheon, you might get knocked out, but usually the pain is gone within a few days. The issue here is not the dog, or the truncheon, but the psychological segregation, which digs deep into the psyche. It does not heal easily, and it continues to cripple people of colour. I remember a rhyme I heard growing up, &#147;If you are white, you are right; if you are yellow, you are mellow; if you are brown, stick around; if you are black, get back&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08052194000043"></a>The colour of skin breeds a sense of inferiority that drives men to drink, boys to become disaffected with the system and girls to get pregnant rather than finish their education. It gnaws away at self confidence, until the young believe that they cannot do anything right, when they are treated less favourably than others on the grounds of colour. That has wider implications for society than many of us care to think about. I invite the Government to think again.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Lester, explained, there is an unfair gap in the law. When an individual experiences discrimination based on her race or ethnicity, she has the benefit, correctly so, of a reverse onus of proof. The burden of proving that there was no discrimination shifts to the defendant. The same benefit does not apply to an individual who experiences discrimination based on her colour or national origin. That distinction itself creates inequality. Those who experience discrimination based on race or ethnicity are treated differently, and better, than those whose colour or national origin are the basis of their discriminatory treatment.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08052194000045"></a>It cannot be that this unequal application of anti-discrimination law was intended, especially because the Race Relations Act prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnicity, colour and national origin. That gap is an example of inconsistencies and anomalies that characterise current anti-discrimination law. I very strongly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lester, who clearly and cogently expressed what is needed. As he said, this House has expertise in all the strands of discrimination. That expertise must be used to ensure that we get new equality legislation based on the criteria that he so clearly described and that the standards that he set are met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08052194000046"></a>As someone who has over the years been involved in the implementation of anti-discrimination legislation, I think that there is a great deal of merit in ensuring

It would be helpful to have legislation where enforcement is not solely reliant on individual complaints but encourages proactive action and, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said, is self-generating in promoting equality of opportunity. Those of us who have been involved in implementation recognise the importance of having a framework that encourages promotion of equality of opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08052194000047"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said, some excellent work was done in 2003 by Bob Hepple on the noble Lord&#146;s Equality Bill. That provides a very helpful model on which the single equality Bill can be based. Combining that work with the expertise in this House, I very much hope that we can move to a single equality Bill based on the criteria so clearly outlined by the noble Lord. I hope that the Government will ensure not only that the inconsistencies and anomalies are remedied, but that the forthcoming Bill will meet the criteria and provide a framework that will help us to promote equality in a consistent manner.</p>

Perhaps I may be permitted, with serious&#151;perhaps almost unparalleled&#151;brevity to put down a marker and say how much I agree with the Question raised and the answer proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Lester. We have now on all stages, nationally and internationally, very strong statements banning&#151;forbidding&#151;discrimination on many different grounds. As the years go by, Governments and international organisations add to the list. The work of courts and tribunals in dealing with discrimination cases is not easy. Having been president of the Employment Appeals Tribunal for some years, I know how difficult those cases can be.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08052194000049"></a>It is very important that we should strive to avoid differences between the various grounds of discrimination. It is also extremely important that we should root out or prevent technical discrimination between the different cases, unless there is very good reason for it. Having a different burden of proof in different areas is very difficult to justify. I do not believe that there is any justification for having a different burden of proof between the three categories to which the Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, refers. I very much hope that the Government will, at the very least, look at the matter again but, more hopefully, do something to remove what I regard as an unnecessary anomaly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08052194000051"></a>We are in an era when the past, with all its suffering and all its discrimination, is a matter of great embarrassment to us. Martin Luther King, one of my great heroes, said in that great speech of his that he dreamt of the day when his children would be judged not by the colour of their skin, but by content of their character. Let me admit it here: I shall be singing hallelujah if Mr Barack Obama wins the presidency of the United States. It would be a tremendous leap forward.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08052194000052"></a>I do not think that my noble friend would say that his Bill or his contribution today is anything but a move in that direction. Parliament here decided to implement the European directive by statutory instrument rather than by primary legislation. That is the cause of that discrimination. It does not apply to claims of discrimination on the grounds of colour or nationality. We want the directive implemented by primary legislation in the new equality Bill to come before this Parliament.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08052194000053"></a>Enough has been said. I know that the Government are listening and will act.

I pay tribute to him for his stamina in pursuing the subject over many years. He has laid out tonight a solid case where the law is apparently in a small way inconsistent. What I have not heard him do&#151;perhaps that was in the interests of brevity&#151;is lay out a lot of cases where people have been disadvantaged as a result of this slight inconsistency in the law, shall we say? I have to say that he has made a very solid case for removing that inconsistency. If there is a legislative opportunity, it should be taken. I do not know what is the Government&#146;s programme in the medium or longer term; I know that it is immensely crowded in the short term. This is a matter that only government can deal with, but there would be no opposition from our party if there were, as part of some other Bill, a clause that put this anomaly to bed&#151;one hopes for the last time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08052194000055"></a>Curiously, I am not ashamed of my past, whatever it may have been. If one looks through the tide of history, one sees immense injustice, inequity and bad treatment of all sorts of people of the same race, let alone of a different race. We had to learn to do away with those things, and the tide of human progress has been rolling steadily forward over the years with improvement in the interests of everybody&#151;more recently, in the interests of all communities.</p>

If we had not learnt that we were wrong, we would not have made any progress at all. So I stick by what I said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08052194000057"></a>If there is an opportunity for this matter to be put right, it should be, but until that opportunity arises, we must ensure that the existing law is applied in such a way that people are not disadvantaged. The noble Baroness, Lady Howells of St Davids, said that this can be a psychological problem. I accept that it is very difficult to deal with psychological problems, but the law was never designed, as I have understood it, to cure psychological problems. The law has always been designed to cure injustice. The psychological cure will come when society in general treats everyone in the same way.</p>

He has enabled noble Lords from all sides of the House to rally around and draw attention to what we all agree is a clear anomaly. I join other noble Lords in paying tribute to his long and distinguished career as an architect of the most progressive race-relations legislation in Europe. That is to the great credit of this House because, as he said, it has traditionally played a key role in challenging and getting the best out of our law. I am sure that that will continue to be the case when we bring the new Equality Bill before this House and that conversations which draw on the experience of this House will be had. I am grateful, too, to all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate, particularly my noble friend Lady Howells of St Davids, because she always speaks with total authority and is always clear and compassionate. She always draws our attention to the real implications of our debates and the law that we are discussing.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08052194000059"></a>The issue before us has been of particular concern to the noble Lord, Lord Lester. I am grateful for the opportunity briefly to explain how it fits in with our track record of tackling discrimination and to explain our next steps to improve and simplify the law for the benefit of all.  I hope that he will not be too disappointed if I tell him that I cannot provide specific assurances on the different matters that he raised because we will bring forward shortly a Statement on the equality Bill which the House will understand I cannot pre-empt. I hope that he will understand from the tone of my remarks that he should have every confidence that, in seeking to harmonise existing law, we will seek to address inconsistencies and anomalies such as that which we are debating today in relation to the burden of proof. </p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08052194000060"></a>I hope that I shall be able to go a little beyond telling the noble Lord things which he knows already, but it is useful to place on record the background, because there are two main issues for consideration in this debate. The first is the way in which European and UK law are connected; the second is the way in which their interaction has impacted on issues such as the burden of proof, to which all noble Lords have referred.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1544"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1544</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80521-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08052194000061"></a>The noble Lord will be aware of and welcome the way in which increasing equality has been at the heart of the Government&#146;s policy&#151;I shall not rehearse that. It in a way emphasises the nature of the anomaly that we have tried so hard to bring significant advance in giving individuals the right to fair treatment and to bring equality into the heart of policy-making and improved services.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08052194000062"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s case is that there is a different domestic test for the burden of proof applying to cases where discrimination on grounds of colour and, in effect nationality, is alleged from that which applies to cases where discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic or national origins is alleged. The explanation for that is in the interaction between our historic and wide-reaching law in relation to race and the more recent requirements imposed by European race legislation. Those requirements are in areas that are drawn more narrowly than the protections that we have long applied. The perceived anomalies in the way in which the burden of proof operates for domestic race-discrimination cases are due to the way in which domestic law has been changed to meet our European obligations in respect of race, ethnic and national-origin discrimination. I shall explain why we introduced those changes in the way that we did. We are very keenly aware of those anomalies. We know that they affect other provisions in our race legislation, such as those relating to harassment and to various exceptions in the 1976 Act.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08052194000063"></a>We have also made it clear that we want to address the range of these anomalies. Noble Lords will know that this week in the draft legislation programme we have already announced our intention to introduce a new equality Bill within the lifetime of this Parliament. That was anticipated in the Green Paper, <I>A Framework for Fairness</I>, which outlined the Government&#146;s intentions for the Bill, which is intended to consolidate existing legislation, taking the opportunity to harmonise the law. Particular reference was given in the Green Paper of the Government&#146;s wish to rectify such anomalies, particularly those relating to harassment and contained in the various exceptions.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08052194000064"></a>The Bill will build on our proud record of anti-discrimination legislation. As the years have gone on, the significance of the 1976 Act has become clearer. In particular, the 1976 Act domestically has long been held to cover five separate dimensions of race; namely, racial, national and ethnic origins, and significantly, colour and nationality.  A person who has suffered discrimination on any of those five separate dimensions can claim the protections in the Act. In many ways, this means that the breadth of our domestic race provisions introduced at that time ensured that the protection available in the UK against racial discrimination was way ahead of anything that applied through comparative European legislation.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08052194000065"></a>Since 1976, things have moved on and some of the concepts in UK and European law have also moved on, partly as a result of a body of case law developing over the period.  In 2000, the European Council introduced new protections in what is commonly referred to as the race directive, to implement the  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1545"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1545</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. We should be proud of the role that the UK played in framing that race directive. The then 15 Member States of the European Union were required to implement the directive in full by July 2003.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08052194000066"></a>I emphasise that the breadth of protections in the 1976 Act meant that UK legislation had already met its requirements. The directive introduced certain new obligations that needed to be incorporated into our legislation, one of which was to make changes to the existing law covering the burden of proof with regard to cases of racial discrimination. That was achieved in Article 8 of the race directive, which required member states to adapt their domestic legislation to give effect to the reverse burden of proof in those areas with which the directive is concerned. Therefore, the UK subsequently was required to amend its legislation to reverse the burden in respect of race discrimination and harassment claims falling under the race directive; that is, race, ethnic or national-origin cases.   This is where the problems identified by the noble Lord occurred in domestic legislation.</p>

<a name="80521-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08052194000067"></a>In order to comply with the deadline&#151;I emphasise the deadline&#151;for implementation of the directive, it was decided that rather than wait for an opportunity for primary legislation, which would have brought the burden of proof into full compatibility with the wider scope of UK race relations law, we would utilise the powers in Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 to transpose the additional requirements of the race directive into domestic legislation. That is a simple explanation. Using those powers is a common way of doing it, as the noble Lord knows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08052194000068"></a>The formulation of the race directive in this case meant that its protections are limited to racial, national and ethnic origins, whereas, as I have said&#151;</p>

The Government&#146;s case depends on construing the race directive as excluding colour when it says race and ethnicity. I have tried to ask in Questions for Written Answer whether any other country has interpreted the directive in that way and have got no answer. Could the Minister write to those who have taken part in the debate to answer this question: when the race directive was made and this Government exported the Race Relations Act to it, did we take the position that it would leave out colour? Was that a policy decision we supported? If so, it was contrary to the UN definition that we used in our own race relations law and that is in the preamble to the directive. I do not expect her to answer that now, but whoever interpreted it in this way acted in a way I regard as manifestly unreasonable.</p>

The legal basis  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1546"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column 1546</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the directive is Article 13 of the treaty establishing the European Community, which itself did not refer to colour but to racial and ethnic origins. I will take up the invitation to write to the noble Lord and will pursue the subordinate question as well.</p>

<a name="80521-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08052194000071"></a>Using the powers of that act did not allow for the provisions that it transposes from the race directive to be extended or expanded to cover colour or nationality. That meant that although historically our domestic legislation has recognised and covered five separate dimensions of race, including colour, the new requirements imposed by the race directive could only be introduced on the grounds of racial, ethnic and national origin. The result has been, as noble Lords have reflected, that the protections of the 1976 Act now operate on a two-tier basis. The noble Lord knows that the provisions relating to the burden of proof are only one of the areas where the transposition has resulted in an anomaly; others are those relating to discrimination, indirect discrimination, victimisation and harassment, as well as the several race exceptions.</p>

<a name="80521-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08052194000072"></a>It was recognised at the time of the introduction of the Race Relations (Amendment) Regulations that these anomalies would be created. The then Minister, Beverley Hughes, explicitly acknowledged that the Government would certainly want to take the first opportunity to bring all the relevant provisions into line on nationality, colour and the three dimensions in the directive&#151;race, national and ethnic origins. We did that in relation to Section 54A, entitled &#147;Burden of proof: employment tribunals&#148;, and Section 57ZA, entitled &#147;Burden of proof: county and sheriff courts&#148;. </p>

<a name="80521-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08052194000073"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, asked about the actual impact on the ground. I am thankful that we are not aware of any cases where this has been a major issue. That does not mean in any sense that we have not got to address the problem that has been created. There is a need for total clarity with regard to the protections available through the law. It is an important issue and is already being addressed. These anomalies can only be rectified now by primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08052194000074"></a>Finally on the burden of the noble Lord&#146;s task this evening, yes, we will be introducing a new equality Bill. The Prime Minister&#146;s recent announcement of the draft legislative programme included reference to it. We are committed to introducing the Bill during this Parliament. The noble Lord has already emphasised that it will be widely welcomed in this House but intensely scrutinised as well. We look forward to that. We are proud of our framework of discrimination law but it has become complex. One of the major challenges in these nine pieces of legislation and 100 more that surround those key elements is to bring together, harmonise, consolidate and simplify the law, and to remove inconsistencies. That is one of the key reasons we intend to introduce the equality Bill. It will make the law clearer and easier to use by simplifying and harmonising the patchwork of protections that we have. Simpler law will make for simpler guidance from bodies such as the Equality and Human Rights Commission. As a result, employees and customers will have a better idea of

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08052194000075"></a>On the noble Lord&#146;s comments on the wider issues relating to the Bill, both in the way the new law should be framed and what the Bill should contain, I have to ask for his continuing understanding and patience. We all want a law that is clear, consistent, balanced and positive, which I am sure it will be. As for what the Bill should contain, I am grateful to him for having made his views so clear this evening. They are now on the record. We expect to make a detailed announcement shortly. His views and those of everyone who has spoken this evening will be taken seriously, and the opportunities will be taken to meet them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08052194000076"></a>There has been immense interest in the Bill. We had 4,000 responses to the consultation, which in itself has been a reason for careful and deliberate work to develop our response. I accept that people have grown impatient, too. We want to respond to the conspicuous appetite for a strong Bill by taking steps to strengthen the framework as well as to harmonise and consolidate the existing law. The Bill is intended

Fairness and an absence of discrimination are the hallmarks of a modern and decent society with a strong economy that takes advantage of the talents of all. The Bill will promote fairness and equality. It will tackle disadvantage and discrimination, and will modernise and strengthen the law to make it fit for the challenges of the future.</p>

<a name="80521-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08052194000077"></a>To return to the specific issue of the debate, some of the responses to the Green Paper identified the same types of anomaly which the noble Lord has brought to the attention of the House this evening. As I said, the Government have already indicated their intention to rectify anomalies similar to the one which he has raised. The Bill will provide the opportunity to do that. I hope that, with those assurances, he can have the confidence that he sought in the spirit of the debate. We look forward to the detailed Statement and to the debates that we will have on the Bill.</p>

I approach the issue in the knowledge that the change is largely a done deal. The GMC has already decided to move across to the civil standard. It believes that this is the right thing to do for patients and that it can apply the standard in a way that is fair to doctors. Eight of the health regulatory bodies already use the civil standard, apparently without problem. So the reason for debating the clause is not to oppose the change but rather to ask questions about it.</p>

<p><a name="08052166000009"></a>The Government&#146;s White Paper, <I>Trust, Assurance and Safety</I>, outlined the key differences between the criminal and civil standards, which I do not need to repeat. It then said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08052166000133"></a>&#147;the civil standard of proof can be flexibly applied to take into account the circumstances and gravity of individual cases, with more serious matters requiring a greater degree of probability of the evidence being true&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052166000087"></a>This is a description of the so-called sliding scale of proof. The main argument for this is that, in the adjudication of a fitness-to-practise matter, we are dealing with what is essentially a protective jurisdiction; ultimately, it is the well-being of patients that is at stake. Under the criminal standard, a doctor may survive a challenge to his continued registration and yet, at the same time, come away with serious question marks over his competence as a practitioner. The evidence given by Lady Justice Smith to the Public Bill Committee in another place made clear her support for a move to the civil standard on the grounds that it was more appropriate for offences whose gravity fell short of the seriously criminal. I understand those arguments and, intellectually at least, can sign up to them.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000010"></a>The questions that rear their heads are to do with the implementation of the standard. The sliding scale almost inevitably opens up scope for inconsistency  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC530"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC530</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and therefore unfairness as between different cases of a similar kind. A judgment by a panel that the allegations against a doctor are of a certain gravity and therefore merit a certain standard of proof might not be the same judgment if it were made by another panel. This underscores the need for comprehensive guidance to panels as well as thorough training for panel members. It would be helpful if the Minister could say something about this, bearing in mind that there will not always be a legally qualified person chairing the panel.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000011"></a>One reason why Lady Justice Smith was sanguine about the GMC moving to the civil standard was the thought that a legally qualified chairperson would be familiar with how to apply it. By implication, someone who is not legally qualified will need considerably more in the way of an induction and training. We need to be sure that this is indeed happening.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000012"></a>One aspect of the sliding scale that troubles me is its potential to be unclear and therefore unfair to the professional whose practice is under scrutiny. At the start of a hearing, it may not be evident how high or low the bar of proof needs to be. How can one know what evidence will be required to prove a given matter of fact until one knows how the panel views the gravity of that matter? How fair is that lack of clarity on the doctor and his defence team? Equally, facts may emerge during a hearing that serve to make the defence less or more serious in the eyes of the panel than it appeared to be at the outset. How fair is it on the doctor if the bar of proof moves down or up as the proceedings progress? How will this movement be made known to the defence team? I would be grateful if the Minister could say something about that when she replies.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000013"></a>The BMA has softened its opposition to the change to the civil standard, partly, I think, because it recognises reality: the GMC is going to do it. However, it has consistently voiced a concern that is harboured by many doctors, which is that lowering the bar of factual proof in certain sorts of cases will, however subtly, lead to the practice of defensive medicine. Conscientious doctors, particularly when time is of the essence, want to go the extra mile for their patients. That sometimes means taking calculated risks, which may fall outside the usual norms of professional practice but which can be justified by the gravity of the situation and the lack of worthwhile alternatives. Not always will a doctor be able to consult colleagues about these decisions and not always is informed consent from the patient possible. However, we all know that many worthwhile advances in medical and surgical practice are made by those creative and imaginative doctors who believe that a new procedure is worth a try in the interests of a patient, particularly in an emergency. How ready will doctors be to do this sort of thing in the future?</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000014"></a>In voicing a fear about the growth of defensive medicine, we are not necessarily talking about new and adventurous procedures. A GP conducting his ordinary practice may say to himself that he should play safe by referring patients for diagnostic procedures, which he would not otherwise have done, simply for fear that a wrong decision would, on the balance of probabilities, be viewed as incompetent by  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC531"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC531</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a fitness-to-practise panel. The unintended consequences of that frame of mind would be a huge rise in referrals of every kind and description. How confident is the Minister that this will not, in fact, be the result of these measures? If she is confident, what evidence is she relying on?</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000015"></a>It would not, after all, be odd if doctors were to react in this way. One of the justifications of the move to the civil standard was spelt out in the White Paper, which said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000108"></a>&#147;There is currently a perception ... that the criminal standard of proof ... acts as a bar or an impediment to the referral of complaints to the GMC. It is considered that this ... results in a culture of hesitancy and reluctance to refer cases to the GMC ... It is intended that the use of the sliding civil scale will go some way towards removing this perceived bar or impediment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052166000088"></a>If that is indeed the perception, which I do not doubt, it follows that part of the point of the change to the civil standard will be to alter perceptions in a way that encourages referrals to the GMC rather than discourages them. Doctors will not be slow to grasp this. Does the Minister expect that there will in fact be an increase in the number of referrals to the GMC arising from these changes? If so, is the GMC geared up to deal with that? I hope that she will be able to shed some light on how the Government view the introduction of the civil standard, not so much from a theoretical standpoint as from a practical one.</p>

<p><a name="08052166000016"></a><a name="80521-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08052166000144"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff:</b> I will speak also to the Question whether Clause 119 should stand part of the Bill. It is included in this group simply as a tidying-up exercise and to provide consistency.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000017"></a>My main question to the Minister is why this has to be in legislation. In another place on 15 May the Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000109"></a>&#147;These rules are not contingent on the changes in the law being proposed in the Health and Social Care Bill&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 15/5/08; col. 66WS.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052166000089"></a>The GMC has said in its briefing that it does not need primary legislation to implement the civil standard of proof. If it is not needed in primary legislation and can be implemented anyway, why do we need this provision in the Bill? Sufficient doubts have been raised within the profession and by others outside to make one wonder whether it would not be wiser to allow this change to happen, to let it work through and then, if problems arise, to reverse the requirement to a criminal standard of proof at all times, as that would avoid the need for primary legislation. The change is happening anyway without primary legislation.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000018"></a>It is worth noting that, although it has softened its approach, the BMA feels that there is a lack of confidence in this measure among doctors&#151;a view that I echo. I draw to the Committee&#146;s attention the fact that the Court of Appeal has registered a concern over the confusion that can arise when the civil burden of proof is imposed. The House of Lords concluded that magistrates, for example, should apply the criminal standard in all cases and avoid ever using the civil standard. Even Dame Janet acknowledged in her report on Shipman that it would be unreasonable, without a legally qualified chair, to expect a panel to use the flexible standard properly.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC532"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC532</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000019"></a>It is worth noting what lawyers have done in relation to misconduct. The sliding scale of the civil standard links two extremes, the high end of which corresponds to the criminal standard&#151;beyond reasonable doubt&#151;while the low end corresponds to a balance of probabilities. The disciplinary tribunal of the Law Society and the Bar&#146;s code of conduct require the application of the criminal standard of proof by tribunals dealing with misconduct of lawyers.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000020"></a>Courts have found it confusing when the burden of proof is undefined between the criminal and civil standards, and case law now dictates that the criminal standard of proof is to be used in disciplinary proceedings involving lawyers. There is a sense that the flexible standard could be applied fairly to the regulation of doctors but not to lawyers. The evidence used by those without judicial training and experience seems to have led to difficulties, such that lawyers are now judged only by the criminal standard of proof.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000021"></a>Therefore, I return to the fundamental question: do we need these clauses in the Bill? Is it wise to include them or, given that they are not needed, would it be much wiser not to have them but to allow the GMC changes to continue? I understand from the GMC that one reason why it wants to go to a civil burden of proof is that lesser sanctions would apply than someone being struck off&#151;that is, imposing on a doctor remedial action, retraining, supervision and so on&#151;and it feels that that would be easier. However, given that it is doing that anyway, I simply ask: why have these clauses in the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="08052166000022"></a><a name="80521-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08052166000145"></a>Baroness Tonge:</b> As a member of the medical profession, although it is a long time since I practised, I was quite pleased to see this measure in the Bill. There is a tendency for doctors to put themselves on pedestals and to feel that they are a bit different from other professionals, but when we were told by the BMA&#151;especially in its first briefing&#151;that it would not like to move to the civil standard of proof because, if found guilty, a doctor would lose his livelihood, that seemed to me a weak argument, because that standard applies to all other health professionals. To lose your livelihood is just as important to a nurse, a physiotherapist or a pharmacist as it would be to a doctor.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000023"></a>I thought that the Bill would bring the medical profession into line with other professions and that we would be seen to be dealt with equally. I also thought that the civil standard of proof from the patient&#146;s point of view&#151;I hope that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;allows other incidents and complaints to be considered when someone is before the panel to have their case heard. I may be wrong, but I believe that under the criminal standard evidence can be heard only on the incident that is being investigated and other complaints may not be taken into consideration. However, in cases where, for example, doctors are accused of molesting their patients and the complaint is dismissed the first time and maybe the second time and no one is quite sure about it, such complaints need to be taken into consideration. I hope that people will correct me on that or clarify the position.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000024"></a>My third point is about defensive medicine, which I, like everyone else, worry about. Defensive medicine is here. It has arrived and I do not think that it will be  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC533"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC533</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>only this measure that makes doctors practise medicine more defensively. They will do so because there is more litigation; more people are prepared to follow the American model of suing and trying to make a bit of money if something has gone wrong in the health service. The health service does not have the funds that are available to private insurance companies to meet the demands of patients who sue, although that is another problem for another day. Defensive medicine is coming. Protocols and a lot of procedures have been introduced to do away with the need for a doctor to practise defensive medicine, whereby he knows what he has to do and the protocols that have to be followed.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000025"></a>I think that on the whole it is good that the Government are backing up the General Medical Council on this by bringing in this measure, but I would like to hear the Minister&#146;s reply to the queries that have been raised.</p>
<h5><a name="08052166000139"></a>4 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08052166000026"></a><a name="80521-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08052166000146"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> This is a terribly difficult issue and I was interested in the questions that my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, asked. We need to tease this out.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000027"></a>I have been thinking about my work for the Royal College of Physicians on medical professionalism. After we completed our work, we held 10 roadshows around the country, which were supported by the King&#146;s Fund, entitled, &#147;Do doctors have a future?&#148;. Not surprisingly, they attracted a wide range of clinicians and managers, as well as doctors, of course. The CMO&#146;s report, <I>Good Doctors, Safer Patients</I>, had just been published. We were debating a wide range of issues, particularly whether we should retain the criminal standard of proof or change it to the civil standard. That debate was before the publication of the Bill and the suggestion that there should be a new body to hear cases, the Office of the Health Professions Adjudicator, was not in contention; that part of the issue was not discussed.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000028"></a>I remember some heated discussions at the roadshows by members of the medical profession who said that they felt that the GMC&#146;s sanctions were so devastating to an individual&#146;s livelihood and their reputation that the criminal standard should of course continue. However, others, particularly NHS employers, said to us that they felt that this high hurdle could lead to a situation in which a doctor survived a challenge and remained on the register but was not trusted to look after patients safely. As I understand it&#151;I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, can put me right&#151;that was the view taken by Dame Janet Smith in her fifth report on the Shipman inquiry.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000029"></a>Of course it is true that other professions have disciplinary bodies that are not a criminal court. In this case, there will be no criminal consequences following an appearance before the Office of the Health Professions Adjudicator, nor will the individual face a potential loss of liberty, as they would in a criminal case. Although the standard of proof is notionally lower, it has long been accepted that, the more serious the allegation, the more onerous the consequences and the  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC534"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC534</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>greater the weight of evidence needs to be before any findings can be made, even on the balance of probabilities. That is what we are dealing with&#151;the balance of probabilities.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000030"></a>When a person&#146;s livelihood and reputation are at risk, low-quality or insubstantial evidence will simply not do; evidence has to be of the highest order. In reality, that may mean requiring such good-quality evidence that the panel is satisfied that it may in effect achieve the criminal standard of proof.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000031"></a>The important thing in all this, however, is that the principle is different. The great strength of the civil standard of proof, which, as my noble friend said, already governs the majority of the health regulators, is that it enables flexibility in imposing sanctions. There will be an option to erase doctors from the register in worse cases, but in lesser cases conditions may be attached. That is a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay. For instance, if a surgeon&#146;s practice in operating keyhole surgery is dangerous, that person could continue as a surgeon but could be prevented from carrying out that particular procedure. He might have to consent to retraining or supervision before continuing, but he will keep his livelihood and it will certainly be safer for patients that he has retrained or been under supervision.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000032"></a>As so many of the other professions, such as teachers or the police, work to the civil standard, which is also used in all family courts, I do not see why doctors should be any different, as the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, said. Rather, I think that it would be much better for doctors and much better for patients this way. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s comments in reply, because there are clearly questions to be answered, but my overall feeling is that we should go for this new measure.</p>

<p><a name="08052166000033"></a><a name="80521-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08052166000147"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Clause 107 requires all the healthcare professions&#146; regulatory bodies and the new Office of the Health Professions Adjudicator, OHPA, to use the civil standard of proof. Clause 119 requires the General Social Care Council and the Care Council for Wales to use the civil standard of proof. In practice, most of these bodies already apply the civil standard, but this clause enshrines the civil standard in primary legislation.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000034"></a>The criminal standard of proof requires that panels assessing facts about health professionals must be wholly convinced that the facts are fully proven, beyond any reasonable doubt. The civil standard, on the other hand, requires the decision-maker to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the facts are true or the events occurred&#151;that is, it is more likely than not that the facts are true or that the events occurred. It is important to emphasise that the change to the civil standard will not remove the need for robust evidence to support serious allegations.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000035"></a>So where does the standard of proof apply? There are three steps in the decision-making process. First, the panel must decide if the allegations are true. Have the facts been proven? Secondly, if the panel considers that the facts have been proven, it then has to decide whether the proven facts amount to an impairment of the practitioner&#146;s fitness to practise. Finally, having  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC535"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC535</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>heard factors in mitigation and other representations, the panel must decide whether to impose a sanction on the practitioner&#146;s registration.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000036"></a>The standard of proof applies only at the first stage, where the panel is deciding whether the evidence presented by either party to the hearing is true. The civil standard is not relevant at stage 2, in relation to the decision that a person&#146;s fitness to practise is impaired. That is a matter for the panel to make a judgment on, based on its expertise and knowledge. Nor does the standard of proof apply to stage 3&#151;the decision on what, if any, sanction should be imposed.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000037"></a>I was asked why the Government believe that the civil standard is appropriate. Let me first say that the use of the civil standard of proof reflects the nature of fitness-to-practise hearings. The hearings panel is not a criminal court and is not applying the criminal law. The purpose of the regulatory action is to protect patients, not to punish the practitioner. We agree with Lady Justice Smith that medical regulation is a protective jurisdiction and that therefore the civil standard of proof is appropriate. This argument applies equally to other professions and not just to the health professions.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000038"></a>I know that there have been concerns that the use of the civil standard of proof is unfair to doctors. I believe that the use of the civil standard of proof in fitness-to-practise procedures will ensure a balance between fairness to the accused practitioner and the protection of the public.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000039"></a>Looking at how the civil standard of proof has worked for other health profession regulators, we find no evidence that the civil standard could result in unjustified adverse findings against a doctor, as ably described to the Committee by the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege. There have been suggestions that the change in the standard of proof will lead to more doctors being struck off. However, as I said, the standard of proof used does not determine the sanctions imposed; it just determines the level of certainty required in establishing whether the facts or events did or did not occur. The experience of the General Dental Council, which is still in the transition stage of changing to the civil standard, is that there has been no increase in erasures.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000040"></a>It is not as though changing from the criminal to the civil standard of proof is something new or untried. The civil standard of proof is already used by the majority of health and social care regulators. Of the eight health regulatory bodies, only three still use the criminal standard&#151;the General Medical Council, the General Optical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The others and the regulators of social care workers have been using the civil standard successfully.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000041"></a>The General Medical Council has already, independently, decided to move to the civil standard of proof ahead of being required to do so by this Bill. The move to the civil standard matches best practice in other areas. For example, the Independent Police Complaints Commission has successfully used the civil standard of proof since 1999. The civil standard

<a name="80521-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000042"></a>Concerns have been raised about the possibility of panels finding it difficult to understand how to apply flexibly the civil standard. I hope that I can reassure noble Lords by saying that the General Dental Council, which, as I said, is in the transition stage of moving to the civil standard, has told us that not only are its panels coping with this very well, but they are coping very well when they still have to hear some cases under the criminal standard. That is a testament to the effectiveness of the training that the General Dental Council has provided in preparation for the change.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000043"></a>I turn to some specific questions raised by noble Lords. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the issue of training and asked what the GMC is doing to prepare for the change. The GMC has carried out an extensive training programme for those directly affected by the introduction of the civil standard of proof, including panellists, legal assessors&#151;lawyers who advise panellists on points of law during hearings&#151;its in-house legal team and GMC staff involved in fitness-to-practise work. The training programme has been tailored to meet the needs of that particular audience, so that legal assessors, panellists and panel secretaries receive fairly detailed training, which includes a number of legal judgments, while panellist training includes a number of case studies. The training for investigation staff, who are not directly involved to the same degree, provides an overview of the change.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000044"></a>The noble Earl asked how consistency in the application of the standard can be assured. In addition to formal training, the GMC provides regular bulletins and other communications to panel chairmen and legal assessors. This flow of information about process and procedure includes updates on appeal cases, including those on regulators&#146; cases, relevant judicial reviews and statements on salient points of adjudication.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000045"></a>The GMC has a panel development team, which deals with panellists&#146; inquiries, monitors panellist feedback, provides the secretariats for a panellist forum in regular meetings between GMC managers and panellists&#146; representatives, audits all panel decisions, provides feedback, takes responsibility for panellist recruitment and retention, carries out panellist appraisal and assessment, maintains the list and provides management information on panel activity. We expect that OHPA will consider having similar arrangements in place.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000046"></a>The noble Earl asked about legally qualified chairmen. As eight out of the 11 heath professional regulators already use the civil standard, the vast majority do not have legally qualified chairmen. Perhaps the proof of fairness lies in the very low number of successful appeals to the High Court. He also asked about hearings, facts and evidence. I have outlined what the fitness-to-practise panel will do. It will have the assistance of a legal chair or assessors to advise it. He asked whether we anticipate more referrals for hearings.

Decision-makers at that stage will inevitably be influenced by perceptions of the likelihood of the facts underlying a complaint being proved. The General Dental Council has not found any increases in erasures at the decision stage of adjudication.</p>

<p><a name="08052166000047"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, asked why this needs to be in the Bill. That was answered very well by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge. We think that changing to the civil standard is the right thing to do. It is a recommendation of the Shipman inquiry, and many regulators are already using it. We want to ensure consistency, not just now but in future, so that all health and social care regulators use that standard. That is why it is in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000048"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, spoke about defensive medicine, an issue that was also raised in another place. The noble Earl, too, asked whether health professionals would practise more defensively, erring on the side of caution. That argument rests on the idea that under the criminal standard professionals might choose more risky but potentially more effective clinical interventions. The Government do not believe that that would be the case. We do not believe that healthcare professionals will behave in that manner as a result of this change. We have confidence in their high professional standards and commitment to their patients. Where there is doubt, uncertainty or significant risk in making such judgments, healthcare professionals, who usually work in teams with other professionals, would generally make such decisions in consultation with their colleagues to ensure consensus of expert opinion and agreement.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000049"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, asked what civil standards allow one to consider when making a judgment. It has been suggested that the change to the civil standard of proof will enable a panel to consider hearsay evidence. It is up to the chair of the panel to decide the admissibility of evidence, having taken into account representations from the parties concerned. This is a matter of civil procedure, as dealt with in procedural rules, not of the standard of proof. Once the evidence is admitted, the facts have to be considered by the panel using the civil standard of proof. I confirm that the change to civil standards will not affect in any way the admissibility of evidence or whether new evidence can be considered during the proceedings.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000050"></a>The change to the civil standard of proof enshrined in primary legislation will address concerns that the use of the criminal standard protects the interests of the professionals at the expense of the interests of patients. There is no convincing argument that one set of healthcare professionals should be treated in a different way from another set of healthcare professionals. This clause will ensure that we maintain consistency across the professional regulatory bodies so that the same level of protection is offered to all patients, no matter what kind of professional is caring for them.</p>

Where is the evidence for that? The GMC has been working for a long time to try to protect patients. That is in its mission statement and its long name. It is the General Medical Council, but its role is to protect patients; it is not there to protect doctors.</p>

<p><a name="08052166000052"></a><a name="80521-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08052166000149"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I accept what the noble Baroness says, but I shall read out a quotation from the report by Nigel Pleming QC on the Kerr/Haslam case.</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000110"></a>&#147;There are clearly lessons to be learned by the GMC from the Michael Haslam case. One particular concern is whether or not there is any justification, in the interest of the public and of patients, for the retention of the criminal standard of proof at GMC disciplinary proceedings, and generally treating those proceedings as if the GMC was engaged in some form of pseudocriminal process. Of course, where the allegations are particularly serious&#151;amounting, if the subject of police investigation, to a serious crime&#151;it is less likely that the doctor will have acted as alleged. But that difficulty can be addressed without the need to adopt any recourse to criminal standards of proof, or the trappings of a criminal trial. Where the allegations would also amount to serious criminal wrongdoing, probability is, rightly, not easily established&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000053"></a>The point is that the GMC has taken the right decision. I was not suggesting that it is not concerned with protecting patients&#151;not in the least&#151;but using a civil standard of proof absolutely makes the case that that is what it is doing.</p>

<p><a name="08052166000054"></a><a name="80521-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08052166000150"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff:</b> I understand that the GMC has been keen to separate the investigation from the adjudication, which is precisely what is being provided for here. However, I remain concerned that we do not have to have primary legislation to do this. All the arguments for going with the civil standard of proof are that that will make available appropriate sanctions against doctors. I should like to take this away and think about it, because it is happening anyway. When I spoke to the president of the GMC, he, too, said that he did not understand why this needed primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="08052166000055"></a><a name="80521-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08052166000151"></a>Earl Howe:</b> This has been a useful debate. I thank the Minister for her reply. What doctors will want to be confident about is that the process is fair, in the sense of being consistent&#151;and, if I can use the word without being misunderstood, reproducible. They need to be able to predict in advance how the civil standard will be applied. It is still not wholly clear to me that they necessarily will be able to, which is why I am uneasy about this proposal.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000056"></a>We need to bear in mind the fact that two major changes to fitness-to-practise adjudication proceedings are happening more or less at once, the first being the change in the standard of proof and the second being the increase in lay representation. Like it or not, different lay individuals bring their own values to a particular allegation. If a doctor has been accused of conducting an inappropriate internal examination on a female patient, one person on the panel may see that as a minor deviation from best practice, whereas another could regard it as a serious assault. Even if the facts of the case are fully understood, those differences of values are bound to come to the fore on occasion.  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC539"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC539</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That is one reason why, when looking back at our earlier amendment, I totally take on board the GMC&#146;s desire to make sure that its indicative sanctions guidance has some standing in the way in which penalties are administered.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000057"></a>It is not just a question of penalties; it is also a question of how facts are interpreted. In the case that I have just imagined, the balance of probabilities is not only about whether the doctor conducted the internal examination; it is also about why he did so, what his motivations were and how he conducted himself during the consultation. The judgment of a lay person on those matters could well be quite different from the judgment of someone who is medically trained.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000058"></a>I am not arguing against lay membership of panels but merely pointing out that, for the profession to be confident in the integrity and consistency of the process, the combination of a sliding scale and lay membership of panels may create uncertainty rather than confidence. I have a high regard for the GMC and its current leadership and have to say that its latest note to parliamentarians gives us reassurance about how it is approaching the implementation of the standard.</p>

We are in a transitional phase with the GMC and, as will shortly be the case, with OHPA. A lot is happening at once; it is quite a major change. I do not doubt that some years down the track what the noble Baroness says will be entirely accepted. As I say, it is not so much that we cannot sign up to the theory of what is happening; our concern is about the practical consequences of the proposals. We need to make sure that they are being handled as doctors would want. I accept the Minister&#146;s basic point. I think that, with the consent of the Committee, it is time to move on, but I once again thank all noble Lords who have contributed.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000063"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment would give to dentists, through the General Dental Council, the rights that doctors already have under the General Medical Council. When I have asked the GDC and the Department of Health why only practising dentists can be on the register, the answer has always been that there was a flaw in the Dentists Act 1984, which did not allow my profession to be treated in the same way as the medical profession.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000064"></a>A letter from the Department of Health dated 2 April confirms that again. For clarification, I shall mention another point in that letter, which was sent following Second Reading. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000116"></a>&#147;You also mentioned that the General Medical Council is entitled to hold a list of non-practising doctors. I thought it might be helpful for me to clarify that is not the case. The General Medical Council holds a single register which does not differentiate between practising and non-practising doctors. A doctor can choose to remain on the register after retirement on payment of the appropriate fee. Currently there is an age related waiver of the registration fee for registrants over 65 years of age&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052166000090"></a>I was wrong in thinking that the GMC holds separate lists; it holds both practising and non-practising doctors on its list.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000065"></a>The General Dental Council used to have an age-related reduced fee for dentists. In 2002, this was &#163;15. In 2003, it jumped to &#163;40&#151;more than double&#151;and, in 2004, it was abolished. Any dentist thereafter was asked to pay the full fee of &#163;388. That was an almost a tenfold increase for older dentists, from &#163;40 to almost &#163;400. The current fee is &#163;438. Those who believed that that was too great an increase for people not actually in practice, and therefore without an income and unable to claim tax deduction, decided not to pay. I was one. I remember that I received a notice saying that I would be &#147;struck off&#148; the register&#151;a phrase used for malpractice. That terminology caused such offence that it was soon amended; I understand that the phrase that is now used is, &#147;Your name will be removed from the register&#148;. It is believed that about 2,500 dentists who would probably have been happy to pay, say, &#163;100 a year were struck off that year, representing lost revenue of &#163;250,000 to the GDC.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000066"></a>There is a further problem in that currently the register contains only the names of practising dentists who have complied with the continuing professional development&#151;CPD&#151;criteria. That was phased in from 2002. An annual practising certificate is available to those who have paid the annual fee of &#163;438 and done the 250 hours of continuing professional development, 75 of which must be verifiable, over five years. There is no provision for leave of absence from the register for illness or maternity reasons and, if a dentist&#146;s name is removed, he or she must apply for reinstatement and pay an additional fee of &#163;110, making the fee &#163;548. Doctors can and do remain on the medical register  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC541"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC541</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>without a practising certificate. The difference is that only those with a practising certificate can practise. That is what I am suggesting for dentists.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000067"></a>I consider it to be in the interests of the public and the profession that dentists should be entitled to apply the same principles to their register&#151;that the right to practise will belong only to those who have an annual practising certificate. It is important to make it clear that I am not trying to force the General Dental Council to introduce such a system; that would be for that body to decide in consultation with the profession, I would hope. My intention is simply to remove the legal obstacle that I have been told by members and past presidents of the GDC has prevented it from doing this. I find it hard to credit that the GDC opposes my amendment and is even lobbying against it. It is only an enabling amendment.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000068"></a>The amendment would also be appropriate when revalidation is introduced; it would avoid the need for further legislation at that time. I have a copy of an article from <I>GMCtoday</I> entitled, &#147;Your Licence to Practise&#148;, which is about doctors. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000117"></a>&#147;In future, there will be three options. You may hold registration plus a licence to practise. You may decide to hold registration only, or you may take voluntary erasure from the register&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052166000091"></a>The article goes on to ask:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000118"></a>&#147;Why would a doctor want to hold registration only?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052166000092"></a>The answer, the article states, is:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000119"></a>&#147;When the concept of revalidation was first introduced back in 1998, a significant number of doctors who are not in active practice expressed concern that they would lose their connection with the GMC. They saw their GMC registration as part of their professional identity. We will therefore make it possible for them to maintain their connection with the GMC by continuing to hold GMC registration, but without a licence. There will be a cost for this, although it will be less than the cost of holding a licence plus registration. However, doctors with registration only will not be able to practise. Of course, doctors who see no advantage in holding registration only will be able to take voluntary erasure from the register. This will cost them nothing&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000069"></a>I have received many letters of support from dentists and it is interesting to see the different angles and requirements that they have. I shall mention a few of them. The first letter is from someone who complained on three grounds. The first was that he would no longer be able to sign people&#146;s passport applications. I do not think that non-practising doctors can do that, so that is not a relevant point. Secondly, he was unable to complete any former employees&#146; documents for GDC registration; in other words, he had been the principal dentist but could not sign for any of those who had worked for him unless he still had a GDC registration number. Thirdly, he stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="08052166000134"></a>&#147;the Dental Defence Union advises that I am not covered for discretionary assistance in respect of the Good Samaritan&#146;s Act unless my name is on the GDC Register&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052166000093"></a>That is important, because in France the obligation is on you to be a good Samaritan. In this country, it seems that everything is against your being a good Samaritan, because people can sue you about everything.</p>

<p><a name="08052166000070"></a>I shall read only a snippet of each letter, otherwise we would be here for days&#151;and I have brought only a few of them. The next letter states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000120"></a>&#147;There are many retired dentists who could contribute to the profession in positions that do not involve clinical contact with patients, but those positions still require them to be registered&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052166000094"></a>I have been given examples about writing for or editing journals and so on. The letter continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000121"></a>&#147;Society is losing out on a valuable source of expertise ... I do not find the GDC&#146;s attitude to be consistent with care for the public and it is not representative of the profession who pay for its existence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000071"></a>Another letter states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000122"></a>&#147;Even though retired, I still write a monthly column for <I>Dental Practice</I>&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052166000095"></a>These are cases where people should know that these were qualified dentists. Another letter provides a different angle and states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000123"></a>&#147;My former partner ... in 1990 at the age of 32, contracted an illness after doing voluntary dental work in Africa. It was &#145;diagnosed&#146; as ME, totally debilitating and was sufficient to make him retire from clinical dentistry&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052166000096"></a>The letter goes on to state how he needed an income and so on and that he then qualified as a lawyer&#151;and he is doing all right. This demonstrates the case of someone who is young and unable to continue practising. Perhaps he could have returned to dentistry despite that condition, but because he was so disillusioned by being removed from the register, was unable to afford to pay the fee and there was no leave of absence, he did something different. However, he is a loss to the profession.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000072"></a>Another letter says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000124"></a>&#147;Of course there must be checks and balances. Of course the GDC must ensure the protection of the public, but its hands are tied and it cannot make the choices which it would wish&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052166000097"></a>I dispute that statement from that dentist, because, as I say, the GDC is lobbying against this proposal, as if I was trying to force it to do this. All the indemnity insurance is covered.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000073"></a>Women dentists wanting to have a family might want leave of absence for a couple of years&#151;but, no, if they want to do that, they must either pay the full fee for continuing professional registration or go off the register and pay the additional fee to come back. There is no provision whatever for career breaks, while doctors, of course, can have them. Someone told me that, when they had said how sad it was that they had to go off this year, they were treated very abruptly on the telephone by the GDC and got no sympathy at all. Someone else said that he was &#147;virtually excluded&#148; from his profession, which he found very hurtful. He went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000125"></a>&#147;My parents made great sacrifices in the 50s to get me through Dental School&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052166000098"></a>In another letter, a man from the Society for the Advancement of Anaesthesia in Dentistry said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000126"></a>&#147;As Hon. Secretary of SAAD I am obliged to be on the register when giving advice to dentists, and when I am examining. This means that I must attend courses that have no relevance to my current situation in order to fulfil my CPD requirements&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052166000099"></a>A number of people have told me that they serve on boards or even trusts and cannot claim to be dentists because they are no longer on the register.</p>

<p><a name="08052166000074"></a>The most interesting letter of all was from a woman dentist, who told me how hard this was fought by the profession. She said that members of the GDC had tried to get such a measure through but were told that it could not be done on legal grounds. She said that she was now 85 and that she had qualified at the age of 21 in 1944, having spent the war years studying in King&#146;s College, London. She survived all the doodlebugs and everything else. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000127"></a>&#147;I followed my father into dentistry and it is a profession that has been in my family since very young&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08052166000100"></a>There were seven of them, and apparently they were all dentists. She went on to say:</p>

<p><a name="08052166000103"></a>She has,</p>

<p><a name="08052166000105"></a>There is a lot more of great interest of the letter, which goes on to say:</p>

<p><a name="08052166000075"></a>The next letter is about a dental hypnotist. I cannot comment very much, as I do not know anything about dental hypnotists. In fact, it is from the man who edits the general dental practitioners&#146; journal, who says that he has had a lot of responses, including this response from a dental hypnotist. He says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000131"></a>&#147;Unfortunately as you probably know the GDC is lobbying quite hard against the change&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08052166000106"></a>Again, I am not sure why. The final letter says, again, how the GDC has met the correspondent with only,</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000076"></a>I could go on and on, but I shall not. I spoke to the GDC itself and asked it to tell me what the loophole was and why doctors could do this when dentists could not. The response from the man from the GDC was that he did not really know but would try to find out. He went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052166000132"></a>&#147;Whether this is a fault or not depends on one&#146;s point of view I suppose. I can imagine various ways of doing what you want&#151;by enabling the creation of a non-practising category (with the right to use the protected titles but not to practise dentistry) or by separating completely registration and licence to practise, with different requirements in each case&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000077"></a>He goes on to say that he will let me know when he has more of an answer to it. That was from the GDC.</p>

<p><a name="08052166000078"></a>I said at Second Reading that there should be a separate list. I do not care about any of the procedures of this; it is entirely a matter for the General Dental Council whether it makes a separate list. Under the revalidation scheme it may be that in due course the doctors need to list such people separately.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000079"></a>I think that dentists, both public and private, should be treated in the same way as doctors are. I cannot understand why there should be a difference. It should be the case that you can practise if you have, in medicine, a practising certificate and, in dentistry, this annual practising certificate. If you do not have that, you cannot practise. There are many situations where it would be important for the body on which you serve to know that you had been an honourable dentist, now retired or having voluntarily ceased practice perhaps because of whatever else you are doing. There is merit in distinguishing between you and those people who have been bad dentists and who have been struck off. There is no way at the moment of knowing which category you are in.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000080"></a>I declare a personal interest because, if the provision were introduced, I would probably pay my &#163;100. I do not know that I would. I might be too old and, like that 84 year-old, not bother. I am not guaranteeing whether I will go back on the register, but I believe that it should be possible for dentists to do this. That is what my amendment proposes. It would simply enable the General Dental Council, in consultation with the profession, to take this action. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08052166000081"></a><a name="80521-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08052166000155"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Amendment No. 137 would amend the Dentists Act 1984 to allow retired dentists to remain on the dentists register on the payment of a reduced fee. It also makes provision for such dentists to be restored to the register on payment of a fee if the reason for their erasure was non-payment of that fee.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000082"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, is correct that the Dentists Act does not currently contain a provision that would allow for this. I fully understand the feeling of loss of connection to the profession when a dentist retires. As the noble Baroness knows, I have a great deal of sympathy with the argument that she has made. Removal from the register signifies that a dentist is no longer in practice but, as the noble Baroness has so eloquently described, it also means a great deal else. My officials have spoken to the General Dental Council about this issue. Its view remains that the dentists register exists to protect the public and that it is not appropriate for it to maintain a list of former dentists.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08052166000083"></a>The noble Baroness made a powerful case. I would like to reassure her that, should the view of the General Dental Council on this point change in the future, the Government would consider making such a change through an order under Section 60 of the Health Act 1999. We do not consider that primary legislation would be required. It is therefore not necessary to make such a provision in this Bill, as we already have the flexibility to do this through secondary legislation, if the need arises. I can feel a campaign coming on here. We do not think that it would be appropriate to accept this amendment

As we are in Committee, and we cannot divide in any case, I have no alternative but to withdraw my amendment. I do so under the impression that we can discuss this matter further. I am slightly concerned about the General Dental Council having to agree to the provision, as all the good things that I have seen happen through the General Dental Council over the years have come from pressure within the profession for changes. That is why I was keen to have an enabling amendment, which would mean that the General Dental Council could no longer hide behind what has clearly been a distortion of the truth for many years&#151;its saying that this cannot be done. When I tabled the amendment, I was told that the council could have applied at any time to any Government for an amendment to be made under Section 60, to which the Minister referred. That option was always open to the council, yet it always denied that this could be done without primary legislation. Therefore, even for the Minister to have placed that on record is extremely valuable. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000007"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 139 would allow Amendment No. 140 to be inserted. During the previous debate, it struck me that one of the first jobs of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence might be to get the General Dental Council to learn a few lessons from the General Medical Council&#146;s book on more modernised and open procedures. I wish the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, well in her mission to do that.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000008"></a>The amendment would ensure openness of procedures. The council will be taking major decisions to protect the public from malpractice and, as such, the public deserve to be assured that the processes will be undertaken without undue delay and without any bias. On a previous day in Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Golding, gave details of the processes that contain potential bias and explained how that can result in a

I am concerned about how, without open reporting and scrutiny, the public and the professions will be assured that the council is working well.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000009"></a>In the light of our previous discussions, it might be helpful to consider the fitness-to-practise statistics. At the moment, there are about 244,000 doctors on the medical register and approximately 5,000 complaints a year are received by the GMC, of which between 1,300 and 1,800 are investigated. Only 300 of these cases are referred to a hearing, resulting in around 40 to 50 doctors being erased each year. This gives one an idea of the funnelling-down of the disciplinary processes. While we have addressed the issue of erasure, the GMC has put in place many other remedial actions and retraining procedures.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000010"></a>I hope that the amendments are self-explanatory in relation to timeliness and independence. An undue delay in procedures is damaging to the professionals, to the patient population and their families, to those involved in investigations and to those who have brought forward cases. As time goes on, the damage tends to be cumulative; questions are asked and trust is lost. However, if issues are dealt with in a timely way, trust in the process is more likely to be retained by all parties. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08052182000011"></a><a name="80521-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08052182000056"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Amendments Nos. 139A and 141 are grouped with the amendment of the noble Baroness. Amendment No. 139A is simple but its purpose is to address an important point. Clause 110, as we have heard, covers the powers and duties of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence. In proposed new subsection (4)(c), the council is given the explicit power of,</p>
<ul><a name="08052182000050"></a>&#147;investigating particular cases with a view to making general reports on the performance by the regulatory body of its functions&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08052182000044"></a>and so on. The word that sticks out like a sore thumb is &#147;investigating&#148;. Is it really the Government&#146;s intention that the CHRE should carry out investigations into individual cases? The word &#147;investigate&#148; is defined in my Chambers dictionary as,</p>
<ul><a name="08052182000051"></a>&#147;to search or inquire into with care and accuracy&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052182000045"></a>I have grave doubts about whether that is what the CHRE should be doing. The purpose of its work is to audit the work of the regulators. In doing that, it certainly needs to look at a selection of individual cases, but it surely will not take it upon itself to investigate those cases ab initio as if it were the Criminal Cases Review Commission or some kind of appeals body. If the CHRE were to do that, not only would that be resource intensive, but the council would run the risk of being looked on by lawyers as a source of useful material from which a case for appeal against an adjudication could be mounted. To say that it can investigate individual cases implies that it will be able to reconsider the evidence and facts of a case as if it were intending to confirm or overturn a panel decision. That is not what the CHRE is there to do. In the amendment, I am suggesting that &#147;scrutinising&#148; might be a better word than &#147;investigating&#148;. To scrutinise means to examine closely, which is surely what is meant here.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC547"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC547</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000012"></a>Amendment No. 141 relates to new Section 26A to be inserted into the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002, which established the CHRE. Subsection (3) of the new section states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052182000049"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may give directions to the Council as to the manner in which the Council exercises its functions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052182000046"></a>I question seriously whether that power is appropriate. We need to remind ourselves what the CHRE is and what it does. It is what is known as an executive non-departmental public body. It is a type of arm&#146;s-length body. &#147;Arm&#146;s-length&#148; means that it does not have to refer any of its decisions back to its sponsoring department; its decisions cannot be overturned by the department or by Ministers; it does not have to explain to the department why it has made a particular decision; and it does not have to give the department details of its decisions. In this sense, it is similar to the OHPA and Monitor, both of which are executive non-departmental public bodies. Like them, the CHRE is operationally independent of government and Ministers.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000013"></a>The CHRE has two main functions. The first is to oversee and check the medical regulatory bodies and the second is to encourage harmonisation of working methods and practice across the various regulators, as the noble Baroness reminded us. In doing that, it acts as an independent voice for patients. Independence has two elements: independence from the regulators and independence from government. It is no accident that the CHRE is accountable directly to Parliament. It meets in public in all four countries of the United Kingdom to discuss its annual report. Its whole way of working is transparent. Against that background, I do not think that a power of direction in the hands of the Secretary of State couched in broad and general terms is consistent with the letter or the sprit of the founding legislation. I do not think that it should be there. It would be helpful to hear from the Minister why she believes that such a power should be granted. </p>

<p><a name="08052182000014"></a><a name="80521-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08052182000057"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> I support my noble friend. I fear that I am boring for Britain on the subject of the independence of these bodies. I cannot understand why the Secretary of State seems so keen on controlling all these independent regulators. I am beginning to wonder whether he has enough to do. Does he feel underemployed? Is he anxious that he may be made redundant? Knowing the Secretary of State, I think that that is extremely unlikely. His workload is probably horrendous, so here is an opportunity to give him a little more time to enjoy himself and have a day out with the family and perhaps not be quite so involved in all these different regulators.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000015"></a>As my noble friend said, proposed new Section 26(3) gives the Secretary of State the power to direct. That undermines the CHRE&#146;s independence and is unnecessary. One point not made overtly by my noble friend is that, as the regulator covers all the countries in the United Kingdom, this provision, which refers only to England and Wales, creates an imbalance with the devolved Administrations, which could be subject to conflicting requirements. At present, the Secretary of State requests the regulator to do some work. Although I know that the noble Lord, Lord Walton,  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC548"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC548</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is anxious to abolish this regulator, it seems to me that it is an important part of the regulatory jigsaw. We know it to be a reasonable body; it has never refused a request from the Secretary of State. Independence allows some practical negotiation on the scope, timing and use of available resources.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000016"></a>I understand that the CHRE is doing some extra work investigating the NMC at the request of the Secretary of State. It is also doing additional work on pharmacy and has been asked to advise the Northern Ireland Office. The clause is not necessary and it undermines the independence of the CHRE.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000017"></a>I support the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay. I remember many years ago when the General Medical Council was very slow at hearing cases. As the noble Baroness ably said, that was part of the problem of the lack of trust that grew with the GMC. Her suggestion that it should be monitored and a report made to Parliament would keep the GMC on its toes. I know that recently it has done much better but we do not know what the future will hold, so this would be a good measure.</p>

<p><a name="08052182000018"></a><a name="80521-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08052182000058"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Amendments Nos. 139 and 140 would widen the powers and duties of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence. The amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, would require the CHRE to audit the timeliness and independence of all processes within healthcare professional regulation.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000019"></a>I sympathise entirely with the spirit of these amendments. I know that the noble Baroness is trying to ensure that fitness-to-practise procedures in particular happen within acceptable timescales and are fair and independent. I could not agree more with those principles. However, the amendments, as drafted, would extend the remit of the CHRE to every possible facet of healthcare professional regulation at both local and national levels. That would dilute the focus of what is already a small organisation and it would make the CHRE, in having to cover such a wide remit, far less effective in the reporting role that it already has.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000020"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, may be reassured to know that this existing reporting role extends to all the processes of the health regulatory bodies. The CHRE already has a statutory duty to hold annual reviews of regulatory body performance and to provide an annual report to Parliament, as has been mentioned. Clause 109(6) strengthens its existing review powers by requiring the CHRE, when providing its annual report to Parliament, to state how far each regulatory body has complied with any duty imposed on it to promote the health, safety and well-being of patients and the public. Clearly, the timeliness and independence of regulatory body processes are part of promoting the health, safety and well-being of patients and the public. Therefore, if the CHRE felt that a regulatory body was delaying the hearing of cases in an unacceptable way, or if the independence of a regulatory body&#146;s processes was undermined, it would have to state that in its assessment of the performance of that body as part of its annual report to Parliament.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000021"></a>Amendment No. 139A would amend new Section 26(4) of the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002 by replacing the  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC549"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC549</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>word &#147;investigating&#148; with &#147;scrutinising&#148;. Before saying why I cannot support this amendment, I must first explain that Section 26 of the 2002 Act sets out that the CHRE may do anything that appears to it to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of, or in connection with, the performance of its functions. Section 26(2) sets out what the CHRE may do, which includes investigating and reporting on how each regulatory body has performed its functions. I know that noble Lords will agree that the ability to report on how each regulatory body does its job is crucial to the CHRE in holding the regulators to account on behalf of patients and the public.</p>
<h5><a name="08052182000054"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000022"></a>Section 26(4), as amended by the Bill, is a clarifying provision and does not confer any additional functions on the CHRE. Instead, it clarifies that the CHRE can consider individual cases to help to compile general reports on regulatory body performance or make general recommendations to the regulatory body. We have therefore used the word &#147;investigating&#148; in the amended Section 26(4) to match the wording of the existing legislation, which enables the CHRE to investigate the performance of each regulatory body. Any other wording would be inconsistent and might lead to doubts about the intention of the amended section.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000023"></a>I am happy to reassure noble Lords that the word &#147;investigating&#148; here absolutely does not mean that there will be a reinvestigation of individual cases; rather, it clarifies that the CHRE can investigate how particular cases have been dealt with by the regulators in order to reach all-important general conclusions about the performance of a regulator.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000024"></a>Amendment No. 141 would remove new Section 26A(3) from the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002. New Section 26A(3), to be inserted by Clause 111, allows the Secretary of State to give directions to the CHRE on the way in which it carries out its functions. The Secretary of State must consult the CHRE, Welsh Ministers, Scottish Ministers and the relevant department in Northern Ireland before giving any directions. I hope that I can satisfy the noble Earl and the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, that this provision is justified. I should add that the noble Baroness is not at all boring; she is asking legitimate questions.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000025"></a>I emphasise that this power is not designed to be used regularly. It is a backstop and is to be used only rarely to ensure that the CHRE is able to function properly and that it addresses any key issues of concern in healthcare regulation. It will enable the Secretary of State to require the CHRE to look at a particular public concern about a regulatory issue&#151;for example, if it were widely felt that a piece of work needed to be done to address an issue relevant to all health professional regulatory bodies.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000026"></a>The power has also been included as a result of concerns that the CHRE&#146;s workload could occasionally be too great and that, as a small organisation, it might not have the resources to carry out all its functions at the same time. In these circumstances, the Secretary of State could have a role in helping the CHRE to set its priorities. This would

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000027"></a>In the ordinary course of events, we will reach agreement with the CHRE without needing to use this power. However, there may be a small number of occasions when it is better that the Secretary of State issues directions so that the reason for the CHRE focusing on some areas above others is clear and transparent. It is important to emphasise that the power is intended to direct the CHRE only on the way in which it carries out its functions. It cannot be used to interfere with or change in any way the core functions or results of the work of the CHRE.</p>

<p><a name="08052182000028"></a>I hope that I have been able to provide noble Lords with the necessary reassurances and that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08052182000029"></a><a name="80521-gc0003.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0003.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08052182000059"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff:</b> I am most grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarification. I can see that the wording of my amendment would almost impose micromanagement, which would certainly not be appropriate. I feel somewhat reassured by the assurances that are on the record about how the council should work and what must be in the annual reports.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000030"></a>However, I should like to pick up on two important points raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, in relation to investigation. I wonder whether that part of the clause needs to be reworded to provide clarification for just the same reasons. The current wording almost implies the potential for micromanagement and suggests that something could be used later in an appeal against a decision.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000031"></a>My other concern relates to the devolved Administrations. I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, as I am usually pretty vigilant about devolved Administrations and I missed a trick here. I can see that there would be merit in not only referring to consultation but saying that there must be agreement between the Health Ministers in the devolved Administrations, because health is devolved. The overseeing of the registration of healthcare professionals is a UK-wide responsibility and requires consistency across the whole of the UK for the way in which they work, in whichever system they work. We have four different healthcare systems emerging now, so if the Secretary of State had powers left in here I would wish the Secretary of State to have to consult.</p>

<p><a name="08052182000032"></a>I feel that I have to defend my Minister of Health in the National Assembly for Wales, with whom I had a constructive meeting yesterday and who is very engaged in issues for healthcare professions at a local level within Wales. It would be hard, within a devolved pattern of healthcare delivery, to find that there was a consultation but that, even if the Minister disagreed strongly, something was somehow imposed. But with those caveats around the amendments that are not mine, I shall not press my amendment.</p>

To use the word &#147;investigating&#148; in relation to the performance of a medical regulator is entirely appropriate. The CHRE can be tasked and is tasked with investigating the performance of the regulators. However, to say that it may investigate individual cases in support of that task is an unnecessary adherence to symmetry in the drafting, if I can put it that way.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08052182000034"></a>On Amendment No. 141, it seems to me that to say that,</p>

<p><a name="08052182000047"></a>is a very broad power of direction. I note what the noble Baroness has said about how that power might be used and that there is no sinister intent, but to give the example that Ministers may want to direct the council as to how it prioritises its workload is very odd. That can surely be done without the council being directed.</p>

</ul><ul>

</ul>
<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000003"></a>The noble Baroness said: We come to a slightly different part of the Bill, which relates to responsible officers, who are being charged with the early identification of problems and thereby remediation of problems before they get to the point where they damage patient care. As a principle, that is to be welcomed. There are rigorous and well established processes already, but they might prove impractical in relation to responsible officers as outlined in the Bill. This does not really relate to those working in trusts, where there are already clear appraisal processes, but it relates to those working in general practice. There is a concern that the responsible officer might be someone who is either too close to or has some bias against the person whom they are overseeing.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000004"></a>The way in which the Bill is drafted gives rise to the concern that the responsible officer does not necessarily have to be a registered medical practitioner. If one is  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC552"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC552</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>looking at a degree of self-regulation and the early identification of problems, there is a lot of wisdom in making sure that the responsible officer has a medical background. This is currently the case in trusts, where the medical director is the person to whom the doctor would be answerable.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000005"></a>Amendment No. 144 has been drafted to cover situations where personal issues are involved. In such cases the responsible officer is not automatically designated but provision is made for an alternative responsible officer to be appointed. Two examples of where this might apply have been brought to my attention by doctors. The first example is a marital dispute involving two doctors, where either they have been married and then divorced or one of them has had an involvement with the spouse of the other, which can create a tense and difficult environment. The other example, a situation which has already arisen, is where the medical director of a PCT had a serious falling out, at practice level, with one of the partners and the partner had nowhere to go to seek support. She was very keen to have the choice of going to a responsible officer at a neighbouring PCT for her professional registration to be overseen and scrutinised because of the fear of vindictive recriminations against her.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000006"></a>That is the background to the drafting of the amendments. I have discussed the amendments with the Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society, which is particularly supportive of them. I beg to move.</p>
<h5><a name="08052193000178"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08052193000007"></a><a name="80521-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08052193000182"></a>Earl Howe:</b> It is clear from my own recent discussions with the medical profession and bodies that represent doctors that the proposals in the Bill for the creation of responsible officers have created a good deal of unease and uncertainty. Underlying that unease is a mixture of thoughts. The responsible officer will have to look in several directions at once. He will have to command the confidence of his peers, his employers, the GMC and patients. He or she will have a lead role in supporting good clinical governance and in the performance management of doctors. He will have to take part in the management of clinical investigations arising from adverse incidents or complaints. To achieve all this, he or she has to be a person with an unusual set of competences and skills. The question that I have asked myself is how many people of such calibre there are, given the large number of trusts that need to make these appointments.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000008"></a>By any measure, the responsible officer will perform a pivotal and powerful role in the trust of a kind that, not to exaggerate the point, could make or break the health of the organisation. As we have heard, it is the Government&#146;s view that medical directors will often be the people best placed to become responsible officers. I have no reason to dissent from that view, although I do not think that it will necessarily be the right thing to do in every case. What will matter above all are the calibre and personal qualities of the individual.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000009"></a>There is an important pastoral dimension to the role&#151;the need for the responsible officer to be able to support and assist doctors who may be struggling for  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC553"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC553</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>any reason. That takes a certain sort of person. Equally, it is obvious that internal politics and professional jealousies can influence, or be seen as influencing, the agendas that underlie how poor performance is managed. I very much identify with the points made in that context by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000010"></a>Good training in the role will therefore be essential. Good training has to be based on best practice. Examples of best practice need to be identified and built on. It is not clear to me who will undertake this rather special sort of training and I should be glad if the Minister could say something about it. How will we be able to arrive at a position where, as far as possible, there is consistency of decision-making and practice around the country among responsible officers? Indeed, how will we know whether there is consistency? How will we know whether a responsible officer has in some way fallen short or abused his or her position? Amendment No. 143 attempts to get to that particular issue.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000011"></a>Inevitable tensions will arise in the role of a responsible officer where that person is also the medical director. Acute trusts have performance targets. There are often shortages of doctors in key specialties. There is always an imperative to maintain patient throughput and to keep the doctors that one has in post working. At the same time there is a need to appraise and revalidate doctors fairly and to investigate adverse incidents fairly. How will a responsible officer, as part of the organisation&#146;s management team, be able to balance those opposing pulls? Will he or she not have an inbuilt conflict of interest, and how will that conflict be reconciled? How do you ask someone to be loyal to an employer while at the same time being fair to professionals and patients by upholding professional standards in a scrupulous way? That will not be at all easy and I do not envy anyone faced with such an onerous burden.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000012"></a>My other question relates to doctors who are not employed by an NHS organisation. There are many doctors practising independently in all sorts of environments and capacities&#151;not only GPs, who are the most obvious example, but doctors in industry and commerce, doctors in the Armed Forces, pharmaceutical physicians and other doctors in private practice of all kinds. Who will act as responsible officers for these practitioners, especially in places where there is often no management structure? Will it be a mandatory requirement in PCTs that there should be a medical director, as there is in acute trusts? It would be helpful to have the Minister&#146;s guidance on that as well.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000013"></a>Finally, it would be useful to hear from the Minister how a responsible officer will liaise and interact with the GMC affiliate. The plans for GMC affiliates have changed considerably since they were first announced. We need to be clear how duties and responsibilities will be divided between responsible officers and affiliates.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000014"></a>I wonder whether this idea would benefit from being piloted in certain locations before being rolled out universally. Does the Minister think that that might be sensible and are there any examples from abroad of the model from which lessons can be  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC554"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC554</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>learnt? Does she think that the concept of having one responsible officer in an organisation is consistent with the proposal, which I have seen advanced, that the responsible officer could in practice delegate his or her responsibilities to a deputy? It seems to me that the idea of a deputy somewhat cuts across the notion of individual accountability, but the idea has been put forward as a way of spreading what will undoubtedly be a considerable workload on the shoulders of the responsible officer. At the very least, that workload will require administrative support. Will it be up to individual trusts to make their own arrangements to provide such support? I hope that the Minister can shed some light on these complex matters.</p>

<p><a name="08052193000015"></a><a name="80521-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08052193000183"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> As I understand it, these new sections codify and make statutory the position of the medical director that exists in many trusts. However, as my noble friend said, the Bill extends the role to PCTs and the private and independent sector. The responsible officer role is intended to protect patients, improve systems and act early to support and remediate doctors when concerns are raised about their practice. This appears to be in line with the wish of the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, that health services should be clinician-led, a concept that I warmly welcome. In the past, many members of the medical profession have shied away from taking the responsibility of managing and running the organisations in which they work. I do not find that surprising, because their education is about combating illness and restoring health. It is only when doctors achieve a consultant post that they are suddenly thrown into the maelstrom that is management. Without preparation, it is hardly surprising that they shy away.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000016"></a>My company is designing and delivering courses on leadership for SpRs and trainee GPs. Our participants are bright, keen, wonderful young people, but they are breathtakingly naive when it comes to understanding the organisation in which they work. They express anger that, after working in the service for eight years, they have never met a member of the top team and have no idea what the chief executive or the director of finance does. They have no idea what a PCT is, yet these are the people who will shortly be in charge of a clinical department. So what do they do? They ask the previous incumbent, who says, &#147;Well, this is the way I have always done it&#148;, so we get no change.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000017"></a>Huge efforts are being made by deaneries, strategic health authorities and the department to ensure that the next generation of consultants, senior partners in general practice and public health doctors have the skills and support necessary to ensure that we have successful leaders, not only in clinical fields but in the organisations in which they work. The responsible officer will be a critical part of that leadership and should not only put into place and maintain the clinical governance systems but ensure that all doctors are providing a safe, high-quality service. As I understand it, he or she will also ensure that appropriate training and professional development are available to doctors. Perhaps the Minister can tell me if that is part of the role.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC555"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC555</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000018"></a>Will this person identify issues at the earliest possible stage and help doctors to get on track before problems escalate? What mechanisms are available to an NHS organisation whose responsible officer shuns the difficult decisions and fails to be tough and to call his colleagues to account? I mention this because I have often heard of medical directors who have tried to take tough decisions but have been urged by their colleagues to be gentle. I have heard the phrase, &#147;Just have a word with him or her in the car park&#148;. However, car park conversations do not work and the responsible officer will have to have the bottle to use the organisation&#146;s HR policies; in some cases, those exempt doctors, which I do not think is right.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000019"></a>It is essential for the responsible officer to be a part of the senior clinical leadership of the healthcare organisation and a member of the management board. That will make it easier to take appropriate action where problems arise that may be caused by dysfunctional systems rather than the performance of individual doctors. For example, I have been told of a case where the hospital introduced single-use instruments, which resulted in a number of post-operative complications. It transpired that the problem was not related to the performance of the doctors but was to do with the design of the instruments. In other cases, the problem might turn out to involve relations between several members of the clinical team rather than one individual. In such cases, a responsible officer who is a senior clinical leader in the organisation must be in the position to take whatever action is needed to protect patients and to support and help the individuals involved.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000020"></a>I share the concerns of my noble friend about consistency, but I suspect that organisations are so different that they will probably want to have different systems. Let us take as an example the acute trust in Leeds, which is on two sites and may have 2,000 doctors. One would expect perhaps to have more than one responsible officer in that trust. Clearly, as my noble friend said, it is important that accountability is clearly defined.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000021"></a>I take the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, about GMC affiliates. This seems to be a moveable feast. We are never quite sure how that whole concept is going to relate to responsible officers. I should be grateful if the Minister could tell us a bit more about that.</p>

<p><a name="08052193000022"></a><a name="80521-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08052193000184"></a>Baroness Tonge:</b> I do not want to say much on this issue, as it really has all been said; it has been put so elegantly by the three speakers that I would not attempt to emulate them. I hope that the Government will take on board the real unease that exists about this concept of responsible officers. Anyone in the Department of Health who has worked as a clinician in a trust, as they are now, or in another organisation will know of the difficulties, the jealousies and the backbiting; they will know how clinicians complain all the time that people get extra money and extra awards for doing things that are not clinical. This is another opportunity to take a clinician away from his work and give him a whole load of responsibility that, as has been elegantly pointed out, he will not have the training for. I shall not say any more on that, as it has all been said.</p>

<p><a name="08052193000023"></a>I have talked to lots of my colleagues, some of whom are still practising and some of whom are retired. They are horrified by the concept of responsible officers. They do not see how it will work. I have heard phrases such as &#147;management creep&#148; bandied around. I have been asked what the merit award will be, or whatever the modern equivalent is. People have said, &#147;How much will you get for that, then?&#148;. They have said, &#147;We will be left to do the clinical work and the out-patients and to deal with all the work while he prances around as a responsible officer&#148;. Doctors working together are often very unkind to one another. I think that we should think hard before we proceed along this route.</p>

Let me be clear from the start: I agree with the principle of this amendment and I am happy to confirm that the regulations will include a requirement for a responsible officer to be a registered medical practitioner.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000025"></a>Proposed new Section 45A(5)(a) of the Medical Act 1983 provides the power for regulations to set out the requirements for a person to be appointed as a responsible officer. An expert group is advising on what those additional requirements will be. In my view, in order to provide greater clarity, the regulations should set out all the conditions that must be met for appointment as a responsible officer and not just some of them. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, will accept my public commitment that her amendment will be reflected in these regulations.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000026"></a>Amendment No. 143 would provide that regulations requiring the appointment of responsible officers may include provision for evaluating their performance in the role. I agree that it is important that we ensure that responsible officers have the ability and capability to carry out their duties and I am glad that this issue has been raised. I can reassure the noble Earl and the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, that responsible officers will already be evaluated, because they will be registered medical practitioners.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000027"></a>The noble Earl asked who the responsible officer&#146;s responsible officer will be. We have been clear that every doctor in the United Kingdom will relate to a responsible officer. We are also clear that responsible officers will have to be registered medical practitioners. Responsible officers will therefore have to relate to a responsible officer. In our view, it would be appropriate for the responsible officer to relate to one in another organisation. Details will be set out in regulations and guidance following advice from the expert working group that is currently sitting.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000028"></a>Under Amendment No. 144, designated bodies would have to provide an individual with an alternative responsible officer if they were requested to do so. If the amendment&#146;s intention is to ensure that a doctor&#146;s career is not damaged unfairly when there is conflict of a personal nature between the doctor and the responsible officer, I fully agree with the principle. However, the amendment as drafted would enable individuals to change responsible officers every time  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC557"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC557</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they thought that they might be in trouble. At the very least, this could result in delays in handling cases and, at worst, it could result in a failure to protect patients in cases where the alternative responsible officer was less familiar with the overall context. We should perhaps look instead to the document <I>Maintaining </I><I>H</I><I>igh </I><I>P</I><I>rofessional </I><I>S</I><I>tandards in the </I><I>M</I><I>odern NHS</I>, which already provides guidance for the NHS on handling cases of poor performance for employed doctors.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000029"></a>I think that Amendments Nos. 147 and 148 are intended to ensure that, when a concern is raised about a doctor, any underlying issues are identified and addressed, not just those that directly relate to disciplinary action. Amendment No. 147 would make responsible officers responsible for ensuring that action was taken when a system failure was identified. I have some sympathy with this proposal. It is certainly our intention that, where investigation of a concern about a doctor&#146;s performance reveals an underlying problem with the system, the responsible officer should have a role in ensuring that appropriate action is taken. That is why we have said that the responsible officer should be a senior doctor, either at board level or reporting directly to a board member. That will ensure that he or she is senior enough to do something about any system failure.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000030"></a>However, this amendment would require the responsible officer to ensure that appropriate action was taken in every case of system failure, whether it stemmed from concern over individual doctors or not. Although in some cases healthcare organisations may wish to combine the roles of responsible officer with wider clinical governance responsibilities, we believe that that is a decision for individual healthcare organisations rather than for the Department of Health.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000031"></a>Amendment No. 148 would ensure that appropriate action under Clause 115(1)(c) was timely and included support and consideration of training and remediation. I can assure the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, that, although this is not set out in the Bill, we will set out in guidance that responsible officers will have to ensure that support is provided to help doctors to undertake their role efficiently and effectively.</p>

I do not think that that is the purpose of the amendment, although I have a great deal of sympathy with the intention behind the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000036"></a>Amendment No. 149 proposes that the responsible officer role should be piloted in at least two geographical areas. I understand the reasoning behind the amendment but I hope that I can reassure the Committee that, in creating responsible officers, we are putting existing best practice on a statutory footing. A principal element of the role of responsible officer is clinical governance. Much of the role that we are proposing for responsible officers is already undertaken, as has been said, in the best organisations and has already been shown to be effective. However, we know that this best practice is being inconsistently applied, which is one reason why we have introduced these measures in this Bill.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000037"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked about the safeguards to ensure that responsible officers have a good reputation and can be trusted to do the job properly. The requirements for appointments will be set out in secondary legislation. However, we expect that responsible officers will have to be registered with the GMC and that they will be senior doctors in their organisation. As such, they can be expected to have already established a reputation and standing among their peers. In most organisations, that senior doctor will be the medical director or someone similar.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000038"></a>The noble Earl and the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, also asked how GMC affiliates fit in with responsible officers. The responsible officer will work for the NHS and other healthcare organisations and he or she will be based in the organisation. The GMC affiliate will work for the GMC. He or she will be the GMC&#146;s local representative. Clearly, the GMC affiliate will be the responsible officer&#146;s link point to the national regulatory framework of the GMC to ensure that there is a sensible relationship between legal clinical governance and national professional regulation. That is what is intended. I hope that I have been able to reassure noble Lords&#151;</p>

That is what they are there for; they are responsible for what is happening in their bit of the organisation.

Clearly, responsible officers will need to work closely with the GMC over issues relating to the revalidation of doctors&#146; fitness to practise. I think that the noble Baroness may be confusing the post of responsible officer outlined in the Bill with people who take responsibility. Obviously, they are not the same. The GMC says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052193000144"></a>&#147;The establishment of &#145;responsible officers&#146; at a local level means that for the first time there will be a nominated individual at a local level who will have a statutory responsibility for fitness to practise matters. We also welcome the clear distinction between the roles of responsible officers and those of the GMC. Responsible officers will be locally employed and not be employees of the GMC. Their appointment will strengthen local arrangements and is not an extension of the GMC&#146;s powers to the local level&#148;.</p>

They filled in a lot of the areas that I had not done adequately when I moved the amendment.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000044"></a>The Minister spoke about regulations. I am reassured that the responsible officers will always be medical practitioners and that there will be guidance to accompany their role. I hope that that will include clear guidance on remedial action, including training, retraining, support and so on. However, I am still concerned about system failures and how they will be rectified. I hope that in the guidance power will be given to the responsible officer to ask questions about system failures. These failures will almost inevitably involve people from other professional groups, clerical staff and possibly volunteers and so on, and they may involve other trusts as well where, ultimately, the problem has landed on the clinician. However, an accumulation of system failures may have occurred&#151;for example, out in the community before a patient went into hospital or in the hospital before a patient went back out to the community, or it may be a system failure in a relationship between health and social care.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000045"></a>When a crisis occurs, it seems to land in the doctor&#146;s lap. I have a real concern that this does not seem to be clearly thought through in relation to system failures, remedial action across the board and the powers that the responsible officer will have, because unless that officer has powers, when they try to investigate something they will hit a brick wall and be told that it is outside their area of jurisdiction or whatever, yet the matter may be really important in terms of what needs to be done. With that in mind, I have been minded to suggest pilot schemes. I hope that the Government will think carefully about pilots before simply rolling out their proposals across the board, so that lessons can be learnt and problems ironed out.</p>

<p><a name="08052193000046"></a>The final group about which I am concerned is locums, whom the Minister did not address in her reply. When people work in a hospital trust in either a training post or a permanent post, it is easier for them to be attached to a responsible officer, but locums are very mobile and they may leave their problems in one area and move into a different area. They might move from England to Wales or vice versa, or up to Scotland. Allocating responsible officers to them will be particularly difficult. I know that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the issue of the Armed Forces, which also needs to be addressed. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to my questions.</p>

This would be necessary where it was deemed that an urgent action was needed to protect the public from a significant health risk. In such a circumstance, regulations could be made to come into force immediately and would later be required to be approved using the affirmative resolution procedure, or they would cease to have effect after 28 days.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000054"></a>I should point out that such regulations could be considered hybrid if they affected only a certain group of individuals or businesses where a public health risk was identified, not others of a similar class. As noble Lords will know, the parliamentary procedure for hybrid instruments can be lengthy. This would not be appropriate where the public could be at risk. That is why Amendment No. 197 seeks to remove that requirement for the hybrid instrument process to take place where the public health risk requires urgent action. The principal aim of Clause 123 is to protect public health. As such, the overriding concern of regulations should be public safety rather than private interests. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000068"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving the amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 151. We now come to the sensitive issue of information sharing. Clause 116 provides for regulations to be made to require NHS trusts and other bodies to provide and share information about healthcare workers in circumstances where that person,</p>
<ul><a name="08052193000171"></a>&#147;is likely to constitute a threat to the health and safety of patients&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052193000134"></a>There is an issue here that I am sure all noble Lords appreciate. Sometimes there can be a situation in a hospital where a doctor or healthcare worker has been found to have put patient safety at risk through some aspect of his practice. Let us say it is a doctor. If that doctor moves to another hospital, there needs to be a way for that hospital to be aware of the adverse incident. I have little problem with that. Where I have a problem is with a system of information sharing that fails to draw the line between hard facts and soft intelligence. There is all the difference in the world between an adverse incident that has been investigated with the full knowledge of the doctor concerned and where the facts have been firmly established and unsubstantiated rumblings about something that might have happened.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000069"></a>It is not acceptable for unproven gossip or tittle-tattle to be treated as if it were fact and passed on as such. If a concern arises about the performance of a hospital doctor, whether from a firm allegation or simply as a product of the rumour mill, an employer should investigate to see whether there are any grounds for the concern and the doctor should be informed of what is going on so that he can comment on it. This is in the interests of the doctor as well as everyone else. Any doctor will understand how important it is for him and for his patients that concerns of this kind are properly investigated and dealt with. Then, if the concerns turn out to be unfounded, they should be removed from the doctor&#146;s file.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000070"></a>What an employer should not do is to allow soft intelligence to lie on a file when that does not amount to grounds for serious concern. All that that does is create a delay in acting on the concerns as well as the potential for misunderstanding on the part of anyone reading the file about the limited value that the information has in protecting patients. It is also inherently unfair to the doctor. With modern appraisal and clinical governance systems there is no reason for that sort of thing to happen. The national clinical assessment system is in operation across the country. If an issue for any reason needs to be taken up the chain, the GMC can issue a warning or retraining order in circumstances where a doctor&#146;s fitness to practice is not completely impaired. All those systems are designed to address concerns about professional competence in a timely and businesslike way.</p>

<p><a name="08052193000071"></a>The other aspect of this, as I have indicated, is the need for the doctor to be aware of any concern that may be raised about his performance. If he is not, there is huge scope for false information to be spread about and the doctor will have had no opportunity to give his side of the story or to put the record straight. On the other hand, if the concerns turn out to have substance, the doctor will have had no opportunity to

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000072"></a>The difficulty that I have with this part of the Bill lies in subsection (1)(a), which refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="08052193000172"></a>&#147;the sharing of information which relates to the conduct or performance of any health care worker and which may show that that worker is likely to constitute a threat to the health and safety of patients&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052193000135"></a>It is the word &#147;may&#148; that we need to look at. Left unqualified, it looks far too tentative and wishy-washy. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, has tabled an amendment that would substitute &#147;shows&#148; for &#147;may show&#148;. In other words, if I understand her intention correctly, the information would have to consist of proven fact before it could be passed on. I have considerable sympathy with that amendment.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000073"></a>The reason for my own less tight amendment is that there could be circumstances in which serious concern could arise about the performance of a doctor where there was no opportunity to investigate it before the doctor moved from one employer to the next. In those circumstances, it would be irresponsible for the first employer to do nothing at all about passing on the concern, even though the allegation might as yet be unproven. But in those sorts of case, the sine qua non is that the doctor himself should be informed of exactly what information has been passed on to the other employer. To be honest, I think that there is a case for marrying up the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness with my own, so that the clause would refer to,</p>
<ul><a name="08052193000173"></a>&#147;information which ... shows, or would, if the case were proved, show that the worker is likely to constitute a threat&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052193000136"></a>The noble Baroness may disagree with that, and I shall be interested to hear what she has to say, but she and I can certainly agree that the current wording will not do.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000074"></a>These are important issues. I hope that the Minister will feel able to look at them afresh. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08052193000075"></a><a name="80521-gc0005.htm_spnew24"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0005.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="08052193000201"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff:</b> I would certainly like to speak to the amendment in my name but do so considering the generous invitation from the noble Earl, Lord Howe, to join it with his amendment. That might provide the solution to the problem in hand.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000076"></a>There are real dangers about information being passed on, based on tittle-tattle, gossip or suppositions, some of which may relate to cultural or perceptual differences between clinicians, but have no substance in how they actually affect their care of patients. For example, the fact that someone may eat their lunch on their own, join others or not join others, does not affect their clinical competence even though their colleagues might feel affronted, shunned or offended. But we are talking about clinical competence, not personal judgment, and for that reason it is very important that there is hard evidence. Indeed, when there is hard evidence to alert one to the fact that there may be a problem, it is very appropriate for it to be handed on.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000077"></a>Perhaps I may illustrate that with a specific example. A doctor&#146;s handwriting may be more easily  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC564"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC564</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>read by some than by others, but if it is not legible it has serious implications for the care of the patient because it is not only a clinical record but it hands on information to others. If the handwriting is so poor that the drug chart is difficult to read, that is another order of serious implication. A doctor challenged about his or her handwriting would be expected to take&#151;and should be supported in taking&#151;remedial action to relearn patterns of handwriting and the use of capital letters on drug charts and so on. Even when he or she has done that, it would be appropriate to hand on to their next employer the fact that there has been a problem. The hard evidence of copies of the entries in the case notes and on the drug chart would apply pressure for the doctor to keep up the remedial action.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000078"></a>However, that is quite different to saying that one does not like the way someone wrote or entered something in the notes where there is no hard evidence to back it up. This has implications for the registration. Hard evidence should be available to hand on. Unsubstantiated allegations may turn out to be defamatory and we could end up with some nasty cases being brought by doctors who fear that their reputation has been unfairly smeared by allegations without any substance. A second trust could inadvertently get caught up in such an action if it takes at face value hearsay evidence which has no substance to it.</p>

<p><a name="08052193000079"></a><a name="80521-gc0005.htm_spnew26"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0005.htm_spnew27"></a><a name="08052193000202"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Before discussing the specific amendments I should point out that this measure is in the Bill because the common conclusion of recent inquiries into doctors who have harmed their patients, including the Shipman, Ayling and Kerr/Haslam inquiries, was that healthcare organisations failed, both singly and collectively, to &#147;join up&#148; the information that was available to them and that this led to the abuse and death of patients. The noble Earl is correct to say that this is a very sensitive issue and that it is important that we get it right.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000080"></a>There is always a balance to be struck between making sure proper measures are in place to protect patient safety and ensuring that doctors and other healthcare workers do not have their careers blighted by unfair or malicious accusations. We think we have got the balance right here. I hope that I will be able to persuade noble Lords of this and set out why I cannot support the amendments.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000081"></a>Amendment No. 150 would have the effect of only allowing information to be shared if the case was proven. That by itself would be a threat to patient safety. It would apply a more stringent test to the kind of information that might be shared than is currently in the Bill. Similarly, Amendment No. 150A would require the information to show a definite risk to patient safety in order for it to be shared.</p>

<p><a name="08052193000082"></a>While I understand the reasoning behind these amendments&#151;they were adequately explained by the noble Earl and the noble Baroness&#151;we believe they would still be too restrictive and could, in certain circumstances, prevent valuable information being shared that may reveal a threat to patient safety. For example, a set of clinical indicators for a health professional  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC565"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC565</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who works across a number of locations could potentially suggest there is a problem, but the interpretation of this data is not clear cut or definite. In this case, the information that the healthcare organisation has shows only that there &#147;may&#148; potentially be a threat to patient safety. If I accepted these amendments, the information that &#147;may&#148; show a threat to patient safety could not be shared. But other healthcare organisations in which this professional is working may hold similar isolated incidents of concern. Put together, they form a pattern that definitively shows that he is a threat to patient safety. That pattern could be identified and action to protect patients taken only if healthcare organisations can share information that&#147;may&#148;&#151;not &#147;does&#148;&#151;show a threat. I do not deny that it is a sensitive and difficult issue.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000083"></a>I know that we need to ensure that healthcare organisations share information appropriately, but the best way to do that is by secondary legislation and guidance detailing the tests that need to be applied and the steps that should be taken before information is shared. An expert group charged with helping to implement the White Paper is looking at this issue and will help us to develop the necessary secondary legislation and guidance.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000084"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 151 would be to ensure that no information could be shared unless the healthcare worker involved had been informed. As a general rule it must be right that healthcare workers are made aware of concerns whether these are shared or not, and certainly before such concerns are shared with other organisations. However, there may be exceptional cases when this is inappropriate or even impossible, for example, when there are concerns that informing the worker might hamper an investigation, possibly by enabling that worker to influence witnesses. For example, the Kerr/Haslam inquiry took the view that a letter of retraction written by a patient who had allegedly been abused by William Kerr was probably written as a result of pressure from him, or one of his supporters, after he had been informed of the accusation.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000085"></a>There may also be cases where the worker has already left the employment of the healthcare organisation and has not left contact details. While it may then not be possible to inform the worker, the healthcare organisation may judge that it is necessary to share the information with other organisations where that individual might work. In such circumstances, the amendment would stand in the way of action needed to protect patients. We intend instead to provide healthcare organisations with detailed guidance setting out the limited circumstances in which it would be justified to share information without informing the healthcare worker, while making clear that the general rule should be that he or she should be told before any information about them is shared. I hope that the Committee will feel that I have explained why the Bill is drafted as it is and that the noble Earl will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08052193000122"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 161, I shall speak to Amendment No. 162 and, very briefly, to Amendment No. 166A.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000123"></a>Clause 123 brings us to Part 3 and to the very important provisions relating to public health. Let me say at the outset that I understand fully, and I support, the need for Parliament to bring our public health legislation up to date and at the same to time to bring it in line with international health regulations. Much of our public health law dates back to the 19th century. As such, it fails to address a number of matters which under most people's reckoning fall within the definition of public health hazards, the most obvious examples being nuclear radiation and chemical contamination. I accept that the law needs to cover these in a way that makes it possible for the relevant authorities to protect the public in an appropriate manner. I also accept the desirability of implementing the recommendations of the World Health Organisation, as reflected in the International Health Regulations of 2005. These now cover infectious diseases in general, rather than naming specific diseases as they used to, and they are also concerned with hazards relating to contamination.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000124"></a>What we have in Clause 123 is a series of new sections to be inserted into the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 which are designed to cover all relevant types of hazard falling under the heading of infection or contamination. While I recognise that this approach is clearly sensible if we are to cater for public health threats that are as yet unknown&#151;and one thinks back to the threat posed by SARS a few years ago&#151;the inevitable feature of it is that the measures in the Bill that are designed to address these disparate threats have to be couched in quite sweeping and vague terms. Under the old-fashioned variety of  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC569"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC569</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulations, we were dealing with specific named infectious diseases such as plague and cholera. The severity of those threats is well understood and the measures needed to avoid their spread are well established. However, once we start dealing with threats that of their nature cannot be defined, because they are as yet unknown, we are into rather different territory. We can provide only in a general way for the measures that may possibly be needed to counter them, even though we cannot say anything substantive about them.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000125"></a>We are also in different territory with the threats posed by chemical and nuclear contamination because, whereas immediate quarantine is appropriate for someone suffering from plague, there is usually no necessity to quarantine a person who may have come into contact with a hazardous chemical. Rather what you do is to try to ring-fence the contamination and keep people away from it. Nuclear contamination falls somewhere between the two. If a place is contaminated, you will want to evacuate the affected area. If, on the other hand, like the unfortunate Mr Litvinenko, someone ingests a nuclear isotope, you will want to isolate that person as well as make sure that the source of the radioactivity does not pose a danger to others.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000126"></a>The result of legislating for this very broad range of threats is a set of all-singing, all-dancing statutory provisions which, if passed into law, will be totally reliant on clear guidance being issued if the relevant public authorities are to implement the law in a way that is both discriminating and proportionate. In new Section 45C we find exactly where this all leads to. New subsection (1) gives the appropriate Minister a power to make regulations,</p>
<ul><a name="08052193000175"></a>&#147;for the purpose of preventing, protecting against, controlling or providing a public health response to the incidence or spread of infection or contamination&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052193000139"></a>In new subsection (2)(b) we see that the power may be exercised,</p>
<ul><a name="08052193000176"></a>&#147;so as to make provision of a general nature, to make contingent provision or to make specific provision in response to a particular set of circumstances&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052193000140"></a>In other words, it is a very sweeping power indeed.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000127"></a>I say that because we are dealing here with measures which are not defined in the Bill but which Ministers can bring into force more or less at the stroke of a pen without the prior approval of a magistrate. These include, in new subsection (3)(c), a provision,</p>
<ul><a name="08052193000177"></a>&#147;imposing or enabling the imposition of restrictions or requirements on or in relation to persons, things or premises in the event of, or in response to, a threat to public health&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052193000141"></a>In other words, Ministers, by regulation, are being given considerable power to limit and constrain the daily lives and freedoms of citizens.</p>

<p><a name="08052193000128"></a><a name="80521-gc0006.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0006.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08052193000212"></a>Baroness Tonge:</b> Has it occurred to the noble Earl that these powers already exist in the Civil Contingencies Act, which was updated in 2004? If he is going to address the issue, I apologise, but I feel we need to look at the two together.</p>

<p><a name="08052193000129"></a><a name="80521-gc0006.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0006.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="08052193000213"></a>Earl Howe:</b> The noble Baroness makes an extremely important point. I was going to ask the Minister whether she could explain how these  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC570"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC570</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provisions tie in with those of the Civil Contingencies Act and what circumstances might be thought likely to warrant action to be taken under that Act rather than under this part of the Bill. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for making that point.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000130"></a>It is quite a job to navigate through these provisions because they are qualified by what is contained in new Section 45D, which is itself qualified by new Section 45G. They also need to be read in conjunction with new Sections 45E and 45F. It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm my understanding that when it comes to those measures which involve the greatest intrusion into personal freedoms&#151;namely, making someone submit to a medical examination, ordering their removal to hospital or another establishment, or ordering their detention, isolation or quarantine&#151;it will not be possible for regulations to bypass a court order made by a magistrate. That is my reading of new Section 45D(3).</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000131"></a>If that is correct, I should appreciate it if the Minister could give us an illustration of the kinds of provision which regulations are likely to contain in the event of, say, a SARS outbreak, a nuclear leak or a leak of a dangerous and toxic chemical. We need to have a feel for the kinds of situations which may be covered by regulations as opposed to the kinds of situations which are thought appropriate for a magistrate to deal with. Some are covered in new Section 45C(4), but this list is expressly not exhaustive.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000132"></a>We are told in new Section 45F&#151;this is the subject of Amendment No. 166A, to which my name is attached&#151;that regulations may confer functions on local authorities and other persons. I can understand the likely role to be played by local authorities, but I am not sure I know who else is likely to be asked to play a role in public health protection. I would appreciate it if the Minister could throw some light on this. If people other than authorised local government officials are to be vested with authority to infringe people&#146;s personal freedoms, we need to know who they are and what functions they are likely to have.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="08052193000133"></a>Equally, I would be glad if the Minister could explain why the provision in new Section 45C(3)(c) creates what is apparently a very low threshold for restrictions or requirements to be placed on persons, things or premises. The condition that is specified is that this must be in response to a threat to public health. That, frankly, could mean anything. The degree of threat is not specified. The only limitation on the use of the provision comes in new Section 45D, which states that the restrictional requirement imposed must be proportionate to what is sought to be achieved, but it does not say how great or how small the actual threat needs to be before measures are taken.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000002"></a>I have to say that I am rather uneasy about that. To interfere with personal liberties when there is only a remote threat to public health might be seen by many as an overreaction, even though a Minister could still justify the restriction by arguing that it was proportionate to the mischief in question, were it to happen. Perhaps the Minister could take us through the thinking here.</p>

<p><a name="08052197000003"></a>If we look ahead slightly to Amendment No. 165 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, it seems to me that she has addressed rather neatly the point that I am making in my amendment. I beg to move.</p>

As the rest of the amendments in my name and in that of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, relate to Part 3 and the issue of public health and compulsory powers, I crave the indulgence of the Committee to say a few words about the general issues. I am particularly grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, for the way in which he has covered this matter. I feel better knowing that it was not just me who found it incredibly difficult to understand.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000005"></a>In Clause 123, the Government propose to modernise the law on public health. The Joint Committee on Human Rights welcomed this aim but it was concerned that, in introducing a broad degree of flexibility in the proposed health protection regulations and public health orders, the Government were asking Parliament to authorise the use of potentially broad restrictions on individuals without close scrutiny of the circumstances in which the powers would be used and how they might affect individual rights, such as the right to liberty, respect for the family in private life and freedom of association.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0006.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000006"></a>Most of our amendments propose a number of additional safeguards for these rights, and we ask the Minister to explain why she thinks the existing safeguards are adequate. Our amendments are principally focused on those regulation or order-making powers which impose restrictions or requirements on persons and which most affect individual rights.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80521-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000007"></a>One of the final series of amendments calls on the Minister to justify the need to create an emergency power to make regulations which might enable the detention, quarantine or isolation of individuals without parliamentary oversight and without the same safeguards required in the Civil Contingencies Act. I am very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, for raising that.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000008"></a>The purpose of the amendments is to ask the Minister to explain why such broad powers to deal with public health risks are necessary and proportionate. We propose further safeguards for individual liberty and to ensure proper parliamentary oversight.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000009"></a>Amendment No. 166 clarifies the scope of health protection regulations. It does not change the effect of the Bill but clarifies the Government&#146;s policy intention, which is to allow health protection regulations to enable the imposition of special restrictions or requirements by the Secretary of State or other decision-makers. In our report on this part of the Bill, the Joint Committee on Human Rights concluded that the effect of these provisions was far from clear and accessible. The effect of our amendment would be to clarify that, although health protection regulations may not directly impose requirements for medical examination, removal

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000010"></a>Amendment No. 167 concerns the timescale of special restrictions and requirements imposed by regulations. The Joint Committee expressed concern in its report that the provisions in the Bill which allowed health protection regulations to impose regulations and requirements on individuals were not subject to any specific restriction on the time a person might be affected.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000011"></a>The committee was particularly concerned about special restrictions and requirements, such as conditions that could otherwise be ordered by a JP, including health monitoring and requirements to provide information, attend training or advice sessions or to be subject to restrictions on contact with others. The committee accepted that the limitation that health protection regulations containing or authorising special restrictions or requirements must be in response to a serious and imminent threat to public health was a positive safeguard. However, it considered that the failure to specify that measures should end when that threat subsides significantly undermined the safeguards.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000012"></a>Our amendment would introduce a requirement that any regulations imposing special restrictions or requirements on individuals would lapse after six months. The amendments provide that those regulations may be renewed but must lapse when they are no longer necessary or proportionate to meet the serious or imminent threat to public health that triggered their use. The amendments also provide that, where regulations enable the imposition of medical examination, detention, isolation or quarantine, a short timetable should apply to those restrictions.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000013"></a>At present, although the Bill proposes that there should be a 28-day limit on the imposition of these restrictions by a JP before they must lapse and be revisited, no similar administrative restriction is required in respect of the imposition of these requirements. My amendment proposes that any restriction that includes medical examination, detention, isolation or quarantine shall remain in place for no more than 14 days. Thereafter, the restriction can be renewed only by a JP but it can be renewed for up to seven days. Following that, any restriction can be continued, subject to automatic review by a JP every seven days and subject to a maximum period to be set by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000014"></a>The government response to our reports did not address those issues, but I very much hope that the Minister will address them now.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000016"></a>I have difficulty with this issue. When I read page 69, line 37 of the Bill, which mentions &#147;other persons&#148;, I assumed that it referred to public health personnel from the local health authority&#151;the primary care trust&#151;which was engaged in this. My question for the Minister is: is that right? I am  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC573"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC573</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>familiar with the public health intervention powers and powers under the National Assistance Act, which I will talk about later. These provide a clear hierarchy of intervention powers. It is clear that the local public health department is responsible, through a medical officer of health or a proper officer, for who must make the decision and when.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000017"></a>I understand that we are trying to legislate for a broad range of threats but we need to have far greater clarity about how this will be translated into regulation and the practicalities of that. Given that these are rather draconian powers, they need considerable watching. We will discuss the monitoring of those powers later, because that is another aspect that concerns us. We need far greater clarity about who will do what to whom and when.</p>

<p><a name="08052197000018"></a><a name="80521-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08052197000157"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> As the noble Earl said, we now turn to Part 3. Clause 123 updates the Public Health (Control of Disease Act) 1984. It builds on local authorities&#146; existing powers to protect the public from significant health risks while introducing safeguards to protect the individual. For example, the existing legislation only provides a justice of the peace with the power to require an individual to be medically examined, to remove an individual to hospital or to require that he is detained in hospital. We believe that those are extreme measures, and the new legislation offers a flexible range of measures enabling the justice of the peace to seek the most appropriate measure for the case&#151;in many cases, a much less restrictive option than the previous Act would have allowed. I apologise for the density and diversity of these clauses. I sought assurance from my officials that it was necessary for them to be written in this way, and I was assured that it was necessary in order to cover all the eventualities and safeguards.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000019"></a>Amendment No. 161 removes new Section 45C(2)(b), which clarifies some of the ways in which the domestic regulation-making power may be used. The scope of this power needs to be broad in order to ensure that we can take action to protect public health. However, I recognise that it can raise legitimate concerns, which is why we have set out in the delegated powers memorandum and the further detailed policy statement how we intend to use it. Those detailed explanations of our intent are available in the Library, and I have placed copies in the corner of this Room.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000020"></a>In addressing some of the other amendments laid against new Section 45C, I hope to be able to persuade the noble Earl and the noble Baronesses why the provision is necessary. Amendment No. 162 seeks to ensure that, when regulations are made under Section 45C(3)(c) to impose or enable the imposition of restrictions or requirements on or in relation to a person, thing or premises, it is done in response to a demonstrably significant threat to public health. I hope that noble Lords will be reassured to know that there are already safeguards in the Bill to ensure that new Section 45C is used in the right circumstances.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000021"></a>The Bill already ensures that all domestic health protection regulations must be in relation to an infection or contamination that poses significant harm to human health. The judgment that Amendment No. 162 asks us to make is whether the  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC574"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC574</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>infection that can cause significant harm to a human&#146;s health is also one that could cause a wider public health threat. That may not be possible where the threat is new and the science is not yet available to assess its significance. For example, when SARS first emerged, there was little scientific evidence about how it was transmitted. It was clear that it was a danger to humans who were infected, but it was unclear how great the risk was to the public at large. Amendment No. 162 would require the degree of risk to be known before regulations could be made, and that could disempower Ministers putting in place precautionary or contingent measures that could save lives.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000022"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 166. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, suggests that the existing provisions do not make it crystal clear that, while regulations cannot impose a special restriction or requirement for medical examination, detention, isolation or quarantine, they can enable the imposition of these requirements. I sympathise with that point. When drafting the provisions, it was not the intention to hide the fact that the regulations could enable the imposition of those measures in certain circumstances. To put this issue beyond doubt, let me state for the record that the regulations are intended to allow the imposition of medical examination, detention, quarantine or isolation when a decision-maker determines that such a measure is a proportionate response to a serious and imminent threat to public health. Furthermore, let me clarify that the decision-maker, who would be specified in regulations, would be the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers, where that would be appropriate.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000023"></a>Amendment No. 166A seeks to remove the power of the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers to confer functions through the international travel and domestic regulation-making power on persons other than the local authority. I shall explain how the power, which can be found at Section 45F(2)(a) of Part 3, could be used. During an incident similar to the SARS outbreak in 2002-03, this provision would allow the Secretary of State to enable doctors to make decisions about whether a patient should be quarantined. On a more day-to-day level, the provision would enable port health authorities to carry out the function of inspecting ships and awarding ship sanitation certificates, which is a requirement under the International Health Regulations 2005. I am sure that noble Lords will see why the provision is necessary.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000024"></a>Amendment No. 167 seeks to restrict the length of time that regulations directly imposing any of the &#147;special restrictions or requirements&#148; on people, things or premises can remain in force. It would require regulations containing such measures to lapse after six months. That might, in some cases, be appropriate for a measure involving a significant impact on a person&#146;s private life. However, new Section 45C(3) allows regulations to be made imposing from the centre a &#147;special restriction and requirement&#148; to, for example, a category of premises. This could be quite a routine matter, needing to remain in force for a long time&#151;for example, requiring all premises of a particular type to be regularly disinfected in a particular way. It would not be appropriate to take up Parliament&#146;s time in having to remake such arrangements every six months.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC575"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC575</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000025"></a>The second part of Amendment No. 167 would insert a new subsection (5B), which seeks to impose time restrictions of 14 days where the regulations enable the imposition of detention, quarantine or isolation by a designated decision-maker in the face of a &#147;serious and imminent&#148; threat. Fourteen days is half the quarantine period of some serious infectious diseases. For example, Hantavirus, a viral haemorrhagic fever spread by rodents, has an incubation period of two to four weeks and can be fatal.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000026"></a>As for how the legislation overlaps with the Civil Contingencies Act, the Bill will allow us to bridge the gap between voluntary compliance with public health measures and the use of more extreme civil contingency powers. The new provisions provide a set of powers specifically tailored for dealing with a significant threat to public health. They introduce specific safeguards and set out the type of provisions that might be made. Unlike the Civil Contingencies Act, regulations under the domestic regulation-making power can be made in advance of a serious and imminent situation so that they are in place as soon as it becomes necessary to invoke them. This gives organisations involved a clear understanding of what measures might be put in place when needed. The domestic regulation-making power also enables the Secretary of State to make regulations placing restrictions and requirements on individuals, things and premises before a threat becomes serious or widespread in order to prevent an emergency occurring. At the other end of the scale, these powers enable routine good housekeeping, such as systems for notifying specific cases of infection or contamination, which is quite outside the scope of the Civil Contingencies Act.</p>

<p><a name="08052197000027"></a>The noble Earl asked for some examples of the type of restrictions and requirements that the Secretary of State might impose and why. I have three examples. First, if a contaminated cargo was dispersed across the country, the powers would enable the Secretary of State to recall the cargo and require local authorities to track down those who had contact with the cargo and offer them medical advice. In my second example, if human-to-human transfer of avian flu became a greater likelihood, the Secretary of State might consider it a proportionate reaction to require all individuals working with poultry to wear protective clothing and undertake a decontamination regime at the end of their daily shift. This could reduce the spread of any infection to family and friends. Finally, if there was a large outbreak of SARS, the regulations could be used to empower hospitals to require all visitors to SARS patients to wear protective clothing to reduce the risk of onward spread.</p>

Who starts things off? At what point do the local authorities say that something is too big for them to deal with and that the Secretary of State should take over? At what stage does the Secretary of State say to local authorities that they will have to invoke the Civil Contingencies Act? I do not quite understand the connection between the two and how, in practice, they will be implemented.</p>

This Bill addresses issues of health protection. However, we will be coming to the group commencing with Amendment No. 198 that is all about the Civil Contingencies Act, and I shall have a very much fuller briefing note, which I hope will help to explain that.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000030"></a>Perhaps I may return to the question of &#147;other people&#148;, which was raised by several noble Lords. The regulations will specify the individual who can impose specific detention, isolation or quarantine. They will be scrutinised by Parliament under the affirmative procedure. Those people will mainly be doctors and health professional officials. I think that one noble Lord identified that those would be the &#147;other people&#148;, and that would indeed be the case.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000031"></a>Amendment No. 167 also requires that only a justice of the peace can renew and review a measure every seven days after the first 14 days. One purpose of Sections 45C and 45D is to provide central powers to deal with serious and imminent threats when it may be appropriate to enable a decision-maker other than a justice of the peace to take key decisions at the relevant time. The amendment would therefore undermine that purpose by reintroducing the role of a justice of the peace. The effect of that could be that, in a widespread emergency, justices of the peace could be overrun with applications that could better be determined by authorised officers applying centrally set criteria under carefully drafted regulations.</p>

It concerns new Section 45D(3), which I understand says that the instances where personal freedoms are infringed the most may only be the subject of an order from a magistrate and may not be covered by regulations. That is where someone is being removed to a hospital or another place and detained, and so on. The Minister is welcome to write to me on that point if she would like to do so. Her answers were very helpful, and I am sure that all Members of the Committee will study them in some detail between now and the next stage of the Bill. I very much join the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, in the concerns that she expressed, and no doubt she is in the same camp as me on this. For now, however, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08052197000134"></a>The JCHR amendments would conclusively remove any subjective element from these provisions and require any restriction or requirements to be proportionate not only to the immediate aim of the policymaker imposing it but also to the risk to public health that it intends to meet. In my view, our amendments are a considerable improvement on the text which, when one reads it, seems to go round a little. I shall do what I think it is proportionate to do and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response. I am sure she will agree that our amendments are indeed a great improvement. I beg to move.</p>

One of the difficulties when faced with some of the exotic infections&#151;SARS has already been cited&#151;is that it is effectively a guess in the dark because the true pathogenicity of those organisms will not emerge until some time later. I am concerned about being overly restrictive in the short term rather than taking a much more precautionary approach. I say that based on my contact with people who were involved in the SARS outbreak. I was full of admiration for the way in which the Hong Kong community managed to clamp down on its movements, including self-quarantine on the part of healthcare workers, who took a precautionary approach and voluntarily stayed on hospital premises, in isolation, before going home.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000039"></a>I am concerned that during the avian flu outbreak in turkeys here overalls were not being changed and cleaned by the people handling the turkeys at both ends of the transport line. There need to be powers to impose cautious behaviour because I fear that in this country we may not do as well as Hong Kong.</p>

That safeguard requires that where a person is imposing a restriction or requirement they must consider that the measure is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by imposing it. Amendments Nos. 163 and 164 would remove from the provisions the fact that the person must consider it proportionate; instead, the provision would read that the measure must be proportionate. However, simply deleting the reference to the person making the judgment that the measure is proportionate does not change the fact that such a judgment has to be made by someone. Measures are not proportionate to the threat by themselves; someone must judge them to be so, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, eloquently explained.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000041"></a>The amendment would force the person making the decision not only to consider whether he thought it was a proportionate thing to do, but also whether  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC578"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC578</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he thought every other person would also believe it was proportionate. How could he decide that with any certainty? For example, during the SARS outbreak in Canada, an entire hospital was closed and all the staff placed in working quarantine. People not yet infected with SARS were placed in quarantine along with people that were. Was that a proportionate measure? With hindsight, the World Health Organisation said that it was control measures such as those which stopped the SARS infection spreading. The person making the decision under new Section 45D must be reasonable and properly informed. That is the law.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000042"></a>Amendments Nos. 164 and 165 also seek to elaborate the factors to which the measure must be proportionate. The amendments require the measure to be proportionate not only to its own aim but also to the risk or threat that it is intended to address. There are two problems with that. First, the Minister or other decision-maker may not know the extent of the threat at the time when the decision must be made. However, because the decision may have to be made in the absence of firm evidence of the extent of the risk, it may be impossible at that time to be sure that the decision-maker has chosen proportionate risk at that time. There was a very helpful explanation from the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, about that. Secondly, and in some ways more importantly, the measure is likely to be one step in a suite of measures aimed at removing or reducing a risk. In and of itself, the measure may not be proportionate to the magnitude of the threat. I hope that in the light of those explanations the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Am I not right that if someone were minded to judicially review a decision under new Section 45D(1), the test would be whether the appropriate Minister had considered that the restriction or requirement was proportionate? That test does not say that the Minister must be satisfied, which is quite a strict test; it is simply a question of whether he or she considers that the restriction or requirement is proportionate. That is a pretty easy test to pass, whereas the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would be a stiffer test because it would be what the reasonable man or woman might say was proportionate to what was sought to be achieved. I do not want to put words into the noble Baroness&#146;s mouth, but it seems to me that there is a distinct difference and that it is not right to say that it does not really matter what you have here and that someone has to make the judgment. It is true that someone has to make the judgment, but the test that a court would look at might be rather different.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000048"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment addresses the question of the rights of review. In its report, the Joint Committee on Human Rights very much welcomed the right of appeal against the imposition of any special restrictions or requirements. The Bill also proposes that there will be a right of review in respect of the continuation of any special restrictions or requirements imposed as a result of the operation of health protection regulations. In our report, we expressed concern that there was very little detail in the Bill about how these rights would work in practice.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000049"></a>The amendment would require a periodic review by a magistrates&#146; court in respect of any special restriction or requirement that continued under any health protection regulations. It is a probing amendment. The Government have explained that, without knowing the specific situations that regulations may be needed to address, it is difficult to provide appropriately for those safeguards in the Bill. For example, it is likely that it would be appropriate for a periodic review to be carried out by the same authority that placed the initial restriction or requirement on the individual. However, that will vary depending on the situation.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000050"></a>In the view of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, many details relating to the operation of the review and appeals process are left to be determined by secondary legislation. Therefore, I am taking the opportunity provided by this amendment to ask the Minister how the Government envisage that this review process will operate in practice. Can she tell us, for example, whether the process will generally be independent of the procedures for appeal? Can she confirm that individuals subject to a special restriction or requirement will have an appeal directly against decisions made under health protection regulations and will not have to wait for the outcome of any periodic review? Would an individual or his or her representatives be invited to make representations to the review? Will there be a further appeal against the outcome of a periodic review? I hope that the Minister can provide some answers to these questions. Also in this group are Amendments Nos. 186, 187, 189 and 190, and I shall refer to Amendment No. 195, although it is in a later grouping. These amendments concern the duration of public health orders. They are also probing amendments to open up a debate on the proposals on the duration of public health orders made by JPs. Amendment No. 186 will reduce the current proposed maximum period for detention, isolation and quarantine from 28 days to 14 days. At present, there is no maximum period for any order relating to other restrictions or requirements, including requirements which may prevent an individual seeing other people or working or which may require  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC580"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC580</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an individual to attend training or that his health be monitored. The Bill provides for no maximum period for these orders, but leaves that to the discretion of the relevant Minister who may set a maximum. Can the Minister explain why that is appropriate? Amendment No. 187 provides that any public health order imposing a restriction or requirement may not last longer than 28 days. A further order may extend that.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000051"></a>The Bill provides that the relevant Minister may set the maximum period for which a JP may renew or extend any order imposing restrictions or requirements. Amendments Nos. 188 and 190, suggested by the Joint Committee, would remove the power to set maximum periods for renewal of orders for detention, isolation and quarantine from the relevant Minister. That Minister would retain the power to set the maximum periods for renewal for restrictions and requirements. Amendment No. 190 would require any public health order involving detention, isolation or quarantine to be reviewed by a JP every seven days after the expiry of the initial period of the order. Amendment No. 195 would require any regulations setting maximum periods for public health orders or extensions to them to be subject to affirmative resolution.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000052"></a>These amendments spring from the Joint Committee&#146;s concern that, as drafted, the Bill could potentially subject individuals to detention on the basis of 28-day orders that could continually be extended or renewed by JPs. Can the Minister explain how the Government envisage that these orders will operate in practice and their likely duration in particular cases? Could she give examples where detention, isolation or quarantine will be necessary for longer than 28 days? Although the relevant Minister is empowered to set a maximum period for detention, isolation or quarantine, or for the imposition of other restrictions or requirements, the Minister is not required to do so.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000053"></a>The Joint Committee&#146;s concerns relate to the following questions. Why is a 28-day initial period appropriate for orders permitting detention, isolation and quarantine? Why is it appropriate to leave the maximum period for all other restrictions and requirements to administrative discretion? Why is it appropriate to leave the maximum period that a person may spend in detention, isolation or quarantine to administrative discretion, subject to the oversight of a JP? I hope that the Minister can provide some reassurance on all those points. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08052197000054"></a><a name="80521-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08052197000167"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I support the amendments that were so ably spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern. My comments will closely reflect her concerns. My Amendments Nos. 184, 185, 188 and 191 in the group also concern orders made by magistrates. New Section 45L proposes that when a magistrate makes an order for a person to be detained in hospital or another suitable establishment, or to be kept in isolation or quarantine, the period for which the person can be kept locked up can be as long as 28 days.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000055"></a>Under new subsection (2), that period may be extended by further order of a JP for a period to be determined in regulations. I share the noble Baroness&#146;s concern; this is not satisfactory, as 28 days is a long time during which to detain someone who  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC581"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC581</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has done nothing wrong and who does not need treatment for a mental illness under the Mental Health Act. Of course, I understand that the incubation period for certain diseases may be three or four weeks. However, I believe we owe it to anyone whose detention is thought necessary only in order to protect the general population, to review the initial detention order at much shorter intervals than 28 days. The amendment proposes every seven days&#151;it could be every 14 days&#151;but the intention here is that the order could be renewed for as long as may be justified by the evidence of risk.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000056"></a>What I am unclear about&#151;and perhaps the Minister could tell us&#151;is whether the extension referred to in new Section 45L(2) is a once-only extension or an extension which may itself be extended once the specified period elapses. The wording is by no means clear here, though the Explanatory Notes suggest that the extensions can if necessary continue indefinitely. I do not have a particular problem with that idea, but I think that the court should have to review the order at frequent intervals. I am not aware of what maximum period the Government are going to specify for any extension of a Part 2A order, and that leaves me feeling very apprehensive. Even if the Minister were to get up and say that the Government intended to make the period seven days, I would be apprehensive, because that period could be changed by any future set of Ministers in a new set of regulations. However, I fear that the maximum extension allowed will be longer than this. I see no reason why that maximum period should not be specified on the face of the Bill, as opposed to secondary legislation. In fact I think it would be infinitely preferable.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000057"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 191 would provide that where an application was made to vary or revoke a Part 2A order, the relevant hearing should take place promptly. If, for example, someone is quarantined under a Part 2A order on the grounds that they are suspected of having viral hemorrhagic fever, and it then turns out that they do not, and that they are not a danger to others at all, it is unacceptable for the person to be kept in continued isolation for more than the shortest possible time. I hope that the Minister will consider this proposal very carefully, as it is not unknown for appeals to a magistrate to be deferred and delayed. A delay may not matter for some kinds of appeal, but when someone's liberty has been taken away through no fault of their own, it matters very much.</p>

While I can see that you need to be able to act very quickly with a precautionary approach when somebody&#146;s liberty has been removed, I have a concern that they might languish and almost be forgotten about in the system, particularly if there are a lot of other people involved. If it is just one patient, a review is much more likely; but if several hundred people were being held in quarantine, I can see how some poor person might get missed out in the system if there was no forced review time. That is simply because of the human nature of pressures on staff.</p>

The maximum period is 28 days.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000060"></a>Amendments Nos. 185 and 186 seek to reduce that period to seven days and 14 days respectively, and Amendments Nos. 190 and 184 seek to reduce any further extension of the period to intervals of seven days. I understand the need to ensure that these powers are not wider than necessary, but 28 days was not an arbitrary choice. It was chosen because it covers the maximum incubation period for most known diseases that are highly transmissible. Lassa fever has an incubation period of up to 21 days and is highly contagious as soon as symptoms appear. Therefore, if the maximum initial period was less than 22 days an individual might not be showing symptoms at the point when the order ran out. A 28-day maximum allows for symptoms to show and supportive treatment to begin, at which point an individual may decide to co-operate voluntarily, thereby removing the need to seek an extension to the order. A period of seven or 14 days would not cover the incubation period of some diseases.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000061"></a>Twenty-eight days is the maximum period available for detention, isolation or quarantine orders. That does not mean that a justice of the peace is obliged to order that an individual be detained for that period. The justice of the peace, by virtue of new Section 45G, may make an order only if he believes that it is necessary to do so in order to remove or reduce the risk to others. Therefore, if the incubation period for a particular disease was known to be only a few days, it would not be necessary to make an order extending for 28 days. This system gives the justice of the peace the flexibility to make a decision on a case-by-case basis and to set the period most effective for removing or reducing the risk while ensuring rigorous attention to the necessity and proportionality of the measures taken. I understand noble Lords&#146; concerns, and one thing I can look at again is whether we should ensure that extensions to orders allowing detention, isolation and quarantine should also be restricted to periods no longer than 28 days.</p>

<p><a name="08052197000062"></a>Amendments Nos. 187 and 188 aim to restrict the period of an order for less intrusive measures to 28 days. That is not practical. For example, if an individual who works with food is found to be infected with typhoid or e-coli, an order can be made requiring him to stay off work. The length of the order will normally be related to the length of time it takes, following treatment, to produce two clear stool samples. Samples will be checked regularly. However, producing two clear samples may take longer than 28 days. It would be unnecessary, if the individual is still found to be infectious, to require a review by a justice of the peace at 28 days.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000063"></a>Amendment No. 191 seeks to ensure that where an application is made to vary or revoke an order made by a justice of the peace under new Sections 45G, 45H or 45I, the application is heard within two working days of it being made. I sympathise with this  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC583"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC583</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>amendment. It is right that a hearing should be speedy, especially where the order will involve the detention or isolation of an individual. However, Amendment No. 191 is very rigid. It would require a hearing to take place even where it would not be sensible to do so within the given timeframe. For example, if an individual has been quarantined under an order from a justice of the peace and doctors are carrying out tests to determine whether the individual is suffering from a particular disease, it would not be sensible to require a hearing before the test results had been obtained, which might take longer than two working days. Requiring the hearing to take place regardless of whether the relevant evidence is available would be a waste of everybody&#146;s time and valuable resources.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000064"></a>Amendment No. 168 seeks to ensure that where a review of an ongoing special restriction or requirement is necessary, it can be conducted only by a magistrates&#146; court. We do not specify in the legislation who should carry out the review. The appropriate individual to carry out the review will vary depending on the situation. It will not always be appropriate or necessary for regulations to require the involvement of a justice of the peace. For example, the Secretary of State could make a requirement that, following incidents involving a particular contaminant, property involved should be closed until repeat disinfection measures can be carried out. The best individual to carry out a review of whether the premises had been successfully disinfected to a standard that no longer posed a public health risk would most likely be a scientist who could take a sample and test it. If the sample was clear, the restrictions on the premises could be lifted. There would be no need to involve the magistrates.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000065"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the issue of risk. We will discuss with the Justices&#146; Clerks&#146; Society and magistrates how best to ensure prompt appeals. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, raised the issue of how the review process will work in regulations and whether there will be an independent appeal process. The review process will always be independent because the appeal is always made to a magistrates&#146; court. New Section 45L extensions are repeat extensions, but we will be putting time limits on each renewal.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000066"></a>Amendment No.195, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, referred, would require that regulations regarding the length of an order or an extension of it follows the affirmative process. The Delegated Powers Committee did not recommend that these regulations were made using the affirmative process. The Government have accepted the recommendations of the Delegated Powers Committee in full, but I can look again at whether a compromise can be found, whereby new Section 45L(4) is brought into line with the recommendation from the DPC regarding new Section 45N, which is that the first version of the regulations would follow the affirmative procedure. I hope that in the light of the reasons I have given on why the Bill is drafted is this way, and the promises I have made to look at certain parts of it, that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000068"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052197000140"></a> Clause 123, page 70, line 28, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>&#147;(ba) the infection or contamination is of a kind which may be transmitted from person to person through casual contact with a person, a thing or premises,&#148;
<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000070"></a>The noble Earl said: I admit immediately that Amendment No. 169 is not anywhere near as perfect as it should be. It has been prompted by concerns raised by the National AIDS Trust. I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 182 and 192.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000071"></a>One of the consequences of adopting an all-hazards&#146; approach to public health legislation is that the language used in the drafting inevitably has to be all-purpose, the result of which is that it sweeps up absolutely everything in its path. In some instances that is not appropriate. The National AIDS Trust has pointed out&#151;and I agree with it&#151;that it would be quite wrong for this legislation to be applied, as it seems that it could be, to individuals who are suffering from an HIV infection.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000072"></a>The powers that are laid out in this part of the Bill are of greatest relevance in relation to serious contagious diseases that are spread by casual everyday contact. SARS and avian flu, as well as potentially deadly conditions such as viral haemorrhagic fever, need to be contained and dealt with in a manner appropriate to the risk that they pose to the general population. The powers necessary to deal with a real health emergency of that kind need to be flexible and extensive.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000073"></a>It is not, however, apparent that such powers should be applied to infections such as HIV, which are not transmissible through everyday or casual contact. The causal chain for transmitting HIV includes steps that require conscious human decisions and actions by both parties, on top of which the risk of transmission from a single exposure is extremely low. To this must be added the issue of stigma. The history of HIV and its spread across the world shows that the mistakes made by Governments have resulted either from inaction or tackling the threat in the wrong way. </p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000074"></a>This part of the Bill provides significant coercive powers that could in theory be applied to an HIV sufferer. Coercion has never been effective in dealing with the spread of HIV. Once you start coercing people, or threatening coercion, you immediately feed the fear and stigma that makes HIV so difficult to address and you do not achieve what is most needed, which is people coming forward of their own accord to be treated while there is still time. I hope that the Minister can provide some reassurance to the Committee on this dimension of the provisions.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000075"></a>Amendment No. 192 has also arisen from a concern of the National AIDS Trust but I have taken a slightly different route from the one it suggested to me. The course which it was keen for us to consider  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC585"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC585</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was the one proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, in Amendment No. 175. The issue here is the need for a mechanism whereby Part 2A orders are reported as a matter of course to a central body. That is appropriate not only in order for there to be national surveillance and advice in the event of an emergency, but also as a safeguard against wrongful use of the powers of removal and detention that are vested in JPs. There needs to be transparency in the way that these powers are actually being used to make sure that they are being applied proportionately and to good effect.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000076"></a>Perhaps rashly, I have been rather more prescriptive than the noble Baroness by suggesting that only one central body is appropriate for this purpose&#151;that is, the Health Protection Agency. I have also suggested that a local authority should have a duty to report to the HPA as soon as it makes the application for an order and not simply when an order is granted. As the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, is not in her place, I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, will be able to expand on this theme more capably than I, but it is something the Government should consider closely.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000077"></a>Turning finally, and very briefly, to Amendment No. 182, I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the wording in proposed new Section 45K(2). It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052197000141"></a>&#147;A Part 2A order may include, in addition to the restrictions or requirements mentioned in the provision under which it is made, such other restrictions or requirements as the justice considers necessary for the purpose of reducing or removing the risk in question&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052197000135"></a>I ask very simply what this could mean. On the face of things, the provision is extremely sweeping and it is not surprising that, again, the National AIDS Trust has expressed concern about it. One could envisage a situation where a magistrate has ordered a person&#146;s removal and detention, as well as the whole panoply of measures listed in new Section 45G(2).</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000078"></a>On top of all this, the magistrate is entitled to do anything else at all if he considers it necessary for the purpose of reducing or removing the risk in question. Can the Minister say whether this might include requiring the person to undergo medical treatment? We see in new Section 45E that regulations may not include such a provision but there is no corresponding limitation on the power of a magistrate. It would be helpful to hear from the Minister whether she is satisfied that this part of the clause, all encompassing as it seems to be, is fully consistent with the European Convention on Human Rights and with WHO guidelines. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08052197000079"></a><a name="80521-gc0008.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0008.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08052197000172"></a>Baroness Stern:</b> I would like briefly to speak to Amendments Nos. 173 and 174. Amendment No. 173 concerns the proportionality of detention under public health orders. The Bill proposes that JPs may only make such orders as are necessary in order to remove or reduce a risk of infection or contamination. This will involve the application of a proportionality test. Our Amendment No. 173 will prevent a JP making an order involving detention, isolation or quarantine unless he or she is satisfied that no other restrictions or requirements would be capable of reducing or removing the risk posed to public health. This makes it clear beyond doubt that in order to be proportionate, and  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC586"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC586</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>therefore necessary, measures which involve detention, isolation or quarantine may be imposed only when all other measures are considered inadequate to meet the risk to public health.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000080"></a>In the current provisions of the Public Health Act, the statutory language indicates that other steps must be considered before detention of an individual is considered appropriate. This reflects the approach of the European Court of Human Rights to detention for the purpose of preventing the spread of disease.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000081"></a>The Joint Committee expressed its concern in its report that at present there is no similar direction in the Bill. The Government explained in their response to the JCHR that they had,</p>
<ul><a name="08052197000145"></a>&#147;sympathy with the principle behind this proposal&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08052197000136"></a>but had some concern about the term &#147;last resort&#148;, which was used in the committee&#146;s report.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000082"></a>The Minster explained that the Government were concerned that unnecessary delay might occur in certain cases if the possibility of detention, isolation and quarantine were limited to the last resort and that a necessity test was more appropriate. We welcome the Government&#146;s acceptance of the principle behind the JCHR&#146;s conclusion. Our proposed amendment does not refer to the last resort and we therefore hope that the Government will find it acceptable.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000083"></a>Amendment No. 174 covers the need for objective medical evidence. The Bill provides for the relevant Minister&#151;either the Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly Minister in Wales&#151;to make regulations in relation to the evidence which a JP must consider before making a public health order. The amendment requires that those regulations include a requirement for objective medical evidence.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80521-gc0009.htm"/>


<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000084"></a>In its report, the JCHR noted that provision of medical evidence before a compulsory medical examination is required by the existing provisions of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights supports the conclusion that detention for the purposes of preventing the spread of infectious diseases or other risks to public safety must be based on objective medical evidence where the source of that risk is related to the health of the person being detained. Can the Minister confirm that objective medical evidence will be required before a JP will be able to make a public health order?</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000085"></a>If the Government do not consider that this evidence will be necessary or appropriate, can the Minister explain why? If the Government accept the need for it, I hope the amendment will be acceptable to the noble Baroness.</p>

Therefore it is very important.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000087"></a>My concern is particularly related to HIV. I have now come to accept that we are not going to get HIV taken out of the restrictions under the Bill. I hope that we might still be able to argue the case but, nevertheless, I am beginning to believe that that may not happen.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000088"></a>At Second Reading, I highlighted my concern about the absence of any reporting and monitoring mechanisms of the use of these orders, which may have significant implications for civil liberties, particularly given our obligations under the Human Rights Act. We have heard a great deal about that in previous amendments and, although I have not intervened, I support most of the amendments under this section.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000089"></a>My noble friend the Minister indicated earlier that the Bill will extend the powers available to a JP in relation to a risk of infection or disease. Previously a JP could make an order for a medical examination, to move someone with a notifiable disease to hospital or for detention in hospital. Under the new Bill, that list is much more extensive. I heard the Minister say that it had been devised to ultimately make the powers more flexible. I would like a little more explanation as to how that would work.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000090"></a>I shall not list all the duties that now fall to a JP, but I shall refer to two. For instance, a requirement to answer questions, restrict movement or quarantine may on occasions be necessary as a last resort to control a dangerous and contagious disease. However, there is also a potential for misuse against a stigmatised condition or a group of people who may be particularly vulnerable, such as people with HIV. I am also concerned that people who have HIV, once they are aware of the restrictions under the Bill, may refuse to go for testing because they are scared of the consequences. Very often they will fear something which they should not fear, which is particularly important. It is also terribly important that there is continuing misunderstanding about how HIV is transmitted. In the UK, it mainly affects already socially marginalised groups.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000091"></a>Given the extension of these powers, it is vital to ensure that the use of the powers is monitored. The actual process of monitoring should be extremely simple. I, too, look to the HPA, which has existing procedures in place that could be adapted for this purpose. Will they be extended to cover this Bill? Given the potential implication of these orders for people&#146;s civil liberties, it is absolutely essential that that is the case.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000092"></a>I stress the point about having some form of statutory provision because with a purely administrative process there is a danger that even with the best instructions and good will the process will be forgotten, particularly over time and as staff move on. The fact that the orders are used very infrequently makes it even more likely that administration processes will fall by the wayside. That could be avoided by a statutory monitoring process, as the system would be enshrined in law or be

However, my concerns go further than that. They also relate to the needs of the individual who is subject to a public health order. Who will provide the information and advocacy for such individuals?</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000093"></a>Clearly the use of the orders is extremely rare, as most people living with a contagious disease are willing to comply with suggested treatments and public health measures without need of an order. I made a point earlier about the problem of people with HIV. Prosecutions for transmission of HIV have prevented people going for testing. The CPS has now reviewed those regulations to assist that position.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000094"></a>One problem that worries me very much is that an individual, a vulnerable person&#151;for example, an asylum seeker who does not speak English and is, perhaps, co-infected with TB and HIV and living in the UK without any family&#151;could be subjected to an order and may not have access to the support that he requires to help him appeal the order. I appreciate the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, which relates to a similar concern.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000095"></a>Will the Government consider the amendment carefully and look again at the need to include within the Bill measures or to give guarantees of a provision in regulation to ensure that vulnerable individuals who are subject to an order are aware of their rights, particularly their right to appeal, and have access to support to help them through that process? There is a need for the Government to consider again the importance of safeguarding the rights of vulnerable people who find themselves subject to a Part 2A order, both through measures to protect the individual and through a national statutory monitoring system to ensure that there is a reliable and sustainable mechanism to monitor the use of these extended powers.</p>

I shall not take up very much of the Committee&#146;s time because it has all been said, but I make a plea that we look again at new Section 45C(3)(c), which talks about,</p>
<ul><a name="08052197000146"></a>&#147;a threat to public health&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052197000137"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, pointed out that that is a very broad statement. We should then look at new Section 45G, which, as we have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, and others, not only allows a person to be ordered to have a medical examination or to be removed to hospital but all the other things in the section, which I shall not read out. It is a very draconian curtailment of his civil liberties, because he is deemed to be a threat to public health.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000097"></a>You could have a ruthless JP or local authority&#151;I do not suggest for one moment that they exist in this country at the moment, but there could be such an administration in the future&#151;which would say that a sex worker with HIV was a threat to public health. You could have an equally ruthless person saying that any gay person infected with HIV was a threat to public health, because it is such a broad term. Therefore, it is conceivable that under that Administration&#151;we have had Governments like that in Europe and it is not

It could be interpreted in that way because of the looseness of that phrase. I urge the Minister to look at those two new sections to make sure that the Government are entirely happy that they will not be misused in future. That is why we want to see some central monitoring. There is no monitoring of these orders at the moment, and it is important that there should be. The Health Protection Agency is the ideal body to do it. We need to keep a close watch on this because of the &#147;just in case&#148; scenario. It could happen, even in the UK. We must protect our civil liberties.</p>

It addresses the issue that the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, has already raised: the need for independent advocacy for these individuals. I am not wedded to my amendment, which I lifted lock, stock and barrel from the Mental Health Act 2007. It was a highly convenient to lift it out and transpose it.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000099"></a>I want us to think about who these people are and why they are so rare. Normally someone gets carted away by the police and the courts under the criminal justice system or under mental health legislation. Tens of thousands of people are carted away every year. Everybody who works in those two systems has intense training in recognising individuals&#146; rights and ensuring that they receive information. There is a system of appeals that is brought to their attention, and there are advocates on their behalf who ensure that they know how to use the system to their best interests. However, there are provisions where that is not the case. Many people will know that Section 47 of the National Assistance Act 1948, which was put in place following catastrophes in 1925, and the shorter emergency version in the National Assistance (Amendment) Act of 1951 are still on the statute book. They are about carting away dirty old people who do not fit conveniently into mental health legislation. They are rather vague statutes, and they are used about 200 times a year. A medical officer of health has to apply to a JP in the same way, and those people are removed to a hospital and detained. As a research project, my colleague Paul Wolfson and I interviewed 200 individuals who had been removed under Section 47. None of them had appealed. I think that one was enabled to appeal after our interview but mostly they did not appeal because no one told them how to do it. These were very sick and frail old people, and half of them died following their removal. Seventy per cent of them could have been removed under the mental health legislation if someone had thought to use it appropriately.</p>

<p><a name="08052197000100"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, has said, it could well be the case that individuals who do not speak English and who arrive with a very peculiar disease, such as SARS, will be subject to these orders, and it seems to me that they will be in the same boat

We must have some way of ensuring that they know how to appeal and make certain that someone is responsible for ensuring that they know their rights.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000101"></a>No data are collected centrally about Section 47. Questions were raised in 2000 in a letter from the Department of Health about the difficulties that Section 47 of the National Assistance Act posed in relation to the Human Rights Act. A discussion was got going but it did not seem to continue. The letter from the Department of Health was circulated. It expressed anxiety about the likely incompatibility of some of the provisions with the Human Rights Act. It said that it was difficult to judge how far any incompatibility of Section 47 and the Human Rights Act went and pointed out the practical difficulties for authorities that did not have any information available.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000102"></a>The reality is that people who are carted away under Part 2A orders will be in exactly the same boat. It is crucial that we understand that it is not just for local authorities to collect the data; we must have data that can be used to review why these things are happening, and those data must be collected centrally by some authority. I, for one, think that the health protection authority was the right organisation to do that. I also express support for the notion that the individuals should have someone independent&#151;I am not wedded to the idea of the local authority doing it&#151;who can assist them in exercising their right to an appeal.</p>

These are that the individual is or may be infected or contaminated; the infection or contamination is one which presents or could present significant harm to human health; there is a risk that the individual might infect or contaminate others; and it is necessary to make the order to remove or reduce that risk.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000104"></a>Amendment No. 169 seeks to add a further criterion&#151;that the infection or contamination must be one that can only be passed from person to person, or thing or premises to person, by casual contact.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000105"></a>Risk does not only exist when a disease is highly transmissible by casual contact. Tuberculosis is highly infectious but it would be rare for an individual to catch it from one instance of casual contact with an infected person. Those most at risk from an infected tuberculosis sufferer tend to be their close family and friends, because they have prolonged or regular contact with the infected person, rather than casual contact.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000106"></a>I understand that the intention behind the amendment is to ensure that the powers are not used against individuals with HIV or AIDS, and I absolutely recognise that as a valid concern. However, we believe that the existing provisions afford the safeguards sought in the amendment. In order for a justice of the peace to make an order, he must consider it necessary to make an order to remove or reduce the risk. I am happy to put on record in this  


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC591"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column GC591</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Committee that having HIV or AIDS would not in itself be enough to justify a Part 2A order.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000107"></a>That brings me to Amendments Nos. 175 and 192, which seek a statutory requirement for a central reporting mechanism for orders made by justices of the peace. We have considered the issue of monitoring which was raised in another place&#151;and, indeed, has been raised by several noble Lords and the National AIDS Trust&#151;and we agree with what has been said. The Department of Health has already agreed with the Health Protection Agency that it will set up a monitoring system within its standard operating procedures. However, to reassure the Committee, I will endeavour to find a way to make it explicit that a local authority must report the making of an order to the HPA in line with its existing duty to co-operate with the HPA as set out in Section 5 of the Health Protection Agency Act 2004.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000108"></a>Amendment No. 183 would require local authorities to take reasonable steps to provide an individual subject to a Part 2A order with access to an independent advocate. This issue was raised by several noble Lords. Evidence from the Health Protection Agency regarding the use of Justice of the Peace orders under the existing legislation shows that they are most commonly used for individuals who have tuberculosis. Many have no fixed abode and it is because of their erratic lifestyle that they have been unable to follow a course of treatment which can take six months. However, such individuals are usually closely engaged with social workers, counsellors, housing officers and other relevant services which are already trying to help them.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000109"></a>In addition, the whole point of placing orders in the hands of a Justice of the Peace is to put real weight behind the protection of the individual. Magistrates&#146; courts are bound by a duty to ensure that vulnerable individuals receive a fair hearing. As public bodies, they are also required to uphold the Human Rights Act. Our legislation ensures that, on top of this, there are rights of appeal to both magistrates and to a Crown Court. That said, I sympathise with the concerns that noble Lords have expressed today. I therefore commit to look again at how the regulation-making power in new Section 45M(5)(e) could be used to add to the list of affected persons, or persons nominated to act on their behalf, who can apply to vary or revoke an order. This would give an individual subject to an order an additional way of seeking assistance if they are unable, for any reason, to use their own right to apply for a variation or revocation, or their right to appeal to a Crown Court under Section 67 of the existing Act.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000110"></a>However, I also recognise that there is a concern, as outlined eloquently by my noble friend Baroness Gould, that a person subject to an order may be newly arrived in this country and friendless and may therefore not know anyone to whom to turn for assistance if they feel the order is inappropriate or if they do not understand it. Therefore I will look at how we can best address an individual&#146;s needs and ensure that they have appropriate assistance or representation to protect their interests.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000111"></a>Amendment No. 173 seeks to ensure that detention, isolation or quarantine can be imposed only as a measure of last resort. We agree that detention, isolation and quarantine are serious measures and should be used only when absolutely necessary. However, in choosing what measure to include in an order the Justice of the Peace needs to consider the severity and urgency of the risk to public health and the effectiveness of any measure proposed. For example, isolation may not be the only measure a Justice of the Peace can order which reduces the risk of an individual spreading a disease, but it may be the only measure which would remove the risk entirely. Another measure may reduce the risk but could leave people exposed to significant danger.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000112"></a>Amendment No. 174 seeks to require that evidence presented to a Justice of the Peace includes objective medical evidence. Once again, I can understand the logic behind the amendment but I cannot support it. The reason for this is that the meaning of the term &#147;objective medical evidence&#148; is vague and could lead to legal challenge. In addition, the issue that dictates whether an order is necessary may not always be a medical one; it may be a lifestyle issue, as I have already outlined, and a social worker or counsellor may be better placed than a doctor to explain that an individual&#146;s erratic lifestyle, for example, is the reason why they cannot comply voluntarily with the six months&#146; course of treatment unless they are required to stay in one place for six months.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000113"></a>It is our intention that the Bill should not allow anyone to have forced medical treatment. If this is not clear, we will bring something back on Report to clarify this and write to noble Lords to confirm that position. We have taken a provision to enable details of the evidence required to be set out in secondary legislation. We will carry out a full 12-week consultation on the regulations, which will also receive parliamentary scrutiny through an affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000114"></a>Amendment No. 182 would remove the power of a justice of the peace to place restrictions or requirements&#151;other than those listed in the Bill&#151;in an order that they also consider necessary for the purpose of removing or reducing risk. Section 45K will, in some circumstances, be an essential tool needed to give effect to the measures that may be imposed. For example, an individual may suffer from multidrug resistant tuberculosis and have a tendency to drink to excess. That drinking may be a known cause of the individual&#146;s lack of co-operation with treatment. So, as well as placing a requirement on the individual to attend regularly hospital for directly observed therapy, the magistrate may believe it necessary to add to the order a requirement that the individual should refrain from drinking for the duration of the treatment. This would be a sensible additional measure which would reduce or remove the risk of him infecting others.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000115"></a>However, I hope that I can reassure the Committee by explaining that the criteria that must be satisfied for a justice to impose an order must also be met for supplementary measures. Therefore, it must be necessary&#151;not just desirable&#151;for such a measure to be included.On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I particularly welcome her statement on HIV and very much welcomed her undertaking on the role of the Health Protection Agency in monitoring the use of these orders. It was helpful that she picked up on the concern about friendless people and the provision of advocacy for them, and that she will take away and consider the possibility that the definition of an affected person could be tailored to include someone who could act as an advocate in those circumstances. I was also glad to hear her say that any lack of clarity about a prohibition on forced medical treatment might be addressed by means of a clarifying amendment.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000117"></a>I am sure that all Members of the Committee will study the Minister&#146;s reply with considerable interest. I thank her once again for the care that she has taken to address the concerns. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052197000142"></a> Clause 123, page 70, line 29, after &#147;a&#148; insert &#147;significant&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000120"></a>The noble Earl said: I will speak also to Amendments Nos. 173A, 176, 178, 179 and 181.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000121"></a>When a magistrate receives an application for a Part 2A order, there is a checklist of conditions that must be satisfied before an order may legally be granted. The checklist is similar whether the application relates to a person, a thing or a set of premises. In the case of a person, the JP has to be satisfied that he or she,</p>
<ul><a name="08052197000147"></a>&#147;is or may be infected or contaminated ... the infection or contamination is one which presents or could present significant harm to human health ... there is a risk that P might infect or contaminate others ... it is necessary to make the order in order to remove or reduce that risk&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000122"></a>The checklist does not include any threshold of risk. The degree of risk, or the size of the threat to public health presented by a given set of circumstances, can of course vary enormously. It can be anything from a remote risk and a distant threat to a high risk and a serious and imminent threat. But the clause leaves the whole issue completely open.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000123"></a>Under new Sections 45C(6) and 45D(4) special restrictions or requirements can be imposed in one of two ways: they can either be imposed by a magistrate or, in certain circumstances, by means of regulations where there is a serious and imminent threat to public health. The inference to be drawn from this is that an application to a magistrate for a Part 2A order could in theory be made in circumstances where the threat to public health is a good deal lower than serious and imminent.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0009.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000124"></a>One could have an overcautious local authority applying to take quite draconian action in the face of a risk that by most people&#146;s standards was remote. That may sound unlikely, but the drafting of the clause at present seems to offer no barrier to the granting of an order in such circumstances.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000125"></a>It is true that the magistrate has to be satisfied that it is necessary to make the order to remove or reduce the risk, but a local authority might argue that an order, and only an order, would achieve the objective of reducing the risk. There is no proportionality test here&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, made that point earlier. That is different from proposed new Section 45D(1), which stipulates that public health regulations may be made only if the,</p>
<ul><a name="08052197000148"></a>&#147;Minister considers ...that the restriction or requirement is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80521-gc0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000126"></a>An order by a magistrate could in theory be imposed even if it was wholly disproportionate to the end result or to the degree of risk apparent at the time of the application. The amendments, therefore, seek to strike a note of realism into the provisions by saying that the degree of risk of infection or contamination must in all cases be significant before an order may be granted. I hope that the Minister will give this proposal some serious consideration. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08052197000127"></a><a name="80521-gc0010.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0010.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08052197000179"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I understand that the intention behind these amendments is to ensure that where there is an insignificant risk of transmission an order cannot be made. I agree that that is an important principle. I hope that I can reassure the noble Earl that the Bill already does that.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000128"></a>As noble Lords know, under the provisions proposed in the Bill, a justice of the peace must be satisfied that the four criteria have been fulfilled before he can make an order under proposed new Sections 45G, 45H or 45I. The criteria are as I outlined in my previous answer: an individual is or may be infected or contaminated; the infection or contamination is one which presents or could present significant harm to human health; there is a risk that the individual might infect or contaminate others; and it is necessary to make the order to remove and reduce that risk.</p>

<a name="80521-gc0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08052197000129"></a>If the risk of infecting or contaminating others was not significant the order would not be necessary, thus failing the fourth criteria. The significance of the risk in the third criterion is implicit&#151;it is there already. I hope that the noble Earl will accept that we have addressed this issue and on that basis feels able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08052197000130"></a><a name="80521-gc0010.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80521-gc0010.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08052197000180"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I am going to have to think very carefully about that one&#151;that the significance of the risk is implicit in the drafting. I could not see that it was. If the noble Baroness tells me that it is, then I must take that seriously. I shall go and look at it even more carefully. In view of the hour it is appropriate for me now simply to withdraw the amendment. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08052179000013"></a>I am pleased to inform the House that we have taken a major step towards the procurement of new naval tankers, as part of the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability (MARS) project, to support the Royal Navy on global operations worldwide. We have set a worldwide competition for the design and build of these new fleet tankers and have now selected four companies with whom we look forward to working to develop our plans further. We urgently need new double-hulled tankers and recognise that UK capacity may not be available. The four companies that will work alongside the department over the coming months for the new MARS fleet tankers are: Fincantieri (Italy); Hyundai (Republic of Korea); Navantia (Spain); and a consortium of BAE Systems (UK) with BMT DSL (UK) and DSME (Republic of Korea).</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08052179000014"></a>Following the competition, the MoD will make a final decision in 2009 to select one of the companies/consortia to design and build these new ships.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08052179000015"></a>The new fleet tankers, the first element of the MARS programme, will comply with the highest international environmental standards, provide a much improved working environment for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary personnel, and allow the full range of Royal Navy operations to continue around the globe for 25 years from their launch.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08052179000018"></a>Mr Lewis&#146;s inquiry comprised three key strands, which have established:</p>
the series of events beginning in May 2005 leading up to the provision to the CPS of the Dutch DNA disk in January 2007. This identified the nature of the arrangements made between the UK and Dutch authorities for the exchange of DNA profiles for   


<notus-date day="21" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS90"></a><b>21 May 2008 : Column WS90</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>comparison with their respective national databases (referred to as Operation Thread) and how these arrangements were carried out;the series of events and the actions of CPS personnel between receipt of the Dutch DNA disk in January 2007 and passing it on to the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) in January 2008. This included consideration as to whether action of any kind should be taken against any CPS employee; and the progress made since January 2008: to pursue the analysis of the Dutch DNA profiles; to exchange information arising from this with the Dutch authorities; and to identify, trace and prosecute those suspected of criminal offences both in the UK and in the Netherlands.
<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08052179000019"></a>The Solicitor-General and I are very grateful to Peter Lewis for his thorough inquiry and for this comprehensive report. On the basis of this, we are in no doubt that there is potentially immense value in these exchanges of data and in the investment the UK Government have made in establishing a DNA database. The exchange of information may lead to the prosecution of criminals who would not otherwise be brought to justice.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08052179000020"></a>However, the report reveals significant shortcomings in the way in which this process was planned and implemented. The report sets out that at no time had it been agreed that the Dutch DNA disk should be sent to the CPS, and that it should rather have been sent to the UK Central Authority. But there was a highly regrettable delay to the process while the disk was in the possession of the CPS.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>

any bilateral discussions for the exchange of DNA data between the UK and foreign jurisdictions should include representatives from the CPS and the equivalent prosecuting authority from that foreign jurisdiction;such discussions should result in the production of a written agreement or protocol, and Ministers should be informed, before the mutual exchange arrangements are implemented;any such agreement or protocol should outline the key steps to be taken, attribute responsibility for each step, preferably to a named individual, identify a senior point of contact in each organisation and set an agreed timescale for completion of each stage of the process, and establish a mechanism for the recorded agreement of any revisions to that timescale where necessary;every such agreement or protocol should comply with the pre-existing legal and procedural requirements of the jurisdictions/states involved, including any data protection regimes;

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08052179000022"></a>These recommendations have been accepted and the National Policing Improvement Agency will lead on ensuring that they are followed. In addition, the UK agreed to the EU Council decision on Pr1/4m in June 2007 which will provide member states&#146; law enforcement authorities with access to DNA and fingerprint data, on a hit or no hit basis, and direct access to vehicle registration. This will allow for much quicker and improved tools to share data for the detection, investigation and prevention of serious crime, while maintaining appropriate data protection safeguards. It is due to be implemented three years from adoption by the European Union Council of Ministers, which is expected shortly.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08052179000031"></a>Today I am publishing two papers which summarise the responses to the consultation papers <I>Statutory Duty for Doctors and other Public Service Personnel to Report Deaths to the Coroner</I> and <I>Cremation Regulations</I><I>:</I><I> Consolidation and Modernisation</I>.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08052179000032"></a>A statutory duty to report deaths to coroners, to be introduced through the Coroners and Death Certification Bill, will be placed on registered medical practitioners only, although it will not prevent anyone else being able to report a death, including family members, if they have concerns. The Bill will give the Lord Chancellor the power, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Health, to make regulations which set out the circumstances in which deaths must be referred to the coroner.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08052179000033"></a>The response paper indicates what we are doing ahead of legislation to take this policy forward. We will work across government and with those who work in the coroners service to produce national guidance for England and Wales to clarify which deaths should be reported to the coroner. This national guidance will form the basis of the list of reportable deaths, and will be framed in secondary legislation and associated guidance under the Coroners and Death Certification Bill when it is implemented.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08052179000034"></a>The Cremation Regulations 1930 have been amended on a number of occasions and are now seen as old-fashioned and confusing. It is intended they will be modernised and consolidated. There will also be two major policy changes. First, bereaved families will have the right to inspect the medical forms before the cremation takes place. This is an important Shipman-related reform. The families of Shipman's victims believed that if they had had seen the cremation forms Shipman had completed about their relative they would have recognised that the information was wrong and Shipman would have been exposed much sooner. The Government believe that that is likely to have been the case. Secondly, the regulation on the handling of contagious diseases will be replaced by a simpler procedure permitting the rapid throughput of cases. In the light of the responses we have received, we intend to introduce the new regulations together with accompanying guidance for stakeholders before the end of the year.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="08052179000037"></a><a name="80521-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80521-wms0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08052179000071"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08052179000038"></a>On 18 May over 1,000 people gathered in Birmingham to mark the 10th anniversary of the formation of a human chain by over 70,000 people to demand an end to the debts of the world&#146;s poorest countries. Since that day 10 years ago, we have made great progress in providing debt relief to the poorest nations. Debt relief has played an important role in helping these countries tackle poverty and progress towards the millennium development goals.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08052179000039"></a>The enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative (HIPC) was launched in 1999 to provide faster, deeper and broader debt relief and to make the poverty reduction strategies of poor countries central to HIPC. At Gleneagles, in 2005, we used our G8 presidency to go further and secure the multilateral debt relief initiative (MDRI). Excellent progress has been made under these initiatives and together they have so far provided over $100 billion (&#163;51 billion) worth of debt relief allowing the poorest countries to invest vital resources in health, education and infrastructure. In 2005, the Paris Club agreed its largest ever African debt relief deal with Nigeria.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08052179000040"></a>Since the last Statement in January 2007 there has been further progress on debt relief for poor countries. Sao Tome and Principe and the Gambia are the most recent countries to complete the HIPC process and have most of their debt cancelled, bringing the total to 23 countries. These countries have received 100 per cent cancellation of their multilateral debts owed to the World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the MDRI. A further 10 countries are receiving interim relief, including Afghanistan and the Central African Republic, who entered HIPC during 2007, and Liberia who entered at the start of 2008. Another eight countries remain eligible for the debt relief provided under these international initiatives. The UK continues to exceed its HIPC commitments, providing 100 per cent bilateral debt relief and holding in trust any payments received from HIPC countries yet to enter the initiative.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08052179000041"></a>There are many good examples of the use countries are making of their debt relief savings. Burundi is using the extra $75 million HIPC relief has provided towards the abolition of primary school fees and the building of 1,100 primary school classrooms. Nicaragua is using its savings to increase investment by $54.3 million in health and $121 million in education between 2007 and 2008. It also used funds towards supporting the construction of social housing, water and sanitation and social programmes aimed at children and families affected by natural disasters. Sierra Leone is using $33

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08052179000042"></a>We remain committed to the full financing and implementation of the HIPC and MDRI initiatives. Our annual MDRI contributions to the World Bank and AfDB for 2007 and 2008 have amounted to &#163;71 million. Since January 2007, we have provided &#163;30.7 million to the HIPC Trust Fund towards debt cancellation costs for a number of HIPC countries including Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo and most recently the Gambia.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08052179000043"></a>Under the Commonwealth Debt Initiative (CDI) we provided a further &#163;5 million of debt relief for Jamaica in 2007-08 bringing the total we have written off under this initiative since 1998 to &#163;51 million.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08052179000044"></a>Countries with arrears to the international financial institutions must clear them before they can enter HIPC and receive debt relief. Last year, we contributed &#163;1.3 million to help clear arrears owed to the AfDB by the Central African Republic and &#163;500,000 to help clear the arrears owed by Comoros to the AfDB. More recently, the UK has contributed &#163;20 million to help with the clearance of Liberia&#146;s arrears at the AfDB and IMF.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08052179000045"></a>We continue to believe that many poor countries, not just HIPCs, require additional support with their debt payments in order to achieve the MDGs. Under the UK MDRI we provide multilateral debt relief to poor countries not covered by HIPC that can use the savings for poverty reduction. We have recently changed the UK MDRI eligibility criteria to provide a clearer focus on good public financial management. This enables more of the poorest countries to benefit from debt relief. Under the revised criteria, five new countries qualify to receive UK MDRI, in addition to the eight that are currently receiving support.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08052179000046"></a>The UK has also been at the forefront of international initiatives to promote sustainable lending and borrowing. We played a key role in discussions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Export Credit Group in January 2008 to agree a set of principles and guidelines that promote sustainable lending to all low-income countries. The UK continues work to improve the capacity of poor countries to manage their debt and to support the development of policy frameworks that promote sustainable lending and borrowing.</p>

<a name="80521-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08052179000047"></a>The benefits of debt relief can be reduced by the actions of so-called vulture funds. We have made concerted efforts to tackle this problem and secured international agreement on the need for action. To reduce the risk of debts falling into the hands of vulture funds we have been working with the World Bank to help poor countries buy back their commercial debts at a deep discount through the debt reduction facility (DRF). Last year we provided &#163;1.8 million to assist with Nicaragua&#146;s $1.3 billion commercial debt buy-back operation. This operation represented the elimination of over two-thirds of all reported court judgments against completion-point HIPCs. Last May, the UK called for assistance from the DRF to be available earlier for HIPC countries, a position supported

We have recently announced our commitment of up to &#163;10 million for future DRF country operations to help tackle the threat of vulture funds. In addition, with strong UK support, the board of the African Development Bank has agreed to promote the establishment of an independent legal support facility to advise countries on how best to tackle vulture fund activity.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08052179000063"></a>The Yorkshire and Humber plan is crucial to delivering the Government&#146;s sustainable communities and growth agenda in the region. It builds on the foundation of the draft plan published by the Yorkshire and Humber Assembly in 2006 and takes account of the two rounds of public consultation and independent examination in public that followed. In total 2,276 representations were received from 201 people and organisations. Over a third of these representations were expressions of support, while the remainder suggested further or alternative changes to the RSS. I have considered all of these representations, and also updates to the sustainability appraisal/strategic environmental assessment and habitat regulations assessment required under the legislation which confirm that the revised plan should help deliver sustainable development. I have decided that no further major policy changes are required, although amendments and clarifications have been made to various parts of the plan.</p>

The Yorkshire and Humber Assembly is committed to carrying out a further partial review of the plan to consider housing growth, taking account of latest evidence, eco towns and new growth points. This will be completed by 2011 as required by the Green Paper.</p>

<a name="80521w0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a><a name="08052174000074"></a>Key proposals are that:</p>
all medical certificates of cause of death (MCCDs), with the exception of cases referred directly to the coroner by the certifying doctor, would be subject to scrutiny by an independent medical examiner appointed by a primary care trust (or an equivalent organisation in Wales) and with strong links to the National Health Service clinical governance teams;if the medical examiner was satisfied that all was in order, he/she would issue an authorisation enabling the family of the deceased to register the death and proceed to burial or cremation;where the medical examiner was not satisfied that the MCCD told the full story, or felt that there were other unusual circumstances, he/she would refer the case to the coroner for further investigation, along with his/her reasons for  doing so;

<a name="80521w0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a><a name="08052174000075"></a>Clauses implementing these important reforms will be included in the coroners and death certification Bill announced as part of the Government's draft legislative programme for 2008-09.
