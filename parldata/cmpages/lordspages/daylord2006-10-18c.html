We are trialling new measures to make best use of motorway capacity. We are also exploring the scope for developing a national system of road pricing.</p>

Does he agree that the vital role in our economy played by road freight transport and the extra carbon emissions from traffic congestion both argue for a higher priority to be given to road improvement and construction? Our existing road system is showing its age and there are numerous congestion black spots that are crying out for traffic-easing investment. As for new roads, have the Government given any consideration, for example, to the possible construction of an outer M25 ring road around London?</p>

On the noble Lord&#146;s basic point, roads are of course essential to our economy and that is why we propose to spend&#163;1.7 billion over the next two years on at least23 major schemes. But I want to give the House the assurance that we intend to lock in the benefits of motorway widening by effective traffic management so that we do not produce additional congestion in due course.</p>

Does the Minister regret that he did not leave it in place because they reinstated most of those projects five years later? If they had left the programme in place, it is possible that the roads would have been built by now.</p>

The answer to the noble Lord&#146;s question is straightforward. We are giving priority to improvements to our roads but we need a comprehensive transport plan, particularly in the context of the problems of climate change. That is also why there is such heavy investment in the railways.</p>

More generally, we already have one illustration of effective road pricing with the congestion charge in London. We are looking at further development and are offering financial support to local authorities to introduce road pricing where they can establish that congestion can be tackled adequately, and in the longer run we will have to look at other areas of the road network in addition to city and town centres.</p>

We have in place, of course, traffic management officers, who ensure that when incidents occur on motorways they are dealt with more effectively. I agree with the noble Lord. As has been shown by the American experience and elsewhere, one has to look towards rewarding cars that are fully laden&#151;that is, with more than just the driver and carrying additional passengers at certain times&#151;and ensuring that we tackle the problem of peak periods. It is a staggering fact that a very high percentage of our cars are on the road at one particular hour in the day, called the school run.</p>

Bearing in mind that there are more than 13,000 post offices but Royal Mail&#146;s view is that only 4,000 are required to deliver a proper Royal Mail service, will the Government consider allowing altering the terms of post office licences so that they can deal with mail other than that of the Royal Mail?</p>

It is not about one government department trying to get a slightly better service and putting a burden on another one. There are very striking differences in cost between the services provided by the Post Office and other means. For example, it costs nearly &#163;1 to make a payment into a Post Office card account, compared with 1p into a bank account.

That is not atypical. Indeed, the MoD has six sites around London through its project MoD Estates London&#151;MoDEL&#151;which will release a great deal of housing for development. It is working with English Partnerships in close association. That is a very good and positive example of how the disposal of public land can make a real contribution to meeting our housing needs.</p>

The reduction in what the Treasury gets from the sale will inevitably come out of other very desirable government spending programmes.</p>

The process is designed to support and stimulate modernisation and reform, promoting Georgia&#146;s development asa secure, stable and successful country. The responsibility for doing all those things lies with Georgia.

My explanations to date must not have been persuasive enough, because the Government apparently still have difficulty in grasping why their proposals cause a problem for police authorities; so I will try once more. The amendment has a different focus from those that I tabled previously, but before the noble Lord accuses me of inconsistency and not knowing what I want, which I am sure he would not do, I will explain.</p>

<a name="61018-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="06101838000082"></a>Police authorities are perfectly happy to have a duty to secure best value, provided they have the tools to make sure that it happens; but they object to being left with a duty, but with no power to do anything about it, which is what the Bill will effectively do. That is an impossible situation to be in. My previous amendments tried to deal with it by removing the best value duty, but the Government have made it clear that they do not like that idea, although they have never satisfactorily explained why, to me anyway.</p>

<a name="61018-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="06101838000083"></a>I am now trying a different tack to resolve the situation. The amendment will give authorities back the power to conduct best value reviews. That is, it will give authorities back the power to make sure that best value happens. I am sympathetic to the view that best value, as applied by what is now the Department for Communities and Local Government, has become a classic example of unnecessary red tape; I am trying to help the Government out here. My amendment would also remove best value inspections from policing, which account for a great deal of bureaucracy surrounding best value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="06101838000084"></a>I think we all agree that the principles of best value are sound; it is the practice that became a problem, surrounded by burdensome red tape. To offer reassurance to the Government about this, I am sure that the Association of Police Authorities would be willing to work with the Home Office, or any other department with an interest in this area, to develop a sort of &#147;best value lite&#148; regime. That would keep what is good about best value as a tool for effective scrutiny of force activity and performance improvement, but would lose what has become negative about it, the excessive bureaucracy, and would focus on the process, rather than outcomes.</p>

That was an interesting step forward and I suspect that we might want to consider that after we have rejected her amendment. The problem with her approach is that we are both arguing from a similar position; we both want to strip away unnecessary bureaucracy, but we disagree about the means by which we achieve it.</p>

<a name="61018-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="06101838000088"></a>We believe that we are removing an overly bureaucratic and excessively resource-intensive process.

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="06101838000089"></a>We should retain our approach and we do not need a statutory power to carry out best value reviews. Police authorities can draw on their powers in Section 22 of the Police Act 1996 to request a report from their chief officer on best value approaches. Police authorities will still be able to discharge their general duty to secure continuous improvement in the way in which the functions of police officers are delivered.

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="06101838000091"></a>I understand, but do not share, the noble Baroness&#146; concerns about the role that the Audit Commission would have played in joint inspections with the new inspectorate, but this amendment goes too far. The Bill retains the overarching duty on police authorities to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement in the way its functions are exercised, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. To ensure compliance with this duty, the Audit Commission would work with the Inspectorate of Constabulary, and that needs to continue to have the powers set out in the Local Government Act.</p>

<a name="61018-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="06101838000092"></a>Furthermore, I strongly believe that the Audit Commission has a valuable role to play. Historically, it has acted in the inspection of the quality and cost-effectiveness of a whole range of local authority services through the comprehensive performance assessment framework. It regularly works with other inspectorates. For example, it works with Ofsted to deliver comprehensive performance assessments and joint area reviews of children and young persons&#146; services, and with Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Constabulary to deliver community safety. With its wealth of experience, it makes sense for the Audit Commission to continue to have a role in carrying out inspections of a best-value authority&#146;s compliance with Part 1 of the Local Government Act 1999.</p>

I shall not detain your Lordships for long but shall clarify very briefly why we have taken this decision.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61018-0003.htm"/>


<a name="61018-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="06101838000100"></a>The Government have told us that adequate laws already exist to deal with any possible case of extraordinary rendition. However, careful scrutiny of Sections 1, 8 and 17 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and Sections 2, 33, 34 and 163 of the Customs and Excise Management Act, although wide, do not cover the illegal detention and transfer of persons to places where torture is likely to occur. Existing domestic legislation, including that proposed in the current Police and Justice Bill, addresses smuggling, stolen goods, prohibited articles or exceptionally urgent circumstances required to save life or limb. It does not cover kidnapped individuals who may transit UK airspace or land at UK aerodromes via state or military flights.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="06101838000101"></a>The Government may well argue that, unless there is evidence that such an individual is destined for a country or place where torture is likely, no arrestable

However, first, it may well be that such information is not routinely requested by the UK Government from their international partners; secondly, that information may not be forthcoming; and, thirdly, there is absolutely no way of ascertaining either of those two possibilities because of the diplomatic clearances in force.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="06101838000102"></a>That does not inspire confidence that the practice of extraordinary rendition does not take place. It is unlikely that there will ever be evidence of this odious practice; it is, by its nature, covert. But that does not mean that it does not or cannot take place. I emphasise that the Council of Europe has categorically stated that extraordinary rendition flights have used EU space and EU airfields, including in the UK. The Vienna Commission and the Joint Committee on Human Rights have both called for special legislation to fulfil domestic and international obligations and to ensure that extraordinary rendition never happens in future.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="06101838000103"></a>I am not sure that that argument is any longer about convincing the Government but it is in answer to other bodies that have expressed serious concerns about the UK's involvement in the practice of ER and the adequacy of existing legislation. To my mind, it is the duty of Parliament to bring about legislation that covers a possible illegality. Of course, there is crossover in legislation&#151;that is inevitable&#151;but where uncertainty exists, as it certainly does in this case, it is entirely legitimate to call for clarification.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="06101838000104"></a>I finish with a statement given by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer to the Constitutional Affairs Committee on 28 February this year.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="06101838000294"></a>&#147;If there were a reason for us to believe that rendition through this country was taking place, and by extraordinary rendition I mean people being rendered to another country for the purposes of torturing them, we would have an obligation to investigate it and stop it in so far as it was happening in this country&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06101838000273"></a>Surely, the Government would wish to abolish all uncertainty or doubt as to the use of UK facilities to enable extraordinary rendition to take place. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="06101838000275"></a>That is where I stand. The integrity of the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, and of the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, is in no way called into question. Fortunately I am no longer at the disadvantageof having discourse with a probabilities mathematician&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, explained the levels of probability. As I see the situation, one cannot approach this on that basis of a mathematical level of probabilities; one cannot even do that before one starts proceedings in the criminal courts. One has to assess fairly, on the available evidence and using one's common sense, what is the question of degree. The noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, and I favour that approach over a mathematical one&#151;I cannot add up, anyway.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="06101838000106"></a>On the available material from a recognised independent authority, the Foreign Affairs Committee of another place, the Joint Committee on Human Rights and other bodies have concluded that an inquiry should be set up. That material referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, has an evidential quality, quite apart from mere assertion. What quality is quite another matter. I have had and continue to have many happy discussions with the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, and have great respect for his integrity, but his approach is rather different from mine.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="06101838000107"></a>If the arrangements referred to on 18 July have already been investigated&#151;I cannot say why, but I have reason to believe they have&#151;that warrants further investigation by an independent body. That should not be in the public arena, however, so as to safeguard intelligence and security, as I said at col. 1211 on 18 July. I am therefore supporting this amendment as an opportunity to, yet again, ask the Government to reconsider.</p>

The issues are clear and well known; I will not rehearse them again. We have cross-party and government agreement that transporting people to countries for the purposes of torture is both unacceptable and illegal. When we have raised these issues, as we did during the passage of the Civil Aviation Bill, the Government have taken the view that no new legislation is needed to ensure thatflights for the purpose of torture&#151;extraordinary rendition&#151;are kept out of the United Kingdom. We have indeed signed up to international conventions putting a duty on us to observe international law for flights landing in the UK or transiting our airspace. As the noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, has pointed out, however, there are gaps, or perceived gaps, in the middle of this. We must ensure that those gaps do not exist.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="06101838000109"></a>Despite all the strong statements from the Government about the unacceptability of extraordinary rendition, there remains widespread concern, which noble Lords have expressed both today and in the past, that some flights sponsored by  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_777"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 777</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the United States Central Intelligence Agency have used United Kingdom airfields and airspace while moving to locations that, we believe, have been used for the interrogation of suspects. We also now know that the United States Government have adopted a rather different interpretation of what constitutes &#147;torture&#148; from that adopted by the United Kingdom. It is therefore presumably possible that the United States authorities could give assurances that the flights were not for the purposes of interrogation under torture under a United States definition, where international and United Kingdom law might take another view.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="06101838000110"></a>I hope that, this time, the Government will welcome this amendment as a way of clarifying the powers and responsibilities of all who may be concerned with suspicious flights. The amendment would also make the United Kingdom&#146;s position on illegal rendition clear to the international community. Given that there are separate, particular difficulties with military airfields, I shall be tabling a parallel amendment as the Armed Forces Bill goes through your Lordships&#146; House. The two amendments together would give us a coherent approach to a serious problem, and I urge the Government to take the opportunity to adopt the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza.</p>

<a name="06101838000111"></a><b><a name="61018-0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06101838000671"></a>Lord Archer of Sandwell:</b> My Lords, we are on well trodden ground. The proposal of the noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, was debated three times during the progress of the Civil Aviation Bill; it was debated in Committee on the present Bill; it was the subject of an Unstarred Question tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway; and it was debated last week in a slightly different form in an amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Garden, to the Armed Forces Bill. Anyone might be forgiven for wondering what there is left to say. But a number of unanswered questions remain, and the basis for the noble Baroness&#146;s anxiety is as clear now as when she first expressed it. Our discussions over that period may simply have deferred the time when we have to take a decision.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="06101838000112"></a>The revisions to the amendment that she originally tabled reflect two factors that emerged from our earlier debates. First, as she indicated, and as the noble Lord, Lord Garden, mentioned, there are divergent views about how far existing statutory powers are sufficient to ensure that the United Kingdom complies with its international obligations under the torture convention. Secondly, there is&#151;so far as I am concerned, at least&#151;an uneasy suspicion that there is a culture in some circles of not wanting to ruffle any feathers, particularly American feathers.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="06101838000113"></a>I am delighted that the noble Baroness has redrafted the amendment so that there would now be not merely a power to enter the aircraft, but a duty to do so. So where United Kingdom facilities may be being abused, the provision is no longer permissive, but mandatory.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="06101838000114"></a>Perhaps it would help to spend a moment clarifying what is now common ground and what remains debateable. I accept unreservedly that the

It hardly needs saying that I accept without hesitation that my noble friend on the Front Bench would not knowingly be complicit in the use of torture by the agents of this or any other country. I echo the gratitude expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, for the willingness of my noble friend and her officials to discuss this in order to assist in narrowing the area of dispute. I am not aware of any evidence to suggest that agents of this country have made use of torture, but what is in question is whether the Government have taken all the steps reasonably open to them to ensure so far as possible that no facilities have been made available to assist others with less scrupulous standards to subject anyone to the risk of torture. The torture convention imposes an obligation on states and individuals not to be complicit in acts of torture, an obligation of which the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, reminded us last week. If that gives rise to a number of questions on which debate is not concluded, perhaps we may be forgiven for at least adverting to them.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="06101838000115"></a>First, is there evidence that facilities in this country have been abused to assist rendition to a destination where there was a risk of torture? The evidence is overwhelming that the actions of the CIA have led to people suffering torture. I regret having to state that so bluntly, as some of my friends are employed by the CIA. I am certainly not suggesting that every official of the CIA is complicit in the practice, and I appreciate the difficulty of controlling agents operating in foreign countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="06101838000116"></a>We examined some of the evidence in the debates on the Civil Aviation Bill on 28 March and we reviewed it again in Committee on this Bill on 4 July. It is also reviewed in the Amnesty International report <I>Partners in Crime.</I> It was dealt with in some detail in the Council of Europe report by Senator Dick Marty and it was summarised by the Secretary General, Mr Terry Davis. It was even set out in the report <I>Torture by Proxy: International and Domestic Law Applicable to &#147;Extraordinary Renditions&#148;</I> by the committee on international human rights of the New York Bar and by the United States Center for Human Rights and Global Justice. Furthermore, in the United States there is considerable concern about the practice.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="06101838000117"></a>I am grateful to Liberty for its very helpful briefing on this subject, which was prepared in anticipation of our debates on the Bill. Of course the evidence does not establish that the facilities in the United Kingdom were used in the course of rendition. Its relevance is that it establishes the propensity of some CIA agents unscrupulously to practise extraordinary rendition&#151;and any country offering facilities to aircraft operated by the CIA would be turning the proverbial blind eye if it ignored the record of those with whom it was dealing.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="06101838000118"></a>Even the United Kingdom is confronted by uncomfortable questions that need to be answered. Both the Council of Europe and the Amnesty reports  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_779"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 779</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>referred to the case of Bisher Al-Rawi and Jamil El-Banna, which led to proceedings in the High Court for judicial review. They were arrested in Gambia, apparently in consequence of their travel arrangements supplied by United Kingdom officials, and were then sent by the CIA to Afghanistan. It is important to establish, if possible, whether the United Kingdom officials who supplied that information were aware of what was intended. Perhaps my noble friend will address that question when she replies.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="06101838000119"></a>The second question that requires to be answered is what precautions, in the light of the CIA's known record, can and should be taken to ensure that the United Kingdom is not used unwittingly in extraordinary rendition. Aircraft are not transparent; the only way to ascertain who is on board and in what circumstances is to enter the aircraft and look. An aircraft in state service&#151;an expression that includes aircraft in military, customs or police service&#151;is not entitled to fly over or land on the territory of another state without authorisation. I must confess that until the debate last week I had derived some comfort from that, as I had assumed that authorisation would be required prior to each such flight and it would be known when an aircraft was operated by the CIA. But, in the debate initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Garden, my noble friend Lord Drayson informed a startled House&#151;at col. 440&#151;that separate authorisation is not required, as there is a system of what is euphemistically called &#147;diplomatic clearance&#148;, which means that someone has given what appears to be blanket permission, and specific clearance by the airfield authorities is not required. I should be grateful if my noble friend would spell that out in a little more detail.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="06101838000120"></a>Does someone in this country have to be notified if it is proposed that a CIA-operated aircraft will fly over United Kingdom territory and make use of airport facilities, or is it done on a &#147;Don't bother to mention it&#148; basis for the whole category of military aircraft? Does it apply to all military aircraft or only to those of the USA? Is there a requirement to provide information on the purpose and destination of the flight? Does someone decide whether a specific flight calls for further inquiry? If so, who? Or does diplomatic clearance mean that no one asks any questions?</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="06101838000121"></a>Of course, it is not suggested that every aircraft operated by the CIA should be searched. It is accepted that there is a stage where investigation may appear as harassment and that that may occasion friction with the United States. The proposal is that an aircraft should be liable to a requirement to land if the Secretary of State is aware of intelligence that it is being or may be used for unlawful rendition. Of course, there is room for discussion about the standard of intelligence required. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, helpfully provided an analysis of that question in our debate on 18 July, at col. 1220. But that problem is not incapable of resolution between us.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="06101838000122"></a>If there is such intelligence, surely the United Kingdom is under an international obligation to make inquiries before permitting such an aircraft to  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_780"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 780</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proceed. If the aircraft is required to land, there is surely no difficulty in having an official or constable available to conduct a search. The inconvenience to the aircraft is surely minimal by comparison with the risk that someone may be tortured.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="06101838000123"></a>The remaining question is the one referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, as to whether there exists a power under existing domestic law to enter and search an aircraft. The Government maintain that the whole proposal is unnecessary because the statutory power exists already. The noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, has already addressed that matter; we have debated it more than once and I shall not weary your Lordships by rehearsing the argument again now. However, it would be helpful if, when my noble friend replies, she would say whether that is the only stumbling block that the Government see. If they are convinced that there is a need for something more than that, the other matters, which we have debated at such length, do not really prevent their acceding to the proposal. In any event, the question now largely falls because the proposal is that there should be a mandatory requirement, not merely a power. What troubles some of us is that this country may become complicit in these appalling practices, however unwittingly, because no one cared enough to ask the right questions and to conduct a simple search.</p>

I am delighted that the Foreign Secretary has stated on behalf of Her Majesty's Government that detention without trial is ineffective against terrorism. That is a small step forward, but I point out that indefinite detention continues at Guantanamo Bay.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="06101838000125"></a>I go further and draw attention to an article in today's <I>International Herald Tribune</I>, which describes the sad case of Mr Sami al-Hajj, an employeeof Al-Jazeera television, who was arrested in Afghanistan and is still, five years later, in detention without trial at Guantanamo. I also point out that, following the signature of a new Bill in the United States, it is not clear to what extent the right of <I>habeas corpus</I> still applies in that country. It is also not clear whether extended sleep deprivation is a legitimate method of preparing people for interrogation within the United States. I suggest to your Lordships that the amendment is for the removal of doubt. It is therefore especially appropriate for Third Reading and I support it strongly.</p>

It is essential that the western world should not have double standards and should not be thought to have double standards. It is not good enough merely to pay lip-service to our opposition to extraordinary rendition. We must satisfy the world at large that we really mean what we say. The Minister will remember that we are currently prosecuting several officers before a court martial for allegedly turning a blind eye in slightly similar circumstances. As I say, double

<a name="06101838000127"></a><b><a name="61018-0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="06101838000674"></a>The Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Scotland of Asthal):</b> My Lords, first, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, and my noble and learned friend Lord Archer for showing me the courtesy of talking to me about these issues in a little more detail before today. I am very grateful to them, as I am to all noble Lords for the care with which they have approached this issue. I confirm that I absolutely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Garden, that we have total cross-party agreement on this issue. There is nothing between us.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="06101838000128"></a>I also understand why there is anxiety about this issue. As a result, I do not hesitate to repeat what I have said on behalf of the Government on several occasions&#151;that we have not approved, and will not approve, a policy of facilitating the transfer of individuals through United Kingdom airspace or territory, including overseas territories, where there are substantial grounds for believing that those individuals would face a real risk of torture. I know that all Members of your Lordships&#146; House are of one mind on this point, but it is important that we understand how we are currently protected. I heard what the noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, and my noble and learned friend Lord Archer said about the question mark over possible gaps in conventions. The noble Lord, Lord Garden, asked whether the gaps were a perception or a reality and said that we must be sure. I hope that I will be able to explain to your Lordships that the anxiety of the House on this issue is not merited.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="06101838000129"></a>Again, I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Garden, that our position on rendition is clearly understood by our international partners, in particular&#151;I say this for clarity, not emphasis&#151;the United States. Again, I hear what my noble and learned friend Lord Archer says about people being worried about ruffling American feathers. I assure the House that I have never suffered from such a disability; it is not one that has afflicted me, as I think my visit to the United States to discuss our concerns over extradition has perhaps demonstrated to our American colleagues&#151;with some success, if I may humbly suggest to the House. We are not resistant to making that clear. Our international partners have clearly understood the message about where we stand, and it is right that I make that clear.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="06101838000130"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, asks how this has been demonstrated, whether we have had a review, and what our position has been. Again, I draw the attention of the House to the Written Ministerial Statement made by the then Foreign Secretary on 20 January, which set out the results of the extensive review of official records going back to May 1997. That review identified four cases where the United States requested permission to render one or more detainees through the United Kingdom or overseas territories. That is what it promised to do,  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_782"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 782</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and what it appears it did do on those occasions. Records show that the Government refused permission in two cases, but granted it in the other two. In the two cases where the request was granted, the individuals were transferred to stand trialfor terrorism charges in the United States and subsequently convicted. That is the context in which we must examine the proposals in the amendment in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, the noble Lord, Lord Garden, my noble and learned friend and others.</p>

<a name="61018-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="06101838000131"></a>On the first point arising from the amendment, if we could create a mechanism to render unlawful rendition impossible we would do so. However, as this amendment does not create any powers that we do not already have in practice, perhaps I may respectfully suggest that it would have no effect whatever on the likelihood of unlawful rendition taking place. As my noble and learned friend Lord Archer said, there has been a divergence in views. I should therefore like, with your Lordships&#146; permission and to make it plain for others who may read this debate, to take a little time to explain why.</p>

I take the point that when permission was sought, it was granted in one case and refused in two. But we have since been told that you do not have to ask for permission. In the arrangements that apply to this rendition and to the arms affair, you do not have to ask for permission. If that is the position, where do we go from there? Is not the only way to qualify those arrangements, consult and investigate? I ask only for clarification.</p>

We would say that in each case a request should be made. Aircraft used in military, Customs and police services are deemed to be state aircraft. They are not covered by the Chicago Convention but by customary international law whose principles are, I accept, less clear. State aircraft need authorisation to fly over the territory of another state. US military flights, along with military flights of a number of other countries, have for decades been given advance diplomatic clearance in accordance with bilateral arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="06101838000135"></a>I cite the United States for the purposes of this debate but we expect anyone crossing our airspace in the way that the noble Lord has indicated to seek permission to render detainees via United Kingdom territory and airspace, including overseas territories. We will grant permission only if we are satisfied that the rendition would accord with UK law and our international obligations. The next point is how we understand our obligations under the UN Convention Against Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="61018-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="06101838000136"></a>The Government have been very clear that the United States would not render a detainee through United Kingdom territory or airspace without our permission. We have not reached this conclusion

That is why, when my right honourable friend the then Home Secretary made his Statement, he affirmed that we had reviewed the records going back to May 1997 and had found four cases, in two of which we had given permission and two of which we had denied it. It is for that reason that I gave the information to the House earlier.</p>

<a name="61018-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="06101838000137"></a>The second point is whether there is a gap. Is the perception of my noble and learned friend Lord Archer real? We would say that it is not. Section 8 of PACE allows a justice of the peace to issue a search warrant authorising a constable to enter and search premises if there are reasonable grounds for believing that an indictable offence has been committed and that there is material on the premises likely to assist in the investigation of the offence. In the case of unlawful rendition, if the person is being held unlawfully in the aircraft, the common law offence of false imprisonment is likely to have been committed and would provide a basis for intervention under Section 8. So I do not accept that kidnapping would not be covered in the way that the noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, fears; we believe that it would. This provision would be effective in any suspected example of unlawful rendition when credible intelligence suggests that an offence has been committed. Clearly, if the intelligence is not credible, no action would be taken.</p>

Does not Section 8 also require that there has to be reason for believing that there is material on the premises that would assist in the investigation? I think my noble friend said that a few moments ago. While there may be a logbook or something like it in the aircraft, is she satisfied that in every situation where there is a suspicion of this kind, the logbook could be said to be material which would assist in the investigation?</p>

<p><a name="st_77"></a>

Section 8 of PACE allows a constable to enter and search if there are reasonable grounds for believing that an indictable offence has been committed and there is material on the premises that is likely to assist in the investigation of the offence. If someone was being rendered unlawfully across our airspace and being unlawfully imprisoned, we believe that they would fall within Section 8. That is our view of where the law currently is. So it is covered.</p>

<a name="06101838000140"></a><b><a name="61018-0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="06101838000679"></a>Baroness D'Souza:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Section 8 of PACE refers to search by warrant, but the amendment we have put forward refers specifically to those instances where it is not practicable to secure a warrant.</p>

However, it should always be practicable to secure one because there is a

One gets the warrant; the piece of paper may come later, but the warrant should always be immediately available. I respectfully suggest that that is not something which need be an impediment. How these things work in practice is always fairly opaque, and I am happy to clarify the position for the noble Baroness. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, who I see is in her place, has probably granted many such applications when sitting as a magistrate.</p>

<a name="61018-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="06101838000142"></a>Section 17 of PACE is also relevant because it provides that a constable may enter any premises for the purposes of arresting a person for an indictable offence. This provision would be relevant in any case involving an ongoing offence such as, for example, false imprisonment. Again, as with Section 8, there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the person being sought is on the premises. For the purposes of these provisions, an aircraft would be a premises. That is a somewhat interesting legal construction, but it is where we are. This means that if there was credible intelligence that a person was on an aircraft and was being unlawfully rendered to places where there were substantial grounds to believe that they would face a real risk of torture, there would be a legal basis to intervene under Section 17 as well Section 8 of PACE. Section 23 of PACE confirms that the references to &#147;any premises&#148; in Sections 8 and 17 do include an aircraft.</p>

<a name="61018-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="06101838000143"></a>Noble Lords have already referred to the convention. This of course is paragraph (c) ofArticle 3 of the Chicago Convention which permits state aircraft to overfly territory of other states only with permission and on the terms of the state whose territory is to be used. Any flight of whatever nature not taking place on these terms would be contrary to the convention and could, at least in theory, be required to land and be searched under the powers I have mentioned.</p>

<a name="61018-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="06101838000144"></a>I hope that I have been able to satisfy your Lordships that there is no legal gap in police powers to investigate suspected acts of unlawful rendition. But of course the real question may be practical rather than legal, as I tried to explain on 4 July when the Bill was being examined in Committee. That is at col. 217 of the <I>Official Report</I>. I shall not repeat the points I made then. With your Lordships&#146; indulgence, suffice it to say that if the security and law enforcement agencies ever received intelligence that could give rise to the types of action envisaged in the amendment, and on a timescale which would permit such an action, they would already be able to undertake it. But the chances of that happening are negligible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="06101838000145"></a>I am conscious that we have spent a great deal of time discussing this issue. However, I felt that I needed to give my noble and learned friend Lord Archer a specific answer on the Al-Rawi and El-Banna question. First, I am pleased to note that the Court of Appeal has confirmed the propriety of the Government&#146;s actions with regard to their decision. Secondly, as regards the point raised by my noble and learned friend, I can confirm that the UK did not request the detention of Mr Al-Rawi or

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="06101838000146"></a>I am conscious that this issue has caused concern and I am grateful for this opportunity to better explain our position and why we think the anxieties expressed by the House&#151;although we understand them&#151;are not founded in fact. I therefore hope the noble Baroness will feel content to withdraw her amendment.</p>

She argues very persuasively that the law is adequate. However, I feel that there is still room for specific legislation in this field&#151;to deal not only with the reality but also, as has been said, with the perception that it occurs.</p>

<a name="61018-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="06101838000148"></a>The amendment goes one step further in that it deals with people and individuals. It also, in a very important way, imposes a duty to inspect aircraft which are in any way suspected of being implicated in extraordinary rendition. The issue has been raised that there is a lack of transparency in agreements about the landing and refuelling of foreign aircraft and I think it is important that we should have such a duty. In view of that, I would like to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="06101838000154"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am introducing these amendments in response to those tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, on Report last week. I gave a commitment and promised that I would introduce these amendments. It gives me great pleasure to&#151;I hope&#151;make the noble Lord a much happier person.</p>

<a name="61018-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="06101838000155"></a>The noble Lord understandably expressed concerns about how the arrangements for scrutiny of crime and disorder matters provided for in what is now Clause 19 would operate in the City of London. I recognise that the City is far from being a typical local authority. It has distinctive governance arrangements, and it is our ambition to work with the grain of those arrangements and try to secure a sensible and appropriate method for scrutiny for the City in terms of crime and disorder issues. Accordingly, these amendments, together with the subsequent regulations and guidance, will enable the City to use its existing committee structure rather than force it to set up a specially tailored crime and disorder committee, which we accept would be somewhat disproportionate. The Common Council will subsequently be able to act as both the local authority and the crime and disorder committee.</p>

<a name="61018-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="06101838000156"></a>I hope that these amendments meet with the approval of the noble Lord, Lord Brooke. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="61018-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="06101838000158"></a>At the level of generality, the Minister, as he sought, has made me a happier man. I am sure he will not mind my asking about one point. The amendments do not quite follow the form of those I tabled on Report. I make no complaint about that, but there is a practical aspect on which I would be grateful for clarification. Paragraph 11(1) of Schedule 8 will enable the functions of the crime and disorder committee to be performed by the Common Council itself. That will no doubt happen where the crime and disorder matter under consideration is of particular importance. In those circumstances, Clause 19(1)(b) of the Bill will give the Common Council the power to make reports and recommendations &#147;to the local authority&#148;. By Clause 19(11) that means, in the case of the City, the Common Council. In other words, it provides a power for the Common Council to report to itself.</p>

<a name="61018-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="06101838000159"></a>I understand the need to include a reference tothe making of reports and recommendations by the Common Council in the Bill, because it links into the requirement on the City&#146;s other crime and disorder partners to respond to such reports and recommendations when copies are issued to them under Clause 19(8). However, I am struggling with the notion that, in the circumstances I have described, the Common Council should be a subject of statutory power to inform itself about its own deliberations. It would seem more apt if the requirement were on the City&#146;s other crime and disorder partners to respond to reports or recommendations made by the Common Council, and not made to the Common Council.</p>

<a name="61018-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="06101838000160"></a>I realise that Parliament reports to itself on the Report stage of a Bill, and that paradigm makes the amendment a form of compliment to the Common Council. The analogy is less than perfect, however, because a Parliamentary Report stage is fluid and subject to further consideration and amendment, whereas a report of the Common Council&#146;s conclusions on a crime and disorder matter will be a final document. Reporting it back again will produce an additional step, which in practical terms will be otiose. I realise this observation may seem churlish, after the Government&#146;s response to my amendments on Report in resolving at a technical level the crux I posed, but I simply make it because the method used has this mild Alice in Wonderland aspect.</p>

<a name="61018-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="06101838000161"></a>If I can offer an olive branch in expiation of any churlishness on my part, I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that the intended mechanism is indeed that Common Council should make reports and recommendations to itself in order to trigger a response requirement from its crime and disorder partners. Subject to that point of clarification, I again thank the Minister for the positive response to my amendments.</p>

<a name="61018-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="06101838000163"></a>One has to look at this matter in a practical light. The aim of the amendments is to enable the Common Council to delegate issues to its existing committee structure which will then issue reports and recommendations. It would be possible for the Common Council, in its capacity as a crime and disorder committee, to issue such reports and recommendations itself, but we do not foresee this creating any difficulties in practice. Indeed, the noble Lord anticipated how that might work and drew a parallel with parliamentary procedure. The House of Lords resolves itself into a Committee and that Committee reports back to the House of Lords in its guise as the Chamber which considers statutory matters. While it might seem somewhat odd to work in that way, there is a parallel on which we can draw. In practice, I guess that the Common Council will want to devolve these matters to a committee and ensure that it receives that committee&#146;s reports to enable it to consider and finalise its own strategy. That arrangement works well in other local authorities. I hope that I have assured the noble Lord that the provision is workable and that the Common Council welcomes the amendment and is more than capable of dealing with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="06101838000169"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I rise to move Amendment No. 6 and speak to Amendments Nos. 7 to 11, which are grouped with it. These amendments were tabled on Report, but were not moved. The amendments would retain the proposal that a local authority should be able to enter into parenting contracts or to apply for parenting orders. It would, however, remove the proposal to give these powers to registered social landlords. As we said in Committee, the latter suggestion was opposed in the strongest terms by all agencies working with children and families as it was perceived as being a highly inappropriate role for the RSLs to play&#151;and we agree with them.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="06101838000170"></a>Families who are really struggling to manage or control their children&#151;something many of us here may have experienced from time to time&#151;need highly skilled, sensitive and professional help, particularly when a parenting contract is being considered and even more so when a parenting order may be  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_790"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 790</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>necessary. Parents can easily feel resentful, inadequate and defensive while being desperate for things to change and careful work must be done with both parents and children. Imposing restrictions on the one hand and working constructively with both parents and children on the other and knowing what resources and support are available requires particular skill and knowledge which is simply not part of a landlord&#146;s role or training&#151;and nor should it be.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="06101838000171"></a>However, as I mentioned in Committee, there is a lot to be said for RSLs having a working partnership with local authorities, and housing officers could appropriately be involved in an application for an order when this is done with other agencies who would be the professionals able to work directly with families and an order. This kind of inter-agency working is the right model to be developing, using different knowledge and expertise to solve problems which are invariably extremely complex and difficult to manage. The National Housing Federation recognises that it would not be appropriate for it to become the responsible officer to give effect to a parenting order. We wholeheartedly agree with this view and hope that the Government will too. I beg to move.</p>

I think she will accept that she and I have no disagreement on any of those issues. It is a consummation devoutly to be wished and one on which we all work. The amendments would drive a significant hole through our policy of allowing more agencies to enter into parenting contracts and apply for parenting orders, as set out in the respect action plan. I know that in one sense that is precisely what the noble Baroness would like.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="06101838000173"></a>Clauses 23 and 24 enable not only a local authority but a registered social landlord to enter into a parenting contract or seek a parenting order in respect of a parent of a child or young person if they have reason to believe that the child or young person has engaged or, in the case of contracts, is likely to engage in anti-social behaviour. The noble Baroness will know that on a number of occasions social landlords are prevailed on by neighbours and others to remove families because of the disturbance and chagrin that they cause to their neighbours. Such evictions can lead to desperate consequences for the children housed in such homes, such as movement from school, disjunction of family relationships and instability. We know that frequent changes of home, when done erratically, can materially undermine the well-being and health of the child, so to minimise such changes is crucial.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="06101838000174"></a>Currently, 52 per cent of social housing is owned by registered social landlords, and they therefore play an important and growing role in managing housing and wider neighbourhoods, including tackling anti-social behaviour. I am sure the noble Baroness would  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_791"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 791</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>accept with me that it would be better to have an intervention that would perhaps prevent, or at the very least delay, an eviction if behaviour of an anti-social nature could be contained to enable the family to remain <I>in situ</I>. As set out in the respect action plan, the Government are determined to increase the levels of parenting support available to all parents and to ensure that those who are unlikely to seek help voluntarily receive help through formal contracts and court orders.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="06101838000175"></a>I remind the House that parenting contracts and parenting orders are early interventions, which are supposed to nip problems in the bud. I respectfully suggest to the noble Baroness that preventing registered social landlords entering into parenting contracts or seeking parenting orders, as these amendments would do, makes no sense when they already have much more coercive powers at their disposal.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="06101838000176"></a>Registered social landlords can seek the eviction of a family without any further ado if they are satisfied about the anti-social behaviour and they can already enter into an acceptable behaviour contract with a family. They can also seek anti-social behaviour orders and injunctions against their tenants and others in the community. It is surely illogical to prevent them entering into arrangements that may help to remove the need for stronger sanctions against these families.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="06101838000177"></a>If action is not taken, there is a significant risk of families losing their homes or being taken to court. We want to remove one level of intervention and help social landlords think more creatively about other solutions that may be available to them before they reach for eviction or for more coercive sanctions. That would be a better way of protecting children than proceeding more quickly to eviction, if there is a sensible, viable and workable alternative.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="06101838000178"></a>We have made it clear that registered social landlords must be able to work in partnership with specialist agencies. These clauses allow for an official of a registered social landlord to be eligible to undertake the role of responsible officer. But the registered social landlord may well want to nominate another person from a specialist agency who is better placed and has the requisite specialist skills in areas of parenting support, and the Bill will enable the registered social landlord to do that.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="06101838000179"></a>It is important to be clear that parenting contracts and orders are not designed to criminalise parents but are instead concerned with providing support to parents to enable them to guide and protect their children more effectively. It is crucial to stress that, in addition to any constraints imposed by the guidance, parenting contracts must be agreed by the parents and parenting orders are subject to approval by the courts. These are vital safeguards in preventing an overbearing approach.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="06101838000180"></a>I know that the noble Baroness agrees with me in commending the good practice that is starting to take place in CDRP areas of multi-agency working, shared good practice and appropriate specialist support. We would expect that in many areas there  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_792"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 792</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be a multi-disciplinary approach with the appropriate agency being invited to join in partnership to deliver appropriate intervention.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="06101838000181"></a>I understand the noble Baroness&#146;s anxiety, but I do not believe that she would rather wish a child to be evicted with the family than provide an opportunity to explore a more creative resolution to what to others may seem an intractable and unpleasant situation. Given that reassurance, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment, so that we can do some joint good work.</p>

Local authorities also have the power to subcontract their anti-social behaviour powers. The second amendment in the group would require bodies to which such powers had been subcontracted to respect human rights standards when exercising these powers.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="06101838000191"></a>These amendments build on old Amendments Nos. 137A and 137B debated during the third day of Committee. In both cases, we have added a new subsection (2). Perhaps I may recall the position. The Human Rights Act 1998 requires public authorities to act in a way that is compatible with the human rights that the Act protects. When local authorities exercise their powers with respect to parenting contracts and orders, they are required to comply with these basic human rights standards, as they are clearly &#147;public authorities&#148; for the purposes of the Human Rights Act. Liberty, among others, believes that if other bodies are to be given these powers, they, too, should be required to comply with the human rights of those affected by parenting contracts and orders.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="06101838000192"></a>However, your Lordships will be aware that the courts' interpretation of Section 6 of the 1998 Act has made it unclear whether private bodies will indeed be covered&#151;thus the need for these amendments to the Bill to spell out that any body exercising the powers in Clause 24 should be treated as a public authority for human rights purposes.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="06101838000193"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights set out the case well, and I hope that your Lordships will bear with me if I quote its comments. In paragraph 1.29 on page 13 of its report, it states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="06101838000303"></a>&#147;The provision in the Bill for contracting out local authority functions of entering into parenting contracts and applying for parenting orders, however, <I>does</I> give some cause for concern on human rights grounds&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06101838000276"></a>It goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="06101838000304"></a>&#147;The continuing uncertainty about the meaning of &#145;public authority&#146; in s. 6(3)(b) of the Human Rights Act 1998, caused by the <I>Leonard Cheshire</I> decision, means that it cannot be predicted whether the person(s) specified by the Secretary of State as a person to whom the local authority&#146;s functions can be contracted out will be treated by the courts as a public authority for the purposes of the HRA&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06101838000277"></a>It continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="06101838000305"></a>&#147;Although the court which must decide whether to make a parenting order must itself act compatibly with Article 8 when deciding whether or not to make the order, it is an additional safeguard for Article 8 rights that the body entitled to apply for such an order is itself a public authority with an obligation to act compatibly with Convention rights when deciding whether or not to apply for such an order&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06101838000278"></a>It finishes conclusively by saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="06101838000306"></a>&#147;In our view it would be desirable if the Bill were to provide explicitly that the person to whom the functions are contracted out is to be treated as a public authority for the purposes of the HRA 1998 in the discharge of those functions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="61018-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="06101838000194"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, did not disagree with the principle underlying these amendments; he only expressed reservations about whether inclusion of the proposed clause in the Bill was the most appropriate means of clarifying this position. He referred to the Johnson v Havering case and a possible change in interpretation by the courts.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_794"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 794</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="61018-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="06101838000195"></a>Liberty, in my view convincingly, questions whether the possibility of a future change in the approach by the judiciary should prevent Parliament from clarifying its intention in the mean time. There is no constitutional reason why Parliament should not clarify the law on a case-by-case basis, pending a judicial decision. Indeed, while it is hoped that the court may change its interpretation, there is no guarantee of that, and our inaction on this issue could lead to a failure to provide protection for the human rights of people affected by the actions of private bodies to which public functions are contracted out.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="06101838000196"></a>In response to the secondary concern raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, that these provisions may cast doubt on previous legislation in which the position is intended to be the same but has not been explicitly stated, we have added the new subsection (2) in each of the two amendments to clarify that that is not the effect. I hope that that will enable clarification of the position in this legislation, while avoiding wider, undesired consequences.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="06101838000197"></a>I hope that, with these drafting improvements, the Minister will seriously consider these amendments, especially as he does not disagree in principle. I beg to move.</p>

They give me an opportunity to ask whether acceptable behaviour contracts will, if possible, always be used before proceeding to antisocial behaviour orders. It is highly desirable that restorative justice principles should be used whenever possible. I suggest that that will have the effect of an aggrieved person ending up being satisfied; if there is no particular aggrieved person, the local community, whose peace and quiet enjoyment has been disrupted, will also receive some satisfaction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="06101838000200"></a>Perhaps I can briefly state where we are. The noble Viscount will know that my right honourable friend the then Home Secretary wrote to the Joint Committee on Human Rights on 23 May, explaining that, in the Government&#146;s view, such a person is a public authority for such purposes. I do not believe that that response was included in the Joint Committee&#146;s 12th report, which was published on22 May, but we have always made it plain that that was our understanding. That was our understanding in relation to the previous legislation and all of us thought that it was plain. If one looks at the expression of intent by the Government, one sees that it is there in the debates. We know that a different view, which has to be considered, has been taken; it was considered in the Johnson v Havering case, and we have to await the outcome. The importance of waiting concerns clarity. If we were to have yet

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="06101838000201"></a>Clause 25 provides for the making of an order by the Secretary of State to enable local authorities to operate with flexibility in making local decisions to ensure that their functions are carried out as effectively as possible. The ability to contract out all or some of their parenting contract and order-seeking functions to other bodies may assist authorities in their management of strategic and operational functions. The new section is modelled closely on similar provisions in Section 1F of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which was inserted by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, under which the Secretary of State may make an order that enables a local authority to contract out its functions of applying for anti-social behaviour orders and similar matters.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="06101838000202"></a>As noble Lords know, the Government are seeking to clarify the general meaning of &#147;public authority&#148;. I have made that plain, as did my noble friend Lord Bassam. A problem has arisen when care services are contracted out by a local authority, as a particularly narrow interpretation of the scope of the Act has been adopted by the courts. As the Joint Committee on Human Rights recommended in its 2004 report on the subject and as the Government agree&#151;I say that a second time so that everyone knows that there is no dispute about where we are&#151;a successful intervention presents the best possibility of our resolving this issue.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="06101838000203"></a>I expect that the functions to which this amendment relates are clearly,</p>
<ul><a name="06101838000340"></a>&#147;functions of a public nature&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="06101838000279"></a>under the Human Rights Act 1998. Therefore, the person to whom such functions have been delegated would be treated as a public authority for the purposes of the Act in discharging those functions. That is the Government&#146;s clear intention. I say that just in case there is any future misunderstanding of how we intend it to be used. I absolutely understand why the noble Lord may consider that confirming that intention in the Bill would be wise. However, to do so could considerably confuse the legislative scheme, given the broad reach of the Human Rights Act, which does not list the functions to which it applies, specifying only that a public authority has,</p>
<ul><a name="06101838000341"></a>&#147;functions of a public nature&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06101838000280"></a>That gives it the broadest possible reach.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="06101838000204"></a>The effect of the amendment would be to start a list, albeit not in the Act. That would create two problems. First, it would cast doubt over other functions for which legislation does not similarly provide that they are public functions. To try to insert such references retrospectively, as the noble Viscount&#146;s other amendment would do for anti-social behaviour orders, is not the answer. I respectfully tell the noble Lord that there would simply be too many references.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_796"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 796</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="61018-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="06101838000205"></a>Secondly, for any future function created in legislation, such a reference would need to be included,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="06101838000307"></a>&#147;For the avoidance of doubt&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06101838000281"></a>Thus we would create a distributed list, with all the attendant difficulties that lists in legislation create&#151;not least that it would defeat the way in which the Human Rights Act has been drafted, to be of general application. If the meaning of &#147;public authority&#148; in Section 6 of the Human Rights Act ultimately needs legislative clarification&#151;for instance, if the Government&#146;s interventions in cases do not succeed&#151;this must be done in a considered and co-ordinated manner. Therefore, although I understand the intention behind this amendment, I hope that I have made the Government&#146;s interpretation very clear.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="06101838000206"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, has quite rightly jumped on the passing bus to make some good points. The ABCs&#151;anti-social behaviour contracts&#151;are a good tool. In accordance with good practice, many practitioners will seek to engage individuals in a contract before going to anti-social behaviour orders. The risk is in the nature of the anti-social behaviour when the matter first comes up. On many occasions, if the behaviour is serious, there may be a question of going to prosecution, which might lead to a conviction, or trying an anti-social behaviour order instead. It is difficult to be prescriptive and to say that this should happen in all cases. I certainly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, however, that ABCs are extremely valuable and have played a powerful role. They are often not spoken of, but they are effective.</p>

<a name="61018-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="06101838000207"></a>I also agree with the noble Lord about the benefits that often accrue from restorative justice models, which are being used to some good effect. For instance, they are illustrative of the good work in the Community Justice Centre in Liverpool, which is adopting restorative measures on occasion. I agree with the noble Lord on all those points and I am glad that he has given me another opportunity to say how much there is in what he says.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="06101838000212"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in view of our earlier debate, it is perhaps somewhat perverse of me to move Amendment No. 16. I do so because there are one or two aspects of the matter that I wish to place on the record and about which I wish to hear the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="06101838000213"></a>The amendment means that the Secretary of State would not have the power to provide by order that local authorities may subcontract to specific types of body their powers to enter into parenting contracts or to apply for parenting orders; the powers would be retained by the local authority. As we have already discussed, the scope of the legal power to apply for a parenting order or to enter into a parenting contract gives enormous discretion to those who exercise it and requires skill, knowledge, expertise and objectivity. Tenant-run management organisations, which are one of the bodies proposed, would, by definition, be very close to the issue, and that would run the risk of inappropriate applications being made.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="06101838000214"></a>The Government&#146;s view is that the process would be more efficient if local authorities could relinquish responsibility for applying for parenting orders or for entering into contracts, but that argument is not good enough when the issue is serious. The Minister assured the House that there will be conditions in the parenting order to protect families and ensure good practice, but since no draft parenting order has been presented for scrutiny we do not know whether the conditions specified in it would give us any comfort. Furthermore, any order would be subject to the negative resolution procedure. It is worrying that this House is expected to use its time to scrutinise legislation without being in a position to do so. There are risks here that need not and should not be run. However, I agree with the Minister that agencies can and should work together and I look forward to her reply. I beg to move.</p>

Clause 25 is significant because local authorities must have the flexibility to make appropriate local decisions to ensure that their functions are carried out as effectively as possible, not least those of tackling anti-social behaviour by young people and providing effective support to parents. We have touched on our agreement on multi-agency working. The ability to contract out all or some of their parenting contract and order-seeking powers to other bodies, organisations or agencies may assist authorities in their management of strategic and operational functions.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="06101838000216"></a>Clause 25 inserts a new Section 28A into the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 to make it possible for the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to make an order enabling a local authority to contract out to a specified person the functions of entering into parenting contracts and applying for parenting orders. There may sometimes be a separate specialist agency to which it would be wholly appropriate to contract out, and I know that the  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_798"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 798</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Baroness would endorse such specialist intervention and approval. Subsection (2) of the new section makes it clear that the order may provide that the local authority&#146;s power to contract out is subject to conditions specified in the order and to any other conditions that the local authority considers appropriate.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="06101838000217"></a>Local authorities will have discretion on whether to contract out parenting contract and order functions to those bodies specified in the order and will retain the power to discharge that function in their own right whether or not they have contracted out that function. So we have given them the ability to say, &#147;No, we do not want to do this; we want to do it ourselves, and this is how we are going to do it internally&#148;. Moreover, local authorities, and the persons to whom they contract out, will be required to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales, as appropriate.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="06101838000218"></a>Given the safeguards, we believe that Clause 25 is a perfectly proper provision to include in the Bill and would enable better delivery of what the noble Baroness would like to happen, particularly for multi-agency working and the use of specialists who may be more appropriate to discharge certain functions.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="06101838000219"></a>The noble Baroness raised the issue of tenant management organisations. There are built-in safeguards in the right to manage process, by which a tenant management organisation takes over management responsibilities from a local housing authority. These safeguards ensure that the tenant management organisation is an accountable and properly constituted body that is competent to undertake housing management functions and has the support of the majority of affected tenants. It is important to bear in mind that many tenant management organisations are made up not of a group of &#147;Don&#146;t have a clue&#148; type of tenants but of the more active, more engaged and energetic type of tenants who all live in the same block of flats, and in most cases, the tenant management organisation is run by professional housing managers, support staff and blue-collar workers. I am sure that the noble Baroness knows of other instances in which very effective and committed local people have managed these circumstances much better because they have had a very direct purchase on the outcome.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="06101838000220"></a>I hope that I have reassured the noble Baroness and put on record how we believe that this provision could be used most effectively. With that assurance, I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="06101838000225"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I rise to speak to the whole series of amendments regarding how we will deliver inspection. I hope I have made plain on behalf of the Government throughout these debates that our starting point has always been that the best way to provide a modern, joined-up inspection regime for the criminal justice system is to have one single inspectorate rather than several. We remain convinced that a unified inspection regime would support frontline staff by minimising the additional work that inspection involves and provide an enhanced capacity to challenge whether the system is in practice giving the public the best possible service by looking more effectively at the system as a whole.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="06101838000226"></a>The Government remain committed to a simplified inspection landscape across the public sector as a whole. But at the same time we recognise the concerns expressed by the House about how that regime is and should be delivered. It is perhaps only appropriate that I say that I was disappointed and perhaps a little surprised by some of the comments made when we debated the matter on Report. There was almost an unsaid implication that the Government were creating a justice, community, safety and custody inspectorate precisely with the intention of diminishing the strong voice of the prisons inspectorate.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="06101838000227"></a>We have made clear all along that that was not our purpose. If anything, we wanted to enhance the voice of the inspectorate to give even greater power, acuity and effectiveness so that we could deliver not just that which we currently do but much more. It is perhaps right if I put on record that Anne Owers, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, has made absolutely clear to me that she has never ascribed such a motive to the Government's proposal. It is perhaps as well that I say that for the purposes of the record.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_802"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 802</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="61018-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="06101838000228"></a>We have therefore looked very carefully at how we can deliver that which all sides wanted but in a way that might be more acceptable. We always made clear that we wanted any new arrangement to combine the existing strengths, which I have just described, and the expertise of the five inspectorates with the benefits of a more joined-up approach, but felt we could not guarantee the delivery of those benefits without statutory provisions.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="06101838000229"></a>However, discussions have taken place during the past few days between Ministers and the five existing chief inspectors and we have been impressed by the chief inspectors&#146; determination to work towards the benefits of joined-up working. As part of those discussions, chief inspectors have entered into four commitments.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="06101838000230"></a>First, they have reaffirmed their commitment to the streamlined and modernised inspection programme as set out in the policy statement of November 2005, and to the Government&#146;s 10 principles of public service inspection.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="06101838000231"></a>Secondly, they have agreed to develop a joint business planning process to provide a framework for joint inspection work to be developed from priorities indicated by the three Ministers. They will produce the first joint plan for 2007-08. Early priorities will include an enhanced thematic programme and clarity about how the inspectorates intend to work towards mainstream inspection of end-to-end processes across agency boundaries. An important early step will be the creation of a common secretariat drawn from existing staff to support that work.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="06101838000232"></a>Thirdly, they have agreed to review the use of resources and back-office support to identify any efficiency gains which can be redeployed to joint working. Finally, they have agreed to report quarterly to Ministers on the progress of those arrangements.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="06101838000233"></a>These proposals have convinced the Government that we can achieve our objectives for the criminal justice system more quickly and effectively by focusing our efforts on strengthening and improving joint working across the inspectorates, rather than on proposals for organisational merger at this time. That is underpinned by the clear commitments of each of the chief inspectors to deliver real improvements in joint working, as I have just outlined.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="06101838000234"></a>We therefore now propose to withdraw the bulk of Part 4. In its place, we will apply to each of the existing inspectorates the provisions in Part 4 for delegation of functions, inspection programmes and frameworks, gatekeeping in respect of inspections by other inspectorates, co-operation, joint action and assistance for other public authorities. That will provide the statutory underpinning for the more efficient and effective joint working to which we know that the inspectorates are committed.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="06101838000235"></a>I wish to make clear that the amendments do not change the existing remits of the respective inspectors; the additional responsibilities originally provided for in the Bill do not obtain. They are simply intended to provide ways in which they can exercise their current functions more co-operatively and flexibly. I do not think that there can be any doubt that that is a desirable aim. Indeed, that view has been

<a name="time_12"></a>
<a name="61018-0006.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="06101838000354"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="06101838000236"></a>To ensure that this is made clear, we have acknowledged the concern that has been expressed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights about the ability of Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Prisons to continue to make unannounced inspections by providing expressly that the requirement to produce inspections programmes and frameworks does not prevent unannounced visits, either by Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Prisons or any of the other inspectors. That is the new provision, which explains matters more clearly.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="06101838000237"></a>We will keep these changes under review and expect to see early progress; for example, in joint business planning. As part of this, we will be looking further at the merger proposals and intend to keep under active review the option of re-introducing legislation. To that end, we will press ahead with work already begun in order to achieve our policy aspiration of a more joined-up inspection regime for the justice system by April 2008.</p>

<a name="61018-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="06101838000238"></a>Some minor technical adjustments may have to be made, given that we now have five separate inspectors, but the substance of all the amendments will remain unchanged. I hope that the amendments will enable the House to feel, first, that the Government have stayed true to the principle of independent and rigorous inspections, and, secondly, that we have been able to deliver the joined-up additional strengthening that we sought and in a way that enables the House to feel content that the nature of the inspection is better assured. I beg to move.</p>

May I say how grateful I am, as I am sure many other Members of this House are, for what she has said and for the depth that the Government have clearly gone into with the inspectors, who are the people most concerned about what she has just described? Before our debates in this House, the inspectors were feeling somewhat separated from the process, which is thoroughly unfortunate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="06101838000240"></a>Throughout this process, the Minister has mentioned her keenness for joint inspections. That has been very much at the heart of the work of the inspectors for a very long time, as I know myself. In 1999, we recommended having the secretariat that the Minister has just announced, and we asked for regular meetings with Ministers, neither of which were given. I am therefore particularly pleased that, in the statement released yesterday by the Home Secretary, he told all five inspectors that the Government will want to meet them regularly to ensure that satisfactory progress is being made and to provide them with clear direction about the Government&#146;s priorities across the criminal justice  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_804"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 804</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>system. That will be wholly helpful and positive. The inspectors have been hoping for that for a very long time, and I am delighted that it is there.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="06101838000241"></a>It would be churlish to question a great deal of what has been said, and I do not intend to do so. I welcome what has been done, because the Government have maintained the strength of the inspectorates unencumbered. Indeed, the strength of the inspection of different elements of the criminal justice system is the aggregation of the separate parts, not the merger of them. By being undiminished, they will be able to contribute far more strongly to the process that the Minister so clearly wants and this House so clearly endorses than if they had been weakened by the compromise that is inevitably part of a merger. I obviously accept and understand that the Government will want to keep the process under review and I am sure that the inspectors will want to do that, but I beg the Minister to accept what has been said on a number of occasions in this House. The burden on the people administering the services is not that imposed by the inspectorates, which in the case of the prisons inspectorate is once every five years, but that imposed by the plethora of regulators, auditors and other organisations which impose themselves far more regularly and in a far more demanding way than do the inspectorates. Inspection is a different process from regulation and audit and has a very particular purpose. It is hugely important that this should not be confused in the whole process of looking at the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="06101838000243"></a>The Minister has said many times that it is no part of the Government&#146;s intention to restrict, limit or water down the independence, rigour and vigour necessary to undertake robust and effective inspections but there are one or two elements that I should like to mention concerning the detail. Of course, in the hurry with which this was produced, it has not been refined. I am grateful to the Minister for saying that refinement can follow, particularly when the Bill moves to the other House. For example, I am concerned about one point that has not been made, particularly in respect of prisons inspection. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, made the point that prisons inspection certainly must have an independent head, not someone derived from the Prison Service or Home Office. I am interested that in an answer on a specific question on this, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said that when the post of chief inspector came up, there would be no bar to people from the Prison Service or Home Office applying. But I shall be interested to see what happens when Anne Owers retires in March 2008 and whether the principle until now of the person not coming fromthe Prison Service or the Home Office is observed in the selection of the new chief inspector.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="06101838000244"></a>I am interested in the proposed new Schedule A1(2)(2), which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="06101838000336"></a>&#147;Before preparing an inspection programme or an inspection framework the Chief Inspector shall consult&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06101838000282"></a>a whole list of people, including some who I never would have thought of consulting over my prison  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_805"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 805</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>programme inspection, such as the Chief Inspectors of Constabulary, of the Crown Prosecution Service, and of Court Administration and the Audit Commission or the Auditor General for Wales. I hope that this is something on which the Minister will consider refinement. The prisons inspector has to prepare the programme for the inspection of prisons and others can come around it. That programme would include consultation and liaison with all the other elements that need to take part. That is what happens now, but I am concerned that the proposal might go too far.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="06101838000245"></a>Under proposed new Schedule A1(2)(3), the content of inspections or the way in which inspections are to be conducted will be subject to ministerial direction, which is contrary to what has been said many times. Ministers have been at pains to protest that they will not specify either the content or the way in which inspections are conducted. I beg the Minister to realise that&#151;I speak with the voice of experience&#151;if you want an inspection conducted, you leave that to the chief inspector and do not try to micromanage it. By all means, say what the programme might be and limit it, but please do not try to micromanage.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="06101838000246"></a>I conclude from all this that the Government are now where the inspectors were in 1999, with dedicated inspectorates committing themselves to relevant joint working and consulting with each other as appropriate without reducing the potency of their single-service focus, which is so important for Ministers if they are going to deliver what is required. I fully accept that additional things have to happen now. For example, I see the inspector of constabulary consulting the inspector of prisons to see at what stage the inspector of prisons might conduct inspections of police cells, and I see the same thing for the courts administration in the inspection of court cells. That is absolutely right, but there is one thing missing which I would beg the Minister to consider&#151;and it is something I have raised many times. I refer to the use of the word &#147;regular&#148;. At present, the inspection of prisons is carried out once every five years. That raises timing and resource implications because the inspector has got to deliver that inspection every five years. It would be helpful to everyone concerned if that regularity could be included at this stage. It is a point that was made by the Joint Committee on Human Rights and it applies as much to places of detention as it does to prisons.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="06101838000247"></a>My reason for raising this is that, unless that is an absolute requirement on the Chief Inspector of Prisons, there is a danger that the requirement to carry out the additional tasks such as the inspection of police cells, court cells and escorts, will eat into the frequency of prison inspection unless extra resources are provided. A balance has to be struck here. The Minister has assured us that resources are going to be maintained at their current level, and that is fine for the current level of operation, but additional operations will need either extra resources or they will have to be conducted at the expense of something else. I am sure that that is not something that the Minister or anyone in the House would resist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="06101838000248"></a>Finally, I am really pleased that, in talking to the chief inspectors, the Government have said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="06101838000337"></a>&#147;We have recognised the serious concerns about aspects of our proposals and agree with you that the focus of our efforts should now be on finding ways to strengthen and improve joint working rather than on proposals for organisational merger&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06101838000283"></a>Each time we debated this issue, the whole House spoke, not just one part of it, and I recognise particularly the courage of Members on the government Benches who spoke and voted as they did the other night. In thanking the Minister, I have to say that I am enormously encouraged by where this Bill has now got to.</p>

<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="06101838000249"></a><b><a name="61018-0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="06101838000698"></a>Baroness Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, as I have tabled amendments in this group I shall speak at this point rather than wait until the end as I would otherwise have done. I support the government amendments, but with the reservations that have been so clearly set out by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. We hope that they might form part of the refinements to which the Minister referred, and we understand that these matters had to be rushed because the Government were pressed for time in producing a different approach to the way the inspectorates are going to run themselves. I am also aware that there are significant rules about what amendments may or may not be part of the process when the Bill reaches another place, but we have shown goodwill over the past 24 hours and I know that we will do our best within the rules to continue to show that goodwill.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="06101838000250"></a>However, it is right that I put on the record a comment about the difficulties that the Opposition and other Members around the House have faced as a result of the nature of the process we have all been going through. We were unable to signal our disquiet on the matters referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, because the 20 pages of government amendments were made available to noble Lords just minutes before the 5 o&#146;clock deadline for tabling Third Reading amendments. We therefore could not see them before the deadline for tabling our amendments expired. Noble Lords will be aware that manuscript amendments are not permitted at Third Reading, and therefore noble Lords were prevented from tabling any amendments to the government amendments today, and that has actually prevented some of the refinements being brought forward today, which could have been a very practical way of progressing. It is clearly not a satisfactory process&#151;I am talking about the process, not the government amendments&#151;and perhaps the Procedure Committee might take note of the problem for future discussion. This could well be an example of where our Third Reading rules are too restrictive rather than not restrictive enough, as some have argued in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="06101838000251"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, was right to set out in detail the three issues on which he has some difficulty within the government amendments, and I support him on all of them. The main point today is that it is clear that the Government have abandoned their plans to create the mega-inspectorate that we  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_807"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 807</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>believe would have threatened the independence and authority of the prisons inspectorate. That is most welcome. It has been a rocky road to this destination but the Government have listened to the arguments put to them in this House at Second Reading, in Committee and on Report. Not one Member of the House spoke in support of the Minister on any of those occasions. Passionate and informed opposition came from around the House, including from the Minister&#146;s own Benches. It came from those who are very loyal to Her Majesty&#146;s Government and for whom it must have been very hard indeed to express their dissent. I suspect that their contribution was very influential.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="06101838000252"></a>I spoke at some length both at Second Reading and in Committee, but I recognised at Report stage, at the end of a long debate, that others had expressed views that covered the whole gamut of the subject so forcefully and persuasively that it was not the time for me to go on at length&#151;so I did not. That meant that I did not speak to the amendments that were in my name at that stage. I said that I would bring them back, and here they are. In fact, they have been tabled by both the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and myself. Again, however, I do not need to speak to them because the Minister, in her wisdom, in her amendments today has adopted the approach that I had hoped for. My amendments are there to probethe wisdom of going ahead with the whole of the organisational structure, and I homed in on the questions about the constabulary&#151;but that all now goes by the board.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="06101838000253"></a>I can therefore be very brief today and add just a couple of points. The result of the Division last week indicated the strength of feeling in the House onthis issue. It showed that this House believes that the Government&#146;s choice of structural change for the prisons inspectorate was simply wrong. The Minister referred in her speech to her feeling that perhaps some questioned the principled stand that the Government were taking and the motives behind it. We were not questioning motives; we were questioning the outcome of what the Government were trying to achieve. I do not know what the Government&#146;s intentions were&#151;that is entirely for them&#151;but the noble Baroness has steadfastly presented them as being to improve the management structures. Whatever the intentions behind the original proposal, there was agreement that it would have damaged the authority and independence of the inspectorate.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="06101838000254"></a>I argued in Committee that there are alternative, preferable options for improving its operation within the criminal justice family without damage to the inspectorate itself. In particular, like the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, I record the work done by the chief inspectors back in 1999 to have a joint secretariat. Like him, I am very pleased that today the Government have accepted that it is right to go down the alternative, more appropriate route of reform, which should focus on strengthening and improving joint working but will not involve organisational merger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="06101838000255"></a>Finally, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, on his eloquent and determined leadership throughout this long process. All the inspectorates will have a stronger future as a result.</p>

The only criticism I had about the Bill was that the issue of inspection did not have adequate time for discussion in the other place. Those of us who often refer to the intention of the other place were rather short in trying to obtain the views of Members of Parliament. There has been a long series of debates on this matter. As far as I can remember, year in, year out, we have discussed this issue ever since the idea of an inspectorate was floated by the Government. There was a very informative debate in which noble Lords participated on Report, whenthe Minister gave a very robust defence of the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="06101838000257"></a>However powerful the case made by the House of Lords, it ultimately remained for the Minister to convince her colleagues about what was appropriate for this House. She has been able to do that, for which I am most grateful. I am glad that there is now a clear statement on the Government&#146;s intentions as well as from the inspectors on how they intend to proceed.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="06101838000258"></a>I put on record the thanks of most, if not all, of my colleagues on these Benches for the work that the Minister has done in convincing her colleagues. Let us hope that we will have future opportunities to iron out issues that reflect what the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has identified to see how we can put them right. My noble friend Lady Harris will comment on some of the amendments, but in the mean time I thank the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="06101838000261"></a>I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 66 to 69 which are, once again, about the Audit Commission. Before I do so, I have a few questions for the Minister which refer to the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, with regard to Schedule 4A(2), looking at the issue from a police authority perspective. It is worth asking the questions to allow the Minister time to get an answer while I am speaking to Amendments Nos. 66 and 69.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_809"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 809</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="61018-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="06101838000262"></a>Does subsection (2)(2) of Amendment No. 17 also mean that HMIC will consult the bodies to be inspected? It was in the latest version of the Bill in Schedule 9(9)(3) on page 110, but it does not appear in this legislation, and I would like an explanation. With regard to subsection (3)(4) of AmendmentNo. 17, can the Minister say how the Secretary of State would envisage using such an order-making power and for what purpose? Does it allow him to mandate joint inspections or just to say who the lead inspectorate will be and then leave it to the discretion of the chief inspector to decide? Specifically, will it allow the Secretary of State to specify that police authorities will be inspected by HMIC?</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="06101838000263"></a>I agree with the points made about the great range of the new amendments. It has been extremely difficult to find the detail in them, and I could not find anywhere a reference to inspection of police authorities. The old wording in the Bill on Report included reference to that. At page 24, Clause 29(3), they are one of the organisations listed as sitting within the criminal justice system, which would have fallen within the remit of the single inspectorate.At page 112, paragraph 12, which one of my amendments addresses, police authorities are listed as one of the bodies&#151;CDRPs being the other&#151;that would have been subject to joint inspection between the CJS inspectorate and the Audit Commission. But the new wording does not include reference to them. Although the wording itself is not new, the context is, which alters the way in which the wording might be read and needs to be examined afresh in light of the Government&#146;s amendments.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="06101838000264"></a>I am sure that if the Minister is unable to answer these questions today, she will be able to do so at a later point, having read carefully what I have said in <I>Hansard</I>. But is she able to tell me how the new amendment will allow for inspection of police authorities?</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="06101838000265"></a>With my Amendments Nos. 64 and 65, I turn to the matter of enabling police authority expertise to be used in inspecting police authorities. It seems that I must continue to disagree with the Minister about whether current wording adequately allows for that. For instance, &#147;sufficient expertise&#148; implies quantity rather than quality, so does not necessarily mean that the chief inspector has access to the right sort of expertise. My amendment tries to address this issue. However, it also explicitly allows for the inclusion of police authority expertise in police authority inspections.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="06101838000266"></a>I have explained before why I think that that is important, so I will not rehearse those arguments again. But I point out that it does not imply a cosy relationship, which the Minister seemed to suggest in our previous debate. I am suggesting that police authority expertise should contribute to police authority inspections, but certainly not be wholly responsible for them. It is certainly no more questionable than the idea that police officers should inspect police forces, which, indeed, they do. I do not

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="06101838000267"></a>In an effort to come up with a compromise that might be more acceptable to the Government, I suggest that the Association of Police Authorities should be consulted by the chief inspector about ensuring that he has appropriate expertise available to him. This is a change to the previous suggestion that the APA should be able to nominate suitable people. It is just slightly different.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="06101838000268"></a>With Amendments Nos. 66 to 69, I have been very busy checking the legislation. For the avoidance of confusion, my previous amendment was about the Audit Commission&#146;s role in best value. Best value appears in Section 24 of the Local Government Act 1999, where it says that HMIC will inspect police authorities for their compliance with best value. The Audit Commission has no role mentioned in that Act whatever.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="06101838000269"></a>Amendments Nos. 66 to 69 address the involvement of the Audit Commission in police authority inspections. Nothing that the Minister has said has convinced me that it has the requisite knowledge or expertise to undertake this role. I know that the Minister is a great fan of its work with local authorities, and I acknowledge, as I have throughout, that it has a wealth of experience in this field, although I do not share the views about its total effectiveness. That aside, local authorities are not the same as police authorities. They have different functions and structures, and it is a mistake to think that techniques and frameworks used in inspecting local authorities can be applied to police authorities; they cannot.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="06101838000270"></a>My second amendment would ensure that the Audit Commission sticks to what it knows about: auditing police authorities, not inspecting them. That is the very point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for which I was very grateful. In addition, however, I was rather taken aback to hear the noble Lord speaking at Second Reading on this section of the Bill. He said the amendment he was then proposing, which is now part of the Bill, gave the Audit Commission a power to act jointly with the chief inspector, where the commissioner had no power to inspect. I am sorry, but if the Audit Commission has no legal remit to inspect, it has no business conducting inspections, joint or otherwise. My amendment seeks to make that plain.</p>

<a name="61018-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="06101838000271"></a>I have also made sure with this amendment that it is the chief inspector, not the Audit Commission, who decides that the involvement of the commission might be helpful, although in practice, because of my other amendments, that will be restricted to inspections of crime and disorder reduction partnerships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="06101851000002"></a>The question of motive was raised. I believe that the Minister sincerely and profoundly believed in what she was putting before the House and in what she was saying and that she sincerely and profoundly believes in what is now being put in substitution.

If one thought of the <I>Times</I> cartoonist Peter Brookes, one might see two cartoons. The first shows what the Home Secretary and the Home Office originally designed for the Bill: complete control from on high, with all the chief inspectors subordinated in the manner against which this House rebelled. The second cartoon, I am afraid, now shows the Home Secretary as a spider&#151;but not the Minister, I am sure, unless she is a smaller spider&#151;who, having been frustrated in the original objectives, has now been determined to tie up the inspectorates in red tape.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="06101851000004"></a>I heard with pleasure the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, say today that it was the Government&#146;s objective to strip away bureaucracy in the Bill. I also heard the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, say that the object was to minimise additional work and that the Government remained committed to a simplified inspection landscape. I have to confess that when I read the amendments that we are discussing and saw the enormous amount of consultation that is supposed to take place&#151;some distinguished commentators doubt that it will&#151;I thought that this is not a simplified landscape at all, but an incredibly bureaucratic one. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what costing the Government have made of the extra bureaucrats who will be needed to carry out all this consultation and response to consultation.</p>

<a name="61018-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="06101851000005"></a>I am concerned that the power of the Home Office to give directions remains very great. I hope that the Government will not seek to put back, through the ping-pong process, any power for the Crown Prosecution Service to become judge and jury in their own cases and to impose penalties and level of penalties. I hope that has gone for good, at least as far as this Bill is concerned. Whether or not that is the case, it is extremely important that the inspectorates should remain independent. I hope that that will be acknowledged.</p>

<a name="61018-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="06101851000006"></a>I wish to make one or two points of detail. If we are to have a framework of consultation, we should bear in mind the fact that the Crown Prosecution Service, the whole prosecuting process and the Attorney-General are not the Government. Prosecutions are not carried out by government; they are carried out by the wholly independent prosecuting authorities. It is the absolute constitutional duty of the Attorney-General to ensure that that is the case and that it is protected. None the less, the Crown Prosecution Service must very properly work extremely closely with the police and the courts. I notice that at present there is no requirement for the Attorney-General, the DPP or anybody in the Crown

That may be deliberate or it may be an oversight. Perhaps it could be thought about and the views of the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General inquired into.</p>

The proposal will ensure the co-ordination that is needed and which I understand the various inspectors have willingly committed themselves to, and yet at the same time will eliminate any danger of important, separate issues being subsumed in a reorganisation of the kind that we discussed last week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="06101851000009"></a>I, too, accept that in some areas we may be talking about perception rather than reality. I certainly accept my noble friend&#146;s assurances that there was no government agenda to weaken the inspectorates, including the prisons inspectorate.

I assure your Lordships that strenuous efforts were made, first, to resolve this issue, secondly, to draft amendments that were most likely to meet the concerns that noble Lords had expressed and, thirdly, to lay those amendments as swiftly as possible. It is to that end that I sought to give notice to the Benches opposite that this was an endeavour that we were embarked on, although I was not absolutely confident about when it might come to fruition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="06101851000014"></a>I will now go through the issues that noble Lords have raised, and I will deal first with consultation. Your Lordships will see that all the consultees in the list are in fact the consultees who are consulted bythe five inspectorates at the moment. The long list is similar to that which was in the Bill earlier. That is why I said that technical adjustments may have to be made. We are in consultation with the five inspectorates, and we will enter into dialogue with them to refine the consultation process in an appropriate way. The direction about the form of the programmes will be about the administrative form and not about the substantive content or the form of the inspection itself.</p>

<a name="61018-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="06101851000015"></a>I think that it was the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, who asked about the possible change in the well established recruitment process. I assure the noble Lord that we have no plans to change the well established recruitment process for the Chief Inspector of Prisons; we hope that similarly robust and vigorous independent-minded people will continue to inspect all our services for the foreseeable future. As I said earlier, if one looked at intent through history, one would see that that is clearly demonstrated. Given the fact that those who are seeking to recruit the new chief inspector came to entice the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, he need not fear that the brief that they were given was to find someone who was compliant. I assure him that there is anticipated to be no change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="06101851000016"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, asked about the Chief Inspector of Constabulary and the requirement regarding police forces and police authorities. I hope that this will please the noble Baroness. We will expect the inspectors to consult police authorities in any event, but we can always make that a mandatory requirement by adding those bodies by order to the list of statutory consultees. As I said, we are in discussion with the inspectors about the consultation requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="06101851000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, questioned the meaning of &#147;regular&#148;. We are not in any way altering by these provisions the existing inspection remits of the five chief inspectors; we are simply adding strengthened and improved joint working. Matters relating to the way in which each inspectorate conducts its own existing programmes would be better addressed in the individual contexts. We are not changing that. It will still be entirely open to each inspector to determine regularity of inspections, but with the added benefit of less duplication through increased joint working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="06101851000018"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, asked about the retention of royal warrants. It flows from what I have just said that all inspectors will retain the royal warrants, as now, and there is no change. I am surprised that the noble Baroness did not immediately appreciate that none of the existing inspectorates will have their remit extended as a result of the government amendments. Accordingly, for now, there will be no provision for the inspection of police authorities or crime and disorder reduction partnerships. We will have to return to that issue at another time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="06101851000019"></a>While I know that the burden of doing so much can be high, I had hoped that my noble friend Lord Bassam had made it clear, in response to Amendment No. 2, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, that, as a result of the changes that we are making in Part 4, the provision for the Audit Commission to act jointly with the inspectorate of constabulary in inspecting police authorities is removed. I know that the noble Baroness was concerned about that and I had thought that we might have heard a whoop of delight when my noble friend said that. She may not have noticed the pleasure that that statement was intended to give her&#151;but I give it to her now.</p>

We thought that that was the better course and I had hoped that this House would have been pleased to have had such an opportunity.

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="06101851000070"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Clause 50 provides for defendants in custody to appear at a preliminary hearing over a live link, and it allows defendants who are in police custody at a police station to appear by live link.</p>

<a name="61018-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="06101851000071"></a>In Committee, and again on Report, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, expressed concern about the possible disadvantage to a defendant in custody of being obliged to appear by live link. She tabled amendments that would require the defendant&#146;s consent before a live link direction could be made.</p>

<a name="61018-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="06101851000072"></a>The Government are content to take account of those concerns by adding such a consent requirement. In this regard, we all have the same purpose, and we think that it could be delivered perfectly efficiently and effectively in this way.</p>

<a name="61018-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="06101851000073"></a>At the same time, the fact that the existing clause would mean that a live link would not be available for a defendant who qualified for police bail is arguably anomalous. It would seem to disadvantage defendants who do not pose enough of a risk to be detained, as they would be unable to make an appearance by live link, even if they were anxious to plead guilty as soon as possible. The Government&#146;s amendments would enable both categories of defendant&#151;those who are detained and those who are bailed&#151;to benefit from the live link facility if they wish to do so.</p>

<a name="61018-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="06101851000074"></a>To meet any concerns about the potential disadvantage of appearing over a live link, we have included an express requirement for the defendant&#146;s

<a name="61018-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="06101851000075"></a>To ensure that the amendments operate in conjunction with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, we have amended that Act to make provision for bailed defendants to appear over a live link. The amendments create within PACE a special class of bail&#151;that is, live link bail.</p>

<a name="61018-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="06101851000076"></a>The amendments also provide for what should happen when a scheduled live link involving a bailed defendant does not take place because, for example, he does not wish to participate or because a live link is not available. In those circumstances, the police will have all the powers, under PACE, that they would have had when the person was arrested so that they may bail the defendant to appear in court in the usual way on another date.</p>

<a name="61018-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="06101851000077"></a>We are conscious of the need to ensure that defendants appearing in this way have access to appropriate legal advice, and discussions are under way to achieve that objective in the proposed pilot.</p>

<a name="61018-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="06101851000078"></a>The Government believe that the amendments will enable the most effective use to be made of live links from police station to court, thereby providing speedier justice, while ensuring that the defendant has the safeguard of an entirely consensual process. I hope that that will satisfy all Members of the House who have expressed an interest in this issue. I beg to move.</p>

I am grateful to the noble Baroness for taking on board so effectively the concerns that I expressed at previous stages relating to consent&#151;that live link directions will be given only when there has been express consent. I think the proposal to extend that provision to those who have been granted bail is a very practical and appropriate one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="06101851000097"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendments Nos. 57 and 58 relate to putting into primary legislation the principle of ensuring political balance on police authorities. Notwithstanding the peace and enjoyment that we have had from the Minister this afternoon&#151;a wonderful array of goodies&#151;and unless she is able to assure me differently in her response, I believe that we may have reached the watermark on this.</p>

<a name="61018-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="06101851000098"></a>At Second Reading, the Minister agreed that this was an important principle, following the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, which highlighted why that was so and what might happen if this principle were not followed. However, the noble Baroness also made it clear that she thought that flexibility was more important and confirmed that this matter would be in secondary rather than primary legislation.</p>

<a name="61018-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="06101851000099"></a>The purpose of my amendment is to ask her to reconsider that position. There is general agreement that key principles need to go into primary legislation, while the detail can be left to secondary legislation. Many of the debates on other parts of the Bill have concerned where that line should be drawn and in some areas drawing a line is not very easy. I do not see how ensuring that councillor representation on police authorities is politically balanced can be considered a mere detail. Surely, it is an underlying principle that permeates the whole concept of accountability. It is the key to the way in which police authorities operate. It has kept them free from party politics as well as from narrow interest groups, as I learnt to my great advantage a number of years ago when I chaired my own police authority. That is not to say that there have not been political debates about policing, but it means that one particular view has not been able to dominate completely to the detriment of others. It means that decisions are, for the most part, reached by consensus, reflecting a full range of views in the area, both political and non-party political. It also means that there is no question of undue partisan influence being brought to bear on the chief officer. That is an important and valuable principle.</p>

<a name="61018-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="06101851000100"></a>I am gratified that the Government agree, but if they agree with that, surely it is important enough to be in primary legislation, as it currently is. I cannot believe that the Government are suggesting that they may need to change this key, underlying principle about the way the authorities are made up. If they do not intend to change this, why do they need the flexibility that will allow them to do so? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="06101851000102"></a>I agree with every word that the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, said about why a balance of elected representatives is a critical part of the governance of police authorities. However, giventhe clear assurance from the Minister on Report that the Government saw this as important, clearly saying that it would be part of regulations, I did not feel it was appropriate to press the amendment again. We have that assurance. Subject to the Minister&#146;s statement that there is no intention to change it, then&#151;unless we are being told that one of the opposition parties plans to dispense with the principle of political balance in the far future&#151;we should surely accept what the Government have made clear.</p>

We have struck the right balance, and I can see no point in drawing ourselves into a lengthy debate this evening on whether primary or secondary legislation is the best way to do so. The important points have been made by my noble friend Lord Harris.</p>

Key principles with a constitutional purpose should not be moved into secondary legislation for administrative convenience alone. It is fundamentally important that policing should remain non-party political, and that police authorities should be properly balanced to reflect and represent the full variety of views in the communities they serve.

But it does mean that there would at least be some sense of ownership by the whole police authority of the appointments of the vice-chair or vice-chairs of the Metropolitan Police Authority, in that they would have had the opportunity to make representations to the Mayor and the Mayor would have had the opportunity to consider them prior to making any decisions on the matter.

However, while one ought to have at least an idea of what are people&#146;s views, if you do not make the appointment that the majority of those people who have expressed their opinion want, should there be recourse to action against you? For example, what if not all members make representations? What if some do but some do not? Some difficult consequences might flow from that, and I wonder whether the noble Lord is wedded to that particular terminology, or whether there is some other terminology that does not have the ramifications of someone taking legal action if they find that they

<a name="06101851000119"></a><b><a name="61018-0011.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="06101851000587"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Harris, has advanced a carefully crafted argument, as he always does on these occasions. Indeed, he has done so so skilfully that he has begun to make me feel rather bad about what I am about to say. If he can take anything away from this discussion, which we have had in two or three stages of the Bill, it is that, I am afraid. I am rather drawn to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, because we often have this strange debate about &#147;shall&#148; meaning &#147;must&#148;. One can get into difficulty if someone &#147;must&#148; have regard to representations made, particularly if there is a challenge.</p>

<a name="61018-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="06101851000120"></a>I shall repeat much of what I said on Report. We are bringing the appointment of the vice-chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority into line with the way in which the vice-chairmen of other Greater London Authority functional bodies, such as Transport for London and the London development agencies, are appointed. As I think has been said in the past, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority appoints its own vice-chairman from among its members.</p>

<a name="61018-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="06101851000121"></a>Our primary reason for enabling the Mayor to appoint the vice-chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority is that the vice-chairman can act as chairman in his absence. It is therefore logical for the chairman and the vice-chairman to be appointed in the same way. I expect, however, that members of the Metropolitan Police Authority will want to make&#151;indeed, are very likely to make&#151;representations about the appointment of vice-chairmen to the Mayor. I have little doubt that any Mayor, and not simply our current incumbent, would be foolish indeed if they did not &#147;have regard to&#148; those representations when making the appointment. I understand the principle of what my noble friend Lord Harris is seeking to achieve, but I do not think that an amendment is required to achieve it. In any event, members of the authority do not need a particular statutory power to make the quality and nature of representations that they have. In part because of the argument that the noble Baroness has begun to advance about the terminology, I think that there may be an unintended or hidden consequence in making such a power.</p>

<a name="61018-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="06101851000122"></a>I assure my noble friend that members will be free to make the representations that they have always been able to make. That is the best way to achieve the outcome that he seeks and, although the logic may have been tortuous in the past, I think that our point is the right one and that the arrangement is best left as it is. For those reasons, I hope that, although he has made his arguments well, he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_836"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 836</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such as this. It was thoughtful, detailed and thorough, looking into all the different issues that might arise. I am grateful for his analogy with the various functional bodies of the governance systems in London. When the Greater London Authority Act passed through this House and the other place, it was noted with considerable interest that every one of the functional bodies under the Mayor had a different governance structure. In four instances, the Mayor appointed the chair. In two of those instances, he also appointed the vice-chair. In one instance, the Mayor did not appoint the chair or the vice-chair and, in the fourth instance, did not appoint the vice-chair. The elected representatives of some functional bodies were expressly forbidden from holding office, and in others only London borough councillors were forbidden. There was no consistency between the functional bodies. If it is an aim of government policy to achieve that, no doubt there will be more signs of it in the forthcoming legislation on local government, although I am not aware that that is part of government policy.</p>

<a name="61018-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="06101851000124"></a>This amendment was put forward to make sure that the Mayor, in making appointments of vice-chairs, listens and thinks about the consequences for the police authority and makes sure that the right balance is achieved in the way that it functions. I was careful in choosing the words,</p>
<ul><a name="06101851000365"></a>&#147;have regard to any representations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06101851000155"></a>I am aware that that is fairly strong phraseology in legal terms. I used those terms because, while the Mayor might not be bound to accept the collective views of the police authority, I want any Mayor to give extremely clear and cogent reasons why he does not accept such representations. Perhaps there is better phraseology to achieve what I want, but it is very sad that we will not have the opportunity in this House to consider the matter. It was put forward for precisely that purpose and in the knowledge that it was a fairly strong statement.</p>

<a name="61018-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="06101851000125"></a>The Minister was kind enough to say that members of the police authority would have the right to make representations and that any sensible Mayor would think about those, which is a statement of the obvious. No one was suggesting that members of the police authority should be forbidden from making representations or that the Mayor would not be allowed to look at them before making any appointment. If my noble friend is suggesting&#151;as I am sure that he is&#151;that in the regulations there will be an encouragement to members of the police authority to make representations to the Mayor and that there will be phraseology to imply that the Mayor should consider them, if not have regard to them, then I am sure that that would be sufficient reason for me not to press this amendment to a vote.</p>

This House has proved the media wrong. It takes its role very seriously in scrutinising government legislation, even those parts of it&#151;and there were some parts like that in the Bill&#151;that we agree with. Today we saw a change in respect of the inspectorate which was most welcome. I recognise there, as I do elsewhere, the work of the noble Baroness throughout. I say that because I know that she has also been handling other significant Bills that have excited far more interest in the media than this. We send the Bill to another place having shown the views of Members here not only on Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Prisons, but also on police force mergers, extradition, the Secretary of State&#146;s directions to chief officers of police and conditional cautions. We give the other place much to think about, but as ever our regret may be that they will not be given much time to consider it.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_840"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 840</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="61018-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="06101855000008"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, my purpose in this debate is to urge the Government to restore family planning and concern about population to a central role in their policy to reduce poverty in Africa. Before I develop the argument, I should acknowledge my debt to a yet unpublished paper by Professor John Cleland and others. He is Professor of Medical Demography at the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and an eminent authority on population and fertility.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="06101855000009"></a>Family planning used to occupy a central role. Until the time of the Cairo conference on population in 1994, it had been extremely successful. In developing countries, between 1960 and 2000 the average number of births per woman fell from six to about three, and the number of women who used contraception rose from fewer than 10 per cent to about 60 per cent. That was a huge achievement. Success was not confined to Asia and Latin America, but was also beginning to happen in sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, it included some of the poorest countries such as Bangladesh and Nepal. What we saw at the time was a substantial increase in international funding. During the period between 1971 and 1985, funding rose from $168 million to $512 million.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="06101855000010"></a>Family planning and concern with population now appear to be out of fashion. Partly this may be due to a reaction against the draconian policies pursued by the Chinese, and earlier by Mrs Indira Gandhi, but more recently family planning has suffered from religious influences in the United States. Anyway, for a number of reasons, some of which I will develop later, between 1995 and 2003 international funding declined from $560 million to $460 million. The millennium development goals set by the United Nations in 2000 ignored the problem of rapid population growth. The Commission for Africa also ignored population growth and the need for family planning. No mention is made of either in the recent White Paper on international development issuedby DfID. The new priorities are HIV/AIDS, international migration, ageing and good governance. I am not arguing that these are unimportant, but I do argue that the decline of interest in family planning is already having adverse results and could be calamitous if it is not reversed.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="06101855000011"></a>Leaving aside for the moment the influence of religious dogma, there is a widespread belief&#151;indeed, it has almost become part of conventional wisdom&#151;that family planning will look after itself if we reduce poverty, because the poor need lots of children as a substitute for social security to support them in old age. Once poverty is reduced, runs the argument, and people are wealthier, they will have fewer children. Further, it is often asserted that family planning cannot be effective in the poorest nations. Neither belief is supported by evidence.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="06101855000012"></a>Many factors affect poverty but it is clear that large families make poverty worse and make it more difficult for the poor to become better off. There is less food to go round; children are less likely to be educated; and large families increase unemployment. Short intervals between births&#151;less than 18 months  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_841"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 841</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is common in the absence of family planning&#151;not only have a devastating effect on mortality rates among children under five but increase the incidence of low birth weight and premature births. They make it impossible for mothers to pursue non-domestic activities. In fact, reducing the birth rate from six&#151;of whom several may die&#151;to two or three is possibly one of the most important steps we can take towards liberating women. Contraception is a vital element in women&#146;s rights.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="06101855000013"></a>It is argued that one of the most important measures for eradicating poverty is improving education. Of course it is. One aim of the millennium development goals is universal primary education for both sexes. But rapid population growth undermines that goal. It means that the number of teachers will have to double every 20 to 25 years; the supply of school equipment and the number of classrooms will have to double, and the cost of all that will be enormous. What will happen is that spending per pupil will fall and the quality of education suffer if population growth continues uncontrolled.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="06101855000014"></a>As to the second misconception that family planning is not effective in poor countries, in fact there is strong evidence of the benefits of reduced fertility and reduced population growth. To cite one recent study of 45 countries, it was estimated that in the 1980s the number of people living in poverty could have been reduced by a third if the birth rate had fallen by five in 1,000&#151;that is, by one-half of1 per cent. Reduced fertility means that after 20 years or so the productive part of the population aged 15 to 65 starts to grow faster than the number of under 15s and over 65s. This could have a dramatic effect on economic growth in the least developed countries.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="06101855000015"></a>I have already mentioned that when family planning was central to development policy it proved effective in very poor countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh. Most governments in the poorest countries have policies in place for birth control, but today they lack the encouragement and funds to make them effective and the funds are now drying up.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="06101855000016"></a>AIDS in Africa is now top of the agenda, but I would suggest that stabilisation of population growth is even more important than reducing AIDS. In Ghana, more women are likely to die from unsafe abortions than from AIDS, and yet funds are being diverted from family planning to the fight against AIDS. Many African countries, despite AIDS, will double or treble in size in the next few decades. In Uganda, where AIDS is a moderately severe epidemic, the population is expected to grow from30 million to over 60 million by 2025 and to some120 million by the middle of this century. There is no official concern about population growth in Uganda and yet its impact on poverty is likely to be immense. Niger is facing a catastrophe, partly as a result of overpopulation. But in Niger there are more meetings about sterility&#151;not an obvious problem&#151;and sex among the elderly than there are about population growth or family planning.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="06101855000017"></a>I should also mention the effect on the environment. Uncontrolled population growth will mean more depletion of soil fertility, more soil

In Africa, the ratio of the number of people in farming to the amount of available arable land is rising steeply and will get far worse in the next few decades as a result of population pressure. There will also be an ever-increasing demand for an ever-decreasing amount of water.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="06101855000018"></a>Africa is the continent most likely to suffer most grievously from global warming, yet adaptation to the effects of climate change will become even more difficult with population growth.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="06101855000019"></a>Why has concern about population dropped out of fashion? One important reason is religious dogma. There is an unholy alliance between the Bush Administration, which opposes contraception, the Pope and the Catholic Church, which preaches that contraception is a sin, and Islam. This alliance hits the developing world with a double whammy: it prevents UN organisations distributing condoms in Africa, thereby condemning hundreds of thousands of Africans to death from AIDS. Even more seriously, it has cut back funding for family planning by international organisation.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="06101855000020"></a>Only Europe can give a lead. Within Europe, the UK could play a major part, but only if we face reality and recognise the problem. I hope to hear from the Minister that the Government recognise that what is needed is old-fashioned family planning to stabilise population growth. Apart, perhaps, from climate change, there is no bigger issue we face today than world poverty. There can be few more important moral issues and few, if any, that have such grave social and economic consequences for us all.</p>

In fact, some of us consider that population growth is of equal importance to the very topical question of climate change. If, like most of the scientific community, we consider that the rapidly increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and global warming are largely due to human activity, the two are inextricably linked.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="06101855000023"></a>If you look at the fertility map of the world, with high-fertility countries coloured dark red, shading down to off-white for low-fertility countries, it is striking how clearly Africa stands out, with nearly every sub-Saharan country at or near the deepest shade, corresponding to a fertility rate of over four children per woman, with several over six, compared with the world average of only 2.7. Niger, Mali and Uganda are at the top of the league, with 7.4, 7.1 and 7.1 respectively. The exceptions&#151;winners, if you like&#151;are Ghana, South Africa and its neighbouring countries, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana, all with rates under four. All are countries with a rising or reasonably high girls&#146; literacy rate and, except Ghana, a per capita income above the sub-Saharan average.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="06101855000024"></a>Although we are mainly considering Africa, it is worth looking at other countries which have not experienced the fall in fertility that has occurred in most countries in the past few decades. Afghanistan and Iraq stand out in western Asia, as does Pakistan and Laos further east, with Haiti and Guatemala in the western hemisphere. All except Iraq are very poor countries and most have experienced war or internal conflict. The birth rate frequently goes up during or after conflict involving loss of life or civil disruption. You could say that this is a kind of natural demographic insurance policy. But conflict makes it difficult to carry out any public health measures, which may include reproductive health provision and may in itself contribute to the high post-conflict fertility rate.</p>

<a name="61018-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="06101855000025"></a>In Africa, conflict and internal disruption have affected around 20 countries with a combined population of more than 250 million&#151;about one-third of the total sub-Saharan population&#151;in the past couple of decades. Apart from Darfur and the uneasy situation in Zimbabwe, there seems to be a period of relative calm, although there are rumbling storm clouds on the horizon. Some might say that conflict resolution and the encouragement of good governance&#151;always part of government policy&#151;should be a first step and have higher priority than programmes to assist with public health, including family planning. Many noble Lords might disagree with that, however, and urge that development assistance, including health&#151;especially reproductive health&#151;is in itself part of the process of building societies that are less likely to tolerate conflict and lawlessness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="06101855000026"></a>I hope very much that my noble friend will giveus some encouraging information on what the Government, through DfID, are doing to assist sub-Saharan countries with reproductive health measures. I look forward to hearing the Minister on that subject.

I hope that will result in an answer to some of the pleas of the noble

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="06101855000028"></a>I shall end by talking about the unmet need for modern contraceptives in the developing world,which is now estimated by UNFPA to run at about 137 million women, with an additional 64 million women using ineffective traditional methods. It is a paradox that, as contraceptive use rises, so does the unmet need among the rest of the population, until it reaches quite a high level. These women appreciate the benefits that contraceptive users in their communities gain only after they have seen it in operation. These gains include more time to engage in income-generating activities; ability to devote more time to each child; and more money to go round generally. It is then that the desired family size comes down. The provision of mother-and-child health services with better chances of child survival, together with the education of girls, helps to lower the size of families that communities feel is the ideal.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="06101855000029"></a>In summing up, the point that seems most important to me is that there is no single way to slow down Africa&#146;s population explosion. It must be tackled from both ends. There is actually room for more people in many parts of Africa, if the population were better distributed, but such expansion must go together with, or after, economic development, and not before it. Meanwhile, there is an urgent need for a holding operation to help women achieve their desired family size, to go hand in glove with the achievement of the better child survival rates that are part of the millennium development goals.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="06101855000031"></a>A few figures first of all: we should remind ourselves that the estimated population of Africa is about 800 million, but by 2050 it will be 1.8 billion, because the fertility rate in that continent is about38 per 1,000 and the mortality rate is 14 per 1,000. HIV/AIDS has been mentioned. Many people think that it will decimate the African population; we know that it is having a huge economic impact in some countries. If you do your sums, however, you will find that if all the 24.5 million people who it is reckoned are AIDS sufferers in Africa at the moment died tomorrow, a population growth of 2.4 per cent per annum means that in less than 18 months those people would be replaced. That is the scale of the problem and of the huge growth of population in Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="06101855000032"></a>As we have heard, the All-Party Group on Population, Development and Reproductive Health has in the last few months held hearings on the effect of world population growth on the millennium development goals. The group has been chaired brilliantly and very ably by Richard Ottaway MP in the other place, and our report will be published soon. I do not want to pre-empt the report, as it is not quite ready yet, but I beg noble Lords to read it. It is important for our future development policies in Africa and elsewhere.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="06101855000033"></a>We have heard about the Cairo conference in 1994. I want to remind your Lordships that that was in the good times when family planning, as my noble friend said, was popular and forging ahead. The 1994 programme of action said that we must meet the family planning needs of the populations of the world as soon as possible, and should,</p>
<ul><a name="06101855000061"></a>&#147;in all cases by the year 2015, seek to provide universal access to a full range of safe and reliable family-planning methods&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06101855000060"></a>But, as we have heard, little happened in Africa. Nothing has changed. There is still a huge unmet need. We used to think that education and economic prosperity were the only way forward to get small family sizes, but we know from surveys all over Africa that if women are given the opportunity and shown how to use methods of contraception, they will leap at the chance. They know instinctively that it improves their health and the health of their family, and allows them to be more productive.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="06101855000034"></a>Why has nothing happened? &#147;Control&#148; has become a dirty word since the 1970s and 1980s, when there were countries that employed coercive techniques, but the funds that were pledged at Cairo either did not materialise or were diverted into the great fight against AIDS. Sadly, although this did not apply to our own Department for International Development, the treatment of and funding for AIDS from much of the international community have concentrated on drugs, which has meant that that very useful little commodity, the simple condom, which is such a good way of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, has not been properly funded&#151;as I said, the money hasgone into drugs instead. Only 1 per cent of the development budget is now spent on family planning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="06101855000035"></a>The simple, time-honoured male condom&#151;a wonderful thing&#151;can prevent AIDS and unwanted pregnancies. It has an availability in Africa of between 1 and 4 per man per annum. I suggest that that would not be adequate even in this House&#151;sorry&#151;let alone Africa, where nearly everyone is under 40. It is a shocking statistic. It is not funny; it is appalling. The female condom is not popular here. It is very difficult to obtain in Africa but is very popular with women there, once they are introduced to it. Hormonal methods of contraception, especially injectables, which are so convenient, are rarely used except in the wonderful work done in clinics by NGOs such as Marie Stopes International.

But, on the ground, Catholic NGOs perform much good work and tend to turn a blind eye to what is going on. Nevertheless, a word from on high would be hugely helpful in that regard, if we could only get it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="06101855000037"></a>The USA has stopped funding UNFPA programmes because of their links with safe abortion&#151;which is so essential&#151;and abortion counselling, which means that all over the world reproductive health programmes have had to be cut.

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="06101855000038"></a>As a doctor, I know that myths and stories about different family planning techniques abound. Even in this country people tell you the most incredible stories about what the pill does to you and how dangerous it is, and claim that condoms cause AIDS rather than prevent it. In African countries where people receive little education, these stories are very much worse.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="06101855000039"></a>So what must we do? We must increase the proportion of aid dedicated to this matter. We must do something about the supply chain to get contraceptives out there. Everywhere you go in Africa, you can get Coca-Cola and Fanta. I can never understand why you cannot get condoms just as easily. Why is there not liaison between Coca-Cola and Durex to supply condoms taped to every bottle? It might be a good idea to do that in this country as well. Why do those commodities get everywhere whereas something as essential as condoms do not appear? We must have positive propaganda. We must ensure that people understand that even the most dangerous contraceptive methods, such as the very high dose pill that we used in the old days, would be hundreds of times safer than pregnancy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="06101855000040"></a>I just have time to tell noble Lords about the Roman Catholic Bishop of Mozambique who has tried to get round the laws of the Roman Catholic Church and promote the use of condoms. He said in a sermon in the past couple of years that if you are HIV positive and have unprotected sex, you are committing murder, and that is a sin in the eyes of God. He also said that if you are a healthy individual but have unprotected sex with someone who may be HIV positive, you are committing suicide, which is also a sin in the eyes of God. Therefore, he argues that not using a condom is a sin in the eyes of God. That is a nice argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="06101855000041"></a>Finally, we must set up chains of health workers. Family planning techniques do not need doctors or nurses to deliver. I have seen wonderful schemes in Uganda, where HIV patients and village workers have delivered the message, delivered the condoms and taught the people. I have been to Senegal, where there is a marvellous organisation called Tostan, which is based on villagers being educated by villagers and spreading that out in their area. It includes not just contraception, because that would be too offensive, but messages about clean water, education and how to feed your family. I ask DfID to look carefully at its very excellent programmes and to make absolutely sure that in the future family planning is given a much higher priority, for the sake of all the people of Africa

It was quite an achievement. I am afraid that I am not going to offer as much practical advice as the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge. For more than 20 years, I have been a vice-chair of the All-Party Group on Population, Development and Reproductive Health, and I happen to think that this is one of the most important subjects that we can discuss. My interest in that group is clearly shown on the register.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="06101857000003"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Rea, and the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, said, we have been compiling a report based on population and the MDGs. Naturally enough, the MDGs provide the framework of the consideration of the committee, which is producing the report. I have been sitting on the committee to hear the evidence with, as the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, says, Richard Ottaway as our chair. We are only at second draft stage at present, so people might have to wait a bit for the final report. I know that it is keenly awaited with much interest, and I am sure that what I say here will benefit from the evidence that we have heard.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="06101857000004"></a>As we know, the achievement of the MDGs will be extremely difficult, and in many cases impossible, in the time scale envisaged. In addition, it will be very much more difficult to achieve almost all thosegoals without the assistance of some input from the field of reproductive health and considerations of population. As part of this, some of us are trying to reassert the good intentions of the ICPD Cairo conference agreement of 1994, which has already been referred to. I will frame some of my following remarks around some of the MDGs, and I hope to show how Africa, and the agreed aim of poverty reduction, would benefit from a substantially increased regard to reproductive health.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="06101857000005"></a>First, we should remind ourselves that the footprint of the developed nations is very much included in MDG 7 on environmental sustainability. For example, there are issues such as fresh water and carbon emissions which apply globally. In our group&#146;s report, the &#147;northern&#148; scale of consumption and the damage that we do to the planet is acknowledged and must be borne in mind when we are talking about the problems of Africa. In MDG 8, our responsibility for being involved in global partnerships for development is set out. That includes fair trade and finance and also co-operating in many fields with developing countries.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="06101857000006"></a>To address the Unstarred Question directly, we should be offering parts of Africa the means&#151;of which reproductive health is but a small part&#151;and helping to create the conditions, background and infrastructure where countries can benefit from and use what reproductive health can offer. There is  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_848"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 848</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>absolutely no coercion, but there is evidence that sub-Saharan Africa could eventually have the benefit of the demographic dividend in the distant future, but there is much to be put in place to achieve that.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="06101857000007"></a>I will mention in more detail than the noble Lord, Lord Rea, that we are very fortunate that the work and the lobbying that have been done to get reproductive health recognised in the MDGs have recently borne fruit. The new target that has been added and adopted under the heading MDG 5 is,</p>
<ul><a name="06101857000058"></a>&#147;to achieve universal access to reproductive health by 2015&#148;.</ul>
<a name="61018-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="06101857000008"></a>The UN General Assembly took note of that in a report by the Secretary-General and implicitly endorsed that recommendation. It should be noted that after that happened the United States said from the floor that it did not agree with what had been added and noted. I understand that regardless of that, the endorsement by the UN General Assembly will enable universal access to reproductive health to be monitored within the framework of the MDGs.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="06101857000009"></a>Further detailed work is needed to measure progress in this particular field by framing and agreeing indicators by which monitoring of progress can meaningfully take place. Given that the theoretical deadline is 2015, I hope that agreement can be reached fairly swiftly on what those measures will be. A further two years&#146; delay would be unacceptable and I hope that DfID can make sure that progress continues.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="06101857000010"></a>Defining the age parameters, for example, for the contraceptive prevalence rate and for the unmet need for family planning will be very difficult; but when agreed, both should be invaluable international measures as to the progress that is being made. The variable of unmet need in the developing world, as the noble Lord, Lord Rea, said, of those who would like to be able to control their fertility but who are unable to do so has varying estimates, but is invariably more than 100 million, sometimes double that. It will be extremely valuable to have an internationally agreed figure.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="06101857000011"></a>A large proportion of that figure is estimated to be in Africa. In the report of the parliamentary group that I referred to, there will be considerable evidence from both written and oral sources on the direction of causation and the relationship of severe poverty to population size. In this short debate, it is not possible to go into too much detail.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="06101857000012"></a>Similarly, addressing the subject of the Question as to what steps the Government might take can be done only in general terms here. I hope that, following the report I mentioned, the Government through DfID can take an even stronger lead internationally than at present in putting the issue of population into the wider field of our concerns, where it belongs. The additional target for MDGs will provide the perfect platform. I am not forgetting that as much of the impetus for that as is possible needs to come from the developing countries&#151;sometimes the poorest&#151;which will understandably manifest more immediate and urgent needs.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="06101857000013"></a>We need to help win the argument on population, in both the long and short terms, on the basis of evidence and need; and we need to ensure that

One problem that arose during the evidence that was heard for the all-party group's report was that some donor countries made the allocation of resources under a very wide and general heading and it was increasingly difficult to identify for what purpose some funds were actually being used.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="06101857000014"></a>I usually try to avoid quoting numbers in this field, particularly in a debate such as this, but some of the sub-Saharan statistics, if the continuing rates of increase are maintained, are remarkable. The noble Lord, Lord Taverne, mentioned figures for Uganda and Niger. If the present rate of increase in population in Niger continues, from the present level of 14 million it might reach 50 million by 2050&#151;and it is a very small country. It would be too much to expect that education services or food supply could begin to match such an increase. Similar examples could be given.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="06101857000015"></a>After the good intentions of the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994, the issue of population growth gradually lost prominence. That trend led to the under-appreciation of population size and growth alone. A present theme might be that numbers do count, at the same time as we are challenged to &#147;make every person count&#148;. I hope that when the all-party group's report on population and the MDGs is published shortly, it will be studied with keen attention by all.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="06101857000016"></a>Perhaps I may end with the encouraging use of the word &#147;population&#148; and the specific endorsement of that issue in a quotation from Mr Kofi Annan. He stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_263"></a><a name="06101857000056"></a>&#147;The Millennium Developments Goals, particularly the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, cannot be achieved if questions of population and reproductive health are not squarely addressed. And that means stronger efforts to promote women&#146;s rights, and greater investment in education and health, including reproductive health and family planning&#148;.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="06101857000018"></a>Why should we be bothered about Africa&#146;s population increase? After all, Africa covers 22 per cent of the world&#146;s total land area, yet has only 13 per cent of the world&#146;s total population. There are three basic problems. First, much of Africa&#146;s land is unproductive&#151;particularly the deserts, which include the Sahara and the Kalahari. Secondly, climate change means that drought conditions now occur more frequently there. Thirdly, projections showthat Africa&#146;s population, which is currently around 800 million, is likely to double over 33 years.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="06101857000019"></a>According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the populations of some countries are expected to triple by 2050: those of Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger and Uganda. Between now and 2050, four of the nine countries expected to account for half the world&#146;s  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_850"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 850</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>total projected population increase are in Africa&#151;Nigeria, the DRC, Uganda and Ethiopia&#151;and each of those will add more people to the planet than the world&#146;s most populous nation, China.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="06101857000020"></a>This increase in population will create additional demands, particularly on water and food supplies. Let us take Ethiopia as an example. The World Resources Institute tells us that in 1950 its population was18 million; by 2002, this had risen to 66 million; and in 2025 it is likely to be 113 million&#151;a sixfold increase in 75 years.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="06101857000021"></a>That creates another problem. In many parts of Africa, population growth, with more mouths to feed, is leading to soil depletion. Farmers are reducing the length of fallow periods or doing away with them altogether to make it possible to plant more crops. Also, the larger the population, the more firewood is needed for cooking and the greater the need to cut down forests to provide more land for crops. The resultant reduced firewood availability has led to animal dung being used for fuel rather than for fertiliser. Marginal lands, which are not really suitable for agriculture, have increasingly been used and protected areas encroached upon. Sharing farms between sons has led to a reduction in farm size to the point where they are inadequate, and many people become landless.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="06101857000022"></a>It is difficult to believe that, even if climate, agricultural and other remedial measures were successfully implemented in Ethiopia, food supplies could be secured in the face of such a massive population increase and the already incurred environmental deterioration. Even if on a global scale an effective reduction in adverse climate effects were achieved, it is doubtful whether Ethiopia or other countries south of the Sahara could achieve food security if the population continued to grow as projected.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="06101857000023"></a>An additional problem is that most of the countries with the fastest growing populations are poor. Indeed, that is one reason why fertility rates are so high, with each woman producing, on average, five, six or seven children. They know that, because of poor health facilities, some of their offspring are likely to die, and parents see children as the only guarantee of help as they themselves get older and more frail.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="06101857000024"></a>However, the news is not all bad. Some countries in Africa already have fertility rates nearing European levels. South Africa has reduced its fertility rate to2.8; Botswana to 3.0; Namibia to 3.3; and Lesotho to 3.4. Tragically, this progress towards stabilising populations has been dealt a body blow by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="06101857000025"></a>Noble Lords will know of my special interest in Botswana and of my declared interests in the register. Botswana faces a particular population challenge. The country is large&#151;larger than France and Belgium put together&#151;but has a population of just 1.7 million. Over 30 per cent of the population of Botswana are HIV positive. In one respect they are fortunate to live in that enlightened country because the Government have built up healthcare facilities and are able to afford to provide the medicines to help  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_851"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 851</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>each infected person live longer. However, the UN says that the country's population is slowly reducing. </p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="06101857000026"></a>A few years ago, in a nationwide address, the President of Botswana, Festus Mogae, startled his people when he said, &#147;Our country faces extinction&#148;. The country is grappling to educate the population, particularly the younger generation, to change behaviour patterns. Like other countries in Africa, Botswana is promoting the ABC campaign to prevent more people catching HIV: A for abstinence; B for be faithful&#151;have only one partner; and C for use condoms. Fortunately, even the Roman Catholic Church has joined in this campaign. It is to be congratulated on recognising the seriousness of the problem.</p>

<a name="61018-0013.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="06101857000027"></a>Lesotho, Swaziland and South Africa also have high rates of HIV and shrinking populations. Elsewhere on the continent the recording of HIV levels is patchy because testing is not routinely carried out. While lower rates of HIV are published for other countries in Africa, we cannot be sure of the true picture. Uganda, one of the most heavily populated countries in the continent, was thought at one time to have the highest incidence of HIV. It was one of the first countries to recognise the problem and to take steps to tackle it, even though the amount spent on healthcare per person was, and remains, very low. Unfortunately, Uganda today still has a very high fertility rate of 6.8 children per woman and the population is soaring.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="06101857000028"></a>So what can the UK Government do about Africa's problem of increasing population? Education is certainly one part of the answer. Encouraging a better role for women so that they are not seen just as baby-making machines is another. Reinstating family planning in our development programme is vital, as my noble friend said. We need to achieve worldwide trade agreements which will drive up average incomes in Africa to see whether there is a direct link between improving incomes and reducing fertility rates.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="06101857000029"></a>In their book <I>Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update</I>, D. H. Meadows et al paint a picture of how, under certain circumstances, population growth slows then levels off at less than 8 billion wordwide; pollution peaks, then falls before it causes irreversible damage; by the end of the current century there is enough food for everyone; and the sustainable society has been ushered in. Here are some of the circumstances which must be fulfilled to reach that goal: all people must be assured by their societies of acceptance, respect, material security, and care in their old age, no matter how few children they have; all couples must have access to effective birth control technologies; and all couples must decide to limit their family size to two children. Unfortunately, the authors say that the last two of these conditions needed to be achieved by 2002, the year of the simulation. Those are not the only conditions. The book also says that the world must develop powerful technologies for pollution abatement, land yield enhancement, land protection, and conservation of non-renewable resources, all at once.</p>

I would go further than making the usual genuflection towards congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Taverne. He has hit a lot of nails on the head and, without any collusion, I shall make many of the same points. I declare an interest as cofounder and vice-chair of the All-Party Group on Africa, although what I am about to say does not purport in any way to be a collective view.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="06101855000043"></a>My central theme is why Africa does not fit what I shall call the rather benign DfID model. Poverty is clearly a function of GDP per head and income distribution. To cure it, we must increase the sustainable GDP rate of growth and achieve better distribution. Everybody ought to be able to agree on that. In passing, I wish that all NGOs were as economically literate as my noble friend Lord Rea. The questions are: what creates economic development, and what explains African exceptionalism compared with the globalisation from which it seems to have excluded itself?</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="06101855000044"></a>There is another side to the coin, of course. Some things make growth less likely&#151;excessive population growth, in particular. There have been hugely impressive technical studies. Attention has already been drawn to <I>Population and Poverty</I>, published by the United Nations Population Fund in 2003, which quotes a study by Eastwood and Lipton showing that a reduction of 5 per 1,000 in the net birth rate can increase GDP by 1.36 per cent for a country with a median GDP per capita.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="06101855000045"></a>So we come to the puzzle&#151;it is not too much of a puzzle, but DfID finds it so: the reasons for African exceptionalism. What creates the virtuous circle of east Asia&#151;which is not a global virtuous circle which everyone can get to via some inevitable Darwinian process&#151;whereby the number of births per woman reduces and the GDP per head rises sustainably? How on earth do countries such as Niger, Mali and Uganda get there? They have six, seven or eight births per woman whereas the replacement rate, as in the UK, is nearer two. There is a close correlation, if you look at the statistics for all 190-odd countries, between births per woman and the scatter diagram of GDP per head and its growth.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="06101855000046"></a>I am not making a fetish of two births per woman. That is a long way off, given the social and anthropological reasons for many people, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, wanting to have a lot of children&#151;leaving aside those who do not want to have children and do not have access to birth control. Declining fertility via family planning programmes makes a dramatic improvement. Sexual <I>mores</I> are unfortunately changing for the worse among many young people. We all have to use the euphemism &#147;family planning&#148;, but we ought to get beyond

There is no sign of &#147;family&#148; with precocious sexual behaviour from the age of six, seven or eight in many parts of Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="06101855000047"></a>If we are going to do anything to improve African living standards, we must clearly proclaim the importance of reducing births per woman as central to our development strategy. That is why I am sorry to say that I find it little short of scandalous that chapter 5 of the White Paper<I> Making Governance Work for the Poor&#151;</I>which was published in May 2006 and does not have a narrow scope; it has an excellent chapter on climate change, for example&#151;contains not one word on the question of excessive population growth. Why is that? The noble Lord, Lord Taverne, has come up with two ideas. He mentioned religion, I think, and I would add to that the fear of neo-colonialism. Those may be explanations. If my facts are wrong, I hope that my noble friend&#151;to whom I have given notice of my line of argument and the sources I am citing&#151;will correct me. If I am accurate, however, the next question is why we are so silent and mealy-mouthed in our profile on this. I am not talking about the Government making erudite submissions in obscure seminars but about the fact that nothing is said loud and clear in the central reports published by DfID on behalf of Her Majesty&#146;s Government or, as the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, mentioned, in the report of the Commission for Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="06101855000048"></a>If the reason is religious sensitivity, we should tell the truth on the basis of rigorous economic analysis. We should render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar&#146;s and unto God the things that are God&#146;s. We should be as robust in dealing with pseudo-religious claims as we are in dealing with false claims of neo-colonialism. I am not anti-religious&#151;I am a member of the Church of England&#151;but I am appalled by the way in which we seem to be censoring ourselves and not saying what needs to be said on this subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="06101855000049"></a>I welcome and echo what my noble friend Lord Rea said about the alarming connection between population growth and desertification and the destruction of habitat. In Madagascar, where I was this summer, 80 per cent of the rainforest has been slashed and burnt in the past 40 years. There is now bare rock in many places and the habitat of animals such as lemurs is shrinking. I shall come back in a second to the problem of disaffected youths&#151;the young men who hang around the streets of Antananarivo. A compelling study by an academic offshoot of the UN demonstrates very vividly how the conflict in Darfur arose essentially from the destruction of habitat in the nomadic areas, which led to migration and inevitable clashes over land at the most sensitive junction of so many ethnic and religious traditions, leaving aside the odd legacy of straight lines on the map from the colonial era in Sudan and other places.</p>

Unemployment may be one way into it, and it is absolutely necessary to consider that, but the other way may be to look at migration, given that a state governor in Nigeria said that if more aid did not come there, more people would come to Europe. People are putting that on the agenda and we must be honest and robust in addressing it.</p>

That sentiment has been echoed by every other noble Lord who has spoken.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="06101857000032"></a>Last year, the UN report on population challenges and development goals concluded that reduction of birth rates led to a &#147;demographic bonus&#148; whereby the number of people of working age increased relative to those of the children and the elderly, contributing significantly to economic growth and poverty reduction. But the UN study of world population prospects in 2004 showed that, over the last 30 years, the lowest reductions in fertility occurred in 12 African high-fertility countries, as has been mentioned. These countries are forecast to have the highest population growth, coupled with the lowest chance of reaching the millennium development goals, particularly as regards infant and maternal mortality and universal primary education.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="06101857000033"></a>The Africa Commission said that Africa's population is exploding and that millions are migrating to the slums of cities, where the young are unemployed and disaffected. Yet it fails to link the population explosion with Africa&#146;s underdevelopment or to emphasise the negative feedback between high rates of growth and the acute environmental risks affecting the continent. That point was mentioned by several noble Lords. The commission recommends that donors should do all that they can to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive services, including the provision of an extra $300 million in commodity requirements. But it offers no suggestions about how to overcome the inertia or obstruction by Governments and religious organisations to these programmes, a matter to which my noble friend Lord Taverne referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="06101857000034"></a>There have been shortages of condoms in Africa. Last year, there was a particular shortage in Uganda, to which my noble friend referred. I think that that shortage was partly caused by the American plan for AIDS relief driven by the religious right, which emphasises abstinence. The DfID profile on Uganda rightly praises the Government of President Museveni for reducing the prevalence of HIV and AIDS from 18 per cent to 6 per cent in a decade. But many women are still unable to exercise freedom of choice over their own fertility. One-third of Ugandan women say that they would like to stop or postpone having children if they could. They are among the100 million to 200 million whom the noble Viscount,  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_855"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 855</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Craigavon, referred to who want to control their fertility but who do not have the means of doing so.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="06101857000035"></a>According to UN estimates&#151;and this was also referred to by my noble friend&#151;Uganda's population may treble from 42 million in 2005 to 127 million in 2050. With similar increases in other countries in that region, climate change&#151;which is linked to population increase, as the noble Lord, Lord Jones, remarked, and is likely to reduce agricultural production because of extended desertification, lack of water, loss of soil fertility and reduction of crop yields&#151;could bring about conflicts over resources, mass starvation and large-scale emigration long before the mid-century arrives. Droughts have increased in frequency in the Horn from one in eight years to one in three, and there are too many cattle for the carrying capacity of the people, but too few to feed the increasing number of mouths. In Somalia, the desperation of people living on the edge of survival is already reinforcing the growth of radical Islam. Even war-torn Somalia, without a functioning Government or health service, is estimated to have a population increase from8 million in 2005 to 21 million in 2050, while the combined populations of Kenya and Tanzania will double over the same period to 150 million. It is inconceivable that east Africa can sustain increases of this order.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="06101857000036"></a>The question is: what can the countries themselves and the donor community do to avert the looming catastrophe? A far greater emphasis on the MDG of promoting gender equality and empowering women would be an essential part of any strategy, because if women controlled their own fertility they would not have very large families. Bill Gates wrote in the <I>Independent</I> the other day:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_264"></a><a name="06101857000057"></a>&#147;Abstinence is not an option for some poor men and girls who have no choice but to marry at an early age ... And using condoms is not a decision that a woman can make by herself; it depends on a man&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06101857000055"></a>I would argue that abstinence is in any case an unworkable policy and contrary to human nature, but if women themselves decided when to get married and could decide on whether contraceptives should be used, both population growth and HIV/AIDS infections would be reduced, as has been remarked, and women liberated from the burden and health risks of constant childbearing would be able to make a far greater contribution to the economy, especially in agriculture.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="06101857000037"></a>In fact, 120 million women in sub-Saharan Africa are illiterate and most African women have less access to land and education than ever before. Elizabeth Chacko of George Washington University points out that Kerala in India has a low fertility rate compared with that of India as a whole because the women of Kerala have a relatively high status, are well educated and are integrated into the workforce. She says that whether a woman can read, can understand what methods of contraception are available to her and is empowered to use them can have a great impact on fertility rates.</p>

But six years ago DfID also said in an excellent report on poverty and women's empowerment that education alone would not be enough&#151;inequalities needed to be tackled across the board in economic, political, social and cultural life. The Beijing World Conference on Women of 1995 identified 12 critical areas of concern, of which one was unequal access to education and training&#151;one very important one, but not the only one. So I suggest to the Minister that it is time for DfID to review the strategy for poverty elimination and the empowerment of women and to upgrade accordingly its country programmes for Africa. That is not only the right policy for its own sake, but the best way to harness the talent and energies of half the population of Africa and to prevent a Malthusian catastrophe from overwhelming the continent within two generations.</p>

I had to attend a funeral and, needless to say, the train was late. I pray your Lordships&#146; indulgence. As the time for this debate has also changed, I asked my noble friend Lady Seccombe to come to my rescue. I am most grateful to her for agreeing and for filling me in on the very impressive introduction from the noble Lord, Lord Taverne.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="06101855000052"></a>I add my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, for giving us the opportunity to debate this very important Question. Current population projections suggest that Africa's population will double again within a generation&#151;as it did during the previous generation&#151;while the figures in some individual sub-Saharan countries are even more dramatic. Despite high mortality rates, there is no evidence that points to the rate of population growth slowing.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="06101855000053"></a>Such sharp demographic change brings with it many problems and prevents solutions being found to existing problems&#151;not least, economic ones. As long as population growth continues at the current rate, it will be very hard to achieve economic growth in real terms. Even where countries are seeing GDP growth, that is more often than not offset by even greater population expansion. Rapid population growth therefore potentially represents one of the biggest barriers to tackling poverty. Continuing to throw money and aid at the problem, while admirable in sentiment, will struggle to have any lasting effect unless the population explosion ends.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="06101855000054"></a>There are equally marked demographic links to hunger and starvation. Population growth is leading to over-exploitation of farmland. More than 80 per cent of farmland in sub-Saharan Africa is now severely degraded, as we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Jones. Nutrients are disappearing from the soil because of overuse due to the pressure of feeding an ever-increasing number of people. As the cycle continues, African farmland will become incapable of sustaining its already undernourished people.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para21"></a>

In Ethiopia, for example, nearly half the country was forested only a century ago. Now only 4 per cent of the country is covered with trees, as the land is required to help feed the population. As the population grows, it will also create new difficulties. It will become increasingly difficult to maintain adequate numbers of schools and hospitals and to improve these and other basic services.</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="06101855000056"></a>The fertility rates in Africa are astonishing. In the rest of the world, including developing nations in Latin America and Asia, birth rates have steadily declined to an average of 2.3 children per mother. Most nations will experience only modest population growth in the next few decades. Yet, in large portions of Africa, the position is very different. In Uganda, as the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, mentioned, the average mother gives birth to seven children. This remarkable fertility rate has been constant for more than 30 years. Are the Government aware of these birth rates, and do they accept that the continent simply cannot support the numbers? Given that the population of Africa is set to increase from around 750 million today to nearly 1.7 billion people by 2050, does the Minister agree with the noble Lord, Lord Rea, that such a development would place a huge strain on natural resources and the environment?</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="06101855000057"></a>Fewer than one in five married women in Uganda have access to contraception. This is a very typical cross-section. What practical steps are the Government taking to improve the awareness of birth control in Africa? Can we expect any increase in the availability of contraception? Does the Minister agree that it is often the poorest and less educated women who have the least access to family-planning services? As the poorest and less educated women have larger families, unlike the educated women in Kerala, whom the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, mentioned, what can the Government do to tackle this problem?</p>

<a name="61018-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="06101855000058"></a>I recently returned from South Africa, where I had the opportunity to study the Anglo-American programme which raises awareness of, and provides treatment for, AIDS for all its employees. Run by the very enlightened Dr Brian Brink, this excellent programme has been in place for several years, and works in various ways. It focuses on prevention, which is so important. The programme ranges from practical measures, such as the distribution of contraception, to behaviour-based education and targeting young audiences. Does the Minister accept that the frightening spread of HIV shares many roots with uncontrolled population growth, and that there can and should be a similar approach to both? Will the Government look into the impressive Anglo-American programme developed by Dr Brian Brink and encourage others to follow?</p>

I also welcome the recent series of parliamentary hearings by the APPG on population, development and reproductive health which have helped to raise the profile of this issue. I pay tribute to the noble Viscount, Lord Craigavon, for his sterling work in the APPG, and for the group&#146;s work for many years to ensure that this important issue does not slip down the political agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="06101857000040"></a>Population&#151;people&#151;are at the centre of the Government&#146;s business. The biggest obstacles to population stabilisation in Africa are poverty, lack of sexual and reproductive health rights and lack of access to basic services. We are certainly aware of the birth rates. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, that sexual and reproductive health are an important part of this Government&#146;s international development policy. However, discussion about limiting population growth has to be firmly based in a rights context. Underlying high levels of population growth is deep-rooted gender inequality. Women&#146;s low status, lack of decision-making power and control, poor access to information and care, restricted mobility, early age of marriage, and low political priority and resources all contribute to high fertility rates by limiting their ability to make informed choices to ensure healthy sexual and reproductive lives. As the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, said, it is the poorest women who have the fewest choices. The attainment of universal sexual and reproductive health rights underpins the achievement of the millennium development goals on poverty reduction, maternal and child mortality, gender empowerment and prevention of HIV/AIDS. The noble Viscount is right that we have to create conditions and means whereby sexual and reproductive health can thrive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="06101857000041"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Rea, and the noble Viscount, Lord Craigavon, I warmly welcomethe new target in the MDG framework to includethe International Conference on Population and Development goal of universal access to reproductive health by 2015. Indeed, the UK worked very hard to achieve that outcome and strongly supports inclusion of this target. One indicator for consideration of the new target was the unmet need for family planning. The Secretary-General recommended inclusion of this in his report that was noted by the UN General Assembly in October. Sadly, the Holy See and USA raised some last minute objections, and negotiations to ensure inclusion of the target and to agree appropriate monitoring indicators are continuing. However, we are committed to work on this diligently because we want to ensure the appropriate outcome.</p>

DfID does not promote abstinence-only messages as a strategy for HIV prevention and pregnancy reduction for young people. The noble Lord, Lord Jones of Cheltenham, mentioned ABC&#151;abstinence, be faithful, correct and consistent condom use. DfID promotes the full ABC message as a balanced strategy for HIV prevention and pregnancy reduction for young people, but I fully agree with the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that for many women abstinence is not an option. I deeply regret that in Ethiopia, for example, the loss of nearly US$500,000 per year of US funding to the Ethiopian Family Guidance Association, is equivalent to the loss of reproductive health services to 500,000 men and women in urban areas every year.</p>

<a name="61018-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="06101857000043"></a>Marie Stopes International lost $60,000 and hadto close several health posts. Funding cuts have caused cutbacks or discontinuations in emergency contraceptive programmes, outreach services, voluntary counselling and testing for HIV. However, DfID is actively addressing that through increased attention to improving funding for abortion and sexual and reproductive health, including family planning and male and female condoms.</p>

<a name="61018-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="06101857000044"></a>Better sexual and reproductive health and poverty reduction is a virtuous circle. Education, better health and greater rights for women and girls enhance choice and opportunity. Fewer and better spaced births improve maternal and child health. Families can invest more in their children. Slower population growth means that countries can invest more per head in basic services. All this helps to reduce poverty. Efforts to slow population growth and reduce poverty are mutually reinforcing.</p>

<a name="61018-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="06101857000045"></a>On the White Paper, I am pleased to inform noble Lords that the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Population Development and Reproductive Health took part in the consultation process. However, I believe they recognised that not every subject that was raised in the consultation process could be dealt with fully. The White Paper takes account of population changes as part of its wider review of environmental and economic pressures, and a key part of the White Paper is about the delivery of basic services, including health and education to poor people. Better sexual and reproductive health is and will remain an essential element of this. I can assure noble Lords that the Government, in the words of my noble friend Lord Lea, are not mealy-mouthed or secretive about population or about sexual and reproductive health. Indeed, we have a very loud voice in the UN and the EU, as well as in our bilateral discussions with countries in Africa, as I will seek to demonstrate. The African Union itself recently held a meeting of health Ministers on sexual health and reproduction, and those Ministers are determined to keep these issues high on the political agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="06101857000046"></a>In Africa, as elsewhere, DfID is keen to contribute to poverty reduction by supporting country-ledand country-owned policies and strategies. Where appropriate, our preferred way of supporting development in Africa is to provide budgetary support to national governments&#146; overall plans and  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_860"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 860</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>budgets. Within that context we can then support governments as they define and deliver their own priorities, including basic health and education services, and reduce barriers to accessing those services. Prioritising issues such as sexual and reproductive health in national planning processes such as poverty reduction strategies is critical. That is why in countries like Sierra Leone we are helping donors and the Government to include performance indicators for sexual and reproductive health at the highest level. In addition, in a number of African countries we are directly supporting long-term investments to rebuild and strengthen health systems. In Malawi, for example, DfID&#146;s emergency human resources programme is improving incentives for the recruitment and retention of health staff and enabling a significant expansion of domestic training capacity. We are also supporting a Marie Stopes International partner which is delivering services to such women, precisely because we understand the importance of family planning.</p>

<a name="61018-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="06101857000047"></a>Access to good quality sexual and reproductive health information, services and supplies, including family planning, is central to giving people more choice over family spacing and size. These help both to stabilise population growth and to tackle AIDS. I must say that I rather like the idea of a free condom with every bottle of Coke. In Mozambique, DfID is investing over &#163;13 million to increase access to reproductive and sexual health services. In Sierra Leone, DfID is considering a joint programme with the World Bank to improve sexual, reproductive and child health. Improving access to family planning will be a key component from the outset. The noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, asked about the simple but important condom. For the past 10 years, DfID has been the fourth largest provider of condoms to developing countries, supporting the distribution of around 150 million condoms annually. DfID has provided nearly &#163;4 million for condoms and hormonal contraceptives in Ethiopia, &#163;500,000 for a social marketing programme to maintain family planning services in DRC, and nearly &#163;2 million for maintaining access to family planning services for women with HIV and AIDS in Zimbabwe. DfID is providing the vast majority of condoms for distribution through the public sector and social marketing in Ghana, and 80 per cent of the condoms in Nigeria. In addition to our direct support for partner governments, DfID supports the global efforts of UNFPA and the International Planned Parenthood Federation. We are currently providing &#163;80 million over four years to UNFPA and&#163;19.5 million to IPPF between 2004 and 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="06101857000048"></a>Noble Lords have clearly demonstrated in their remarks that the unmet need for family planning is enormous. Some 137 million women who have expressed a desire to space or limit their family size are not using any form of contraception. This year alone an estimated 19 million women and girls will face an unintended and unwanted pregnancy. Many will suffer the deadly consequences of unsafe abortion, from which nearly 70,000 will die and many others will be left with long-term debilitating injuries. The UK has therefore taken the lead and, in February  


<notus-date day="18" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_861"></a><b>18 Oct 2006 : Column 861</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>2006, the Government committed an initial &#163;3 million to the safe abortion action fund developed by the IPPF, which aims to reduce the 13 per cent of maternal deaths which result from unsafe abortion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="06101857000049"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, referred to the DfID publication of 2000. Last year there was an evaluation across all DfID work looking at gender and the empowerment of women in relation to the achievement of the MDGs. One of the outcomes is that a senior management team is working to ensure that empowerment of women and gender are mainstreamed. Yes, an evaluation of the 2000 strategy would be interesting, but DfID believes that it is much more important to ensure that we are doing the job and empowering women. I will write to the noble Lord with further information about the evaluation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="06101857000050"></a>My noble friend Lord Lea is absolutely right&#151;it is important that data and analysis about population dynamics and their consequences are made available, disseminated and taken into account in the development of policy. DfID is currently working with the William and Flora Hewlitt Foundation and the Population Reference Bureau to convene an October seminar at DfID on poverty reduction and economic growth, the role of population dynamics and reproductive health.

But that is precisely why the focus of DfID&#146;s policy is the elimination of poverty. It is also clear that when women have full sexual and reproductive health and rights they are able to participate more fully in education, sustainable livelihoods, markets and the economy, decision-making and the political processes.</p>

<a name="61018-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="06101857000052"></a>As mentioned by my noble friend, increased migration is also a result of both poverty and population growth. In September, I participatedin the UN high-level dialogue on international migration and development and there is now real recognition that development plays an important role in tackling the causes which compel people to migrate and that migration could be a positive force for development.</p>

<a name="61018-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="06101857000053"></a>The UK Government remain firmly committed to the stabilisation of population in Africa. We will seek to ensure that the achievements we have seen to date are consolidated and continued. We will work with others to ensure that critical constraints, both at the global policy level and at the country level, are overcome. I understand that the Germans, in both their EU and G8 presidencies, will focus on Africa, so there may be room there to develop this work.</p>

<a name="61018-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="06101857000054"></a>But although we will continue to play our part, it is also the responsibility of African Governments to take leadership to address this issue. That is why we are putting our resources into their development plans and channelling them through their systems. The UK has shown continuous leadership and lobbied at the highest level for full attention to sexual and reproductive health and rights, including family planning. I can assure the House that we will continue to do so.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_head0"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="06101842000002"></a>EU: Lahti Summit</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="06101842000007"></a><b><a name="61018-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="06101842000043"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Triesman):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Margaret Beckett) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="06101842000008"></a>The informal summit of European Union heads of state and government will be held on 20 October in Lahti, Finland. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister will represent the UK.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="06101842000009"></a>The Government welcome the opportunity the Lahti summit provides for EU leaders to take forward the &#147;delivery agenda&#148; agreed at the Hampton Court summit last October, during the United Kingdom's presidency of the EU. This will help the EU respond to the challenges of the 21st century: improving European innovation and research; ensuring Europe's universities can compete globally; tackling the energy challenges all member states face; addressing citizens' concerns on security and on migration.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="06101842000010"></a>In particular, Lahti will concentrate on EU external energy policy and innovation. There will also be discussion of immigration and of Darfur, as well as diner with President Putin.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="06101842000011"></a>At Lahti, we will underline the importance of climate security in the EU's discussion of energy; for example, through the extension of the emissions trading scheme and developing clean coal technology. Delivering our climate change goals is bound up with improving our competitiveness and fostering jobs, growth and innovation. Lahti will be an opportunity to set a clear political framework for future work.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="06101842000012"></a>The discussion of external energy issues will also ensure we maintain the momentum of the Hampton Court agenda, for example by mainstreaming energy into the EU's relations with third countries. Energy will also feature in the discussions with President Putin over dinner. This will also be an opportunity to consider the future of the strategic relationship between Russia and the EU.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="06101842000013"></a>The other main theme at Lahti will be innovation.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="06101842000014"></a>The Government believe there are two major challenges for the EU in this area. First, a fragmentation of effort in research; and, secondly, Europe's relative weakness in getting to market the high quality research and innovation carried out by its research base and universities. Lahti should make progress on the key aspects of improving the EU's innovation performance, such as intellectual property rights and the links between business and education.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="06101842000015"></a>Heads of government will also discuss the situation in Darfur, at the request of the Prime Minister. It is important that EU heads send a clear message underlining the urgent need to implement the peace deal agreed in May.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="06101842000016"></a>We also expect a discussion of migration issues, bearing in mind recent experience in Spain. Member states agreed at Hampton Court to a series of commitments as part of the global approach to migration. It is important that the EU continues to prioritise delivery of those actions.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="06101842000017"></a>The Government will provide a Written Statement to the House next week on the outcome of the Lahti summit.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_head1"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="06101842000003"></a>EU: Transport Council</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="06101842000018"></a><b><a name="61018-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="06101842000044"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (Dr Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="06101842000019"></a>I attended the transport session of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council, held in Luxembourg on 12 October. The Finnish Minister for Transport and Communications, Mrs Susanna Huovinen, was in the chair.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="06101842000020"></a>The council held a debate on the communication, <I>Keep Europe&#151;Sustainable mobility for our continent</I>, the Commission's mid-term review of the 2001 Transport White Paper. Ministers generally welcomed the new focus on &#147;co-modality&#148; (getting the best from each transport mode) and other themes included better regulation, road safety, tackling environmental impacts, efficient logistics and financing of infrastructure. I was among Ministers who spoke in favour of aviation emissions trading and continuing rail liberalisation.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="06101842000021"></a>The Commission introduced its communication, <I>Freight Transport Logistics in Europe&#151;the key to sustainable mobility</I>, and reaffirmed its commitment to bring forward an action plan in the autumn of 2007. The presidency aim is for council conclusions on the communication to be agreed at the December council.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="06101842000022"></a>The council reached a general approach on two regulations providing for the Galileo Joint Undertaking (GJU) to be closed and for its responsibilities to be transferred to the European GNSS Supervisory Authority (GSA). The GJU is to be wound up by amending Council Regulation (EC) No 876/2002 which set it up, and its responsibilities are to be transferred to the GSA by amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 which had established and defined the responsibilities of the GSA. In response to the commission's report on the progress of Galileo in its communication, <I>Taking stock of the Galileo programme</I>, the council also adopted a set of council conclusions which urged more tangible progress. The texts of the two regulations and the council conclusions were acceptable to the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="06101842000023"></a>During debate on wider aspects of the programme including the concession contract, I reiterated the UK's position that Galileo was a civil programme under civil control. In discussions on third country participation in Galileo, the Commission said it was essential to define the roles and terms for third country participation and that it was reflecting further on these issues before bringing forward a draft mandate for relations with international partners. The Commission announced that a Green Paper on applications for the programme will be published by the end of the year.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="06101842000024"></a>The council reached political agreement on the regulation on common rules in the field of civil aviation security, which will replace the 2002 regulation. The agreed text was acceptable to the UK. The commission noted that the events in August in London demonstrated the importance of agreeing this legislation as soon as possible. The presidency will continue its contact with the European Parliament, to work towards agreement on the text.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="06101842000025"></a>I provided a summary of the UK response to the August security events and lessons learnt. I thanked the Commission and other member states for their work in reaching a prompt agreement on new security measures.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="06101842000026"></a>The Commission gave a progress report on EU-US air transport negotiations: it reported that no progress had been made since the previous council, due to the political situation in Washington. However, they reaffirmed their commitment to delivering a balanced deal. Movement from the US would be needed in order to achieve this. They were ready to continue their efforts to encourage the US to move forward, so that the target date of 31 December, as agreed at the last EU-US summit, might be respected. While understanding the frustration expressed at the lack of progress, I pointed out that we were still some way from reaching a balanced deal. But without significant progress from the US side, we were in danger of getting nothing. The presidency summed up the discussion with presidency conclusions.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="06101842000027"></a>The Commission provided council with an update on discussions with Russia about payments for Siberian overflights. The Commission is aiming to reach agreement in time for the EU-Russia summit in Helsinki on 24 November.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="06101842000028"></a>Under any other business, the Presidency gave a report on the EU-Russia Permanent Partnership Council (PPC) meeting on transport on 8 September.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="06101842000029"></a>Agreed without debate were: a council decision on signature of the Transport Protocol of the Alpine Convention; and adoption of the regulation establishing the second Marco Polo programme for the granting of Community financial assistance to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system (&#147;Marco Polo II&#148;).</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="06101842000030"></a><b><a name="61018-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="06101842000045"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="06101842000031"></a>The Government are today announcing 49 schemes, involving 38 local authorities that will ensure social rented homes meet and maintain minimum standards of decency. These schemes should deliver around &#163;3 billion of investment, of which at least &#163;1.8 billion will be levered in from the private sector. They will tackle over 80,000 non-decent homes, and ensure that a further 100,000 are maintained at the standard that tenants have a right to expect.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="06101842000032"></a>These new schemes, which are subject to continuing consultation with tenants, will establish arrangements to transfer local authority social housing to registered social landlords.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="06101842000033"></a>Some 29 schemes have been awarded places on the disposals programme. These schemes are in Blaby, Braintree, Bracknell, Brighton, Castle Morpeth, Castle Point, Daventry, Fenland, Gedling, Gravesham, Harborough, Lewisham (two schemes), Mole Valley, North Shropshire, Oswestry, Rochford, Salisbury, Sheffield (five schemes), South Kesteven, South Northamptonshire, Sutton, Three Rivers, Watford, and Wellingborough.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="06101842000034"></a>A further 18 schemes have had places on the transfer programme held open primarily for further discussions to take place over covering funding gaps arising from negative housing stock valuations. These schemes are in Berwick-upon-Tweed, Cannock, Chester le Street, Crawley, LB Havering, Manchester (four schemes), NW Leicestershire, Plymouth, Ribble Valley, Salford, Tamworth, Torridge, LB Tower Hamlets (four schemes) and Wansbeck. I expect all these schemes to gain programme places over the coming months.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="06101842000035"></a>These schemes mark our continuing commitment to ensuring that all social sector tenants have the decent homes that they deserve, and keeps the decent homes strategy firmly at the heart of the sustainable and mixed communities&#146; agenda. Many of the schemes will encompass works outside the properties to ensure that it is both homes and local neighbourhoods that receive investment to ensure they are both good places to live in.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="06101842000036"></a>The results of the round 6 ALMO programme will be announced later in the year.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="06101842000037"></a><b><a name="61018-wms0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06101842000046"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (Dr Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="06101842000038"></a>My right honourable friends, the Secretaries of State for Transport and Communities and Local Government have decided to grant legal powers and planning consents to Network Rail in respect of its Thameslink 2000 rail enhancement scheme.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="06101842000039"></a>The scheme involves extending and upgrading the existing Thameslink network, by providing for more frequent and longer trains to serve 121 more stations than at present. Planning permission and statutory powers for the scheme are being given, together with listed building and conservation area consents and consents for consequential rail closures.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="06101842000040"></a>These decisions accord with the recommendations of the inspector who held a public inquiry last year into the scheme. My right honourable friends are satisfied that earlier deficiencies in the design of the scheme that were identified following the initial inquiry held in 2000-01 have been satisfactorily addressed.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="06101842000041"></a>It is important to note that these decisions do not amount to a final go-ahead for the project. They are made without prejudice to a decision on funding for the scheme, which the Department for Transport is currently considering separately. Furthermore, none of the authorised rail closures can take place unless the Thameslink scheme is implemented.</p>

<a name="61018-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="06101842000042"></a>The decisions, and the reasons for them, are explained in full in three separate decision letters, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House with a copy of the inspector's report of the public inquiry. These documents are also being placed on the department's website.</p>

</ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_9"></a>
<a name="06101843000055"></a><b><a name="61018w0001.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="06101843000250"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Equality-related consultations arising from Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 did not begin to take place in departments until after equality schemes approved by the Equality Commission were in place, around mid 2001. Between 2001 and 2006 in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern Ireland there were eight equality-related consultations undertaken. Further details can be found in the department's statutory five-year review of its equality scheme which is publicly available on its website at www.dardni.gov.uk/index/publications/pubs-dard-strategies-reports-and-accounts/five-year-review-of-equality-scheme.htm.</p>

<a name="61018w0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a><a name="06101843000056"></a>For each consultation DARD consults with groups and individuals who have requested that they be included on its Section 75 consultation list (a copy is attached at Annexe B), which was established as part of its equality scheme for these purposes. This list is updated on request during the year. Backdated lists are not kept.</p>

<a name="61018w0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a><a name="06101843000057"></a>The noble Lord may wish to be aware that in addition to equality-related consultations, the department consults with key stakeholders as part of good policy-making practices generally, and because one must consult on legislation, even where no adverse equality impacts have been identified.</p>

<a name="61018w0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a><a name="06101843000058"></a>With regard to the noble Lord's second Question, the information requested is not readily available in the form requested and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However, for every equality-related consultation issued, policy makers record to whom consultations were issued, who responded and what was said. At least a summary of consultation responses received is published (usually on the department's website). All of this information is or has been publicly available.</p>

<a name="61018w0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_8"></a><a name="06101843000059"></a>It is difficult to identify specific changes that have occurred to a policy as a result of consultation alone. This is because, when equality is mainstreamed effectively into decision-making throughout the policy development cycle&#151;through, for example, having advisory fora, pre-consultation or informal consultation&#151;there will be no negative equality impacts evident.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_92"></a><a name="06101843000164"></a>As a further measure in response to the 9 October nuclear test, Seoul has halted food-related assistance, which so far has included a further 90,000 tonnes of rice. The only significant external providers of food assistance now are the World Food Programme and China, which has in the past provided about the same amount as South Korea, although China also supplies grains to the Democratic People&#146;s Republic of Korea on commercial terms. So far this year, Chinese food deliveries appear to be down to about 30 per cent of 2005 levels.</p>
