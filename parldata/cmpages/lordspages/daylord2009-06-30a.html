We are aware of local variations in the provision of incontinence services and so continue to work for a high level of integrated incontinence services across the country.</p>

Bearing in mind that incontinence is the last great health taboo, a massive public health problem that affects 4 million to 6 million people&#151;men, women and children&#151;and more prevalent than asthma, epilepsy and even dementia, will the Government consider adding incontinence management to the list of national health improvement programmes?</p>

It will be incorporated into a later phase of a package for older people in order to promote improvements to health and well-being in later life.</p>

Will the Minister say whether there is a date by which we can expect someone responsible and trained in handling incontinence problems to be in post in all trusts? Will she also say whether incontinence products other than the usual, bog standard ones&#151;I apologise for the pun&#151;can be made available to meet the very different needs of incontinence sufferers?</p>

The noble Baroness is correct to point out the need to make available the right guidance and support to deliver these services. Those things are in place, but we now need to make sure that our monitoring services pinpoint those areas that are not delivering a proper level of care to patients with incontinence. The development of products is a matter that we have under review. I cannot give the noble Baroness any more detail on that now, so I will write to her.</p>

Maintaining our continence is fundamental to ensuring our dignity, yet the current practice of some PCTs is resulting in some people being forced to use basic products that do not meet their needs.

Good practice in incontinence services recommends that a range of pads should be available in all categories, including bedpans and a variety of sizes of pads with different absorbencies. Rationing is totally unacceptable and the Government have made it completely clear that incontinence pads should be provided in sufficient quantities to meet individuals&#146; needs.</p>

That means that people are deprived of important medical facilities and treatments. The Government should intervene, regardless of their present stance.</p>

In April 2009, NICE took over the responsibility for overseeing a new independent process for prioritising, developing and reviewing the quality and outputs framework of what happens in clinical and health improvements. Any new topic for inclusion in what is known as the QOF will need to be made to NICE as part of this process. The noble Baroness points to an important matter. The process of prioritisation of topics will be made by the advisory committee and decisions on whether to include things will be based on evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness. I think that I feel a campaign coming on.</p>

Will the Government consider putting in place a system to monitor the practices of PCTs to ensure that some of the commissioning processes that I am aware of, including local formularies and very restrictive tendering procedures, are not used to the detriment of incontinence patients?</p>

We will continue to fund the mobile unit through the find and treat programme, which actively screens homeless hostels across London until 2010. It will then be up to the London commissioners to reach a consensus on future support for find and treat, including whether there should be a second mobile x-ray unit.</p>

Is she aware that there is now an exceedingly serious situation in London with drug-resistant tuberculosis among the homeless and within the prisons, which is where the mobile unit goes? The recommendation was that there should be at least two units, but the Health Protection Agency has actually recommended that there should be three. The only unit that there is at present is now getting very old, so they desperately need another one. That would enable them also to do schools and children.</p>

What is required here is that the London PCTs agree to take this programme forward. The cost of one mobile unit per PCT in London would be &#163;16,000 per year, and the cost of two would be &#163;32,000 per year. We are not talking about enormous sums, but it will require co-operation among the London PCTs. We are doing our very best to encourage this.</p>

After that, the London PCTs will combine to take on the programme, if the evaluation proves to be right, and the mobile units. We now know through the HPA of the recommendation to have two units.

We do this in several ways, including raising awareness of TB within the medical profession. The incidence of TB in the population has been stable for the past two years.

That Bill provides for jurisdiction founded not on residence but on presence. Will the Minister confirm that the Government are looking sympathetically at potential changes in UK law of a similar effect to ensure that the United Kingdom is not a safe haven for war criminals?</p>

The Government will continue to work with other countries, of course including the United States and the European Union, to ensure that criminal justice systems around the world are designed to deal with cases of this nature. We also consider the role of international institutions in these matters. I have no personal knowledge of the matter before the Senate in the United States, but it is clear that it would be of both interest and education in terms of what we are seeking to do in this country.</p>

It occasionally provides judgments which we might not find politically convenient or in the best interests of ourselves as a single nation. They are, however, judgments in the best interests of humanity. As the Human Rights Act protects people in law, I do not believe we should disagree with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09063062000053"></a>The Children&#146;s Commissioner, Sir Al Aynsley-Green, has made it clear that the detention of children is &#147;harmful to their health and wellbeing&#148;. Furthermore, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, on her recent visit to Yarl&#146;s Wood and other detention centres, found that in the past four months alone no fewer than 83 children had been detained for either 28 days or longer, with no clear indication when they would come out of detention. Therefore, will Minister consider looking at community-based schemes for families who are awaiting return to their homes or who may not be able to be returned to their homes, as has happened in other countries? Will he also consider that those families who have been in Britain for many years, in some cases with children born and entirely educated here, might be eligible for a humanitarian system of amnesty, because it is difficult to return people who from birth onwards have had no links with any country except our own?</p>

The facts are that in the first quarter of 2009, 95 children were removed on leaving detention. Of those, 30 children were in detention at 31 March, with 20 detained for seven days or fewer; five for 15 to 28 days; five for 29 days and fewer than two months; and five for two months. However, I agree entirely that we should look for community-based solutions. There is a further experimental project in Glasgow, which is moving in that direction.</p>

On the circumstances that the noble Baroness and the noble Lord have mentioned, when people have been born in this country, individual case officers look at the situation. We do not have a cold, hard heart towards the children of asylum seekers, failed or genuine, and we try to treat them with the sensitivity that they deserve. However, we come back to the point that if we are satisfied that there is not to be persecution in the country to which they would return and there is a country to which they can be returned, it is the right thing to do.</p>

I have an interest in this matter, particularly as someone who was told that he would have been arrested, if he had not been a bishop, for my involvement in causing a dawn arrest to be bungled. These dawn arrests happen at six in the morning, with teams of people who are almost exclusively male coming in like storm troopers wearing protective jackets. I shall come to the question in a moment, but I know of a case in which there was only one female officer for a mother with three children, who had to be supervised by males. I think of other cases in which children were left in their nappies for six hours and in their bedclothes with no ability to be changed. What guidelines are there for allowing such treatment and are there are any plans for ending those dawn raids?</p>

If he cares to write to me with chapter and verse&#151;I am sorry about the pun&#151;I would be more than happy to look at the matter. But it is not the policy of the agency and certainly not the Government&#146;s policy that we put people in that situation. When a team goes to visit, it is made up as determined by risk assessment. If there is no criminal element involved, it is not thought necessary to do it team-handed. I am surprised by what the right

It has been tabled following queries raised by Inquest with the Ministry of Justice. As a general feeling, the new simplified appeals procedure is welcome. It affords an opportunity for bereaved people to raise concerns in a more informal manner than they were previously able to do. However, a concern arises from the way the Bill appears to be worded. The concern is that the only further appeal is to the Court of Appeal on a point of law. What exactly does that mean? Does it mean, as it would appear, that the possibility of any challenge by way of judicial review in respect of most, if not all, coronial decisions would no longer exist? Does it mean that where there has been a question of process no appeal would be applicable? Does it mean that if clinical information has not been provided to the inquiry no appeal could be undertaken?</p>

<a name="90630-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09063062000069"></a>Inquest queried the matter with the Ministry of Justice because it wanted to know whether it would still be an option judicially to review a coroner&#146;s decision or whether someone would have to go directly to the Chief Coroner for that type of decision. Interestingly, it received two conflicting replies. One said that judicial review remains an option; the other said that it had to go to the Chief Coroner. I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify the position for the Committee. Will funding be available to families? Will judicial review remain an option and in what circumstances; and, if not, what will the process actually entail? I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply. I beg to move.</p>

Under the Bill&#146;s new appeals system, an interested person appeals against a coroner&#146;s decision, first, to the Chief Coroner. If dissatisfied with the Chief Coroner&#146;s  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_120"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>decision, they may then, under Clause 32(8), appeal, on a question of law only, to the Court of Appeal. In practice, this means that they can appeal to the Court of Appeal only if they think that the Chief Coroner has not applied the law correctly when considering the decision made by the senior coroner which is being appealed. The appellant cannot appeal to the Court of Appeal as to the merits of the decision made by the Chief Coroner. A procedure already exists for challenging a decision in these circumstances and that is to bring proceedings for judicial review.</p>

<a name="90630-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09063062000071"></a>The purpose of Amendment 129 is to enable interested persons to appeal to the Court of Appeal on the merits of the decision made by the Chief Coroner when he or she was determining an appeal against a senior coroner&#146;s decision. This would be in addition to appealing the Chief Coroner&#146;s decision on a question of law and may be prompted by a wish to give bereaved people a greater right of appeal.</p>

<a name="90630-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09063062000072"></a>The new system of appeals will radically change and simplify the procedure for bereaved people and other interested persons to appeal against many coroners&#146; decisions and ensure that any bereaved person who is dissatisfied with a coroner&#146;s decision will receive a fair hearing from the Chief Coroner&#151;who will be a circuit or High Court judge&#151;or one of his deputies. At present, the decisions of coroners can be challenged only by way of judicial review and so the new appeal route is a great improvement on this. We do not believe that it is necessary to widen this even more so as to enable the Court of Appeal to review decisions made by the Chief Coroner unless a question of law is involved. To do so is likely to overburden the Court of Appeal with appeals from interested persons in relation to decisions which have already been reconsidered by the Chief Coroner and where, for the reason I have given above, the appeal stands little prospect of success. There is also the need for finality so that decisions are not being reviewed endlessly.</p>

<a name="90630-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09063062000073"></a>There is only one exception to this process: where, under Schedule 8 to the Bill, a coroner&#146;s investigation is carried out by a High Court judge or retired Court of Appeal judge. If an interested person wishes to appeal their decision, the first appeal will be to the Court of Appeal, under Clause 32, because of the seniority of the judge who carried out the investigation. There may be some circumstances where an interested person has concerns about a coroner&#146;s decision not listed in Clause 32. If this occurs, then, again, the remedy would be judicially to review the decision as at present although the new bespoke appeal system should mean that this rarely happens.</p>

<a name="90630-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09063062000074"></a>Judicial review has not in any way been ruled out. However, we would expect an interested party to appeal to the Chief Coroner before bringing proceedings. As to the possibility of legal aid support for judicial review, I have no reason to believe that it would be handled any differently from any other judicial review. If there is a difference, however, I will write to the noble Baroness. In view of this explanation, I hope that the noble Baroness will consider withdrawing her amendment.</p>

Amendment 134A is straightforward. It applies to page 21 of the Bill, at subsection (2). It would simply insert before &#147;persons&#148;, &#147;interested persons&#148;. This emanates from my interest in the Bill in trying to ensure that the families of military personnel who have lost their lives in the duty of the country are involved in the process. Whereas this will currently not be disclosed except to persons specified in the direction, I am seeking that the interested persons be named in the direction. Amendment 136A is linked with the provision in that, if accepted by the Minister, it defines what an interested person is. That is covered on page 22 under Clause 38(2)(a), which specifies clearly that an interested person is,</p>
<ul><a name="09063062000161"></a>&#147;a spouse, civil partner, partner, parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, child of a brother or sister, stepfather, stepmother, half-brother or half-sister&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09063062000125"></a>In other words, it is a whole range of family members who may be affected by the death of service personnel. That would put in the Bill clearly what an interested person is, so there would be no way that in the subsequent regulations any of that group of people could be excluded from being consulted and involved.</p>

<a name="90630-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09063062000078"></a>Amendment 137A is slightly different. It leaves out Clause 36(3)(a). After the Government&#146;s decision to drop Clause 11, I was in some confusion as to whether the clause would remain in the Bill. My concern, if it remains in the Bill, is to seek to remove it from the Bill. The reason is that as it stands a coroner may rule and give a direction excluding specified persons from an inquest or part of an inquest if the coroner is of the opinion that the interests of national security so require. I am not against the best interests of national security. I am concerned that here we could have members of the family of the bereaved excluded from some parts of the coroner&#146;s case. That situation will do nothing to assist the families. It implies that they should not have the full facts of how their loved ones lost their lives, which I do not think is the intention of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90630-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09063062000079"></a>If this paragraph were deleted, it would mean that in any circumstance the members of the family of the person who lost their life, as a member of military personnel, would be entitled to attend the coroner&#146;s inquest, to have a reason given and to hear what is said rather than be excluded from possibly substantial parts of the hearing. If that were to happen, they would never have a full understanding of what happened when their husband or other member of their family lost their life in the service of their country and, one could also say, they would never arrive at closure. I hope that the Minister is able to accept the three amendments that I have put forward. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09063062000081"></a>I have two concerns about Clause 36(3)(b). The first is the breadth of the power. It is not restricted by any requirement to ensure that these rules allow for such exclusion only where necessary because there is no other means of avoiding serious harm to the young person; nor is it restricted by any requirement to ensure that the rules must balance the interests of the young person giving evidence against the interests of another person in remaining present&#151;for example, the interests of the person who may be said to have been responsible for the death in question. I ask the Minister why we need such a broad power when, so far as I know, no such power is found in criminal courts when young people give evidence, which they do regularly.</p>

<a name="90630-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09063062000082"></a>My second concern about Clause 36(3)(b) is that, on present drafting, it would allow for rules to authorise the senior coroner to exclude all members of the press. Even if there is a case for a rule-making power which allows the senior coroner to exclude individuals from an inquest, I do not accept that it is appropriate to exclude members of the press simply because the young witness might, understandably, find the experience of giving evidence less traumatic the fewer people there are present. Surely the presence of the press at an inquest helps to maintain high standards and avoid rumours and allegations of any cover-up. When members of the public are excluded from a hearing, it is surely all the more important that the press are allowed to remain present. That has long been the practice and the law in youth courts. The Minister will know that under the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, when a child or young person gives evidence in criminal proceedings and their evidence is likely to be impeded by their fear or distress, and either the proceedings relate to a sexual offence or there is a fear of witness intimidation, the court has a power under Section 25 to make a direction excluding specified persons from the court. Section 25 adds that a representative of the press must be allowed to remain. Section 25 also helpfully provides that in such cases, the proceedings are still to be treated as having occurred in public for the purposes of libel law.</p>

<a name="90630-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09063062000083"></a>So if it is necessary to retain Clause 36(3)(b) in some form, can the Minister tell us why there is no protection similar to Section 25 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act, including similar protections for press freedom, in the coroners&#146; context? These points that I have made about Clause 36(3)(b) are also relevant to the drafting of Clause 36(3)(a) and I ask the Minister to think again about these aspects of Clause 36.</p>

An explanation is seriously needed as to why existing Children Act legislation cannot be used as a model. I also have a problem with the closing words of Clause 36(3)(b) where it talks about the coroner being of the opinion that having the evidence given without the excluded persons being there,</p>
<ul><a name="09063062000162"></a>&#147;would be likely to improve the quality of the witness&#146;s evidence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09063062000126"></a>That seems almost to be asking for a mini-trial within an inquest. I do not know how else, on any fair basis, the coroner can possibly arrive at that opinion without allowing it to be tested by questions from interested parties.</p>

I support the amendments in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde. Indeed, the requirement to specify who the interested persons are relates to an amendment which I will be moving later, and her points are well made. I have a concern, though, about removing the ability of a coroner to exclude certain persons when a child is giving evidence. I say this based on our experience in south Wales, where children in a small community have been intimidated and frightened of speaking out.</p>

<a name="90630-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09063062000086"></a>I understand the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, in relation to the press but wonder whether there need to be reporting restrictions so that if members of the press had to breach them, they would know that they were doing so but for good reason, which would afford some protection to the child. I would certainly welcome the assurance he mentioned about libel law being protected whether the hearing was in public or not.</p>

<a name="90630-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09063062000087"></a>I also ask the Minister whether, if we completely adopted the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and were a full signatory to it, that might solve the problem in protecting children when they are giving evidence in what is often a desperately stressful situation because it often relates to the death of their own sibling. That is why I have a concern with simply deleting Clause 36(3)(b).</p>

<a name="90630-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09063062000089"></a>The intention is to make rules enabling the names of UK Special Forces personnel who have died to be withheld. This will allow them and their families to retain their anonymity and it repays the duty of confidentiality imposed on UK Special Forces personnel during their period of service. This measure has been introduced as a result of approaches from representatives of UK Special Forces personnel and their families,  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_126"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>including bereaved family members. This power might also be used to enable a name to be withheld in circumstances when a bereaved family or a witness&#146;s safety would be jeopardised if their identity were made public.</p>

<a name="90630-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09063062000090"></a>I understand that taken together, Amendments 134A and 136A would mean that a coroner could disclose the deceased&#146;s name not only to persons specified in the direction but to a bereaved family. I believe that that is unnecessary as the bereaved family would know the identity of the deceased member of the UK Special Forces. In other cases, it may not be appropriate for the bereaved family to know the identity of a person subject to a coroner&#146;s direction, for example, if the person was a witness who was in fear of their own or their family&#146;s safety. If it was appropriate for the bereaved family to know the identity of such a witness, the coroner could specify them as persons to whom the identity should be disclosed.</p>

<a name="90630-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09063062000091"></a>Amendment 137A would remove Clause 36(3)(a), which largely replicates the existing provisions in rule 17 of the coroners rules. It enables a coroner to hold all or part of an inquest in camera if the coroner is of the opinion that it is necessary to do so in the interests of national security. That may be necessary, for example, for an inquest that needs to cover sensitive military operations. I understand that there may be some concerns that in cases where the deceased person is a member of the Armed Forces, this could lead to members of the deceased person&#146;s family and their personal representatives being excluded from attending part of the inquest. It is a concern that I fully understand, but I know that on those rare occasions when the provision has been used by coroners in respect of military operations, most families understand why they have been excluded. I believe that this is another area where the Chief Coroner may consider issuing guidance to coroners. Such guidance could outline in what circumstances the coroner may consider whether to hold part of an inquest in camera in the interests of national security.</p>

<a name="90630-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09063062000092"></a>When it is necessary to exclude bereaved family members and their personal representatives, as well as the wider public, guidance might also deal with the need to explain the reasons for the decision. Again, I hope that that will put the mind of the noble Baroness at rest that the power in Clause 36(3)(a) will be used proportionately.</p>

<a name="90630-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09063062000093"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, would prevent the coroner excluding specific people from an inquest where a young person was giving evidence and the coroner believed that the exclusion would improve the quality of the evidence. I accept, of course, that in most circumstances an inquest should be open to the public, but I can envisage situations when a young person might be traumatised by having to give evidence publicly at an inquest. This measure is about ensuring both the quality of evidence and protecting vulnerable young witnesses.</p>

<a name="90630-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09063062000094"></a>It is intended that rules will be made under Clause 36(3)(b) requiring the senior coroner who is considering whether to issue such a direction to consider the views expressed by the witness, a parent of the witness and all the circumstances of the case. Provision will also be made in the rules made under the clause,

<a name="90630-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09063062000095"></a>In addition, provision will be made so that any direction providing for a representative of the press to be excluded from an inquest must be expressed so as not to apply to one named person who is a representative of the press who has been nominated for the purpose by one or more news gathering or reporting organisations. Accordingly, the reports of the proceedings will be able to be published in the usual way, and interested parties will not be excluded. Provision is made in criminal legislation enabling the court to exclude persons from a hearing in which a person under 18 is giving evidence. We will write to the noble Lord to let him know the relevant legislation and how it fits.</p>

As I understand it, the clause expands slightly the list of interested persons as laid out in Rule 22 of the Coroners Rules 1984 and empowers the coroner to determine that any other person is an interested person.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09063062000100"></a>There have been a significant number of contentious deaths in detention where the deceased had no family, or no interested family, and as such their interests were underrepresented at the inquest. The experience in these cases is that there is a danger of the inquest becoming a mere rubber-stamping of the official version of events. In the absence of legal representation on behalf of the family, it is unusual for a coroner to ask the kind of searching questions that arise when there is representation. It is felt that some custodial deaths and other controversial deaths have not been as well scrutinised as they should have been because the family did not have the information or resources to be legally represented. When the deceased has no family interested in participating in an inquest it is tantamount to the deceased having no family at all. I would therefore appreciate the Minister&#146;s clarification of the clause.</p>

It is not just a question of deaths in detention in prisons; there are also many circumstances where people are detained under mental health legislation. These people are often without family, or their family has let them be and wants nothing to do with them. They are precisely the kind of people who get in trouble with medication properly prescribed, or with drugs, alcohol or other things, and their management is a significant problem. One might find with people of this kind&#151;and there is a substantial number of them&#151;that the official version, as the noble Baroness has described it, is simply biased. It should be possible for the coroner to recognise other interested persons. So this is simply an opportunity for the Minister to say on record that when coroners are giving consideration to these matters, they should be prepared to consider including appropriate bodies&#151;non-governmental organisations, charities and others&#151;which have an interest in people who are otherwise neglected.</p>

I think that all of us have met with situations where people have died without loved ones and with no one else to represent them. One thinks of the parallel of the amicus curiae who can intervene and represent people in court when someone, for instance, is in a persistent vegetative state or when their long-term care is being considered. I signed this amendment because I had read recently in the newspaper of a case where someone had been found dead in their council flat. They had been left there for literally weeks on end undiscovered and had no relatives or friends. That seems precisely the kind of case that the coroner ought to be probing to discover where the culpability lay for the neglect of someone who was literally allowed to die unbefriended and uncared for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09063062000103"></a>Many of us in the Chamber represented constituencies when we were in another place and, sadly, one did occasionally find that there are people living in a state of almost toxic loneliness. I think that it will be the great curse of the 21st century. It is estimated that some 1 million elderly people do not see a friend, neighbour or relative during the course of an average week. I think that this is an issue that we will have to contend with in the future. It would be good if the national coroner had the right to admit an organisation, such as Help the Aged, or an interest group that has been campaigning in some respect about some of these questions, in order to appear on behalf of the person whose case is being considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09063062000105"></a>Our view is that it is not necessary to set out additional classes of person who might be interested for the purposes of a coroner&#146;s investigation, because we have included in Clause 38(2)(n) a discretion for the coroner to be able to designate a person as interested if they have sufficient interest in the matter. It is possible that a coroner may exercise his or her discretion in cases where, for whatever reason, there is no other friend or family member of the person who has died who has an interest in the investigation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09063062000106"></a>The coroner will of course consider each case on its merits. If the coroner decides that the person or organisation does not have sufficient interest to be designated under Clause 38(2)(n), it will be open to the person or organisation to appeal the decision to the Chief Coroner. I venture to say that that is an important consideration in dealing with this amendment. It should ensure that only those persons with a proper interest in a coroner&#146;s investigation are so designated, with the appeal rights that flow from that. That is all I intend to say on this matter. I hope that it gives the noble Baroness some comfort.</p>

It is completely understandable that there must be discretion in who is named&#151;otherwise you could have a vexatious coroners&#146; court tour by a group that just wanted to agitate rather than being bona fide people interested and concerned about the circumstances of a death.

The Statement is as follows.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09063062000109"></a>&#147;Mr Speaker, over the past 12 years, school standards have risen significantly in our country, and our education system has changed beyond recognition. The number of secondary schools with at least 30 per cent of pupils failing to achieve five good GCSEs, including English and maths, has fallen from over half in 1997 to just one in seven today. We now have over 40,000 more teachers, backed up by over 200,000 more support staff. We now also have 200 national leaders of education,  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_132"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>compared to none in 1997. Our best state schools now match the best schools in the private sector and anywhere in the world; and the reason is that we have rebuilt the school system on a foundation of sustained record investment matched by tough accountability. That is why we can now go further and transform our schools system to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09063062000110"></a>Our country faces an economic imperative, because every young person now needs skills and qualifications to succeed; and a moral imperative, because every child and every young person has potential and can do well with the right help and support. It is to meet these twin imperatives that I am today publishing our <I>21st</I><I>Century Schools </I>White Paper based on: new guarantees for pupils and parents; a significant devolution of power and responsibility to our school leaders, matched by strengthened school accountability; and an uncompromising approach to school improvement, because we want every child to succeed and we will never give up on any child.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09063062000111"></a>We will now legislate for our pupil guarantee to ensure that: all young people get a broad and balanced curriculum and high-quality qualifications, whether their strengths are practical, academic or both; every secondary pupil has a personal tutor; all pupils get five hours of PE and sport every week and access to cultural activities, too; gifted and talented pupils get written confirmation of the extra challenge and support they will receive; and all pupils with additional needs get extra help, with 4,000 extra dyslexia teachers, and all pupils in years 3 to 6 falling behind in English or maths get one-to-one tuition to help them get back on track. We will now extend the offer of one-to-one or small group tuition to all pupils at the start of secondary school who were behind at the end of primary school. And following the report of the expert group on assessment, we will now introduce a new progress check at the end of year 7 so that parents can be confident that their children have made up the lost ground.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09063062000112"></a>Our new parents guarantee will ensure regular online information about their child&#146;s progress, behaviour and attendance, access to their child&#146;s personal tutor, and fair school admissions in line with the admissions code. Parents&#146; views will be listened to and reported on a school report card so that parents know what other parents think when choosing a school. Where parents are unhappy with the choice of schools on offer to them, based on an annual survey of parents, local authorities will have to listen and respond to their concerns. And because all parents want their children to learn at an orderly school where they are safe from bullying and lessons are not disrupted by bad behaviour, we will now legislate to strengthen home-school agreements so that all pupils and parents will accept the school&#146;s rules when they apply for a school place and be expected to sign up to renew their commitment every year. Schools will have stronger powers to enforce discipline through intensive support, parenting contracts and parenting orders, and parents will have the right to complain and expect action if schools fail to act to enforce the home-school agreement.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_133"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>now&#151;we will devolve power and funding to school leaders to decide, with ring-fenced funding, what support they need to further drive up standards. We will ensure that schools can get the support they need from other services through children&#146;s trust boards and encourage multi-agency teams based in schools. The new chair of our independent bureaucracy watchdog will review any unnecessary obstacles which get in the way of delivery. And building on the success of our National Leaders in Education and academies programmes, we will now act so that our best head teachers can run more than one school, with better pay for executive heads. We will accredit high performing schools, colleges and universities to run chains of schools in not-for-profit accredited schools groups, with the first providers up and running by January. Already nine schools, one multi-academy sponsor, four colleges and four universities, including Nottingham University, have come forward, and I am today setting aside funds over the next two years to support their growth.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09063062000114"></a>We will match this transformation in school leadership with a transformation in school accountability. School league tables are easy to read, but because they present a narrow view of performance based solely on the attainment of the average pupil, they cannot provide the full picture parents need. Our new school report card will include full information on school attainment, but go well beyond it. It will set out clearly for parents how the school is improving standards, how well it is helping those pupils who have fallen behind to catch up, and stretching the most able. It will report on discipline, attendance, sport, healthy eating and partnership working. And it will set out what parents and pupils think of the school.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09063062000115"></a>We will begin pilots of our new school report card this September. But while we will consult further, I am now convinced that if parents, newspapers and websites are to make fair, clear and easy-to-understand comparisons between schools, our school report card will need to include a single, overall grade.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09063062000116"></a>Because a world-class schools system needs a world-class workforce, we are making teaching a masters-level profession. We will now introduce a new &#145;licence to teach&#146;, similar to that used by other high-status professionals, such as doctors and lawyers. Teachers will need to keep their practice up-to-date to renew their license, and they will be given a new entitlement for continued professional development. We will start with newly qualified teachers, beginning their training this September; those returning to teaching, from September 2010; and all supply teachers shortly afterwards. We will make governing bodies slimmer and more highly skilled and will require all chairs to undergo specific training.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09063062000117"></a>The primary responsibility for school improvement lies with head teachers and governing bodies. But where progress is too slow and performance does not improve, local authorities have a responsibility to act. Since we set out our National Challenge and our Coasting Schools Challenge, local authorities have drawn up improvement plans and we have announced 55 new academies and 27 National Challenge trusts. Today I am giving the go-ahead to two new academies, in Halton and in Redcar and Cleveland, and confirming  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_134"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>funding agreements for two further academies, in Nottingham and in Herefordshire, all replacing National Challenge schools.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09063062000118"></a>Some argue that where underperformance is entrenched, locally-led change is not working and excuses are being made, the right approach is to stand back, let schools wither and slowly decline, and to allow the children and young people in those schools to pay the price. I disagree. We have a responsibility in government to step in and demand improvement. I will not shirk that responsibility.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09063062000119"></a>Following Ofsted&#146;s December 2008 assessment of Milton Keynes, which found children&#146;s services to be inadequate, with serious weaknesses in secondary school attainment and improvement, we commissioned an independent performance review. Despite some progress, the review concluded that urgent improvement is still required. The Children&#146;s Minister has today written to the council directing it under Section 497A of the Education Act 1996 immediately to appoint Mr Peter Kemp to chair an independent improvement board that will report directly to Ministers, and to submit and agree an improvement plan.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09063062000120"></a>The Schools Minister and I are concerned about the rate of progress in Leicester, where we issued an improvement notice last June. So today I am asking Sir Mike Tomlinson, chair of our National Challenge expert advisers, to provide us with a progress report in September. And, on the basis of his report and this summer&#146;s results, we will consider whether further action is needed.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09063062000121"></a>I am also asking our expert advisers to work with Blackpool and Gloucestershire&#151;areas that need to make more progress&#151;to identify what more needs to be done to deliver National Challenge and report back to me on progress in September.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09063062000122"></a>If this year&#146;s exam results reveal serious weaknesses in these areas, or any area in the country, I will do whatever it takes to secure the progress of children and young people.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09063062000123"></a>In this White Paper, we match continued investment with reform and higher expectations so that we meet the economic imperative by ensuring every young person gets the qualifications they need; and we meet our moral imperative by ensuring that every child can succeed, whatever barriers they face. And I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

However, it was a Statement, as one expected, of old, rehashed ideas and the Government&#146;s admittance that they have failed to get to grips with some of the serious concerns that are giving parents and teachers alike great anxiety. With this White Paper, the Government had a great opportunity to transform our approach to the education of children in this country. What the Secretary of State has in fact shown is a failure to address why so many of our young children are not reaching minimum requirements in reading, writing and numeracy from primary school age straight through to secondary education.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_135"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09063064000002"></a>We have seen a frightening rise in the numbers of young people not in employment, education or training. We have seen a rise in truancy and in the numbers of children repeatedly suspended from schools. The Government seem to have tacitly accepted this by ditching their national strategy for numeracy and literacy after years of lauding its success.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09063064000003"></a>Many of today&#146;s parents are the product of a childhood under a Government who have taken more and more responsibility away from them and handed it to the state, while failing to make available effective educational provision. The Government cannot release themselves from being the architect of the failure of so many children to thrive and reach their full potential at school.</p>

<a name="90630-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09063064000004"></a>This programme proposes to strengthen the responsibilities of parents to their children&#146;s behaviour. If parents fail to comply, they will be prosecuted and fined up to &#163;1,000. We all agree that parents have a key role to play in the support they give their children and schools in tackling poor behaviour, but surely we need to see what can be done to help parents carry out those expectations rather than criminalise them. We know that often the most disruptive children come from disruptive backgrounds. Do the Government really think that criminalisation of inadequate parenting skills is the way forward?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90630-0005.htm"/>


<a name="90630-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09063064000005"></a>The Minister said that all primary school children will have an entitlement to one-to-one tuition and all children in secondary school will have an entitlement to personal tutors. How will this be funded? Where will all these tutors come from? Will they have appropriate training? When will they come into action? Furthermore, it is proposed to have an extra 4,000 teachers for dyslexic children. Where will they come from? What qualifications will they require? Will the process involve special educational needs assessments? How does the Minister propose to fund the proposal set out in the pupil-parent guarantees, as there seem to be huge financial implications? I am sure that the Minister will quote the Secretary of State&#146;s view that &#163;400 million has been freed up due to the let-up of the recession. Can she explain exactly what this means and where this money will come from?</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09063064000006"></a>The abolition of school league tables in favour of an ill defined and uninformative report card system will surely have one big loser&#151;the parent. At a time when we need parents to have access to far more detailed information about the schools they are sending their children to, it would be a travesty to offer only a one-page report card that includes, laughably, a rating on how the school teaches children to control their feelings. Can the Minister offer any reassurance to our concerns that with such a paltry selection of very general information&#151;consisting apparently of, among other things, ratings on truancy levels, sporting prowess and attendance at lunch&#151;there seems to be little encouragement for schools to lift their academic standards. Surely just rating schools A to F will leave parents unsure about schools&#146; exact academic achievements.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09063064000007"></a>The Conservative Party has consistently argued for the strengthening of league tables, a process which would require a great deal more data to be made  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_136"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>accessible to parents. As it is, this seems like another of those lost opportunities that we have become used to under this Government.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09063064000008"></a>A second and more serious point that I hope the Minister can clarify is what the actual function of the grades will be. If they are for parent information, they are remarkably uninformative. If, like under the New York system, they are to be used to justify sanctions and benefits for bad and good schools, it is important for the Minister to inform the House of what these might look like. It would be useful to know whether the system will be a means for state control of school behaviour or of giving information to parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09063064000009"></a>It would seem that the Government have not grown tired of watering down and rehashing the ideas of the Opposition. School chains are part of what Ed Balls calls an,</p>
<ul><a name="09063064000068"></a>&#147;uncompromising approach to school improvement&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09063064000062"></a>Apparently they will engineer a situation whereby high-performing schools and education providers will take over less successful neighbours to create chains of successful schools.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09063064000010"></a>Surely this is nothing more than a watered down version of Conservative Party policy for opening the market to new providers. The Secretary of State called this White Paper radical during an interview on Radio 4. Will the Minister explain what is radical about taking a policy that the Opposition have developed, removing all its innovative aspects and then passing it off as new and revolutionary?</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09063064000011"></a>The Minister will say that raising to &#163;200,000 the salaries of head teachers who take on these chains of schools will be an incentive. However, it seems unlikely that it will provide the answer to the problem of the energy that head teachers put into running successful schools being taken away by working with poorly performing schools without the necessary support mechanisms. Will the Minister assure us that these super heads will have available the support mechanisms to ensure not only that their successful school will be managed properly but also that the new schools that they take on will be properly facilitated.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09063064000012"></a>This is a missed opportunity from a Government who have run out of steam. The proposals bring nothing but more bureaucracy, tinkering and meddling. The Government&#146;s own report card would state &#147;grade F&#148;. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09063064000015"></a>While the Government have put much needed resources into the schools system, there remains their gross failure during their 10 years to reform the secondary school curriculum. One reason why around 50 per cent of young people do not gain grades A to C is

The Government&#146;s failure to pick up and implement the Tomlinson report in 2004 means that they are left with a continuing process of relative failure in secondary schools.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09063064000016"></a>The Statement echoes elements of the White Paper, <I>Your </I><I>C</I><I>hild, </I><I>Y</I><I>our </I><I>S</I><I>chools, </I><I>O</I><I>ur </I><I>F</I><I>uture: </I><I>B</I><I>uilding a 21st </I><I>C</I><I>entury </I><I>S</I><I>chools </I><I>S</I><I>ystem. </I>As with so many of the White Papers that we see these days, it is a re-announcement of a lot of initiatives which have existed previously. Among them are a number of initiatives that we would applaud. The one aspect of it that seems so unreal in the present circumstances is where the money will come from. In spite of Speaker Bercow&#146;s announcement last week that new ideas were to be announced first in Parliament, we had a good preview of this White Paper on this morning&#146;s &#147;Today&#148; programme. The Secretary of State indicated that he had found &#163;400 million in his budget to fund these initiatives for 2009-10 and 2010-11. This may be so, but where is the money coming from in future? We know that many cutbacks are still to be made.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09063064000017"></a>Among those elements of the White Paper that we on these Benches would applaud is one-to-one tuition for years three to six and, if the young people still need it, in the early years of secondary school. We have long argued that more money should be spent on those pupils who come from a disadvantaged background than on other pupils&#151;we call it our pupil premium. We are glad that the Government have at long last accepted that this is so. Again, it is an initiative which, had they only put it into practice 10 years ago, might have led to very different results from our primary schools and fewer young people in the category of not in employment, education or training.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09063064000018"></a>We also support to a certain extent the New York-style report cards on schools. There is no doubt that league tables are a crude way of measuring a school&#146;s performance, particularly those that are based largely on the crude examination score. Attempts to create value added measures of school performance have not been very successful.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09063064000019"></a>As the Government are considering a broader report card to measure schools, why when they look at local authorities are they going back to the league-table mentality and crude exam results? The White Paper refers to authorities that have been in difficulties and says,</p>
<ul><a name="09063064000069"></a>&#147;if this year&#146;s exam results reveal serious weaknesses in these areas, or any area of the country, I will do whatever it takes to secure the progress of children and young people&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09063064000020"></a>Again, it is back to using exam results to measure performance.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09063064000021"></a>One of our reservations about the Government&#146;s proposals is that, like the Opposition, we do not fully understand what the guarantee means. Does criminality for parents mean that parents will be fined? Does it mean a criminal offence? ASBOs have proved to be unsatisfactory. I do not think ASBOs for parents will prove to be any better. Who is sued if the guarantee is not met? Is it the governors who are sued? Is it the local education authority or is it the Department for   


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_138"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Children, Schools and Families who will be sued if the guarantee is not met? If it is the governors, the Government will find it increasingly difficult to find people to volunteer to be governors. The responsibility you take on as a governor is already formidable and if you are likely to be sued if the school does not deliver it could be even more so.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09063064000022"></a>On federations, on these Benches we have long argued that the right way to approach education is co-operation not competition. As the Minister knows, we had a lot of reservations about the schools policy which set one school against another and we continue to have those reservations about the academies programme because it puts them outside the community. In our view, schools are there to serve a community and need to co-operate with one another. We like the idea of a federation but we have grave reservations about sharing heads. As everyone knows, a good school is where you have a good head and a good leadership team and it is not easy to share those with other schools. If a head&#146;s attention is divided between two schools, it does not always work.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09063064000023"></a>Neither do we want to see shared boards of governors. There was a time when many schools were run with shared boards of governors or schools managers, as they were then called. The concept of a board of governors is to be a link between the community and the school. It is not a good idea to have shared boards of governors between a lot of schools. Federations in terms of co-operation between schools&#151;yes; federations in terms of having lots of schools with one head or one leadership team or one board of governors&#151;no, that is not what we want to see.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09063064000024"></a>We do not understand why the Government are proposing to slim down boards of governors. They have slimmed them down a lot and boards of governors work quite effectively now. There does not seem to me to be any room for slimming them down more. Given the responsibilities they are putting on boards of governors&#151;the fact that you have to have a governor who represents special educational needs, a governor for children in care, a governor for health and safety&#151;it is difficult to see why you would want fewer governors. Governors are an important link between the community and the school.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09063064000025"></a>Can the Minister tell us more about the Government&#146;s proposals for teachers, including the requirement for a Master&#146;s qualification and licence to practise? Are they proposing that no one can teach until they have a Master&#146;s degree? If they want teachers to have a Master&#146;s degree, I would hope it would become part of the CPD training and that teachers would not only get time off in order to acquire these extra qualifications but could do so in bite-size chunks. In that way they could gradually build up those qualifications and be recompensed for having done so and for having given up their own time for doing it.</p>

In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, I recommend that she takes time to look at the White Paper, because I think that she will find that, rather than being a recycling of Conservative Party proposals, it is a recognition that, since 1997, following the  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_139"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>significant investment in school infrastructure, teaching and support staff and every aspect of education delivery, we are now at the stage where the system is maturing and we can increase the level of trust and confidence that we have in our schools. Rather than, as the noble Baroness suggests, increasing bureaucracy, we are aiming not to abolish the national challenge but to allow schools, by devolving resources to them, to procure improvement resources themselves. We are building on the success of initiatives such as the national challenge.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09063064000027"></a>When the noble Baroness talks about the report card, she should note that parents are looking for a much richer and broader set of data on schools, including more information on discipline and how bullying is managed. Yes, academic qualifications are extremely important to parents, but it is also important for parents to know how well school well-being and discipline is being delivered. She asked about superheads, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. It is absolutely vital that we make the most of the incredible leadership skills and the management and educational expertise of some of the wonderful heads that we have in this country. By allowing them to broaden their impact and work with other schools, we are making the most of them. Of course, it is absolutely vital that they have the right support to do that.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09063064000028"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the report card. It is extremely important that the pilot that we are beginning drills down into what is effective for parents and communities. We shall work hard to interpret the outcomes of these pilots to ensure that the new report card captures all the information presently available through the system and adds the kind of richness that we know that parents look for.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09063064000029"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the percentage of young people who are NEET. It is extremely disappointing that in 1997 we had 76.8 per cent of young people NEET and that we now have 79.7 per cent of them who are NEET. However, you have to look at that in the context of our strategy for raising participation. We know that through hard work and investment we will be able to encourage young people to become further involved in education and training.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09063064000030"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, asked about one-to-one tuition and funding for tutors. Of course, the money for one-to-one tuition is part of our spending review settlement and has already been announced; so the money is there. All the tutors that we are talking about recruiting&#151;and this is an area that is very important to parents&#151;will be qualified teachers. The noble Baroness generously welcomed much in the White Paper and I encourage her to look at it further. She talked about the importance of co-operation between schools; there is a great deal in the White Paper about the value of schools working in partnership, which is very much at the heart of what we trying to achieve. We have a system in which it is time to recognise the economic challenges; we do not want to leave a single child to fall through the net, but we know that schools cannot do it on their own, and it is vital that they work together. Therefore, we have created this duty on schools, and it is important that we build on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09063064000031"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, asked about the guarantee and the legal recourse. Surely, the first step would be for a parent to talk to the head teacher at school, and then, if the parent is not satisfied, to make a complaint to the local government ombudsman. As a last resort, there is always judicial review&#151;but that is very much an end process. We want to avoid that through much more meaningful relationship between parents and schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09063064000032"></a>Time presses, but I would encourage noble Lords to look at the detail of the White Paper. There is much in there that Members of this House will find interesting and encouraging.</p>

I welcome very much the Statement read by the noble Baroness. I should like to press the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, about governing bodies. My own experience is that it is very difficult to recruit governors, especially from the community. With her express proposal to slim down these governing bodies, how does the Minister propose that we recruit the governors that are needed for the curriculum sub-committee, the discipline sub-committee, the appeals sub-committee, the <I>Every Child Matters</I> sub-committee and the remuneration sub-committee? These committees require a lot of work. One of the things that the Government should be addressing is the creation of incentives to encourage people from the community to come forward for what is an ever more onerous responsibility serving as a member of a governing body.</p>

I appreciate that the volume of work involved can be very great. What is really important about a governing body is that it has the right skills in order to do the right job. Of course we will make sure that we have the adequate number to do the work. However, I know from my own experience that when you have working groups it is sometimes extremely helpful to bring in expertise from other community groups. You do not necessarily have to be a governor to be involved in supporting a school in your community. I hear what the right reverend Prelate says; we need to ensure that the size is right and that governing bodies can function appropriately.</p>

Most particularly, I welcome the thrust to decentralise the control over education and to give more control to the professionals in the system, to teachers and to schools. We and the Liberal Democrats have shared that aspiration for some considerable time.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_141"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09063064000037"></a>I have two questions to ask the Minister. First, I ask about the one-to-one teaching. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, asked where the money and the people were coming from. I think that the Minister replied about the money but not about the people. If these are all to be qualified teachers, where will the necessary supply of people, who are expert enough to work with children who are failing in the way she has described, come from? There are many classes and many schools where it is not the odd one child who needs special help, but where 20 children in a class need one-to-one special help. I wonder where this recruitment for so many people will come from.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09063064000038"></a>My second question is much broader. Where will the thrust for independence for schools be reflected, particularly in relation to this mistaken policy of giving every school a grade? The idea of the report card is sound, because, as the Minister has rightly said, parents want a wide range of information about schools. They want to know whether a school is right for their child; is it the right sort of feel, does it have the right sort of atmosphere and values? That is certainly important, but to give a school a grade seems such a retrograde step. Parents will not want to send their child to &#147;D&#148; school. It will simply increase the competition for the &#147;A&#148; schools, and make it harder and harder for schools struggling on examinations. Can the Minister explain where the grading will come from, and what sort of factors will be taken into account?</p>

<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="09063064000039"></a><b><a name="90630-0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09063064000079"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> My Lords, first, the recruitment for the one-to-one tutors has already begun. As I understand it, interest is encouraging. I agree with the noble Baroness that it is extremely important that we get the right people. Many children will benefit from this. We know from evidence that even short courses of one-to-one tuition can help children catch up very quickly, which we are keen to enact as quickly as possible. Many teachers would find this attractive. I am encouraged by the initial feedback.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09063064000040"></a>The report card is not a simple matter. In my opinion, as parents we want to see that rich, broad information. For schools, however, it is not always helpful. If that information is put in the public domain, somebody will always put it into a league table for you. There is merit in having a clearly evidenced procedure or process that has come out of real piloting in real schools, which will allow the process of creating a grade to be fair, transparent and widely tested.</p>

<a name="90630-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09063064000041"></a>The noble Baroness is right in that no parent wants their child to go to a D-grade school, but we want every school to be an A-grade school. We must have a fair and open process that can allow us to achieve that. We do not want a single child to be left behind.</p>

<p><a name="st_106"></a>

Why not make certain that they can read before they move out of the entry level? If they cannot, they cannot keep up with what happens afterwards. Then you get all the problems of being unable to keep up: they are bored, they leave and they truant. Time after time you hear reports of teachers, observers and everyone recommending this. We have Statement after Statement, but still that basic requirement seems to be denied. Can the Minister explain why?</p>

Of course, that means ensuring that they can read before they leave primary school. It is intolerable for us if only one child moves on to secondary school without functional skills. That is why we have invested not only in ensuring that we drive up standards for all schools and making sure that we are initiating the catch-up one-to-one tuition at the beginning of secondary school, where children have fallen below level 4. As the noble Lord is aware, we have also invested in training in functional skills for adults. We are not just tackling children who need to have those basic literacy skills but also adults.</p>

I echo the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, about school league tables focusing on a single grade. Some of our most praiseworthy schools operate in areas where the catchments are disadvantaged. However hard the schools work, their children will never pass exams, which is the main criterion for achieving in these schools. That would be a major concern both on our Benches and on the Conservative Benches. Has an estimate been made of the amount of additional bureaucracy that those measures will impose both on schools and on individual teachers, who will have to carry out a great deal more form-filling, writing and reporting rather than being in front of young people and teaching them?</p>

This is something that the pilots will be looking at. It is essential that the report card, which has that rich, fuller set of information about a school, takes into account the community and the circumstances in which a school is functioning. That means fully representing the value-added&#151;an awful phrase&#151;that a school provides. It is precisely because the oversimplistic focus on exam results does not satisfy what parents are looking for that we are reaching for something that has much more to say about the broad work that schools do promoting well being for young people, ensuring a calm and orderly environment, that bullying is tackled and that children have the opportunity to benefit from good quality teaching by the provision of a sound learning environment. There is no benefit for anyone if our commitment to devolving more to schools results in schools taking on more bureaucracy. That is not what our Secretary of State is trying to achieve. He is firm on that matter.</p>

<a name="09063076000001"></a><b><a name="90630-0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09063076000023"></a>Lord Carlile of Berriew:</b> The amendment stands in the name of my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford. I hope that the Committee will grant me the indulgence of allowing me to be his, albeit inadequate, substitute. Rumour has it that my noble friend is in South Africa trying to persuade lions to roar three or four points louder than in the past couple of weeks. When I was a foal in a barrister&#146;s stable in which my senior colleagues were, as they now are, my noble friends Lord Thomas of Gresford and Lord Hooson, I was taught that if someone else gives one a good point on a plate, one should move fast and make it one&#146;s own. That is what I seek to do in moving this probing amendment.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09063076000002"></a>The background to the amendment lies in the successive pusillanimity of Governments of every possible persuasion. I hearken back to the old Criminal Law Revision Committee, which I suspect was possibly in place before anyone in this House was practising at the Bar. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, has just made a signal confession, so he will remember it well&#151;I tempted him. For a couple of generations and more, Governments have not had the courage to remove the mandatory life sentence. We are now going to embark on a series of debates on Part 2 of the Bill concerning complications of the law designed to avoid removing the mandatory life sentence, but these are an obstacle course set up against the merits of something that could be much simpler. I say to the Government at the outset that it is high time that we no longer had the mandatory life sentence and that we had something along the lines of this probing amendment&#151;I had hoped that we would receive it from the Government who, to their credit, introduced the Human Rights Act&#151;which is founded on the Law Commission&#146;s report entitled <I>Murder, Manslaughter and Infanticide</I> of 28 November 2006.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09063076000003"></a>I fear that the failure to remove the life sentence is either a lesson learnt from, or possibly a denial of, the old Burkean adage that a parliamentarian should be a pillar of what is right and not merely a weathercock of public opinion, although I am unsure as to what public opinion really now is on the mandatory life sentence. I think that if we were to ask the public a  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_144"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>series of intelligent and intelligible questions about the mandatory life sentence, we might find that they took a different view from some of the popular papers. My real fear is that the Government may have gone below the superficiality which is usually exercised by Governments and discovered what happened to Burke when he said that in a celebrated by-election in the West Country, which history reveals he unfortunately lost.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09063076000004"></a>This probing amendment provides that a person shall be guilty of murder if they intended to cause serious injury to another person and were aware that their actions could result in the death of another person. Proposed new subsection (2) provides that a person shall be convicted of manslaughter if he was unaware that there was a serious risk that his actions could result in the death of another person. This is very close to the Law Commission&#146;s recommendation in 2006. It recommended the adoption of a three-tier structure of general homicide offences to replace the current two-tier structure of murder and manslaughter.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09063076000005"></a>There was considerable debate on the consultation paper issued by the Law Commission prior to its full recommendations, and there was a great deal of support for its proposal from, for example, the resident judges of the Central Criminal Court. It is worth emphasising that the daily, although not exclusive, diet of Central Criminal Court judges, High Court judges and senior circuit judges&#151;every man and woman among them&#151;is murder cases. They try more murder cases than possibly all the other courts in the country added together. The proposal also had the support of the criminal sub-committee of the Council of Her Majesty&#146;s Circuit Judges, importantly Victims&#146; Voice, JUSTICE, the Crown Prosecution Service, which saw the proposal as entirely practicable, the Criminal Bar Association, the Law Society and even those radicals, the criminal law teachers at the LSE.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09063076000006"></a>There were groups opposed to the provisional proposal&#151;among them, the Higher Court Judges&#146; Homicide Working Party, which thought that the restriction in the consultation paper of the Law Commission made the definition of first degree murder too narrow, and that objection is reflected in the amendment. The Higher Court Judges&#146; Homicide Working Party thought that first degree murder should be extended beyond cases of intentional killing to cover homicides in which the offender acted on an intention to do serious injury and was recklessly indifferent as to causing death. It was the virtually unanimous view that people should not be convicted of murder, at least without a distinction between first and second degree, if they either did not intend to cause serious injury or were not recklessly indifferent as to causing death.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09063076000007"></a>The present law causes real difficulties. Judges are faced with verdicts of juries which have said &#147;guilty&#148; to murder, leaving the judge to decide whether there was an intention to kill or an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. The proposals in the amendment would enable a jury to make the choice by grading the offence at the appropriate level. Judges now have immense experience of sentencing in homicide cases. In reality, we have a rather artificial sentencing position  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_145"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>now. Judges do not like telling lies forced on them by statute. We now have a situation in which a judge is forced to pass a life sentence because it is mandatory. Having passed the life sentence, the judge then indulges in a completely different exercise in which he or she in effect says, &#147;This is not really a life sentence. I am now going to impose a tariff&#148;. The amendment would bring the law into a consistent position with practice and would also bring the public, in the form of juries, into the decision-making process by which the jury would qualify the act complained of and committed by the defendant.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09063076000008"></a>It is therefore my suggestion that this kind of improvement of the law would make a significant step forward. It would mean that those who watch homicide trials&#151;particularly the media, since they are inclined to be so critical of what happens in court&#151;would see that homicide cases were being dealt with in a realistic, common-sense and logical way. There would no longer be a large gap in the degree of culpability involved, as between the alternative fault elements in the current offence of murder. I was also taught in that stable that one of the virtues of cogency is brevity; so I beg to move.</p>

I was, indeed, a member of the Law Revision Committee all those years ago under the chairmanship of a judge of the Court of Appeal, whose name I cannot now remember, unfortunately. I briefly served as chairman of the Law Revision Committee, but as soon as I became chairman, the committee never sat again.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09063076000010"></a>The noble Lord has done a good service by moving this amendment, because it shows how strange it is that we should be considering the partial defences to a charge of murder before we have determined what murder is or should be. It is all the stranger since the Government consulted the Law Commission as long ago as 2002 on the question of partial defences, received a report in 2004, and have done nothing about it since, until today. Why now?</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09063076000011"></a>In his letter of 18 May, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, was kind enough to say that there were a number of stakeholders, among whom I would include myself, although I can never quite imagine myself as a stakeholder. I am not sure what my stake would look like. He concedes that there are a number who would prefer the Government to look at the current Law Commission proposals as a whole, and not in parts. I say amen to that. The Minister said that a number of other stakeholders took a different view. I cannot help wondering who those other stakeholders are and, more importantly, what their reasons are. Perhaps we might be told.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09063076000012"></a>Perhaps we can also be told the real reasons why the Government have still done nothing about the first  64 pages of the current Law Commission report, published in 2006, which set out its proposals for the new structure. It is the structure that we should be talking about today, not the partial defences. The Government have done nothing about the structure in the past two and a half years. Is the real reason simply that they cannot make up their minds? They say that they want to proceed step by step. That is all very well,  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_146"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provided that you take the steps in the right order. Here, they are taking step 2 before step 1, which usually ends in disaster.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09063076000013"></a>Having said that, I shall now turn to the amendment. I was not sure whether the noble Lord was confining himself to the terms of this amendment, or anticipating the terms of mine. I admire the drafter of the amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, for his courage in defining the law of murder in two short paragraphs. However, I cannot support his amendment, for the following reasons. Subsection (1) of the proposed new clause corresponds to the Law Commission&#146;s definition of first degree murder, except that it leaves out the defendant who intends to kill. Intentional killers are surely the most serious of all. They should be expressly included in any definition, and certainly not left to be inferred. Subsection (2) is also unsatisfactory as it would exclude from murder the most common case in practice&#151;the defendant who intends to cause serious injury or harm, but who is unaware that he might be likely to cause death. It would also exclude the defendant who intends to cause some harm but not serious harm, but who is aware that his act might cause death.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09063076000014"></a>They should be included in any definition of murder, as recommended by the Law Commission. They are too serious to be treated as manslaughter. At any rate, they should not be excluded from murder, as the amendment proposes, without very prolonged consideration which we cannot give it now. With great respect, I hope that the noble Lord will not press his noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

We are, in effect, being asked to consider the partial defences in a vacuum. Until we know what they will be measured against&#151;what the Government will say about the component parts of the crime of murder&#151;we are not in a position to reach any conclusions about the merits of the measures that are contained in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09063076000016"></a>On the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, so ably presented this afternoon by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, I respectfully share the concerns expressed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, on the absence of intention to kill in the definition of the offence. Without that, the amendment is plainly incomplete. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, will consider the matter between now and Report.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09063084000003"></a>I was a perennial optimist and had hoped that the Government would have the courage to make progress. I regret very much that the Executive appear so set against what would be by far the most sensible and important reform&#151;the abolition of the mandatory life sentence. That militates against achieving &#147;individualised justice&#148;, both generally and specifically in relation to mental health and many other factors relevant to proper sentencing. It is sad that the Government have failed to accept the Law Commission&#146;s recommendations this time round. Those do not go as far as we would like, but a variant would at least devolve from the Executive to the judiciary sentencing powers for a large percentage of cases. That of course is the sticking point: the power that the mandatory sentence gives to the Executive. It seems that that is just too much to be readily given up.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09063084000004"></a>As I am not a lawyer, perhaps I may be permitted to offer some praise for the judiciary in the matter of appropriate sentencing. We have a system of checks and balances on sentencing that I do not believe require this executive control. We also have an excellent parole board system that enables the date of release to be reviewed at an appropriate time. After all, people are going to be released. I find it extraordinary that the Secretary of State would wish to retain the decision-making powers in this matter when a whole panoply of executive systems is available to enable the decision to be made by proper experts without political interference. The amendment is an attempt to move away from that in a way that&#151;thinking of debates that the House has had in previous years&#151;many of us would feel sympathetic towards.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09063084000005"></a>I do not want to comment on the specific wording of the amendment, because this may not be the right one. I listened carefully to what was said by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. The wording of this amendment may not achieve what we want to achieve. Nevertheless, a review of the law on homicide is sadly missing from this Bill. We will be spending the rest of this evening debating matters that would be far better addressed at sentencing rather than at the point of verdict. It is a terrible shame that we have got to this point and not been able to address this major issue.</p>

I, too, agree with the analysis of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, about the flaws in the amendment itself. However, I take it very much as it was put by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile&#151;that it is a probing amendment to enable us to have this debate. It was not suggested that these amendments are necessarily correct in form, so I make no point about that at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09063084000007"></a>We would argue very strongly that we should not make the best the enemy of the good.

We made clear at the outset that the provisions of the Bill are the first part of a staged approach. We will be looking at the Law Commission&#146;s other recommendations, especially those on a new structure of homicide comprising new offences of first degree murder, second degree murder and manslaughter, in the light of the effect of the changes to the partial defences proposed in Clauses 42 to 46.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09063084000008"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, said that we should have dealt with the structure first and the partial defences second, but noble Lords who have spoken know as well as I that these provisions have caused real interest and contention over a number of years. Many jurists have scratched their heads, debated, disagreed and made contributions, and it was clear that there was no unanimity of view about whether those proposals were definitively the best that could be devised. The issue is therefore whether we should do nothing or whether we should try to grapple with those things where there seemed to be some consensus and where there is an opportunity to do a bit of good and to take a step or two further along this road. The Government decided that we should try to deal with some of the issues that have caused difficulty.</p>

I put it baldly: is there time for this Bill and for a Bill to deal with homicide? Everyone in this Committee who has grappled with this issue would acknowledge that dealing with homicide as a whole would take some considerable time and a great deal of care because we would have to get it absolutely right. Therefore, there is a question about how much can be undertaken. I cannot give the noble Lord the precise timing because I am in the happy position of not being one of the usual channels, not setting the parliamentary timetable and not being able to say when that should happen. However, it has been clear from the energy and commitment that has been shown not only by the Law Commission but by many others whom we have consulted that this issue has remained firmly on our agenda. It has never been taken off the boil or neglected. We have continued to discuss it, debate it, hone it and define it to try to make things better. I agree with those who say that the present law presents real difficulties and that we need to look at those things that we can change. That is what we are seeking to do in moving the agenda forward in relation to the partial defences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09063084000011"></a>I have to say to noble Lords that there was a great deal of support for changing the way in which we deal with partial defences. There was therefore a realistic assessment that we could do some good work in that area, and perhaps only in that area, in trying to make a difference. That is what we now propose to do. It is critical that we get this area of law right. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, referred to what the weathercock of public opinion would say in relation to mandatory life sentences. I know that some people may not wish

However, I have had the great privilege of speaking to many victims who have suffered a loss in their families as a result of murder and manslaughter. I must tell noble Lords that it is a matter of great importance to them that there is a mandatory life sentence. It is something that we must grapple with, because it is their reality that they live with every day. That is something that we must face when we speak to them about why the person who is responsible for killing the person they loved will not get a whole-life tariff and will not stay in prison for the whole of their life, but will be allowed to go free. The weathercock of public opinion is very interesting.</p>

The careful definition of the offence deals with the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Knight&#151;who knows that I respect very much her contributions both in this House and formerly in another place&#151;by emphasising that an offence of murder really is an offence of murder, and that a life sentence, when a judge says, &#147;You will

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09063084000017"></a>How long will we have to wait for all the stages of this approach? I recall&#151;other noble Lords will, too&#151;that in another place, something like 20 years ago, the then home affairs spokesman of the Labour Party in opposition, no less a person than Tony Blair, advocated very strongly the abolition of the mandatory life sentence. But today the noble and learned Baroness is giving us an assurance&#151;a very welcome and genuine assurance&#151;that we are still somewhere along a very long obstacle course with no indication when we shall reach the end and be able to consider the whole of this issue fully.</p>

<a name="90630-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09063084000018"></a>I do not believe that I have heard in this debate any empirical justification for why we do not start with a process that is staged in the way that we have described. I have heard no empirical justification for avoiding clarity of definition of the offence of murder. I have heard no empirical justification for why we do not abolish the mandatory life sentence. However, with the intent to return to the issue in due course, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It seeks to enable a jury to bring in a verdict of murder with the rider that in the jury&#146;s view, there were extenuating circumstances. The effect of that rider would mean that the judge would not be obliged to pass a sentence of life imprisonment, but could pass such other sentence as would be appropriate in the circumstances found by the jury. Perhaps I may start by listing some of the advantages that would flow if the amendment were to find favour with the Committee. I shall then mention the safeguards that have been built into the amendment, and finally, give the reasons for believing that the amendment would work in practice.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_151"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09063084000021"></a>What are the advantages? I shall limit myself to mentioning only four, but I suspect that there are many others; indeed I know that there are others. In the first place and most obviously, it would provide an answer to the case of the mercy killing. The evidence shows very little support among members of the public for imposing a life sentence of imprisonment in the case of the genuine mercy killing. That evidence is set out in the Law Commission report at paragraph 7.47 and is confirmed by the Nathan committee, which reported in 1988. Indeed, many Members of this House served on that committee. The committee members had mercy killing well in mind when they recommended the abolition of the mandatory life sentence.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09063084000022"></a>Perhaps I may say a brief word about the mandatory sentence. I remain firmly of the view that it ought to be abolished because it is the one single factor that makes coherent reform of the law so difficult. But I accept that, as things are for the moment, its abolition is not a practical possibility, if only because it is opposed by both of the main political parties. They oppose it for reasons that I regard as specious, but nevertheless, there it is. So we must find a solution other than the abolition of the mandatory sentence to deal with the practical problems that arise.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09063084000023"></a>I now turn from the Nathan report to the Law Commission report. The commission was hamstrung by the obligation imposed on it by the Government to regard the mandatory sentence as continuing. That did not make its task any easier. But at paragraph 7.48, the commission did express the view that a life sentence is &#147;neither necessary nor appropriate&#148; when dealing with the genuine mercy killer. Regrettably, however, it made no final recommendation on that point, because&#151;regrettably again&#151;it had failed to carry out any public consultation on that particular question. It gives that explanation in paragraph 7.30 of its report.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09063084000024"></a>However, the absence of that public consultation need not matter, because I do not myself believe, and I doubt whether any Member of this House present today believes, that there could be any doubt as to the views of the public on imposing a life sentence on a genuine mercy killer when the judge goes on in the same breath to say that he may serve no more than two or three years at the most. That makes a mockery of the law.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09063084000025"></a>If it be said that the life sentence is necessary for the protection of the public in such a case, I would ask: is there any known instance of a mercy killer killing twice? So what is to be done?</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09063084000026"></a>Later on, we were to have come to an amendment in the name of the noble Lords, Lord Joffe and Lord Goodhart, in which they had proposed that mercy killing be charged as manslaughter, and not as murder. I think that amendment has now been withdrawn, but my amendment would achieve exactly the same result in practice, but by a different&#151;and I suggest simpler&#151;route.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09063084000027"></a>Its advantage is that it would not require a definition of mercy killing on the face of the Bill. It would leave that question to be decided in each case on the facts by the jury, which is where the decision belongs. My experience of trying many murder cases is that the   


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_152"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more one leaves to the jury the safer one is. So much then for the first advantage&#151;mercy killing. I can deal with the other advantages more briefly.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09063084000028"></a>The second advantage is that it would cater for those difficult cases, of which Clegg is the best known example, where a soldier or a policeman fires and kills in the agony of the moment. They may be technically guilty of murder, as the law now stands, but to have to sentence a man such as that to life imprisonment, when they will in practice serve only a year or two at most, again, makes a mockery of the law.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09063084000029"></a>Thirdly, the amendment would cover the case of the battered wife. The Government believe that the existing law of provocation favours the husband who kills in anger, as against the wife who kills the husband after years of suffering abuse. They say that the law needs to be rebalanced in favour of the battered wife. That was the view that the noble Lord, Lord Bach, if he remembers, expressed to me in his letter of 18 May&#151;a view with which I very largely agree.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09063084000030"></a>The case of the battered wife is indeed a very deserving one, but it cannot be dealt with by rejigging the law of provocation, as we shall see when we come to Clause 44. The battered wife who makes a deliberate decision to kill her husband has not lost her self-control; nor can she be brought within it in any way by extending the existing law of diminished responsibility. On the other hand, the battered wife is just the sort of person who should be covered and would be covered by this amendment, as it would enable the jury to find extenuating circumstances.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09063084000031"></a>Finally, I come to the fourth advantage. There have always been awkward cases on the edge of provocation and of diminished responsibility, like the case of Doughty. A parent who has been without sleep for nights on end because of a crying baby loses his or her temper and throws the baby on the floor, with fatal consequences. What conceivable point is served by sentencing such a person to life imprisonment? One thing is certain beyond any doubt: he or she will not do it again. The thought that other parents might be deterred is clearly absurd. Doughty is just the sort of case where a jury should be able to exercise what is sometimes called the jury equity and find extenuating circumstances.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09063084000032"></a>I now turn briefly to the safeguards. The first and most obvious is that it would be up to the judge to decide whether there was evidence on which a reasonable jury might find extenuating circumstances. If there was no such evidence, he would say nothing about it in his summing up. If there was, he would say that it was for the jury, and the jury alone, to decide whether there were such circumstances. He would not give any indication, one way or the other, of his own view. There would, of course, be nothing to stop the jury from adding a rider where it had not been told about such evidence by the judge but the judge would not be bound by such a rider and would pass a sentence of life imprisonment in the ordinary way.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09063084000033"></a>The second safeguard is that in any case where the judge does not pass a mandatory sentence, he would be obliged to give his reasons. Those reasons could then be looked at by the Attorney-General, and if the  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_153"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Attorney-General took the view that the sentence was too lenient, he or she could refer it to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09063084000034"></a>Lastly, I come to why I think the amendment would be effective. First, it is not dissimilar, although it is by no means the same as, to the old recommendation to mercy in the days of capital punishment. The Home Secretary was not obliged to accept such a recommendation, but in many cases he did. As far as I am aware, it did not cause any problem. That practice fell out of use but only because it was thought in those days to be unconstitutional for the jury to recommend mercy, which was the prerogative of the Crown rather than of anybody else.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09063084000035"></a>Secondly, such a system was found to have worked well in France in the days when there were minimum sentences for a large number of grave offences. It was open to the jury in France to find &#147;circonstances att&#233;nuantes&#148;; in that case, the minimum sentence did not apply. Thirdly, and perhaps even more relevantly, this worked well in South Africa in the days when it had capital punishment.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09063084000036"></a>Those are the reasons why I believe the amendment would work. Before sitting down, I should like to pay a very warm tribute to Professor John Spencer of Selwyn College, Cambridge. The ideas that I have put before your Lordships today were not mine in origin&#151;I wish I could say that they had been&#151;but his. I believe that they are a sensible and practical solution to many of the problems which will continue to arise until the mandatory sentence is finally abolished. If the idea finds favour with your Lordships, the credit belongs not to me but to Professor Spencer. I beg to move.</p>

I have for a long time believed that a mandatory life sentence for murder was wrong. Murder covers an immense spectrum, from sadistic, multiple murders to mercy killing of a beloved spouse or partner. The sentencing should be given an equally wide spectrum.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09063084000038"></a>When the Government asked the Law Commission some years ago to report on changes to the law of murder, they expressly excluded from consideration the removal of the mandatory life sentence. This was, frankly, a surrender to the tabloid press. The Government almost certainly knew that the mandatory sentence was wrong; they must have known that the Law Commission would very probably say so; therefore, they prevented any discussion of the mandatory nature of the sentence.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09063084000039"></a>We were left as a result with a complex proposal by the Law Commission for new legislation about murder, creating separate first and second degrees of murder which I believe were unnecessary and which have in any event not so far been implemented&#151;nor have the Government shown any signs of doing so.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09063084000040"></a>Mandatory sentences have a seriously damaging effect. They make necessary, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, pointed out, the partial defences of diminished responsibility and provocation.  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_154"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Diminished responsibility is often used to exclude mercy killers from life sentence by an overgenerous interpretation of what constitutes diminished responsibility. This is an act of kindness by the judge and the jury, but it means that the law is being distorted. Provocation is an unsatisfactory defence, because it has developed into a complex legal principle which it is far from easy for a judge to explain to the jury. The law would be greatly simplified and made more humane by abolishing the mandatory sentence for murder and leaving what are now partial defences to be dealt with by a procedure which would enable sentencers to take them into account.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09063084000041"></a>My original view was that all that was needed was to abolish the mandatory life sentence and leave sentencing to the judge. However, the amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, improves on this considerably&#151;thanks are indeed due to the professor&#151;by involving the jury as well as the judge. That is a crucial step. It is both correct in principle and would make the change in the law much more acceptable to the public. First, the judge would have to direct the jury that it could conclude that there were extenuating circumstances. Secondly, the jury would then have to agree that there were extenuating circumstances which justified a maximum sentence of less than life. Thirdly, there would be a possibility of appeal to the Court of Appeal against an unduly lenient sentence.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09063084000042"></a>I would ask one question of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, as a matter simply of explanation. I assume that the number of members of the jury required for finding that extenuating circumstances existed would be 10, 11 or 12, which is the same number as is required for providing a conviction or an acquittal. That means that in the case of a unanimous conviction by 12 jurors for murder, the rider finding extenuating circumstances would require 10 jurors to support it, not all 12. The noble and learned Lord will tell me whether that is correct.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09063084000043"></a>The amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, would simplify the law and make it much fairer. It should make it possible, for example, to limit diminished responsibility to cases of mentally disturbed murderers who needed to be placed in a secure mental hospital and not in an ordinary prison. The amendment should enable provocation to be eliminated as a partial defence, and it should enable people whose actions did not deserve a potential life sentence to avoid one. As I have already said, because of the necessity of consent of the jury to the process, it would be much more acceptable to the public.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09063084000044"></a>The amendment would make an admirable change to the law. It would remove the absolute requirement of mandatory sentence, but do so only if both the judge and the jury were satisfied that there were extenuating circumstances which justified a lesser maximum sentence.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09063084000045"></a>I think that at one stage the noble and learned Baroness, the Attorney-General, said that the best is the enemy of the good. I hope that that means that she thinks that what is proposed in the amendment is the best. It certainly seems to me to be the best, but I do not think that in this case it is the enemy of the good. There is a strong case for adopting the amendment and the principles behind it.</p>

I strongly agree with the way in which it was put forward by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I add only that I share the dismay of other Members of this Committee that part 2 of the Law Commission&#146;s proposals has been put ahead of part 1, but until the Government are able to make up their mind as to what they want, what is proposed in the amendment would provide an opportunity for a jury, properly directed, to make findings of fact on extenuating circumstances, a power which they do not have at the moment, and give flexibility to the judge to deal appropriately with the facts of a case to show the difference between, for instance, a mercy killing and other cases such as the Clegg case and somebody who it is clear should be given a serious life sentence with a long term as the tariff. For those short reasons, supporting the reasons already given, I hope that the amendment will commend itself to the Committee.</p>

Earlier in this afternoon&#146;s debates, the noble and learned Baroness, the Attorney-General, told us of conversations that she has had with victims of murder. I do not doubt for one moment that they have taken place, though perhaps often in fairly highly charged cases. As a veteran probably of as many murder cases as anyone in this Chamber, both as prosecutor and defender, I must say to her that I have found over the years that, provided as prosecutor or defender you explain the process carefully to the families during the trial, which happily counsel is now able and encouraged by the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions to do, their understanding of the process is much increased and they understand that an empirical sentencing process needs to be carried out somehow or other.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09063084000048"></a>As the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said, this proposal adds participation by the public in the form of the jury in the process of decision-making, not only on the bare facts founded on the judge&#146;s direction of law but on the qualification and quality of those facts. The noble and learned Baroness, the Attorney-General, said earlier that we were somewhere on a long process towards reforming the law of murder. I would simply encourage her on behalf of these Benches to seize on the opportunity at least to make some progress today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09063084000050"></a>I am not unduly concerned about the authorship of the proposal. I wish it had been centred entirely on the noble and learned Lord, based on his experience. I would have felt more comfortable about that. It is essential that we should do something about the anomalies that exist. To wait indefinitely, as the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General proposed on the last  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_156"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>amendment, is in my view a counsel of despair. We should at least try. If the law needs further amendment afterwards that is acceptable&#151;we can do that in the light of experience. To do it without any experience at all and to wait indefinitely is intolerable. I found the arguments that have been advanced by the noble and learned Lord and others persuasive, reasonable and logical. I do not like the idea of the criminal law being brought into contempt. How long will that be allowed to go on? How long will we have to put up with the uncertainty?</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09063084000051"></a>It is important that we should acknowledge the principle of change and accept that. If we are proved wrong, it will be possible to do something about that in the future. An overwhelming case has been made out for change right away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09063084000053"></a>I would like to know what the Law Society, the Bar Council and those who are engaged in criminal law have to say about this. Surely, the Government have conversed with all of them as well as with the victims. I greatly respect the noble and learned Baroness, the Attorney-General, who is one of the best Attorneys-General we have had. My aside is intended to establish that we approve of this idea now. It is important that we should be able to make some progress on this significant matter instead of neglecting it for years to come.</p>

I took note of that. I strongly support this amendment. We have had a huge amount of discussion over a lot of time about the extent to which extenuating circumstances should play a role in the judge&#146;s decisions on sentences for murder, contrary to the existing mandatory life sentence. One approach has been to try to define types of murder and manslaughter in order to bring the law more in line with practice, which is a mandatory life sentence accompanied by a tariff which modifies the life sentence in many cases. We have tried to do that. The attempt in the preceding amendment was on those lines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09063084000055"></a>We now have Amendment 150A in front of us. This amendment corresponds precisely to the way in which I think we should go, for two reasons. First, it provides the flexibility which is obviously necessary because of the different circumstances of these cases. Secondly, it brings in the jury in a role that I strongly support. The jury has a role in giving its opinion on the extenuating circumstances&#151;whether they do or do not exist. This is an excellent amendment, which I strongly support, among the many lawyers who apparently take the same view.</p>

I have heard it from her before on a previous occasion when mandatory life sentences were raised, and I have heard it from those on the other side of the House when the topic has been raised earlier when I have been in the House. I see that it is extremely difficult for any political party to say they are going to make that major change. I was grateful that the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, reminded us of the undertaking that was given at the time of the abolition of the death penalty, because that underlies the decisions that will be made by the Front Benches.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09063084000057"></a>It seems to me that this amendment finds a way of somehow mitigating the damage that has been done by the mandatory life sentence. It does not go behind the undertakings that were made at the time because in effect it provides a discretion to those who have had the advantage of hearing the evidence in the court. Those of us who are practising at the Bar and who have sat in many murder cases over the years are bound to say that not only do they all vary in their facts but they all vary in the degree of culpability. As others have said, not all murders merit a life sentence. The majority undoubtedly do but there are those&#151;the mercy killings, the soldier, the one-off&#151;which do not. To watch the judge, the prosecutor and the defence trying to find a way to achieve the right result is not the way justice should be administered. Consistency is needed but so are honesty, openness, clarity and, above all, justice. One size does not fit all in relation to murder cases.</p>

<a name="90630-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09063084000058"></a>This amendment seems to shine a light for the first time in a way which I hope the Government can take forward. This is a light into a way in which the jury and the judge, faced with these extremely difficult and not very common circumstances, can reach a means of imposing the right sentence on the offender. I hope it will not receive a blanket rejection today. I hope it will be taken away, because the sense round the whole of this Committee is that the time has come for us to make some progress. Even if we cannot tackle the whole of the law of murder, which I think we ought to be doing in a separate Bill, this is one area in which this piece of legislation could at least show some reform and some advance.</p>

It is striking indeed that so many lawyers should agree about anything. I would add one further argument in favour of the amendment. We all know that there are occasions when the jury is reluctant to convict, despite compelling evidence that the defendant is guilty of murder. The jury is reluctant to convict because of its concern that on the facts of the case a mandatory life sentence is simply inappropriate. One of the great attractions of the amendment is that it would involve the jury in the assessment of whether there are extenuating circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09063084000060"></a>The amendment would serve the very valuable purpose of mitigating the absurdities of the mandatory life sentence for all cases of murder. The Attorney-General suggested earlier, in answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, that it is necessary to maintain public  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_158"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>confidence, which may require the retention of the mandatory life sentence. I ask the Attorney-General to explain to us how it maintains public confidence for us to retain the mandatory life sentence when the trial judge, immediately after passing the sentence, tells the defendant, the victim&#146;s family and everyone concerned that this sentence means that the defendant will therefore serve a tariff of a defined number of years and will thereafter be released if and when it is safe to do so. Surely that serves only to undermine public confidence in the law. Unless and until the Government come forward with a systematic reform of the law of murder, this amendment would be a substantial improvement on what we have now and will serve only to strengthen public confidence in this area of the law.</p>

I rise to speak only so that there should be more than one non-legal voice speaking in this debate. In this case, philosophy undoubtedly supports the voice of the law, as it so often does&#151;and perhaps we should say it the other way round, that jurisprudence is a version of philosophy. It is absolute nonsense on the practical point, as my noble friend has just pointed out, to suppose that a life sentence when passed should immediately be revoked and turned into something else. Far beyond that, I think that everybody who has ever been interested in questions of responsibility, blame or conflicting senses of duty realises that there are a large number of extenuating circumstances, particularly in the case of mercy killings, which were mentioned at the beginning of the debate. This is a very good amendment and I strongly support it.</p>

Those who are familiar with English legal history&#151;although they will not get a dissertation on that from me now&#151;may recall a crime that used to be called grand larceny, to be guilty of which you had to steal an object worth more than 40 shillings. The issue of whether it was worth more than that was left to the jury, who would habitually value a diamond ring at well below that amount. The other day&#151;well, not the other day but about 15 years ago&#151;there was a case of malicious destruction of some weapon of war that was going to be exported to tyrants who would use it to suppress their population. The people involved, who were mainly women, although there may have been some gallant men there as well, physically destroyed that weapon of war and were charged with malicious damage, or whatever it was. To the amazement of all except the

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09063084000065"></a>To allow the extenuating circumstance rider to be added is a great improvement on the existing law. There may be problems to be faced, although we do not need to go into that now, in that the clause says that the judge will make up his mind in relation to the facts as found by the jury, who will have to make some finding about the particular facts that amount to the extenuating circumstances. Without complicating the issue today, one can imagine circumstances when there were rivals as to which of the so-called alleged extenuating circumstances matched up to it. But the general idea seems wholly praise-worthy and we should adopt it.</p>

<a name="09063084000066"></a><b><a name="90630-0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09063084000127"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> I, too, support the amendment. As a circuit judge, I never had to try a person for murder, but more than 40 years ago, when I was a Minister in the Home Office, one task was to advise the Home Secretary of the day on the issue of life sentences. One realised then how much of an obscenity some of those cases were when a mandatory life sentence had to be passed. The noble Lords, Lord Neill and Lord Pannick, pointed to what the ancients used to call pious perjury, whereby a jury would go out of its way to find that there were some circumstances that would save a person from the injustice that would otherwise be brought upon them in that particular case.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09063084000067"></a>There are cases that call for our attention, and there are three things that we can do. One is to do nothing but to hope that in some way the political parties will be educated and will educate their supporters to be responsible and just in these circumstances, allowing much greater flexibility for the sentencing judge in cases of murder. That is a far-flung possibility that we may not live to see come about. Secondly, we could define each and every one of the categories, which would be a recipe for disaster, as there will always be categories beyond our comprehension that will turn up in cases from time to time.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09063084000068"></a>The third possibility is to accept the amendment. It is not perfect but, if King Solomon was sitting in judgment in the Supreme Court in Jerusalem, I doubt whether he would be able to bring about a perfect solution to the situation. It is not perfect for this reason. Imagine a typical afternoon, when many juries up and down the country have been sent out to consider a verdict of murder. Some come back having been given this direction; it is only within the scope of the test of reasonableness that the judge will have spelt out to them that they will be able to come to the conclusion concerning extenuating circumstances. Each jury is an individual and unique animal, and a jury in Chelmsford may find that there are circumstances that are within the ambit of the amendment, while a jury in Chester, in circumstances virtually identical, will find that there are not. That, I am afraid, is the price that has to be paid for bringing about the advantage that the amendment carries with it.</p>

It would stop, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, the performance of stretching the criteria of diminished responsibility, which should surely be constrained to those whose diminished responsibility is a result of a mental disorder or disability or some other specific criteria. At the moment, we know that the diminished responsibility rules are fudged in relation to mercy killing. There is a very good reason for introducing it into this legislation. In a later group of amendments we shall debate at length the subtle changes to the criteria on diminished responsibility, which will have the effect of making them slightly more difficult to use because their description is going to be slightly tightened up. Many psychiatrists have pressed for this to make them more consistent with current medical practice, but it means that it will make them more difficult to use in circumstances where this amendment would be of great utility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09063084000071"></a>We will come on much later to the issue of infanticide, but one of the major reasons for preserving the extraordinary current law of infanticide is that there seems to be no other way to deal with the very young women who give birth, are in a state of distress and kill the child quickly. That is a dreadful circumstance, which at the moment is catered for under infanticide as it is extremely difficult to fit them into the formal diminished responsibility criteria. It will be more difficult to fit them into other criteria. Of course infanticide does exist, and it is intended that it should exist, but I hope to convince the Committee that it should not continue. If the Bill were amended in this way it would deal with many of the problems that we are making for ourselves with regard to diminished responsibility and would allow us to tackle other cases such as mercy killing.</p>

I understand the reasons she gave in her response to the previous group of amendments, when she spoke of the privilege she had&#151;it was typical of her that she should express it like that&#151;of talking to the families of those who have suffered bereavement at the hands of murderers. That is what you might call a &#147;straight from the heart&#148; reaction. I quite understand that, as must anybody who has had any ministerial responsibility. It was not particularly exhilarating of the Government, of whom I must take my share of collective responsibility, that we set aside the recommendation of the Law Commission.

The soldier goes onto the streets in those circumstances for the purpose of preventing murder. The terrorist goes onto the streets for the purpose of committing murder and yet the sentence for each is the same. The straight from the heart reaction of the families of the soldier does not need me to describe it. The great beauty&#151;if I may put it like that&#151;of this amendment is that it enables the public, as has already been said, through the jury, to express through a finding of extenuating circumstances the reason why a mandatory sentence need not be imposed.</p>

I never practised law but I did teach it once, including criminal law, but that was a very long time ago. Therefore, I think I should probably be classed as a layman on this issue this evening. That is no bad thing because I would like to take my place alongside the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, not among the chorus of lawyers who have supported the amendment, but among those laymen who are perhaps in a position to explain to the Committee how this matter appears from the point of view of the ordinary man in the street, so to speak. I want to add my voice to the chorus of support which there has been for the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09063084000076"></a>The rigidity of the mandatory life sentence is universally recognised, and has been in this debate, to give rise to major deformities in our law of homicide. One particular deformity that it gives rise to and one undesirable consequence is that it leads to fictional findings of diminished responsibility; for example, to accommodate the mercy killer, who may well have been acting under stress, but who was certainly not acting irrationally. Indeed, they may well have been following what seemed to them to be a highly rational course of conduct.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09063084000077"></a>The Law Commission in its review of the partial defences to murder in 2004 said in relation to mercy killing:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="09063084000101"></a>&#147;At present, in such cases, a conviction for murder, with consequent mandatory life sentence, can only be avoided by&#148;&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="09063084000102"></a>&#147;It is however a blight on our law that such an outcome has to be connived at rather than arising openly and directly from the law&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09063084000094"></a>Whatever one thinks of this fiction, this connivance, it is now certainly made more difficult, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, indicated, by the Bill. Under the law as it stands, to establish the defence of diminished responsibility the defendant has to show that he was  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_162"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>suffering from such abnormality of mind, whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes, or induced by disease or injury, as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions. This is a fairly broad and loose concept, which is put to the jury to find their way through as best they can.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09063084000078"></a>Under the new definition of diminished responsibility, which will be introduced by the Bill, the defendant would need to be shown to have been suffering from a recognised medical condition at the time of the act, which substantially impaired their ability to understand the nature of their conduct, to form a rational judgment, or to exercise self-control.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09063084000079"></a>The defence of diminished responsibility will thus be considerably tightened up. That is no doubt a good thing. It will help to put an end to fictional findings of diminished responsibility. That being the case, it is clear that we will now need the amendment that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, has brought forward this evening, which could well be the best way to ensure that the law can continue to show compassion to genuine mercy killers through clear, open procedures set down in statute and subject to public scrutiny rather than through the hidden means of the benign conspiracy.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09063084000081"></a>What has been addressed is one component of the public and personal reaction to the situation of a soldier who, by nature of his job, finds himself effectively being convicted of murder. But there is another side to it as well, which also gives support to this elegant and powerfully and persuasively argued amendment. Consider that not everyone in the population pays quite so much attention to the question of murder as is the case in your Lordships&#146; House, but notices those which are of great importance to them as well as the political stance of the leaders of Governments. In my part of the world, one of the statements that rung through again and again was the Prime Minister speaking of murder being murder being murder.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09063084000082"></a>Then we have a situation in which a soldier is convicted of murder. There is no possibility of the jury applying extenuating circumstances. There is a requirement for a mandatory life sentence. But what is seen from an Irish perspective is a Prime Minister saying that murder is murder, a British solider being convicted in a British court of murder, a mandatory life sentence being the appropriate sentence, but &#147;the British establishment&#148; deciding that of course the solider should not serve it. We all know and appreciate that it is wholly appropriate that the solider should not serve it, but that is not necessarily how it is seen in Ireland.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09063084000083"></a>However, if an amendment of this kind were part of the law, and the jury, not the judge, was able to identify that there were extenuating&#151;and, in the case of a soldier carrying out his job, more than mere&#151;circumstances, that would send a message to the population that those engaged in the detailed consideration of the problem viewed it not as being merely murder,

So, in no way diminishing the arguments about the solider and his family&#146;s plight that have been adduced, but taking into account the requirements and concerns of the public, there is another perspective that simply adds weight and support to the amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and others.</p>

The amendment extends well beyond mercy killing but, as I no longer regard myself as a lawyer, I will focus only on that aspect, which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, has raised, as I have some knowledge of the issue.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09063084000085"></a>I approach the issue not, as I say, as a lawyer, but as someone concerned with justice, and with justice for everyone. The amendment must be considered in the context of the changes in the law proposed in Clause 42, which would result in a mandatory life sentence for a mercy killer. The noble Lord, Lord Low, has drawn attention to what the Law Commission, in its report 290 in August 2004, referred to as the benign conspiracy between psychiatrists, the defence, the prosecution and the court to avoid convictions for murder. Clause 42 appears intended to prevent that benign conspiracy which, although it was a fudge from a legal point of view, was a humane fudge that often resulted in non-custodial sentences for persons found guilty of mercy killing. Under the proposed law, there would not be that gap, and mercy killers who kill for compassionate reasons will face a mandatory life sentence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09063084000086"></a>We have, then, this obvious injustice in Clause 42 that mercy killers who, out of compassion for someone who they love, reluctantly assist their loved ones to die and will receive the same mandatory life sentence as murderers who kill maliciously for gain. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, has pointed out, it makes a mockery of the law. The mandatory life sentence is the most severe punishment that can be imposed on a convicted accused. It must bring the law into disrepute if a compassionate act attracts the same sentence as a dreadful murder.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09063084000087"></a>If the amendment were accepted, it would bring some consistency to the law where the Government have surprisingly accepted the Law Commission&#146;s recommendation that, pending the outcome of any public consultation, Section 4 of the Homicide Act 1957 should be retained. This section provides that the survivor of a suicide pact is guilty of manslaughter, not murder, if the defence proves that he was acting in pursuance of the pact. So if Clause 42 becomes law we will have the strange and seemingly irrational outcome that a mercy killer found guilty will be sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment unless they happen to be the survivor of a suicide pact, in which case they will only be guilty of manslaughter, thereby providing the judge with discretion as to their sentence. Can my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General explain

It seems on the face of it that, as the Law Commission has earlier said, the law is in a mess. Clause 42 will increase rather than solve that mess.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09063084000088"></a>If they were concerned about justice, it would have been far more rational for the Government to have deferred tightening the law on diminished responsibility under Clause 42 until the public consultation on mercy killing recommended by the Law Commission had taken place, in exactly the same way as they have deferred the decision on suicide pacts. That suggests that the Government may never really have intended the draconian outcome of mandatory life sentences for all mercy killers, because I do not believe that the Government are not concerned about injustice.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09063084000089"></a>In their consultation paper CP19/08, the Government stated that the aim of the Bill is to ensure that the law is just, effective and up to date, producing outcomes that command public confidence. The Bill is to be applauded in its aim to prevent the encouragement of suicide through the medium of the internet, but it is not just in respect of mercy killings. It is too early to say whether it will be effective, but one outcome is certain: it will not produce outcomes that command public confidence.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09063084000090"></a>In the present climate of uncertainty over the lack of public confidence in Parliament, leaders of political parties have expressed concern that Parliament is out of touch with the opinions of the electorate and must listen to their views. Public opinion surveys consistently show that 80 per cent of the public support assisted dying. While this is not the place for a debate about decriminalising assisted dying, it follows from these surveys that at least 80 per cent of society would be appalled at a law that results in mandatory life sentences for mercy killers. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, has pointed out, the Law Commission commissioned Professor Mitchell to undertake surveys for it, which the commission recorded in its report. The professor found:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="09063084000103"></a>&#147;The surveys reveal very little support for the imposition of a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment in genuine cases of &#145;mercy&#146; killing&#148;.</p>

<a name="90630-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09063084000091"></a>Is it time that the Government take account of the views of the overwhelming majority of the population, who would undoubtedly support the amendment? It is encouraging that the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, supports the amendment, as he and I have had different views on assisted dying.</p>

I have been increasingly convinced by the case made by the noble and learned Lord and so many others who have spoken for the amendment. As I have done so, and as that has been the way in which my mind has been moving, and even before the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, stood up, I had an increasing quaver of dis-ease, to put it mildly. Although I fully understood the noble and learned Lord&#146;s case and respected it, my dis-ease began when he spoke of mercy killing, which is a difficult phrase, in his outlaying of the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09063091000002"></a>I have been asking myself what may be the effect on public thinking and the media which we are told over again by the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, is in a particular position on matters that will come later in the Bill and what may be the effect of thinking in the Committee when we reach the amendments in the names of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, and the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice&#151;probably not this evening. As I listened to the noble Lord, my concerns became all the stronger, even though, like him, I had noticed that among those learned and experienced in the law&#151;what a strange thing that the term &#147;learned&#148; is applied in your Lordships&#146; House only to learning in the law and not to other things&#151;who have supported the noble and learned Lord&#146;s amendment, are those whom I know to be strongly opposed to the amendments to come in the names of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, and the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09063091000003"></a>This leaves me concerned; the quaver has become much greater and it is not simply dis-ease but considerable anxiety about the effects as it is working out in the Committee. The question I want to ask&#151;it will matter to me what answer I receive&#151;relates to proposed new subsection (4) of the new clause, which brings into play the Attorney-General. I would like to be clear that were a trial judge to make such a statement as he or she is enabled to by proposed new subsections (1) and (2), and if a jury so found that that was reasonable in relation to what the noble and learned Lord has spoken of as mercy killing, would it be open to the Attorney-General to question that and to do so clearly?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09063091000004"></a>The Attorney-General has nodded, but it will be interesting to hear her speak. She has not nodded; she has shaken her head. I am not sure whether she has shaken her head to my saying that she has nodded or whether she has shaken her head more generally, which is why it is important to rely on speech in your Lordships&#146; House. I should want to know that the law in these matters would not be made simply by a judge and jury, important as the jury is in these matters but that if the Attorney-General in the public interest believed that the law was slithering in the direction in which some noble Lords might wish it to run, the Attorney-General could ask those questions and bring back the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09063091000005"></a>As well as that detail I want to note a gathering unease, which leads me to the point of not being at all clear how it would be right to vote, were we to vote on the amendment, on the grounds that I have outlined.</p>

I support the amendment and I was taken by the arguments of my noble and learned friend. I often find myself in agreement with what he has to say and I do so again this evening. I am concerned about some of the other arguments that have been adduced during the course of the debate that have caused the creeping unease to which the right reverend Prelate has referred. The arguments advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, and others about fudged verdicts are compelling. Looking at the way in which mandatory sentences are imposed is a

Many of us at Second Reading expressed concern that within the Bill there was no opportunity to look in great detail at the law on murder and many expressed again during Committee the thought that we probably need a separate piece of legislation to look at the matter in detail in the future. I would be one to sign up to that.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09063091000007"></a>I want to follow something that the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, said in his remarks. He has made great play of the point about mercy killing as a reason why we should now pass the amendment. The arguments for fudged verdicts are good, but the argument about mercy killing is one we should consider carefully. I would like to ask the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General how many people have in any event been sentenced to life imprisonment as a result of mercy killing. How often do such cases come before our courts? The reality is that this is a theological argument; in a legal sense we would rarely find such cases. I am not aware of anyone being given a life sentence for so-called mercy killing.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09063091000008"></a>However, I am struck that at the beginning of our proceedings on the Bill we have spent a great deal of time looking at the coroners service arising out of the killings of over 226 people by Dr Harold Shipman. I am struck that the defence that he could have offered, if at an earlier stage he had been brought to court, is that he had done such things as an act of mercy killing. Would that have been a defence in law and would he have been brought before the courts and given a mandatory sentence? We need to know how that would have happened in reality.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09063091000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Joffe, in his argument, said that we should rely on public opinion. As I experienced while a Member of another place for a division of the City of Liverpool, many people there were in favour of the restoration of capital punishment. I was regularly told in general elections that if only I would commit myself to the restoration of capital punishment they would vote for me. Many opinion polls show a majority of people who would like to see the restoration of capital punishment. However, as a matter of prudential judgment, I disagreed with that view and have always voted against it, for reasons that we would not have time to debate here tonight but I suspect that many would be in agreement with. We should not therefore necessarily rely on public opinion. The right reverend Prelate was right to say that we should have some concern about some of the arguments being adduced during this debate and the destination to which that might lead us.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09063091000011"></a>I agree with the assessment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, that the abolition of the mandatory life sentence is not a political option at present. It is not on the table, as the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, suspected in her intervention, and will not be in the foreseeable future.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09063091000012"></a>The value of the amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, is that it recognises that fact. In redefining the offence of murder in its report, the Law Commission also recognises that as a fact. However, like the Law Commission report, the issue that this amendment addresses is not the mandatory life sentence but the appropriate definition of murder to which it should apply.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09063091000013"></a>That brings me to my first question to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. In his amendment, to which definition of murder does he foresee the mandatory life sentence applying? In other words, what is the starting point before the court goes on to consider extenuating circumstances? Is it the existing definition of murder? I see the noble and learned Lord nodding and therefore I do not need to go on to suggest what other definitions of murder might have been in his mind.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09063091000014"></a>I cannot begin to trace the journey that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, undertook that led to the final draft of his amendment, but it is an amendment of great perspicacity because he leaves the role of deciding whether there are extenuating circumstances to the jury. It is the noble and learned Lord at his most deft, if I may say so, and, for the Government, at his most challenging&#151;because the insightfulness, as the Americans say, of the amendment is that the jury is the best possible expression of public opinion that the court could have in looking at what is an appropriate sentence in the circumstances.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09063091000015"></a>We are told that the great problem that we have with the law relating to murder is public opinion and that, whatever the politicians do, in the end we will always come up against this barrier But what better expression of public opinion in a case can you have than a jury? It comes much closer to the situation than any newspaper editor is able to do and, what is more, it is composed of ordinary members of the public selected at random from our society. Therefore, I hope that the Government will think about this amendment very seriously.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09063091000016"></a>One hesitation that I have about the amendment is whether too much discretion is left to the jury. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, mentioned a number of possible extenuating circumstances. He addressed mercy killing, the battered wife, the particular issues to which the Doughty case gave rise and, of course, the soldier. I wonder whether these issues ought not to be expressed in the amendment and, if it ultimately succeeds, in the Bill and then the Act. I recognise the difficulties that are involved because one wonders how one can foresee a spectrum of extenuating circumstances.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09063091000017"></a>This is a real difficulty because, although the amendment gets over the crucial question of public opinion&#151;that is its real ingenuity&#151;nevertheless one has to consider very seriously the extent to which the discretion of the jury should be constrained. I know  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_168"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what the answer of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, will be. He will say that it should be left to the discretion of the judge. I find that initially an attractive solution; but I should certainly like to go away and think about it if that is his response to me.</p>

<a name="09063091000018"></a><b><a name="90630-0009.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09063091000121"></a>Baroness Scotland of Asthal:</b> I have found this an absolutely fascinating and insightful debate. However, as I listened carefully, a number of things became clear. First, although the noble and learned Lord says that he accepts that the mandatory life sentence will remain, perhaps I may respectfully suggest that the effect of the amendment would be that it was, de facto, expunged. Let me explain why that is so.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09063091000019"></a>We are dealing with a set of partial defences which at the moment would reduce a conviction for murder to one for manslaughter. The amendment proposes to say to the jury, &#147;You may find the person guilty of murder but then you may affect the sentence of murder so that it is capable of being dealt with as if it were manslaughter by using the defence of extenuating circumstances&#148;. So there is almost&#151;I hope that the Committee will take this in the spirit in which it is meant, because it is ingenious&#151;a different, benign conspiracy to try to ignore the fact that we have accepted that there will not be any expunging of the mandatory life sentence.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09063091000020"></a>Before I come to the way in which the amendment would work, perhaps I may take up some of the points raised. First, I say to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, that I absolutely understand the position of the soldier&#146;s family. Indeed, the privilege extends not only to those who have been subjected to a murder in the ordinary way; the noble and learned Lord will remember that one also has an opportunity to listen to families who go the other way. It is very similar to the one-punch murder/manslaughter case, where the family is devastated that someone who has done something that in one sense looks ridiculous and unintended is dealt with quite firmly. Therefore, I understand the desire here.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09063091000021"></a>I also understand all those who have spoken about wanting to mitigate the harshness of what would appear to be the mandatory life sentence. The noble Lords, Lord Elystan-Morgan and Lord Goodhart, put their finger on some of the issues that cause us difficulty. First, the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, says&#151;and he is right&#151;that one will not be able to determine what any particular jury in any particular part of the country might decide amounts to extenuating circumstances. Although the judge can give guidance about that, what criterion will the judge be invited to exercise in determining what can or cannot make up an extenuating circumstance?</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09063091000022"></a>The right reverend Prelate asked whether I could intervene as Attorney-General and, under the provision is crafted, exercise my power under Section 36 of the 1988 Act, which relates to sentence. The answer is that I could not, because that is a power to refer in relation to sentence and not in relation to conviction. It does not relate to the verdict, and a finding of extenuating circumstances under this amendment is not a sentence. Therefore, I would envisage that if the jury in a case of mercy killing&#151;we have talked a lot about the difficulties of cases where mercy killing is in issue&#151;came to the  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_169"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>conclusion, and the judge agreed, that such an extenuating circumstance justified the reduction in sentence, they would be entitled to say so.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09063091000023"></a>There is then the very interesting question of whether Parliament is content that individual jurors in individual circumstances would be able to determine what the law was going to be on a particular day at a particular time.

Does she accept that in fact that is exactly what happens in relation to the current law of diminished responsibility? The jury makes the decision about the verdict in a case, and there are widespread differences between juries, just as there are widespread differences in time. That plea used to be used 130 times a year; now it is used 20 times a year. I cannot see that there is anything about the use of this amendment in relation to verdicts by juries that is any more difficult than the law that we already have, and will continue to have, in relation to diminished responsibility.</p>

One of the things that we aspire to achieve with these provisions is a greater degree of clarity, certainty and, therefore, consistency. That is the aspiration. A number of noble Lords have said, during this debate and elsewhere, that one of the problems we have with the current process is that it lacks clarity, simplicity and certainty. So we are seeking&#151;in both the provisions relating to diminished responsibility and those relating to loss of control&#151;to give a greater degree of clarity so that we know what falls within the categories of murder and manslaughter. That is the whole purpose of this debate.</p>

<a name="90630-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09063091000026"></a>This amendment seeks to create what I must respectfully suggest to the House is an unhelpful halfway house between murder and manslaughter, eroding the boundary between the two. It would mean that a person could be convicted of murder but face the consequences which would flow from a manslaughter verdict. It is generally accepted that the rationale for a manslaughter verdict, in circumstances where a partial defence applies, is to allow the defendant to be freed from the full consequences of a murder conviction&#151;that is, a life sentence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09063091000027"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, raised the issue of the life sentence. The life sentence has a real bite because it remains in being for the whole of that individual&#146;s life. If at any stage they transgress, they can be brought back. That is why the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, says this is a blunt instrument because the life sentence is for life. It cannot, therefore, be disregarded, saying, &#147;You have done your tariff and that is the end of it&#148;. It is not the end of it; it goes on.</p>

Would my noble friend answer that point? It is important that those who have experience as practitioners should be heard.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, referred to the extensive consultations there have been. I cannot tell my noble friend whether this particular amendment, which is Professor Spencer&#146;s amendment, has been subject to specific consultation. I can certainly undertake to find out whether that is true. But have all of those people been consulted in relation to a plethora of homicide provisions over the past six years? Absolutely. Have we discussed the import of their suggestions? Yes. Has everyone always agreed? Regrettably, not. Is it a continuing, iterative conversation? Yes, it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09063091000034"></a>This amendment seeks to create a third category. You would have murder with extenuating circumstances and then manslaughter, which could be introduced if one of the partial defences was proven. I do not know whether the noble and learned Lord is suggesting that we accept this amendment and expunge the partial defences in relation to provocation. If he is not, we would have three areas&#151;murder, murder with extenuating circumstances and manslaughter. One can see a certain echo with the Law Commission&#146;s categories of murder one, murder two and manslaughter. We would argue strongly that this is not the moment to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09063091000035"></a>We have a real difficulty in terms of defining what the extenuating circumstances are.

This issue would not be one for Parliament to decide&#151;I know that subsequently we are going to debate the issue of assisted dying and mercy killing&#151;but it would be for the court on the day in question to determine, judge and jury, whether there were extenuating circumstances. For something of such importance to the public at large, I think it is for this House and another place to make that determination after full and proper debate. I understand the attraction of taking this route but I cannot advise your Lordships to adopt it. It would not enable us to look at these issues with the acuity they require. These are hotly contested issues and Parliament, as difficult as it is, will have to decided what it wants in relation to them on behalf of the people of this country. We cannot slip round that by using this amendment, as attractive as I undoubtedly believe it may appear at first blush.</p>

The case that she is making is that the effect of this amendment would be to change the offence and turn it into murder two, as it were. Surely that is not the case. It is still murder and potentially susceptible to a life sentence. All this amendment does is open up some space in which the jury and the judge between them are able to modify the sentence.</p>

There will then be two people on the jury who believe in a full-blown murder without any extenuating circumstances. That is the basis on which they will have convicted the defendant, while others disagree. The jury is being asked to determine a complex set of scenarios. That does not bring clarity or simplicity; it brings complexity. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, was right to raise it, as was the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, with his experience of the circuit bench, who asked about regional differences.</p>

All the jury needs to decide is, first, whether there has been a murder and secondly, and only if the judge says that there are grounds for justifying extenuating circumstances, whether there are such circumstances. If 10 or more members of the jury say that there are extenuating circumstances, the case will proceed on that basis. If fewer than 10 agree, it will not. That seems perfectly simple to me.</p>

In the debate it was said that it would be impossible to define what an extenuating set of circumstances might be. They would have to be specifically honed to the case in point. How can that be done if there is no independent rubric or tool by which it will be measured? I respectfully suggest that this situation would have to be honed so that it was

The noble and learned Baroness is overcomplicating the position of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. It is absolutely clear what he wants. He has three additional amendments which would get rid of Clauses 44, 45 and 46. Their effect would be to leave the existing law of provocation standing and get rid of the new ideas embodied in Clauses 44 and 45. That is absolutely straightforward.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, said that it is rare for so many lawyers all to agree. It is extremely rare, but on this occasion we are also joined by many perspicacious laymen who have all expressed views in support of the amendment. I am extremely grateful to all of them. Only two Members of the Committee, other than the Attorney-General, have expressed any doubt; one was the right reverend Prelate, and I do now rather regret having put that fourth paragraph into the amendment, because in truth it is unnecessary. The Attorney-General would be able to refer such a sentence to the Court of Appeal anyway. I would say the same to the noble Lord, Lord Alton. I respect his concerns about the amendment and hope to take them fully into account before bringing the matter back at a later stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09063091000042"></a>I am grateful, as always, for the replies of the noble and learned Baroness. However, I found them disappointing. She said that the amendment was trying to circumvent the mandatory sentence, and said in so many words that it was a fudge. It is not a fudge; it is a way of enabling the jury to enable the judge to reach an appropriate sentence in each case. She said that all the extenuating circumstances that might apply should be defined. I cannot imagine anything more silly, if I may say so. We all know that the circumstances of murder are infinitely various. To attempt to define circumstances that the jury might find to be extenuating would be impossible and would deprive the amendment of all point.</p>

I shall speak also to Amendments 153 and 158 and any consequential amendments flowing therefrom.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09063091000045"></a>The amendments would amend Clause 42(1), which amends Section 2(1) of the Homicide Act 1957, to allow a charge of murder to be reduced to manslaughter if the person who killed another was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning which arose from developmental immaturity. The amendments would give effect to the Law Commission&#146;s recommendation that for defendants under 18, developmental immaturity could be a possible basis for reducing murder to manslaughter. The age of criminal responsibility begins at 10, but there is a great deal of research showing that a child of 10 does not have the same reasoning processes as an adult. They may have&#151;but they may well not have.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09063091000046"></a>Under the current proposals an adult with a learning difficulty who has the mental age of a child can plead diminished responsibility. On the other hand, a child without a medical condition but with developmental immaturity will not be able to plead diminished responsibility under the current proposals. These amendments would mean that if the child could show that the killing took place because he or she suffered from an abnormality of mental functioning that arose because of developmental immaturity and this substantially impaired the child&#146;s ability to understand the nature of his or her conduct, to form a rational judgment or to exercise self-control, and this provides an explanation for the child&#146;s actions, that could reduce a murder charge to manslaughter.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09063091000047"></a>Those would still be substantial hurdles to overcome and a successful plea or verdict would still result in a conviction of a very serious offence&#151;manslaughter. In Committee in the Commons the Government said that this amendment should not be introduced because they said that they had not seen any evidence showing that it was necessary. They said, too, that one of the problems was that many children would raise this as a defence. Many children might raise it as a defence because it has merit both in law and in an analysis of children. I simply do not understand the logic of saying that because it might be a defence that will avail many people, possibly justly, we should not entertain it. The mere fact that this defence might be relied on but ultimately not succeed in other cases cannot justify the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09063091000048"></a>In its 2004 report, <I>Partial Defences to Murder</I>, the Law Commission recommended that the diminished responsibility partial defence should be available to a child or young person under 18 on the ground of developmental immaturity. These amendments would simply give effect to that report. There are many platitudes that one could use about children&#146;s development. However, the scientific evidence&#151;the evidence to which we should pay attention&#151;seems to show that in the physiological development of their brains, children are markedly more impulsive. They are driven more by fear and gut reactions. They are more influenced by their circumstances, including what may be very adverse circumstances, and react much less rationally than

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09063091000049"></a>Under-18s mature at different rates. Their ability to decide to engage in criminal activity, including committing murder, in the clear knowledge of the full implications and consequences of doing so, must be subject to the developmental level that the individual young person has reached. Knowing the difference between what is legal and illegal is not intrinsic to a child, and it is certainly not intrinsic to every child in the same way at the same rate of development. It needs to be learned. It is a lesson much harder learned by vulnerable children&#151;those who have been neglected, those who have been abused, those who are less able to take logical account of the differentials in behaviour that at least many of us in this House recognise sometimes.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09063091000050"></a>The omission of developmental immaturity from Clause 42 is particularly material as a result of the abolition of the presumption of doli incapax. It means that any child over the age of 10 in this country is now to be held to understand the significance of their actions and that a partial defence to murder should only be available if a child meets the proposed conditions for a defence of diminished responsibility. The effect is wholly unjust. An adult of 40 with the emotional maturity of a 10 year-old will be able to plea diminished responsibility if they are diagnosed to have a recognised medical condition. On the other hand, a 10 year-old without such a recognised condition but suffering from developmental immaturity of a significant kind cannot succeed with the plea as their development has not been arrested. It is simply ongoing.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09063091000051"></a>It seems to us that this is a merited defence that will ensure that the law remains just for those under 18. I beg to move.</p>

In my view, on this occasion the Government were right. The evidence was that in a case where developmental immaturity is such that it ought to provide a partial defence, it would be covered by the term &#147;recognised medical condition&#148;. Furthermore, if it were to be included as a separate head, I can see no reason at all why this amendment&#151;or certainly a later one&#151;should include it simply for those under the age of 18. Why should a person of 18 with a mental age of, say, 10 be entitled to the defence when a person of, say, 40 would not be? It does not make sense. That leads to another difficulty. If a person of 40 with a mental age of 10 is entitled to a partial defence on the grounds of developmental immaturity, what about a child of 10 with a mental age of 10? As has been pointed out, he could not rely on the old rule that a child of 10 is incapable of committing a crime. The child of 10 would be guilty of murder but the man of 40 with a mental age of 10 would not. That seems an absurd result. The less we think about developmental immaturity, the safer ground we shall be on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09063091000054"></a>Amendment 154, standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Murphy, seeks to restore the Law Commission&#146;s proposal that courts could consider developmental immaturity in under-18s as a defence permitting a less onerous sentence than murder. I have listened with interest to what my noble and learned friend Lord Lloyd of Berwick said on this point and I will read carefully what he said. Perhaps the first point to make is that we treat children differently before the law. That might be why it is appropriate to think of under-18s as being treated differently in these circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09063091000056"></a>I urge the Minister to reinstate the Law Commission&#146;s proposal, which had the backing of the NSPCC, the judges of the Central Criminal Court, the criminal subcommittee of the Council of Her Majesty&#146;s Circuit Judges, the Criminal Bar Association, the Youth Justice Board, the Law Society and the Royal College of Psychiatrists. The Law Commission&#146;s report stated:</p>

Does the noble Earl agree that if an adult is suffering from a recognised medical condition which in an adult may be evidenced by developmental immaturity, that will avail the adult, but that, as the clause makes clear, if a child under 18 is suffering from developmental immaturity, that will not be a recognised medical condition that will avail the child? With enormous respect, that is the point that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Berwick, on this rare occasion, has not quite got altogether. Does the noble Earl agree?</p>

<p><a name="09063091000061"></a>That does not include any reference to the perfectly natural condition of developmental immaturity in young children. It is wrong to equate childhood developmental immaturity, a normal part of growing up, with abnormality of mind, a concept derived from cases of offending adults with learning disabilities or psychiatric disorders. That the consultation did not throw up a strong call for this measure may reflect only the small number of children affected and the lack of a culture that prioritises child welfare. I would be interested to see, if possible, some of the details of that consultation&#151;and I apologise if it has already been circulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09063091000062"></a>Dr Eileen Vizard, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist who gave evidence in the Bulger case and has been treating seriously disturbed young offenders for decades with the NSPCC, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="09063091000109"></a>&#147;The overwhelming scientific and clinical evidence base is to the effect that ordinary children between 10 to 14 years old are naturally &#145;developmentally immature&#146; and therefore unable to make fully adequate judgments about the true seriousness of their behaviour&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09063091000104"></a>Dr Vizard also highlights how far psychiatry has advanced in recent years in the understanding of brain development in children, to which the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, referred, which continues into late adolescence, and she regrets how far the courts lag behind in applying that understanding.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09063091000063"></a>I consider that this amendment falls within the spirit of the Government&#146;s welcome and progressive steps towards improving child welfare in this country in the 10 years that I have been sitting in your Lordships' House. These children of whom we are speaking will often be the sort of sexually or physically abused or neglected children about whom the Government have been so concerned and in whom they have invested so much. I recall the Quality Protects programme, which was dedicated to providing ring-fenced funding for children in care when the Government first came into office. It made such a difference. Since then there has been the Every Child Matters agenda, which looks at the vulnerability of all our children, and Care Matters, specifically for children in care. I pay tribute to the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General for her work on domestic violence, including the introduction of domestic violence courts and changes to legislation, which has protected children in families where they witness physical violence between their parents. Perhaps a boy would feel protective of his mother when he saw his father coming into the house in a drunken stupor. The Government have taken a lot of positive steps to improve protections for vulnerable children, and they may perhaps wish, on reflection, to embrace this amendment in that tradition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09063091000064"></a>Amendment 161 relates to doli incapax. I regret I cannot support it for the reasons that I have already given. It is normal for under-14 year-olds not to have the developmental maturity to be capable of crime, that is, to be fully responsible for their actions in criminal regard. Doli incapax would allow children to show that they were incapable of crime. Children

I will address developmental immaturity first, but before I do, I shall get in yet another side-swipe on the issue of diminished responsibility as a partial defence. Lawyers and psychiatrists&#151;it is nearly always psychiatrists who appear in court&#151;come from different planets. I think lawyers are from Mars and psychiatrists are from Venus, or something like that. The problem is that lawyers deal in definite contributions to causality, whereas we psychiatrists&#151;I look for support from the other psychiatrist in this House who sits on the Liberal Democrat Benches&#151;tend to deal in small proportions of causality in quite a different way, and we cannot be quite so definite about when something is caused or not.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09063091000066"></a>The difficulty with all these partial defences is that they use expert psychiatric evidence within contested trial hearings directed towards the jury determining the verdict. As we know, this is an unseemly process for many psychiatrists. It has led to a bunch of so-called expert witnesses who are not properly qualified forensic psychiatrists&#151;the &#147;rent a doc&#148; brigade&#151;who are there to be tapped into to produce a range of expert evidence that the jury has to make a decision about. It is an unseemly job, and psychiatrists are much better at giving evidence at the disposal phase when the jury has already made a decision about guilty or not guilty. This is why it is so important to have these other verdicts available to us.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09063091000067"></a>One of my psychiatrist colleagues said: &#147;Actually, we don&#146;t have all that much difficulty with diminished responsibility when somebody is really mad. It is the ones who aren&#146;t mad that create the problems&#148;. I am sorry if I am not being politically correct, but the problem is that if you have someone with a rip-roaring psychosis, then everybody is agreed on the issue. The problem is when he does not. For all kinds of reasons that I shall come to later, people do not want to go for not guilty by reason of insanity. So, we are stuck with it. I recognise that, and therefore I am going to probe on a number of issues in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09063091000068"></a>Psychiatrists have looked very carefully at the Bill. The Royal College of Psychiatrists was closely involved in the discussions that led to the changes that have come now as slight shifts in the diminished responsibility criteria. Some of my amendments&#151;not the one on developmental immaturity&#151;are probing amendments to get the thinking of the Government and the processes clearly established in the record. I particularly refer to Amendments 155, 157 and 162. I am grateful for the letter I have received from the Attorney-General and the opportunity I had to discuss the amendments with the noble Lord, Lord Bach.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09063091000069"></a>On developmental immaturity, I support the amendment that refers specifically to normal children. The Law Commission recommended that developmental immaturity should be added to the phrase,</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_178"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="09063091000110"></a>&#147;arose from a recognised medical condition&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09063091000105"></a>as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, mentioned, but people who have a recognised medical condition, particularly if it is a learning disability, already have a defence in that regard. The introduction of the additional basis for a finding of diminished responsibility of immaturity should be restricted to children who are immature as part of their normality and stage of development. To allow immaturity as a discrete and separate basis for arguing abnormality of mental functioning in an adult would be problematic. There would be disagreement about what constituted immaturity in adults, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, with the prospect of returning to unseemly discussions between experts.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09063091000070"></a>There is a case for allowing developmental immaturity. The current legislation is unfair in restricting the availability in murder cases of a defence of reduced responsibility to adults who are mentally abnormal. Children in adolescence may, as a result of their normal, less-than-fully-mature stage of development, be incapacitated in their thoughts, emotions and actions in ways that should properly reduce the level of responsibility for their actions. Biological factors such as the functioning of the frontal lobe of the brain play an important role in the development of self-control and of other abilities. The frontal lobes are involved in the individual&#146;s ability to manage the large amount of information entering consciousness from many sources, in changing behaviour and in determining impulsivity.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09063091000071"></a>The frontal lobes are thought to mature at approximately 14 years of age. However, in a case involving a child under 14, it would still be open to the prosecution to seek to rebut evidence of poor frontal lobe development by arguing that the child had matured to a sufficient degree to be fairly convicted of murder. The jury should be trusted to reject implausible claims, as it is with other defences based on expert evidence. Offenders under the age of 18 commit a very small proportion&#151;about 4 per cent&#151;of homicides. It is hard to imagine that more than a small proportion of the even smaller number of children from this group who find themselves charged with murder will be in a strong position to claim that they were suffering from diminished responsibility solely because of developmental immaturity. Even those who succeed in persuading a jury of the merits of their claim&#151;they are likely to be in the younger age group, who commit the fewest homicides&#151;will still be convicted of a lesser degree of homicide and can be sentenced to anything up to and including life imprisonment. For the few cases that meet the criteria, the recommendation meets requirements of justice recognised as fundamental in civilised legal systems across the world. The amendment is necessary because the principle of doli incapax has been abandoned. We will return to that later&#151;although the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, has spoken about it&#151;when we debate Amendment 161.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09063091000072"></a>Amendments 155 and 157 are designed to explore the rationale for the new criteria of diminished responsibility. Overall, the concept of abnormal mental functioning is better than the current concept of abnormality of mind because it emphasises mental processes rather than a static idea. I strongly favour this adjustment because it offers a legislative route towards ensuring  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_179"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that conditions put forward in the defence come within accepted diagnostic criteria. I think that we will move towards the World Health Organisation&#146;s ICD-10 criteria, or those specified by the American Psychiatric Association&#146;s <I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</I>&#151;we currently use number 4. That will avoid the idiosyncratic diagnoses that have been offered in the past by many experts. Many lawyers here will have sat through some very eccentric explanations of diminished responsibility. We would like to see the definition narrowed, and I accept that the new definition will ensure consistency.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09063091000073"></a>I was concerned that the word &#147;medical&#148; might rule out evidence of psychological conditions, and seek reassurance from the Government that it does not. I realise that to add &#147;or psychological&#148; would open up the concept too much and allow in all manner of conditions that might offer more in the way of explanation of the offence than valid partial exculpation.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09063091000074"></a>The phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="09063091000111"></a>&#147;substantially impaired D&#146;s ability to do one or more of&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09063091000106"></a>introduces a notion of relative incapacity consistent with the civil law, as expressed, for example, in the Mental Capacity Act. However, it adds a layer of complication to expert evidence, and the mere inability to do (a), (b) or (c) would be enough. By definition, if there is evidence that the defendant did not understand or form a rational judgment or exercise self-control, his relative incapacity is demonstrated. The argument in favour of incapacity is that any mental condition can then be described in terms of inferred disability expressed in medical terms.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09063091000075"></a>It is the criteria (a), (b) and (c) that cause problems: to understand the nature of D&#146;s conduct; to form a rational judgment; to exercise self-control. Elements (a) and (b) are very restrictive in terms of the types of medical disability that are allowed. They seem to mirror the old McNaughton rules for insanity in being highly cognitive. This raises concerns because, although there is also the self-control element (c) available, (a) and (b) imply a narrowing of the defence. The decision in R v Byrne, the seminal case in diminished responsibility, which identified abnormality of mind as anything that the reasonable man would term abnormal, was far broader in its potential use for justice. I should like to understand what the Government intend by their specification of particular types of disability. It would be better to clarify which situations might underpin diminished responsibility.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09063091000076"></a>The fact that the great majority of defendants will have to rely on (c), the exercise of self-control, emphasises that the reform is one that narrows the defence. For example, many defendants with quite severe schizophrenia would fail to come within the terms of (a) and (b), as they do with the insanity defence at present. The law allows them to utilise the defence. I remind noble Lords that in 1843, the McNaughton rules on insanity, to which these are very similar in many ways, were drawn up after McNaughton was found not guilty by reason of insanity. The rules were created after the public outcry following the case, which even involved Queen Victoria. The criteria are so stiff that McNaughton himself, who took a pot shot at Robert Peel&#146;s private secretary, would not have satisfied them. This appears to be going back towards very difficult cases of &#147;not guilty by reason of insanity&#148;.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09063091000077"></a>With regard to (c)&#151;self-control&#151;although this does allow an aspect of Byrne back in, because that case allowed an &#147;irresistible impulse&#148;, it may be argued by the Crown that it is only an irresistible impulse that reflects (c). The current proposal is very restrictive in cases where there is a determined, even planned, intention to kill. For example, a severely depressed woman may kill her children on the basis of a delusion that this world is such a terrible place that her children, whom she loves, would be better off no longer in it. She might still be able to judge whether her actions were legally right or wrong. Or a man may be paranoid and deluded about someone else, kill them in a planned way, based on delusions, yet still know that it is legally or even morally wrong to kill per se. Thus (a) and (b) would not be satisfied. Lack of self-control might also be very difficult to prove. A severely mentally ill person could be denied a psychiatric defence unless loss of control was clearly proven. I want to explore the Government&#146;s thinking on that.</p>

<a name="90630-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09063091000078"></a>The likely effect of the proposed reform will be to limit further the application of diminished responsibility. This will occur against a background of changing social attitudes, also affecting jurors, away from allowing partial exculpation&#151;as evidenced by the substantial drop in the number of successful pleas of diminished responsibility in the past two decades. So Amendment 155 allows for mere distortion of thinking or perception as the basis for a successful plea of diminished responsibility where the defendant was able to exercise self-control.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09063091000079"></a>I turn now to causation in Amendment 157. The inclusion of the causation element is understandable, and in giving evidence under the current law, it is always necessary for an expert in effect to offer evidence about the connection between the abnormality of functioning and the act. However, connection or offering a narrative that explains the relationship between abnormality and the act allows for a broader approach and references explicitly to causes. It seems likely, therefore, that defence experts will be cross-examined beyond what science can offer in relation to causation. However, if cause is interpreted more loosely, the problem will not necessarily arise, but of course psychiatry cannot say with hand on heart what caused a killing per se. That said, the operation of diminished responsibility in both its current and proposed versions makes it inevitable that whatever language is used in statute, doctors will be asked to say what element, if any, of a defendant&#146;s mental disorder contributed to the killing. Causation will be addressed in fact whatever the wording of the statute, but &#147;causes&#148; is too restrictive.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09063091000080"></a>Certainly I acknowledge that the abnormality of mental functioning need only be a cause of the killing since clearly it is only in extreme cases of severe mental disorder that a person&#146;s actions are driven solely from within themselves and without any influence on their behaviour arising from the circumstances or the words and actions of others, including the victim. Thus, abnormality of mental functioning should surely be a contributory cause or a basis for understanding the offence, but be neither a necessary cause nor a sufficient cause of the killing. Amendment 157 proposes that nothing beyond the word &#147;understanding&#148; is required in the statute and

Again, I want to probe what the Government think will be the outcome of the use of the defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09063091000081"></a>Finally, I know that many of the lawyers here will say that Amendment 162 is completely loopy because it is entirely unnecessary, and I have had the benefit of discussions with the noble Lord, Lord Bach, about it. Why is it necessary to give a partial defence of diminished responsibility to a charge of attempted murder when the whole point of the diminished responsibility plea is to move from murder to manslaughter, where a range of sentence options is already available? I accept that that is a very good point.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09063091000082"></a>I want to talk about what happens in practice, because although the offence of attempted murder in legal terms is thought of as a lesser offence than murder, in psychiatric terms it is actually often as severe because the risk that the individual poses is exactly the same as the risk of murder. In terms of preventing risk to others, the person often requires a rapid disposal from the courts to an appropriate place for treatment. The difficulties lie in persuading individuals charged with an offence that was not followed through to the completion of a murder but was an attempted murder to plead insanity. At this point the only defence&#151;if they are going to be disposed of quickly by the court&#151;is the defence of not guilty by reason of insanity. Getting people to plead insanity is very difficult indeed. Trying to persuade a patient is hard to do because it is one thing for someone to say, &#147;I accept that I have diminished responsibility for this act, and please put forward that point&#148;, but quite another for them to say, &#147;Yes, I am insane or was insane when I did it&#148;. Defendants do not like to have it charged.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09063091000083"></a>What happens in practice is that juries often bring in a guilty verdict and individuals are sent to prison where they languish while waiting for a psychiatric opinion. It can take three or four months for someone with a psychosis to get out of prison and into an appropriate special hospital or regional secure unit. While I accept that in legal terms this amendment puts forward an odd proposal, I would like to explore how a similar provision can be made for those charged with attempted murder.</p>

One of the difficulties for psychiatrists who have any contact with the courts and the law is that we are working on totally different sets of understandings. It is not that one side or the other is not looking for the truth of what has gone on, but in a sense the second part of the Title of this Bill points to the problem. The concepts of justice are really quite different. For psychiatrists, it is trying to understand what is appropriate for this particular person at this particular time with this particular kind of mental functioning. That is what I should like to talk about for a few minutes.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09063091000085"></a>It is important first to recognise that human beings and their mental functioning are nothing like computers. For a computer, you draw up a plan, build the machine, plug it in and, with the addition of a little software, it is operational. But that is not how the minds of human beings are constructed. They develop over a period of time, and they do not develop all of a piece. Noble Lords will know from their children&#151;or, looking around the Chamber, perhaps from their grandchildren&#151;that as they grow and develop, they change quite dramatically. Some aspects remain remarkably the same, but other elements grow and change. Their emotional, physical and intellectual aspects, along with their capacity to stick with things, all change profoundly, but they do not do so all of a piece. Some young people develop emotionally at a completely different pace from their cognitive, intellectual development, while others develop impulse control much more slowly, or in some cases with precocious speed&#151;which usually leads to other problems.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09063091000086"></a>Earlier a noble Lord mentioned the example of someone aged 40 with a mental age of 10. It is an interesting rule of thumb, but it is completely meaningless because there is no such thing as a mental age of 10. In any case, does it mean someone&#146;s intellectual age, their emotional development, or something else? Furthermore, someone who reaches the age of 40 will have developed beyond the age of 10 in a whole series of ways. So the idea of a &#147;mental age of 10&#148; is a meaningless concept from the psychiatric point of view, and indeed from the factual one as well. What we have is young children growing up and developing different components of their personalities. By the age of 10, some will behave like 15 year-olds, while some at the age of 18 will behave like 12 year-olds. Indeed, some 15 year-olds will behave this minute like 13 year-olds, but in five minutes&#146; time like 21 year-olds, and then a bit later to behaving like three year-olds. None of this is consistent, as development in young people is a fluid thing. The idea that we should ignore this and treat everyone as if they were 21 year-old adults or, worse still, 45 year-old adults, is not just. It does not recognise the reality of human development.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09063091000087"></a>If what we are about is creating law, that is all very well, but if what we are about is trying to make the law just, then we have to recognise the reality that people do not develop all of a piece and that by the age of 10, they are not functioning as they will at the age of 14, 15, 17, 21 or 50.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09063091000088"></a>That is why the amendments bring into the Bill the notion that not everybody is fully developed, and furthermore that the development may be impaired as part of the normal function of growing up. There were times when we behaved and thought more immaturely than others at the same stage at school. There may also be a falling back, a stunting or a disability that we need to regard as well. Some of the amendments are trying to point up that this notion of developmental immaturity may not necessarily be the same as a medical condition. That is the point. It is not all about illness. Whenever someone gets pregnant and has a baby, being pregnant is not a medical condition&#151;it is not an illness&#151;but many people who get pregnant also get illnesses. That is why there is such a crossover. We should not treat normal development as thought it

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09063091000089"></a>The second element is that when people fall ill with certain kinds of mental disorders or psychosis, their perception of reality becomes disturbed. Sometimes that is terribly obvious; the person is clearly psychotic, acutely so, suffering from a schizophrenic illness of some description that is acute and severe. They completely misunderstand what is going on. That situation is relatively simple and straightforward. But there are also other situations where the person may be disturbed in their thinking right from the beginning; they are completely rational, but from a disturbed base. Indeed, one of the cases that Freud treated and wrote about was a judge who suffered from a condition like this, who was perfectly able to operate rationally in respect of everybody else, but inside they were disturbed.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09063091000090"></a>If we do not take these things into account, we will not produce a just outcome&#151;not for children who are not fully developed; not for those who have developed, but not completely when they are adults; and not for those who fall ill with a mental illness.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09063091000091"></a>In the Bill, as has already been mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, &#147;medical condition&#148; is identified. I subscribe to this tightening, clarification and removal of the eccentricities and the idiosyncrasies of certain expert witnesses. I would seek from the noble Baroness a clarification that &#147;medical condition&#148; also means psychiatric conditions. I suspect that she will have little difficulty in reassuring us on that, but it is important to have it on the face of the Bill, so that people are absolutely clear about it.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09063091000092"></a>There is much more that one could say about this Bill, but I will finish with one particular component; the plea of insanity. This has always seemed to me to be a particularly peculiar legal notion. The whole point about somebody being seriously mentally ill with a psychosis is that they do not have insight. They do not know they are mentally ill. They believe that the explanation that they are applying to the disturbed situation is a correct appreciation of reality. When you say to them, &#147;I think you ought to plead insanity&#148;, they say, &#147;You must be mad. I am not insane; it is you who do not understand what is going on&#148;. The irony of it is that the person who pleads insanity is less likely to be suffering from a psychosis than the person who has really got a psychosis, because they do not understand it and have no insight.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09063091000093"></a>I trust I have at least said enough to demonstrate that if lawyers are from Mars, psychiatrists are not from the moon. They are dealing with real people and real problems. Our responsibility is to try to ensure that the laws that pass through this place and to another place encode justice in the capacity for their implementation, and not merely a set of rules that may be convenient but does not apply to the complexity of humanity.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09063091000095"></a>I am very concerned about the potential and actual injustice to a very small number of young people, aged between 10 and 18, who are caught at the moment, rare though it may be, by the fact that, as I understand it, psychiatrists are very cautious about finding a recognised medical condition as set out in Clause 42 in proposed new sub-paragraph (1)(1)(a). Therefore, if one requires a recognised medical condition in relation to a teenager, it would be likely, as I understand it, that a psychiatrist would hold that it would be very difficult to say that this is a recognised medical condition, because it may be an element of developmental immaturity. Consequently, at the age of 25, an individual might be seen to have a recognised medical condition, but at the age of 15 would not. Therefore, at the age of 15 that individual might be found guilty of murder, whereas at the age of 25 they would not be found guilty of murder. That, as a lawyer and not as a psychiatrist, is the nub of the problem. It is the young person who is disadvantaged compared with the adult under the proposed new sub-paragraph.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09063091000096"></a>It is a serious matter. If the Government are going to say that Amendments 151 and 154 are not appropriate, they have to grapple with the fact that it is almost impossible to tell the distinction between this developmental immaturity and a real recognised medical condition that would continue throughout adulthood. I do not know how the Government manage to do that. These two amendments&#151;I do not think it matters which of them goes forward&#151;make it possible to show that a child, or young person, within the age group to which that young person belongs, is exhibiting a degree of immaturity or possibly a recognised medical condition, that differentiates that young person from the normal young person who would be behaving in a normal way, which would be unlikely, among other things, to be committing murder.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09063091000097"></a>One has to recognise that Mary Bell and the Bulger murderers all behaved in quite extraordinarily bizarre ways, and when the psychiatrist saw them, as I understand it&#151;though I have never read the reports&#151;they had very considerable medical problems, and had had, of course, absolutely appalling upbringings. Whether or not, if this particular amendment was in place, they would have been found guilty of murder is another matter; but at least they would have had the opportunity for that situation to have been considered. It must be wrong in principle, and it must be unjust, that if you are 25 and you have a condition you will not be a murderer, but if you are 15 and have a condition that is difficult to diagnose, you will be a murderer. There has to be something wrong with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09063091000099"></a>Our amendments in this group were suggested by the Standing Committee for Youth Justice. They reinsert, as will be obvious to all of your Lordships, the Law Commission&#146;s recommendation in its 2004 Report <I>Partial Defences to Murder</I>, which was designed to bring the criminal law into compliance with Article 40 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09063091000100"></a>The Law Commission&#146;s report on partial defences noted the opinion of one expert, the forensic psychiatrist Dr Eileen Vizard, who felt that the definition of diminished responsibility is defective in relation to children and young people because, as your Lordships are well aware, it omits references to developmental immaturity. The Law Commission agreed that there was a need to make these changes, but ultimately preferred to wait for a discrete review of the law of murder as it relates to children.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09063091000101"></a>Our amendments would, we believe, ensure that the diminished responsibility partial defence could be available to a child or a young person under the age of 18 if their developmental immaturity substantially impairs their ability to understand the nature of their conduct. They would be guilty of manslaughter rather than murder, giving the judge a full range of sentencing options, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, has already observed.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09063091000102"></a>As the honourable David Howarth said on behalf of the Liberal Democrats in another place, the way the clause in the Bill is drafted is anomalous. A person who is physically 40 but has a mental age of 10 would be covered; the same would be true of a 17 year-old with the mental development of a 10 year-old. The trial would proceed on the basis, in other words, that there was a partial defence. Yet that benefit would not extend to a child of 10 who acted like a child of 10. Our amendments would give children the benefit of being children without having to show that they were immature for their age. They cannot understand the nature of their conduct under proposed new subsection (1)(a) of Section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957 because of their developmental immaturity.</p>

I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, and the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, for the powerful speeches they made enabling us all better to understand things from a psychiatric and psychological point of view. That is a very important benefit. I will take very seriously the invitation of a number of noble Lords, particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, and the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, to say things on the record which clearly identifies the way in which the Government are thinking. Bearing in mind the nature and breadth of these amendments, I anticipate that that might take me a little while.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="090630103000003"></a>Amendment 151, which was spoken to so well by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, on behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, Amendments 155A,  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_186"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>156A and 156B, spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and Amendment 154, spoken to by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, all deal with developmental immaturity. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said quite clearly that the concept of developmental immaturity formed part of the Law Commission&#146;s recommendations on reform of the partial defence of diminished responsibility. The Law Commission recommended that in the case of a person aged under 18, developmental immaturity ought to be a possible basis for the partial defence as well as or in combination with an abnormality of mental functioning arising from a recognised medical condition. The Law Commission&#146;s recommendation was specifically limited to defendants aged under 18, as a number of noble Lords have said. Amendment 151 would of course go even further and apply it to any defendant. However, following very wide consultation, the Government decided not to accept the Law Commission&#146;s recommendation to extend the partial defence of diminished responsibility to include a developmental immaturity limb for under-18s and would certainly not support a developmental immaturity limb without any age limit.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="090630103000004"></a>It is important to explain why we came to that conclusion. There are two reasons. The first is that there is no provision for developmental immaturity in the current law of diminished responsibility, and we do not believe that the case has been made that there is a real problem to be addressed. Indeed, the diminished responsibility partial defence should, we believe, be fully adequate to meet appropriate cases involving under 18 year-olds and adult defendants. I accept entirely what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, that there is a wide variation of maturity and that people mature at different ages, but we have to look at the mischief that needs to be cured. Is this a mischief that needs to be addressed?</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="090630103000005"></a>Secondly, there are some clear drawbacks to introducing the developmental immaturity limb to the defence. When discussing the concept of developmental immaturity, a distinction has been made by some between so-called abnormal and normal developmental immaturity. We heard that in this debate. An abnormal immaturity, as has been clear from various statements, is where the child is in some way unusually underdeveloped for their age. The Government believe that such abnormal immaturity is covered by the diminished responsibility partial defence we are proposing, as we would expect the child in such a case to be suffering from a recognised medical condition. So we would argue that there is no need to make explicit provision. That would also apply to an abnormally immature adult.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="090630103000006"></a>Normal immaturity&#151;if that is not a contradiction in terms&#151;is where the child is around the level of maturity one would expect for their age but less mature than one would expect an adult to be. We accept that the proposed diminished responsibility partial defence does not make provision for normal immaturity but we are not at all convinced that it is necessary or desirable to introduce a separate developmental immaturity limb for this purpose, as was said by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. As I have indicated, during our consultation we did not receive any evidence that the existing law is causing real difficulties in practice as a result of the absence of a developmental

A number of noble Lords underlined that we have to address the injustice; that point was made strongly by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="090630103000007"></a>I fully understand and sympathise with the concerns of noble Lords that young people who are genuinely vulnerable should be able to benefit from the diminished responsibility partial defence to murder, a point strongly made by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, among others.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="090630103000008"></a>Let me reassure your Lordships about cases which are undeniably deserving and which would be categorised as abnormal immaturity. For example, if the child defendant has been diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder and this has substantially impaired his or her ability to understand the nature of their conduct, to form a rational judgment or exercise self-control, or any combination of the three, such a child would fall within the diminished responsibility partial defence as proposed. The same considerations would apply if one were to substitute, for example, learning disability or frontal lobe disorder for autistic spectrum disorder in the example that I have just given.</p>

<a name="90630-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="090630103000009"></a>The conditions I have mentioned are all listed in the World Health Organisation&#146;s <I>International Classification of Diseases</I>&#151;ICD-10&#151;and the American Psychiatric Association&#146;s <I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</I><I>of Mental Disorders</I>. I hope that noble Lords will accept that these are probably the best known and most highly regarded&#151;</p>

My understanding is that the frontal lobes of children mature at about the age of 14, so it would be normal for the frontal lobes of a 13 or 12 year-old to be immature and therefore for those children to be particularly susceptible to impulsive behaviour. If I heard the noble and learned Baroness correctly, she said that, where the development of the frontal lobes was immature, it would be recognised as a mental condition. That probably highlights the difficulty. We are not saying that children who lack development of their frontal lobes have a mental condition but that it is just normal for children of 13 or 12 not to have developed those frontal lobes. We want the courts to be able to take account of that. Perhaps I misunderstood the noble and learned Baroness.</p>

These lists are probably the best known and most highly regarded of the accepted classificatory systems which together encompass the recognised physical, psychiatric and psychological conditions and which the Government expect will be used when considering whether a medical condition is recognised.

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="090630103000012"></a>We are therefore quite sure that young people suffering from these conditions would in no way be excluded from running the diminished responsibility defence by absence of a developmental immaturity limb. On the other hand, were the developmental immaturity provision to be included, there is a risk that the defence would become too wide and permit potentially unmeritorious cases to succeed. Such a change would complicate and probably lengthen the trial without good reason in many cases where a defence of diminished responsibility should not be available as the defendant knows what they are doing and are able to function &#147;normally&#148;.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="090630103000013"></a>We recognise that the level of maturity of defendants, even within so-called &#147;normal&#148; maturity, will vary. Some defendants will have lower levels of maturity for their age than others, but we do not consider that such developmental immaturity should of itself be sufficient grounds for reducing a murder conviction to manslaughter, which would set the threshold partial defences too low. It should be available only where the killing was linked to an abnormality of mental functioning arising from a recognised medical condition. We are concerned that, should developmental immaturity be available as a basis for the partial defence, there would be clear potential for it to operate unacceptably and undesirably.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="090630103000014"></a>A teenager, in a fight with another teenager, who impulsively pulls the knife that he is carrying and stabs the other youth to death, could seek to argue the defence, even if there was nothing identifiably&#151;to put it colloquially&#151;&#147;wrong&#148; with them and they were not &#147;abnormally&#148; developmentally immature for their age but simply less mature than adults. We do not believe that there should be the possibility of this amounting to sufficient grounds to reduce the ensuing verdict from murder to manslaughter.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="090630103000015"></a>There is no issue of young people being denied access to the diminished responsibility partial defence or being disadvantaged with respect to adults. Wherever the defendant, young person or adult suffers from an abnormality of mental functioning arising from a recognised medical condition, it will be open to them to argue that this substantially impaired their ability to understand the nature of their conduct, form a rational judgment, exercise self-control or a combination of the three. If the jury agrees and finds that impairment of these abilities caused or was a significant contributory factor in the defendant&#146;s carrying out the killing, the defence will succeed. We believe that it is right that the partial defence should apply only in these circumstances. I hope that that explanation will assist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="090630103000016"></a>Amendment 153 would effectively negate one of the central changes that we are seeking to make to the partial defence of diminished responsibility by removing the requirement that the defendant&#146;s abnormality of mental functioning arose from a recognised medical condition. The requirement that the defendant&#146;s abnormality of functioning must have arisen from a recognised medical condition follows the Law

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="090630103000017"></a>The concept of &#147;recognised medical condition&#148; represents in our view a much more helpful, up-to-date formulation than the current law and it has found widespread support. We are confident that it will prove to be a much more helpful term than the current phrase &#147;abnormality of mind&#148;, an expression that has no meaning in current medical terminology&#151;we have heard that explored extensively this evening.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="090630103000018"></a>There is a risk that if the requirement for a recognised medical condition is removed it will allow the partial defence to be raised both by anyone who considers themselves mentally abnormal, even where there is no medical basis whatever for the claim, and by those whose abnormality of mental functioning results from actions on their part, such as consuming alcohol or illegal drugs. The partial defence should not succeed in such circumstances. I can assure your Lordships that the term &#147;recognised medical condition&#148; is sufficiently flexible to accommodate any changes in the consensus about whether a particular set of symptoms constitutes an actual condition. The accepted classificatory systems which cover recognised physical, psychiatric and psychological condition systems will be used when seeking to establish that the defendant was suffering from a recognised medical condition. It will also be possible, however, in relation to a condition not yet included in such a list for the defence to call on evidence from a recognised specialist who has had their work peer-reviewed or validated in some other way. A jury would then decide how to treat this evidence after appropriate direction had been given by the judge. This is important because it allows the law to keep abreast of medical developments in this area, which we have not been able to do in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="090630103000019"></a>As to Amendment 155, the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, would extend the scope of what must be substantially impaired by the abnormality of mental functioning arising from a recognised medical condition to include the defendant&#146;s perception of reality. The Government do not believe this is necessary or appropriate, as in most cases where the defendant&#146;s perception of reality is substantially impaired, the defendant&#146;s ability to understand the nature of his conduct or to form a rational judgment will also be substantially impaired. That part of the test for diminished responsibility would already have been met and there would be no need for the amendment. In the unlikely event of cases arising where a defendant&#146;s perception of reality is substantially impaired but his ability to understand the nature of his conduct, form a rational judgment and exercise self-control are not, we do not consider that he should be able to benefit from the partial defence as these issues go right to the heart of the case for reduced responsibility in homicide cases where there is an abnormality of mental function.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="090630103000020"></a>As to Amendments 156 and 157, they would appear to be aimed at removing the requirement that a defendant&#146;s abnormality of mental functioning must have been at least a significant contributing factor in causing him to act as he did and I am happy to explain that as the noble Baroness invited me to. The Government consider it is necessary to spell out what connection between the abnormality of mental functioning and the killing is required for the partial defence to succeed. Otherwise, random coincidence would suffice. For this reason, Clause 42 provides that the abnormality of mental functioning must provide an explanation for the killing in the sense that it must have been at least a significant contributing factor in causing the defendant to act as he did. It need not be the only cause or even the most important factor in causing the behaviour but it must be more than merely a trivial factor. We believe this gets the balance about right.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="090630103000021"></a>The effect of Amendment 156 would be to leave only the requirement that the abnormality of mental functioning must provide an explanation for the defendant&#146;s acts and omissions in doing or being party to the killing. We do not consider that this provides enough clarity about what is required. The defence could easily end up being either too easy or too difficult to access, depending on the interpretation of the courts, whether by requiring a full explanation so that it has to be the main cause or by allowing any explanation, however obscure, to suffice.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="090630103000022"></a>I am saddened that the noble Baroness should have described her Amendment 162 in such deprecating terms. I am sure nobody would have addressed her in such an unkind way. Amendment 162 would extend the ambit of the partial defence of diminished responsibility so that it applies to attempted murder. I understand what she says about the dilemma that many people are in with regard to the diagnostic assessment of a person&#146;s condition. The whole concept of diminished responsibility, however, works as a partial defence to murder because of the availability of the alternative verdict of manslaughter. As the noble Baroness is aware, no such alternative is available in the case of attempted murder. It would in effect therefore be a full defence leading to an acquittal. I know that is not what the noble Baroness would want to see.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="090630103000023"></a>The verdict of manslaughter serves a particular function in relation to homicide in that it allows the mandatory life sentence to be avoided. The same considerations do not apply in relation to other offences where mitigating factors can already be prayed in aid at the point of sentencing. I hope the noble Baroness will find that, albeit I am a lawyer, I still belong to Venus.</p>

<a name="090630103000026"></a><b><a name="90630-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="090630103000170"></a>Lord Jay of Ewelme:</b> My Lords, I am very glad to be able to introduce this short debate this evening, and particularly glad that it has elicited two maiden speeches&#151;from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Wakefield and the Minister. I greatly look forward to hearing both speeches.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="090630103000027"></a>It is nearly four years since heads of state and government, at Canadian instigation, adopted the doctrine of responsibility to protect, or R2P in the jargon, at the 2005 United Nations World Summit. Behind that jargon lies a principle of huge importance: a pledge by world leaders to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We need only to recall for a moment some of the atrocities of recent years to realise the difference that this doctrine, had it been in effect, might have made&#151;on the massacres in Rwanda, which showed that the machete is as deadly a weapon of mass destruction as the sophisticated weaponry of the West; the civil war in Sudan; the atrocities in Darfur; and the sustained misgovernment in Zimbabwe. There are others, and in other parts of the world.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_192"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="090630103000028"></a>The doctrine of responsibility to protect is thus important, necessary and potentially far reaching, with the possibility of making a huge and positive impact on many of the world's most vulnerable people. R2P has also, alas, been contentious. The Europeans have, on the whole, been enthusiastic, though not always at one. The United States, scarred by the intervention in Iraq, has feared that it may lead to pressure for similar adventures elsewhere. Many developing countries fear the opposite: that R2P may instead be used to justify such adventures. The Russians and the Chinese have seen it as leading to an unacceptable intervention in the affairs of other states. So, shamefully, little has happened to put the doctrine into effect.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="090630103000029"></a>Fortunately, the new UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, has recognised the need for action and, on the basis of work by his special representative, Ed Luck, has produced a report to the UN General Assembly that will, I understand, be debated next week. This provides a real opportunity for the UN to breathe life into the doctrine of R2P; and for the Government to use their undoubted influence to ensure this happens at next week's debate and beyond. The UN Secretary-General's report makes it clear that R2P is not and should not be seen as some neo-colonialist assault by the developed countries on the sovereignty of others. It should be seen for what it is: a recognition by the international community as a whole of responsibility to do all it can to prevent atrocities in future.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="090630103000030"></a>The Secretary-General set out a three-pillar approach for putting the doctrine into practice: first, that states themselves&#151;this is a hugely important point&#151;have the primary responsibility for protecting their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity; secondly, that the international community has the responsibility to help them do so, by encouragement, by aid and by capacity building, and to focus in particular on countries which are under stress, and before conflicts and crises break out; and, thirdly, only where a state is &#147;manifestly failing&#148; to protect its population, the international community has the responsibility to take timely and decisive action to prevent atrocities; such action may range from bilateral and regional pressure on recalcitrant states through sanctions to&#151;if all else fails&#151;coercive measures under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, but always with UN Security Council authorisation. Responsibility, in other words, is on all of us to protect the vulnerable.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="090630103000031"></a>I have mentioned past atrocities that the doctrine of responsibility to protect might have averted, but the key now is to anticipate and prevent future crises. Some of these are already too clearly on the horizon. Let us for a moment consider not Darfur, which rightly gets the world's attention, but Sudan and the growing tensions between north and south, which, wrongly, do not. As part of the comprehensive peace agreement between north and south that ended one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars, the south will hold a referendum in two years&#146; time on whether to secede. It is almost certain that it will vote to do so. It is possible, perhaps probable, that the north will try to prevent it. The result could well be yet another catastrophic civil war.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="090630103000032"></a>I was in south Sudan a few months ago for the medical charity I chair, Merlin&#151;an interest I declare this evening. I saw how fragile is the recovery from the civil war. I saw, too, how, within the south, weak government is leading even now to local conflict, exacerbated by incursions from across the border. If to this already explosive mixture is added a civil war between north and south, there will be a massive humanitarian disaster.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="090630103000033"></a>The point is that we know all this now; we do not need to wait until disaster happens to try, too late, to stop it. Early warning of crises, as the Secretary-General's report makes clear, is an essential element in putting R2P into effect, so that the international community as a whole&#151;neighbouring states, regional organisations, the developed world&#151;recognises its responsibility to act. There could be no clearer example than Sudan of the need to work hard now to put that doctrine into effect.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="090630103000034"></a>Against that background, I ask the Minister to ensure that putting the doctrine of responsibility to protect into effect gets to the top of our foreign policy agenda, with the departments concerned, especially the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence, working closely together so that the tools of our foreign policy&#151;diplomacy, economic aid and our peacekeeping forces&#151;are properly co-ordinated. I am not one of those who advocates the reintegration of the FCO and DfID, but I believe that there is a need for and scope for much closer co-operation between the departments and, in particular, between the instruments of our foreign policy that they control. I ask the Government to look again, as a number of Members of your Lordships&#146; House have already urged, at the misguided cuts in our conflict prevention budget.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="090630103000035"></a>In addition, I suggest that we work to ensure the UN General Assembly reconfirms R2P at its meeting next week and agrees on the urgent need to put it into effect; that we make the doctrine a central plank of our foreign policy dialogue with the Obama Administration; that we work within the European Union, for which the Minister is uniquely well placed, and in particular with the Swedish presidency that takes office tomorrow, to put the doctrine at the top of the EU's agenda too; that we work equally hard&#151;I hope that I am not pre-empting here the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Howell&#151;to put responsibility to protect at the top of the Commonwealth's agenda&#151;no issue plays better than this to the Commonwealth's unique strengths; that we work with the Canadians, as instigators of the doctrine, and as G8 hosts next year, to put the doctrine high the G8 agenda; and that we build up a dialogue on responsibility to protect with the African Union, the charter of which includes the important and welcome principle of non-indifference to grave crimes committed within African Union member states.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="090630103000036"></a>Speeches about Britain's foreign policy regularly vaunt the influence we can bring to bear through the network of groupings to which we belong. I have drafted many such speeches myself. Here is an opportunity to show what we mean. Finally, Britain's commitment to implementing this doctrine should be a criterion

I extend a particularly warm welcome to my noble friend Lady Kinnock of Holyhead. She brings to this House great experience, wisdom and courage as well as a fine record of commitment to the cause of justice.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="090630103000038"></a>I endorse the United Nations report on the responsibility to protect. It identifies four major evils and tries to tell us how to anticipate and deal with them. These evils are genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. I have nothing against the doctrine of responsibility to protect. In fact, I endorse it wholeheartedly. However, as the document is formulated, there are important gaps. I will briefly highlight five of them, and hope that the Minister will feed them into the appropriate channels.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="090630103000039"></a>First, those four evils overlap. It is not easy, for example, to distinguish between genocide and crimes against humanity or between genocide and war crimes. Equally importantly, these evils arise differently. Some arise because the state is evil. Others arise because the state has collapsed. In one case, the state is responsible, in the other, the absence of the state is responsible. These two situations need to be distinguished because they call for two kinds of responses. The United Nations document tends to homogenise them and fails to appreciate the need for different strategies.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="090630103000040"></a>Secondly, we need to evolve a global consensus on what obligations and responsibilities the outside world has. We tend to assume that the West, or the world at large, has the responsibility to intervene in situations of this kind. There are major powers that take a different view because they have suffered at the hands of the West&#146;s doctrine of intervention. China, for example, places great responsibility on the doctrine of sovereignty and does not think that it is its business to interfere when evils of this kind occur. The Chinese have made that very clear in their official policy documents. To some extent, India has tended to take this view as well, because it does not want outside powers to interfere in Kashmir or with lots of other internal problems.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="090630103000041"></a>The United Nations document makes the mistaken assumption that there is already a universal consensus on intervening in situations of this kind. That is arrogant and presumptuous. We must develop a global consensus by encouraging a dialogue between the western and Chinese points of view. Both make important points. Unless we do so, we will be working at cross purposes.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="090630103000042"></a>The third point that needs some attention is the document&#146;s total absence of mention of the need to restructure the United Nations. The United Nations as it is constituted, its structure and procedures, reflect the world of the late 1940s. It is dominated by the Security Council, where five members have the right of veto. The United Nations is seen as just another stage for its members to pursue their national interests. It  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_195"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 195</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should become a genuinely global forum where members deliberate in a calm and disinterested manner and reflect the viewpoint of humanity at large. If the United Nations is to carry moral and political authority it will need to be far more representative than it is. Muslim voices and the voices of other developing countries need to be given greater prominence. I should also have thought that the United Nations would benefit greatly if it had a standing commission keeping a global watch on the world at large and alerting the world community to potentially dangerous situations.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="090630103000043"></a>Fourthly, in situations of the four evils that we talked about, military intervention sometimes becomes necessary. No one can deny that. But military intervention cannot be the first course of action. When it is undertaken, it needs to be guided by an appropriate ethics, which is absent. There should be clear guiding principles as to when it should be undertaken to ensure consistency in international action. It should be authorised by the United Nations and well judged, because military intervention works in certain situations and not in others. It would not work in Myanmar or Burma today and it would not have worked against Zaire under Mobutu. When the legality of military intervention is in doubt, as it was in the case of Iraq, we should make it a point of law to refer to the International Court of Justice, which would have helped us greatly in the case of Iraq. The purpose of military intervention should be not to run the country or discipline the natives and sort them out but rather to restore normalcy and hope that over time the country, now handed over to its citizens, will be able to manage its own affairs.</p>

<a name="90630-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="090630103000044"></a>My fifth and final point is to do with the need to explore non-military forms of intervention. We have got into a binary opposition: either we abstain and do nothing, or we move in with armed forces. Is there no other way; no middle space that we should be exploring? I should have thought that there are half a dozen ways that we could move in such situations. Countries involved in these four evils could be expelled from international bodies, or recognition given to them in international law can be withdrawn temporarily. We could involve other agencies in civil society&#151;for example, the churches, which wield enormous power. I am struck by the fact that the Buddhist monks endorsed the murder of Pol Pot or that the Vatican itself stayed quiet in relation to Rwanda.</p>

I hope that in particular the three right reverend Prelates on the Bench of Bishops will forgive me if I say&#151;and it is to a certain extent like spitting in church&#151;that I have not always been the greatest admirer of the

I hope that the United Nations gets it right next week in the laudable aims that the noble Lord, Lord Jay, has set out. The noble Lord is right: we must always try to help, as we always have done under Governments of both colours. The aims of the responsibility to protect are high and good, but it is much easier to assert or say as some new United Nations norm that if a national Government attack their own people or fail to prevent their starvation then they forfeit their sovereignty, than it is to do something about it in a practical way or find constant and reliable partners to help those who are in the lead to help in this task.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="090630103000048"></a>I am also aware that behind the laudable aim of the responsibility to protect there are others who have further agendas that might not be in the national interest of powerful nations such as the United Kingdom. I hope that it is not politically incorrect to talk about national interests in a context where the United Nations is in the forefront. Of course we need to help those who need help, but we should do so throughout by maintaining our ability to take sovereign decisions to dispatch our Armed Forces or to deploy diplomatic pressure or apply and then sustain sanctions or whatever.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="090630103000049"></a>Yet I think that there are others who use this excellent instinct of wishing to try to help to promote another and more nebulous concept of some, at present, equally nebulous international community which is going to take over and do all these things. There are a number of organisations which I find rather mysterious but increasingly powerful, referred to as international non-governmental organisations, such as the Open Society Institute or the World Federalist Movement. They wish us to float away completely from national interests, voters and democratic legitimacy, and devise new so-called guiding principles, without much democratic foundation, for members of what is known as the broad international community. They are all anointed by something that I have seen called the &#147;emerging international judicial consensus&#148;, whatever that is, and are all supported by lots of new UN special envoys, although mercifully not yet any UN tsars. I advise the UN not to adopt tsars in this concept. I think that the idea of a responsibility to protect is excellent but its broad principles, which I strongly support, must not be hijacked by those who have other agendas along the lines of world government.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="090630103000050"></a>Thirdly, we must not let other countries off the hook in sharing the burden of doing rather than sharing the fun and gratification of rhetorical grandstanding. There will always be pleas from others, once the international conference room oratory has stopped, that they are too poor or that they simply do not have the military strength to help, leaving the United Kingdom, the United States&#151;which is so often criticised at the same time as it is looked to for help in these areas&#151;and a few others to bear the unshared burden. I am sorry to use diplomatically incorrect language but it is shameful how little some of our European neighbours have contributed to burden-sharing, not only in recent conflicts but in helping in the humanitarian spin-offs which are so manifest in the world around us. That said, we must stand ready to help throughout&#151;I entirely support what the noble Lord, Lord Jay of Ewelme, said&#151;although I do not

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="090630103000051"></a>Fourthly and lastly&#151;and well within time, as the Whip on the Front Bench will be pleased to hear, let alone the Chief Whip, who I am flattered to see in his place listening intently to my speech&#151;there is one very great conundrum that underlines and underpins this issue, and that is the dilemma to which the noble Lord, Lord Jay, referred. First, do great countries such as the United Kingdom have the moral authority to intervene in anything at all? Secondly, if we decide that we have the might, the means and the moral authority to intervene with some of our allies and friends, any such intervention, however well intentioned, will be seen as imperialism by other means, with stronger nations trampling on the sovereignty of troubled nations. That would certainly be the cry should we be at the borders of a Burma or a Zimbabwe, let alone an Iran if things turn worse there. I, for one, do not know what the answer to this conundrum is, and I hope that next week&#146;s deliberations help us to that end.</p>

For that reason alone, I am enthusiastic to speak in this debate. Since the time of St Augustine of Hippo, Christian ethicists have participated in public debates and private reflection to help refine and clarify what constitutes the appropriate use of military force in statecraft. Participants within this dialogue&#151;jurists, ethicists, politicians and generals&#151;have sought to shape and develop the just war tradition so that its relevance is retained even when applied to entirely new security challenges. Among the Bishops, the the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, has contributed seminally to these debates in this House. The development of responsibility to protect as an emerging norm in international relations is

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="090630103000055"></a>After having taken the initial step&#151;namely, the conceptualisaton and fundamental recognition of R2P&#151;the challenge now is to look at ways in which we can move towards a clearer definition and operation of the responsibility to protect. Only by working through these issues will the international community be successful in preventing crimes against humanity or, at the very least, ending them at an early stage. If it can do that, the international community might yet fulfil its responsibility for the preservation of peace in the 21st century.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="090630103000056"></a>There is a risk, however, that in all this we might become too state-centric, so to speak. R2P breaks once and for all with the state-centric concept of humanitarian intervention with its overt reliance on military action. In its place stands a three-pillar concept of security, involving a responsibility to prevent, a responsibility to react and a responsibility to rebuild. This understanding of human security has been part of the core of the R2P norm from the Canadian sponsored report in 2001 through to the publication of the report implementing the responsibility to protect by the UN Secretary-General in January 2009.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="090630103000057"></a>In a 24/7 media culture, the focus is invariably on our responsibility to react, but our priority must be on a responsibility to prevent. There is a specific role here for civil society and the churches, as the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, has already suggested. As I noted, Wakefield diocese has formal links with two Anglican dioceses in other countries&#151;the diocese of Mara in Tanzania and the diocese of Faisalabad in Pakistan. It also has vital links with the churches in Georgia. Last summer I was able to issue a statement on behalf of the Church of England urging Georgian restraint and condemning the disproportionate use of force by Russia in the tragic war there.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="090630103000058"></a>Our relationship with Mara in Tanzania goes back more than 20 years and has as its motto in Swahili, &#147;Bega kwa bega&#148;, which translated means, &#147;Shoulder to shoulder&#148;. This motto, which is particularly apt given today&#146;s debate, has been practised through many conversations, visits and joint projects by the people of both dioceses which continue to enrich the link. I was there myself last October. It is the myriad of relationships like this that underpin and give meaning to our understanding of responsibility to protect. I very much hope that, in thinking about what steps need to be taken to give effect to the United Nations doctrine of responsibility to protect, Her Majesty&#146;s Government recognise that there are those on this Bench who believe that human rights and security are indivisible and that the responsibility to protect is therefore a matter of direct concern for everyone and not just Governments.</p>

I think I can say that he was the senior Franciscan &#147;Brother of Penance&#148; because he led the ancient Third Order of St Francis in its European province from 1991 to 1996. He is also chair of the Liturgical Commission. He has obviously set a very good example because his sons, Aidan and Gregory, are both ordained priests. We look forward very much to his future contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="090630103000060"></a>I speak as a former staff member and trustee of Christian Aid and I thank my noble friend for introducing the debate. My experience is of small-scale projects where outcomes are measurable and perceptible, and so I can feel a warm glow inside sometimes, unlike my friends who have had to wrestle with great international institutions. I feel empathy with those, both in government and outside, who have promoted civil society within the international system, such as Mr Bernard Kouchner. However, I have misgivings about the ambitions of some human rights workers and politicians to effect regime change in places such as Burma within the new UN doctrine.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="090630103000061"></a>The doctrine has already gained support in Westminster, I hear. A group of MPs led by Mr John Bercow, the new Speaker, have signed a resolution in support of responsibility to protect in Burma, so it is coming close. Many people regard parts of the world such as the Congo as a priority for the UN because of the extent of human rights violations over a long period. I admire the way in which the UN force MONUC has survived with the minimum of personnel in very small, remote outposts, and I admire still more how experienced NGOs, such as CARE International and Merlin, have been able to offer protection to thousands of displaced families with very little back-up and protection and rarely any local recognition.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="090630103000062"></a>It is precisely because of those years of conflict and neglect in those countries that it would be absurd to pretend that the world has a duty to protect all its vulnerable citizens, because manifestly it does not and cannot. Either the infrastructure is there or there is no political will to do it. The same goes for Zimbabwe and other countries where tyranny has presided over various forms of chaos. This doctrine is evolving and the world has to pick and choose to implement it. Protection, child protection in particular, has long been a hallowed concept within the UN and the civil society extended family.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="090630103000063"></a>The General Assembly did well to introduce the R2P doctrine because it belongs directly to the rights-based tradition, but there are many grey areas. Protection can be a de facto consequence of any humanitarian programme. Social exclusion, for example, is an area of development abroad where the responsibility to protect can work with very specific targeted aid programmes, but it will not be among the programme objectives&#151;it just has to happen. I am thinking of work among the Dalit communities in India where there may be daily violence against the low-caste with limited protection from the NGOs trying to defend them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="090630103000064"></a>I am also thinking of various projects of NGOs in various parts of Afghanistan. Here I feel that NGOs are different. They constantly have to stretch their own security rules to the limit because of a separate moral responsibility, while the UN agencies are more likely to operate strictly within the brief. One thinks of UNRWA staff in Gaza. It depends on the personality of the people involved. Only rarely will the off-duty work of an NGO be recognised by the national Government.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="090630103000065"></a>I hope that I have a healthy scepticism about what the UN can do. I wish that it could have done more in Palestine and Sri Lanka, but the odds were stacked against it, including the world&#146;s apathy. It is easy to list the failures of the international system and difficult to discern what my noble friend Lord Hannay, who cannot be in his place, recently called the,</p>
<ul><a name="090630103000150"></a>&#147;emerging patches of genuine progress and rules-based order&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090630103000138"></a>The work with the International Criminal Court and peacekeeping in the Balkans and east Africa are good examples of this.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="090630103000066"></a>The implementation of a responsibility to protect is a constant challenge in Africa&#151;I am glad that my noble friend mentioned Sudan. Iraq has so dominated the airwaves that the UN has had no chance of showing its successes. I have had recent personal experience of the remarkable achievement of the UN in Nepal and Kenya, though these cases, too, may be listed as unfinished business. Everything in UN terms is unfinished business. I recognise the particular role of our own diplomats in these examples.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="090630103000067"></a>I pay tribute to the UN and voluntary agencies who work with refugees and the displaced. In Kenya, the Dadaab camps were constructed for 90,000 refugees from Somalia. They now have to protect more than three times that number, growing at 7,000 a month. Wherever the NGOs offer an umbrella, the migrants will come in. The R2P is concerned with crimes against humanity but it is not an open-door doctrine. It has to be policed or the genuine refugees will be twice victimised.</p>

It was explained to me in six points: just cause; right intention; final result; legitimate authority; appropriate means; and reasonable prospects of success. As we went through this, the noble Lord, Lord Jay, spoke of learning, study and getting in early to see whether the intervention can be successful. That suddenly made me think that that is the way to go, but it also

Whether getting in early to make the world a better place&#151;literally, we are talking in global terms here&#151;is a price worth paying for the mistakes made is a horrible decision to have to make for everybody concerned.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="090630103000071"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Parekh, pointed out that the two coming superpowers, China and India, probably have a different take on that to those within the traditional western world. If the UN is to mean anything, the opinions of China and India&#151;particularly if they are in a bloc&#151;must count for a great deal. If we could achieve consensus between the traditional western powers and China and India about defining a doctrine which can be acted upon, early intervention might become a vague possibility. I hope for an intervention that will not have to go down the route of military activity. Clearly the worst-case scenario is a bad or unsuccessful military intervention, something which creates resentment.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="090630103000072"></a>Iraq will probably hang over us for a while. Has Iraq been a successful intervention and did it have sufficient authority? We have been over this dozens of times. My opinion and those of my party on this are well known. Have we created a successful state there or have we merely managed to have a pause in an ongoing civil war? I hope the first is what has happened, but a possibility still exists of something hideous happening and intervention there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="090630103000073"></a>As for the value judgments of our own society being placed on other societies, the ruling sections of Iran&#151;the great culture that is Persia&#151;might regard the threat and existence of this as a good reason for cracking down on any opposition to strengthen and protect their vision of what their society should be. It is a difficult job to balance these matters.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="090630103000074"></a>I look forward to hearing the Minister sum up. She could have given herself a rather easier ball to catch the first time. She has an extremely difficult job because the main problems with this doctrine concern the type of intervention, where it should take place, and at what level. We should stop people being slaughtered in genocide or ethnic cleansing&#151;I hope that no one in the Chamber is in favour of that in any circumstances&#151;but where do we intervene and how do we do it successfully? The real question is how we can get a doctrine that commands enough support on a worldwide basis. It is a difficult problem that we can only hope to get right most of the time. It would be interesting to know what the Government think are the limitations of our decision-making at this point.</p>

Although it may be fashionable to denigrate spiritual and religious aspects, they are becoming more important than ever as we try to bring sense into the near anarchy of the new globalised system. The role of the right reverend Prelate and his like will increase enormously in coming years.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="090630103000076"></a>The doctrine we are taking about, the responsibility to protect, is beyond reproach. The aims are almost unchallengeable. They are to codify the humanitarian intervention procedure within states. This idea was born before 9/11, at the end of the previous century, but since 9/11, it has become many times more searing and relevant to our deliberations about what we are supposed to do. On the one hand, there are states that are living entities of people who form together under their own rights, customs and governments, good or bad, and on the other hand, there are the searing demands of a globalised world with atrocities pitched into our living rooms and onto our websites almost every night. One has to ask whether one can generalise or make general rules, or whether each situation is bound to be fraught with its own conundrums and dilemmas.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="090630103000077"></a>I do not know the answer to that but, looking back over the past decade, one has to ask whether it would have been helpful to have had firm rules on intervening in Rwanda, or in Bosnia to deal with the horror of Srebrenica&#151;the worst tragedy of humanitarian intervention that I can remember in my lifetime&#151;or in Kosovo, Burma, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Darfur, Zimbabwe&#151;very controversial&#151;or Somalia? What help would it have been in the agonies over Iraq and whether we got United Nations agreement, or whether we are right to be so involved in the Pashtun frontier area between Afghanistan and Pakistan? There are many other places as well.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="090630103000078"></a>One can see the need for a general framework, but within it, there will still be agonising decisions about whether to intervene. It is a bit like the proverbial elephant. The case for intervention, whether soft and mild or military and hard, and whether it is likely to succeed is like the elephant; it is difficult to describe and generalise but easy to know when we see it. When we have the horrors of ethnic cleansing etched on our minds or see the agonies of deliberately inflicted starvation, murder and torture, we know it is a case for action. The evils and cruelties of aggressive terrorism have been brought to our doorstep&#151;we see immediately that they, too, are a case for international action.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="090630103000079"></a>We then face the problems, discussed this evening, of what kind of intervention; and if it is military force, which of course is the last resort but a resort that we keep resorting to, what kind of military force? Is it self-defence&#151;standing by&#151;or is it becoming involved on one side or another in internal civil wars and other horrors? When we consider United Nations military intervention, do we need new force structures to deal with the asymmetric warfare that we have encountered in Afghanistan and elsewhere, rather than the traditional bringing together of various forces by contributions from different countries that go off to war and often find themselves powerless?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="090630103000080"></a>We must also take account of the debate on the nation state. I am not talking about the old doctrine of sovereignty, but about something new. Boutros Boutros Ghali, who was one of the best Secretary-Generals of the United Nations&#151;he was sacked after one term, but he was a superb man&#151;talked about the essential need for a profoundly renewed concept of the state to give the isolated individual identity and fulfil deep needs to belong and love a country. That is in contrast to other, more fashionable talk about the nation state being finished and being superseded. Still others, as we have heard this evening, have talked about the shift of power away from western hegemony and into the hands of the rising Asian states.</p>

<a name="90630-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="090630103000081"></a>I will just say that these feelings of the need to belong and have an identity, even in countries that are sadly disadvantaged, are not reached by talk about the international community, or by remote parliaments and assemblies. This is because the whole texture of international relations has changed very fast in the past 10 to 15 years. Thanks to the internet, international relations are no longer confined to officialdom and to formal relations between Governments. There are a mass of connections and interfaces between semi-public and non-governmental bodies. This is the new fabric that Governments and officialdom sometimes find difficult to grasp. It is the new international network, of which the Commonwealth, which I was delighted to hear mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Jay, is a vital part.</p>

Perhaps we should start with the democracies&#151;including ours&#151;which are not healthy at the moment; then with the international institutions of the 20th century that all need revising; and then find the true consensus needed to protect all mankind.

The noble Lord, particularly through his work as the chair of Merlin, is well aware of the need for speedy and effective responses to emergencies.</p>

<a name="90630-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="090630103000086"></a>I think that we all have seared on our memory the tragedies of Srebrenica, which was mentioned, of Rwanda and of Darfur. Now we grapple with how to deal with the tragic plight of civilians today in Somalia, in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in Sri Lanka. My interest in R2P is personal. I was in Rwanda and what was then Zaire in 1994 during the immediate aftermath of the genocide. The memory of those days will stay with me all my life. I have also been to Darfur, to Chad, to south Sudan on a number of occasions, and to the eastern Congo. All the suffering I have seen testifies to the need for us to undertake the shared responsibility, the binding commitment to tackle the structural causes of conflict which include social and economic inequalities, impunity&#151;something that really has not been mentioned&#151;and injustice. I can confirm that the UK Government are fully engaged and indeed were in the vanguard of efforts to ensure that the world summit agreement reached in 2005 included a clear and ground-breaking commitment to R2P. But while we have the tools and the instruments needed to fulfil the responsibility to protect, as the noble Lord, Lord Addington, said, the biggest challenge that remains is how we can make it all work.</p>

<a name="90630-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="090630103000087"></a>First, it is clear that we must strive to create a culture of the responsibility to protect, a culture that is accepted across the world. This is work in progress for our governments. We have to build confidence in the principle that states have a fundamental responsibility to protect their own populations, and indeed we have to bring clarity and acceptability at the United Nations and European Union level to the concept of the responsibility to protect. Secondly, R2P must be a holistic concept in its development and in its application. Many noble Lords have spoken about the four R2P crimes; those crimes of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. But R2P must not just be about responding to such atrocities. It must relate to conflict prevention, mediation and peace-building. It must include efforts to increase awareness of potential tension, as the noble Lord, Lord Jay, said, and listening and then acting when the alarm bells ring.</p>

<a name="90630-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="090630103000088"></a>Thirdly, we must tackle the misconception that R2P is somehow an initiative of the developed world, one that is being imposed on the south. The concept of non-indifference to crimes, which has been mentioned, was actually in the Constitutive Act of the African Union 2000, long before the UN adopted the responsibility to protect. It was the African Union that took an early lead in responding to the violence in Kenya last year when an estimated 600,000 people were displaced. We must also tackle the misconception that R2P is somehow a justification for military intervention. It is not about imposing solutions on countries from outside. It is about encouraging world leaders, politicians and representatives of civil society to play their own parts. It is as much about responsible sovereignty as it is about intervention. That is what I mean when I talk about the culture of R2P.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="090630103000089"></a>The Government continue to follow closely developments at both the EU and the UN levels in the run-up to the UN General Assembly debate, which I understand is to take place on 20 July. The UK has welcomed the reaffirmed commitment to R2P in the December report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and the 2007 EU Consensus on Humanitarian Aid. R2P is a priority for the General Assembly, and I am glad to say that the member states of the European Union have confirmed this. Further to those actions, the Government continue to explore how we can ensure that awareness of R2P informs all our work on conflict, on development and on human rights at the domestic level, at the regional level and globally. We will therefore continue to work to secure better and more effective responses to the four R2P crimes and we will support the building of better early warning systems&#151;which is essential&#151;more deployable military and civilian capacity, and more effective regional reaction, particularly from the African Union and from the European Union.

We are particularly focused on the UN General Assembly and the resulting opportunity to build a real consensus on the 2005 agreement and secure practical measures related to the implementation of the Secretary-General's report. This task will involve a high level of political commitment for the foreseeable future. The Government understand that and are committed to fulfilling that aim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="090630103000092"></a>I am also very interested and supportive of the references to South Sudan made by the noble Lord, Lord Jay. I absolutely agree that the peace agreement is looking very shaky at this time. I met people from South Sudan only last week and there is a great deal of doubt and apprehension about the referendum and about the prospect of an election. There is this terrible uncertainty, which, as the noble Lord says, is something we need to watch very carefully in order to ensure that there is no tipping over into yet more fighting and yet more conflict in a part of Sudan that has suffered so much over so many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="090630103000093"></a>I agree that R2P has to be at the top of foreign policy. Noble Lords can rely on me to understand this and constantly refer to it. It is also important to say that we are working very hard in the FCO, DfID and the MoD; working together perhaps more effectively, and for the long term, to ensure that we can be more coherent in the work across departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="090630103000095"></a>R2P is not a legal obligation. That is a very important point for us to realise in this debate. It is a moral and a political commitment that we have made. When you use the term &#147;R2P&#148; people often become very defensive in situations of tension. Quite often you can move things forward more effectively if you do not use that vocabulary.</p>

<a name="90630-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="090630103000096"></a>It is very important for us to say that the suspicion about R2P, to which some noble Lords have referred, is something we need to be aware of, conscious of, and respond to appropriately. It is also important to mention that action can be taken, including that in Chapter 7 at UN level, if military intervention is considered to be appropriate and necessary; that is something that we would be looking at.</p>

<p><a name="090630103000139"></a>We have had a fascinating and wide-ranging debate, and I am grateful to noble Lords for their contributions. Everyone in this House, including the Government, is committed to working with the international community, to create what I have referred to as a culture of the responsibility to protect.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_207"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="090630103000100"></a>This amendment reverses the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which, in turn, reversed the previous law that children under the age of 10 could not be held criminally responsible for a crime. The law with respect to children who kill is very different in England from that of most other European countries. It is not just that the age of criminal responsibility, at 10 years old, is exceptionally low, but also that the doctrine of doli incapax, or being incapable of crime, was abolished in 1998. Moreover, the distinction between manslaughter and murder means that those convicted of the latter are subject to a mandatory penalty of indefinite detention, with its duration assessed by the Home Secretary and not by the courts or the Parole Board. This means that children who have not yet reached puberty are treated as if they were adults but their handling puts them at particular disadvantage. There was a very celebrated case that preceded this law.</p>

<a name="90630-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="090630103000101"></a>There are several reasons why this seems quite unreasonable to me. First, there is extensive evidence which we have talked about before that the important development changes continue throughout the teenage years. To reduce this to the question of whether children know right from wrong is highly misleading. Even pre-school children appreciate this distinction, although they approach it more in terms of fear of detection and the punishment that will follow rather than from internal justice principles and concern for the victims of wrong acts.</p>

<a name="90630-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="090630103000102"></a>During early adolescence, young people&#146;s thinking tends to become more abstract, multi-dimensional and self-reflective. In addition, they are able to generate more alternatives in their decision-making. There is a marked increase in emotional introspection, together with a greater tendency to look back with regret and look ahead with apprehension. The transition to more adult modes of thinking does not emerge, as we have already heard, from any single age, but it is clear that it is very far from complete at age 10. As with any aspect of development, there are marked individual differences in how children achieve maturity.</p>

<a name="90630-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="090630103000103"></a>The second consideration is that homicide is rather different from the rest of juvenile delinquency in that it has not shown the same marked rise over the past half century or so. Nevertheless, homicide and serious juvenile delinquency have much in common.</p>

<a name="90630-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="090630103000104"></a>Thirdly, children who commit homicide are likely to be seriously psychologically disturbed&#151;again, as we have discussed&#151;and often have experience of very serious adversity. This means that they will usually require residential care in order to receive the intensive psychological treatment and rehabilitation that they urgently require. However, it also means, very positively, that rehabilitation is a realisable goal.</p>

<a name="90630-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="090630103000105"></a>As with any other criminal behaviour, there is a crucial need to balance the protection of society and the rehabilitation needs of the offender. Changes in the law should be viewed in terms of meeting both. That is, the change should not automatically mean that children receive a reduced sentence; rather, the argument is that they should be treated with respect to the differences between children and adults. This means that if we are to fail with our previous amendments&#151;although I hope that we shall support the noble Lord,  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_208"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Carlile of Berriew, and his colleagues if they come back with their amendment on Report&#151;there would be a need to reintroduce doli incapax in that it is suggested that it would be reasonable to assume a lack of capacity below the age of 14 but to reverse the assumption over that age.</p>

<a name="90630-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="090630103000106"></a>In either instance, it should be open to the courts to decide in the case of that particular child with that particular background and with that particular crime that there was capacity below the age of 14 or that there was not over it. It is essential that careful consideration be given to the state of the offender before release, but this needs to be done with the benefit of expert advice from the Parole Board&#151;I am afraid that the Executive would not be my choice. It would also be helpful for juveniles to have one offence of homicide, removing the distinction between manslaughter and murder with the implication that follows from that. I beg to move that we reinstate an amendment for doli incapax.</p>

<a name="090630103000107"></a><b><a name="90630-0014.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="090630103000184"></a>Lord Carlile of Berriew:</b> In the light of the Government&#146;s refusal to recognise the concept of developmental immaturity in relation to children, the lack of a transitional stage in a child&#146;s development as a potential criminal between the ages of 10 and 14 is a matter of great concern to these Benches. Set at 10 years of age, the threshold for criminal responsibility in England and Wales is one of the lowest in western Europe. It is 13 in France, 14 in Germany and 16 in Spain. A number of those countries also have something akin to doli incapax in force as well as a higher age of criminal responsibility. Indeed, it is perhaps shocking that the age of criminal responsibility in this country is 10, whereas for males in Iran it is 14 years and nine months. Horrifyingly, for females in Iran, it is eight-and-a-half years, but perhaps we need not trouble with that further at this stage.</p>

<a name="90630-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="090630103000108"></a>Our age of criminal responsibility is set so low as to cause concern that, without a special category of developmental immaturity, there is a risk of unjust conviction of those who simply are not of a capacity fully to understand what they are doing or have done. Even the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has expressed concern about the United Kingdom&#146;s law of juvenile criminal responsibility. That committee said that it might be incompatible with Articles 37 and 40 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to have our age of criminal responsibility set so low, leading to a recommendation that,</p>
<ul><a name="090630103000151"></a>&#147;serious consideration be given to raising the age of criminal responsibility throughout the areas of the United Kingdom&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090630103000141"></a>That comment was made by the UN before the abolition of doli incapax. It would seem therefore odd that the abolition of doli incapax has not been accompanied by raising the statutory age of criminal responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="090630103000109"></a>As a result of all the legislation that has been enacted so far, in particular the Crime and Disorder Act, and the proposed legislation we are considering tonight, all children of 10 years of age and more will be presumed and treated as having the same moral culpability and ability to conduct themselves as an adult. We illustrated in the last debate that it could be even worse than that&#151;that children could be in a less advantaged position than adults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="090630103000110"></a>In the case of C (a minor) v DPP, Lord Lowry, quoted from elsewhere,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="090630103000147"></a>&#147;No civilised society regards children as accountable for their actions to the same extent as adults&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090630103000111"></a>Without the measures which the noble Baroness has been urging, or something like them&#151;she has put it broadly and I wholly support her&#151;we will be left as a society which regards children not only as accountable for their actions to the same extent as adults but we shall leave children as presumed to be accountable to the same extent as adults for actions for which in fact, as any good psychiatrist will tell us, they are not actually fully accountable. There is a real danger that if we pursue this legislation to the letter in its current draft form there will be a severe injustice to children which it will be left somehow for the courts to sort out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="090630103000112"></a>In the penultimate debate, the noble and learned Baroness, the Attorney-General, suggested that what was being proposed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, was a fudge. If the Government will not meet these problems, as described by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, the fudge will simply be handed on to the courts. The Court of Appeal will have to produce the fudge in order to safeguard the interests of children. That should not be the task of the Court of Appeal; it should be the role of this Parliament and this House to produce legislation that meets the apprehended justice of cases like those we have in mind.</p>

Of particular importance is the debate before dinner about developmental immaturity. There is now another effort by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, to attack the same point. It is particularly important that the Government remember that the four Children&#146;s Commissioners of the United Kingdom were extremely critical of the approach towards the criminalisation of children, and young children in particular, in this country. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child was also very critical. It praised the Government for some improvements but it remained extremely critical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="090630103000114"></a>There is a danger that the Government of the day, and I suspect all Governments, are overinfluenced by the popular press and particularly certain sections of the press that demonise children and treat all children who are old enough to go to court and who commit really serious offences as evil. The Government should be giving a lead and not responding to the soundbites of the newspapers in relation to the way in which children are to be treated in the same way as adults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="090630103000116"></a>One thinks about the way in which we treat our social workers, who are supposed to protect children, the low status they have been provided and how they have been treated as pariahs&#151;or the staff at children&#146;s homes, who work with the most vulnerable and challenging children. There are members of staff paid the same as or less than staff at supermarket checkouts. We should think about the context in which this takes place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="090630103000117"></a>I commend all the excellent work that the Government have done in the past 10 years in seeking to remedy some of these situations. However, if we look at ourselves in the mirror, we have to say that somewhere or other we have rather lost our way in terms of prioritising the welfare of our children. That may be another reason to take this opportunity to look extremely carefully and think again about how children are treated in the courts. Perhaps we should be open-minded and think that perhaps, given the cultural context in which we operate, here is an opportunity to make more modern how we treat children in our courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="090630103000119"></a>It cannot be right logically to think that children of 10 can be treated the same as adults for their behaviour and be subjected therefore to the same justice system or criminal system.

However, the more I thought about the Attorney-General&#146;s response, the more troubled I became by the message that I got from it. Below the age of 18&#151;and no differentiation seemed to be made between those who were 10 and 11 and those who were 17 or 18&#151;there was, first, no persuasion that there was a problem or even a potential problem of injustice here. The difficulty that was adduced was that we should think about teenagers who produce knives and stab somebody and whether they should not be held responsible. We have to think seriously about the problems, but the idea that we should somehow hold 10 and 11 year-olds as responsible in the same kind of way as people in their twenties, thirties, forties or fifties seems to me extraordinary.</p>

On the other hand, children are now, through television, the internet and other things exposed to a degree of disturbing stimulation that may actually make it more difficult for them to cope with some of the stimuli that they are getting than children were before. I do not regard this as a simple matter; it is a complex and difficult matter. However, if one pulls back from it, does one really believe that it makes any kind of sense or justice to hold children of 10, 11 or 12 as responsible as when they are in their late teens or their twenties? People in this Parliament decided many years ago that they would change the educational system of this country because they did not believe that it was fair that decisions should be made about children&#146;s educational capacity at the age of 10 or 11. I speak not about whether that was a good idea or other, but that was the decision that was made. The decision being made now is that children of that age can be made responsible for the most serious crimes that we can imagine. That seems to me to be an inconsistency of approach and understanding that I find difficult to struggle with. I do not suggest&#151;and I know the noble Baroness does not either&#151;that this amendment solves all the problems, but I did feel that it was necessary to come back, even after a short period of thought, to say to the Minister that I really think we have a problem here. It may be that perhaps we should be looking at the age of 13 or 14 if people find it difficult to say 16, 17 and 18-year olds, who get involved in all sorts of activities. There is such a profound difference between the child of 10 or 11 and the teenager of 17 or 18, that simply to lump them all together seems to me to be inappropriate, yet it seems that the arguments did that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="090630103000124"></a>I take exception in a gentle way with the noble Lord, Lord Patel, when he claims that young people between the ages of 10 and 18 are subject to the same justice system as adults. They are not. They have youth courts, and the way they are disposed of by the courts if they are found guilty could not be more different. The trouble that is taken with young people&#151;indeed, the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, was making this point before dinner&#151;who are convicted of committing offences is different in kind from the trouble that is taken with those over that age. I will return to that when I have dealt with the subject matter of the amendment.</p>

<a name="90630-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="090630103000125"></a>The doctrine of doli incapax involved a rebuttable presumption in criminal proceedings that a child of between 10 and 14 years of age did not know the

This is a probing amendment and obviously we could not just put the law back to what it was by the amendment, so let me try to explain why we do not believe that that doctrine should be resurrected.</p>

<a name="90630-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="090630103000126"></a>In the White Paper <I>No More Excuses</I>, published in November 1997, the Government said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="090630103000148"></a>&#147;To prevent offending and re-offending by young people, we must stop making excuses for youth crime. Children above the age of criminal responsibility are generally mature enough to be accountable for their actions and the law should recognise this&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090630103000142"></a>That remains our view. It is both the right approach and, as it happens, also the view of the vast majority of people who live in our country.</p>

<a name="90630-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="090630103000127"></a>Our communities are entitled to be protected from anyone who sets out to cause harm and to have confidence that the criminal justice system will protect them and deal with those who break the law, but will take special notice and care of those who break the law but are of a young age.</p>

<a name="90630-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="090630103000128"></a>The presumption in practice led to delays, to cases being dropped and to unjust, paradoxical and unfair outcomes for victims, for witnesses and, not least, for the young person in question. In addition to having to prove both that the defendant committed the criminal act and that he or she had the required mental state at the time to the criminal standard&#151; that is, beyond reasonable doubt&#151;the prosecution in cases involving a child aged under 14 would have to rebut the presumption. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, that I am not sure that some of those other countries that he mentioned, where the age of criminal responsibility is older, have quite the same standard and burden of proof as we have in all criminal proceedings in this country. That presumption could be rebutted only by clear positive evidence that the child knew that his or her act was seriously wrong at the time when he committed the act concerned. Mere proof of intentionally doing the act concerned, however terrible or obviously wrong that act might have been, could not establish the requisite guilty knowledge and rebut the presumption.</p>

<a name="90630-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="090630103000129"></a>That would bring back delay into our court system, and nothing is worse than delay, particularly when it involves young offenders. It would also bring back the need for further evidence, quite separate from the evidence of the offence itself, to show that the young person knew what they had done was not just wrong but seriously wrong at the time when he or she committed the act concerned.</p>

<a name="90630-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="090630103000130"></a>We are determined that people who offend&#151;and that includes young people, too&#151;take responsibility for their actions. We should not return to a culture of excusing such behaviour. That is in no one&#146;s interests, least of all those of the young people themselves. We all accept that there has to be a point at which an individual becomes responsible for what they do. The courts of course take account of the young person&#146;s age, first, in how the case is conducted. It is conducted in separate courts from adults, in youth courts set up specifically to deal with young people. Account is taken, secondly, in the disposal: the sentence handed down.</p>

<a name="90630-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="090630103000131"></a>About a year ago, we spent night after night discussing a criminal justice Bill. We discussed for a long time, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, may recall, issues surrounding youth sentences: what should we do with young people who are convicted of offences? The last thing being suggested was that we should somehow treat them as adult offenders. So it is not fair to say that they are somehow subject to the same justice system, as though there is no distinction made between young people and adults under our justice system. Every difference is made, particularly in terms of venue and how we deal with them if they are convicted.</p>

<a name="90630-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="090630103000132"></a>I very much took on board the point of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, about social workers. They are completely unfairly denigrated, and I find astonishing the amount of money that experienced social workers can get for a lifetime&#146;s work in that profession compared to, for example, what young lawyers can sometimes get. The comparison is ridiculous under our system, and it is right that a Minister should say that social workers do a fantastic job, particularly for young people. I thank the noble Earl for his comments.</p>

<a name="90630-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="090630103000133"></a>The suggestion was made that we do not react enough as a Government, whatever party is in power, to the influence of the press&#151;and the popular press, at that. Well, sometimes that may be true. I concede that, of course. However, on the case that I think the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, was hinting at that led to a change in the law&#151;the Bulger case&#151;after their years in custody, being looked after as young offenders should be, those two young men had a chance to start a new life. That was done with complete hostility from large sections of the popular press, but it was still done. Governments and the system do not always give way to popular opinion of that kind. I hope that some credit can be gained from that.</p>

<a name="90630-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="090630103000134"></a>I end on a slightly lighter note, if there can be a lighter note on such a serious subject. I invite noble Lords and the noble Baroness in particular to look at the <I>Mail </I>online this morning, which deals with a study from the University of Chicago, which makes the point&#151;I am not saying that this is right or wrong, but it is an interesting part of the argument&#151;that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="090630103000149"></a>&#147;Children have an inbuilt sense of right and wrong, researchers claimed last night&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090630103000143"></a>I hand my copy to the noble Baroness. There is an argument that states that children do have that inbuilt  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_214"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column 214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sense. They are talking about the ages from seven to 12. It is part of the argument that psychiatrists and others use. We would be taking a retrograde step if we were to change the law back to what it was prior to 1998. I take many of the points that are made about how children and young people are different from adults and need to be treated differently from adults once they have been convicted under the criminal justice system. I would argue that they are treated very differently under our system and that is the right way for us to carry on.</p>

<a name="90630-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="090630103000135"></a>Having thanked the noble Baroness again for instigating this short debate, I ask her to withdraw her amendment.</p>

Perhaps the <I>Daily Mail</I> is going back to the original sin hypothesis. I am aware that in expressing my views on the amendment I was not hoping that we would obtain a reversal in the legislation; I admit that. I noticed that those who appeared to speak in its support were not speaking for the amendment. With friends like that, who needs enemies? I am grateful for their apparent support for this amendment. Nevertheless, I wanted to highlight that we hark back to the Bulger case. Such cases have caused deep concern, although I recognise that it has been said that the system has managed to take care of those young men. Nevertheless, the procedures that they went through were troubling and led to a tightening of the way in which young children were viewed by the courts in law at any rate, even if the reality has been somewhat different.</p>

<a name="90630-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="090630103000137"></a>I hope that our debates before the adjournment will come back strongly, because we have not reached the bottom of how we address this point. I would much prefer it if, on Report, we thought clearly about developmental immaturity in relation to children, because there seems to be enormous support around that issue. This amendment does not seem to be the one to have made it there, so I beg leave to withdraw it.</p>

</div>
<p><a name="09063068000003"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09063068000112"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> This amendment would remove Clause 14(1)(b), which abolishes the carer&#146;s allowance increase for adult dependants. This benefit is fiendishly complicated. The carer&#146;s allowance is called an income maintenance benefit, which can be increased if another adult is financially dependent on the recipient.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000004"></a>The adult dependency increases date back to 1948 when on the whole men were the breadwinners and women were the homemakers, so the increases were mostly paid to men for women. Adult dependency increases&#151;ADIs&#151;are paid at different rates for each benefit. The highest rates are payable with contributory long-term benefits, and the lowest with non-contributory benefits.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000005"></a>It was announced in December 2006 that ADIs in the carer&#146;s allowance would be removed for new claims from 2010, aligning the allowance with ADIs in the state pension and other benefits. The reason given in the impact assessment&#151;the Peers&#146; information pack is, sadly, completely silent on this clause&#151;is said to be,</p>
<ul><a name="09063068000104"></a>&#147;an important step in moving towards a simpler benefits system which is easier to understand and operate, and helps reduce error&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09063068000095"></a>It is also thought to be outdated as many couples have their own incomes. However, many carers will receive &#163;30.20 a week less in benefit income than they would under the existing rules. At present, around 17,400 carers receive an ADI, and there are an estimated 2,400 new claims each year, including an award of an ADI.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000006"></a>We are assured that income support or pension credit will ensure that most carers do not lose out. However, the impact assessment, under the little heading &#147;Risk of Negative Impact&#148;, says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09063068000099"></a>&#147;Any negative impact can be mitigated through ensuring adequate information in the run up to the change and promoting awareness of Income Support/Pension Credit. This would be consistent with the Government&#146;s commitment to advice services&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09063068000096"></a>Are we quite sure that this will be adequate? I should be glad for some reassurances from the Minister. Does he envisage any circumstances in which someone could be worse off when this part of the Bill takes effect? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09063068000007"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09063068000113"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> My Amendment 125, like Amendment 124 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, refers to the removal of adult dependency increases to the state pension from 2010 to 2020. I understand that the rationale behind the Bill getting rid of these increases is not solely about saving money but about adapting payments to reflect changes in family patterns since the payments were introduced in 1948.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000008"></a>Amendment 125 would not reverse the change made by the Bill, but it is designed to probe the transitional period, although the noble Baroness has already posed some of the questions that I might have thought to ask. I accept that the plan is not to make any new payments after April 2010, and that existing awards will not be ended until 2020, which ought to be ample time for existing awards to run their course. From that perspective, it is logical to be able to bring the scheme to a close before 2020 if no existing families are left on it. However, my honourable friend in another place posed two questions to which the Government did not really give any enlightening answer, so I shall re-ask them in this House, and I hope that the Minister will be in a better position to elucidate.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000009"></a>I have said before that it would be a rare bird indeed in social security law if some people did not lose out; the challenge is to mitigate that loss or cushion the blow. To that end, what exactly will the Government do to keep claimants informed of the changes and how they will be affected? Although I acknowledge that monetary savings were not the only consideration, there will none the less be savings of up to &#163;17 million in 2014-15. There exists an opportunity to compensate the poorest households, which will lose out under the proposed changes. Has the Minister given any thought to the good uses to which that money could be put?</p>

<p><a name="09063068000010"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09063068000114"></a>Baroness Turner of Camden:</b> I am interested in the amendments because I am not certain what Clause 14 means. Do its provisions, one of which the noble Baroness seeks to remove, mean that after the reform in the Bill, carers and pregnant women with adult dependants will qualify for extra benefits only if they pass a means test? My noble friend will know that a lot of us are not very keen on means-testing; we think it has a negative impact on work incentives anyway. I would be grateful if he would let us know whether that is what the clause means, because I gather that it is not very clear&#151;if it were, we would not have the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="09063068000011"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09063068000115"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government &amp; Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> I thank noble Lords for the amendments and the chance to explain the Government&#146;s position. One of the amendments removes the provision to abolish new awards of the adult dependency increase with carer&#146;s allowance from 6 April 2010, and to phase out  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC37"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>existing awards by 5 April 2020. The other removes the provision to specify an end-date to awards of adult dependency increases with carer&#146;s allowance.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000012"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, broadly got right the history of adult dependency increases and where the Government are on the subject. I say straight away to my noble friend Lady Turner that the clause does not mean that carers can access only means-tested benefit. As I shall explain, it removes one component of the existing structure of allowances available to carers.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000013"></a>By way of background, it might help if I explained that our intention to introduce the change was announced in the December 2006 Pre-Budget Report. The Committee will be aware that one of the long-standing aims of my department is to simplify and update the benefits system. Reducing complexity means that people claiming benefits can better understand what support is available and so improve the take-up of benefits. Simplifying the benefit rules also helps to ensure that staff administering those benefits make accurate and prompt payments. We have already legislated to phase out adult dependency increases with state pension between 2010 and 2020. Such increases have never been a feature of jobseeker&#146;s allowance, nor are they a feature of the new employment and support allowance, which replaced incapacity benefit for new claims from last October.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000014"></a>I shall address Amendment 124. Removal of the increases from carer&#146;s allowance and maternity allowance is the final measure needed to complete that element of benefit simplification and modernisation. We also think that the benefit system should reflect modern society. The concept of adult dependency is becoming increasingly outdated in a society in which partners generally regard themselves as equals rather than as breadwinner and dependant. Around 3,000 awards of carer&#146;s allowance a year include an adult dependency increase, and 18,000 carer&#146;s allowance awards are in payment, which is about 4 per cent of the total of all awards which include the adult dependency increase. Half the carers who receive the increase are no better off because it reduces the income-related benefit payable to them. The relatively small figures are indicative of the fact that the adult dependency increase is outdated.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000015"></a>It is important to bear in mind, as both the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, did, that this change has a 10-year transition period. Although no new awards will be made from April 2010, we will not end existing awards until April 2020 for any customers who continue to meet the conditions of entitlement. The average length of awards is six years and, as a result, entitlement will have ended by 2020 anyway for the vast majority of customers.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000016"></a>Turning specifically to Amendment 125, we are confident that very few people will still be receiving an adult dependency increase in April 2020. However, we will consider how best to notify customers in good time&#151;I say that in response to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale&#151;and we have a period in which to do that. We need to make it clear to them that the increase is being withdrawn and to advise them to claim any alternative benefits to which they may be  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC38"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC38</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>entitled. Less well-off carers and carer households are likely to be in receipt of income-related benefits and therefore will be fully compensated by increases in those benefits.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000017"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, asked if I could give an assurance that no one would be worse off. I cannot give that assurance; one cannot say that, come 2020, there will not be someone in receipt of the adult dependency increase. However, the number of people in that position will be very few, in our estimate, because of the six-year average of the claim. A proportion of those claimants receive income-related benefits and therefore it is a net nil for them. The strategy to ensure that individuals are informed over the 10-year transition period has yet to be worked through but, as I said, we have time enough to do that.</p>

Clause 15 inserts a new section into the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, which in turn allows the Secretary of State to make arrangements with external providers to make social loans in place of the present arrangements with the DWP. The Official Opposition welcome the proposals and the interest that the Government express in having advance payments as a way of getting rid of the need for crisis loans to be made in certain circumstances.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000021"></a>My noble friend Lord Skelmersdale and I have tabled these amendments to examine the operation of the new section and to seek assurances from the Minister. He will probably tell me that Amendment 126 is unnecessary because the Government propose not to allow external providers to impose any interest charges on those who receive loans from the Social Fund. They set out that position in another place and I expect the Minister will stick to it here; they do not intend that external providers should charge interest to people who are in need and receive social loans.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000022"></a>However, the Government are proposing to take powers&#151;although they do not have any intention of using them at present&#151;to enable external organisations to make loans in place of the present arrangements in the DWP. We know that if the powers were to be used, the external organisations would be credit unions and similar organisations. I am happy to acknowledge that these are very worthy organisations, which would be well placed to make such loans. However, should that power be exercised and the credit unions and suchlike be called into action, they will be making loans from a somewhat different position from that of the DWP. I am sure that I do not need to remind noble Lords that such organisations face expenses which they normally defray from interest charged. Indeed, credit unions need to exceed their operating expenses. I therefore hope to use my amendment to ask the Minister for a little more clarity and detail on this, given that we now know that the credit unions and other organisations will not be able to charge interest. In other words, I am asking the familiar old questions: &#147;How will this work?&#148; and &#147;How will the sums add up?&#148;.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000023"></a>Amendments 129 and 130 are very simple and should be read as a pair. They refer to the repayments of external provider social loans. The Bill suggests that regulations may provide for the collection of repayments by the Secretary of State. My amendments suggest that rather than introduce new regulations the Government should make use of existing regulations. That is not a wholly serious proposal, but the point is that at least we know what the existing regulations are. If the Minister could give your Lordships a clearer idea of what the new regulations might be like, I should feel a lot happier withdrawing my amendment. I beg to move.</p>

I appreciate that, by tabling Amendment 126, he is seeking to put beyond doubt the Government&#146;s intention that we would not allow an external provider to charge interest on any social loan made by that external provider. My right honourable and honourable friends in another place have made the Government&#146;s position clear on this matter on a number of occasions and I can add to that assurance that our position remains unchanged. We would not permit interest to be charged.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000025"></a>Our intention is to make arrangements with external providers to make social loans. We will not allow them to charge interest, but we realise that there must be a financial incentive to undertake this work. This is why subsection (4) of the new section provides for the Secretary to State to make payments to lenders in respect of the sums required to make loans and payments in respect of the expenses of the lender, which in different circumstances would be covered by interest charges.</p>

We have already said that we intend to have further discussions about some of the detail of how external provider social loans will work in practice. We also have to consider how what might go into the regulations will sit alongside the detail of the contract between the Secretary of State and an external provider. In particular, we will want to look at the provisions around recovery of external provider social loans, such as the priority given to an external provider loan in relation to other debts. We will also wish to consider in more detail the arrangements for recovery when a borrower moves off benefit into work and what specific recovery arrangements may apply in these circumstances.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000027"></a>While I appreciate that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, in particular has concerns around the number of regulation-making powers in the Bill&#151;certainly his colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has expressed that point of view on a number of occasions&#151;and that these amendments would reduce the number of new sets of regulations, I cannot be sure that we will not need new regulations. I can, however, reassure him that when we have finished considering the details around recovery and decided what regulations should say, we will amend existing regulations rather than introduce new ones, if that proves practical. I hope that that has covered each of the noble Lord&#146;s points, but I would be happy to try to answer further, if it has not.</p>

He has confirmed what was said in another place on this point. Of course, loans are loans and there must be an expectation of repayment, although, as the Minister will understand, there probably is a higher risk of failure to repay with this type of loan than may be the case with others. It would totally defeat the purpose of making these loans if the repayment structure became burdensome on a family or an individual.</p>

One of the key points in going down this route is to seek to ensure that, when individuals avail themselves of these facilities, they are provided with support to manage their financial affairs generally. When they need specific support, they are provided not just with a loan and no advice around that. That is one of the key issues that we want to address in using alternative providers. We hope that it will help increase individuals&#146; financial knowledge and their ability to handle their financial affairs generally.</p>

It emphasises, though, the need for individual care monitoring to make a success of these welfare reforms. At almost every level at which we have discussed these matters, we know that the relationship between the client and the welfare agencies is the key to success. Given the way the provision is structured, one hopes that it will succeed in doing that. The Minister has said what I expected him to say. I did say that in those circumstances I would beg leave to withdraw the amendment, which is exactly what I now seek to do.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000032"></a>Those whose only income is derived from contribution-based benefits are at present not eligible to apply for help from the Social Fund. Contribution-based benefits can be claimed by those who have at least some national insurance contributions. Currently, eligibility for community care grant and for budgeting loans is restricted to people receiving pension credit, income support, income-based or means-tested JSA and income-based ESA. Community care grants do not have to be paid back, while budgeting loans are interest-free loans to help people meet one-off expenses. People with sufficient national insurance contributions have to claim the contribution-based element of benefits whether or not they have any other income or savings. Many people who have claimed contribution-based benefits do not have any other income or savings but are clearly disadvantaged compared to those on income-based or means-tested benefits. This is clearly unfair. Many people in this position face financial hardship and have no option other than to approach loan sharks.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000033"></a>I do not usually cite case studies but on this occasion I will. A citizens advice bureau in Surrey advised a client who was in receipt of incapacity benefit. His circumstances were such that, had it not been for his NI record, he would have been entitled to income-based, means-tested benefits, which give access to the Social Fund. The client had moved into an unfurnished flat which had no cooking facilities or carpets and lacked a fridge. He had asked for a grant or loan from the Social Fund but had been told that he was ineligible because he was receiving incapacity benefit. As a result the client was cooking meals on a camping stove, which is dangerous, and buying take-away meals, which are expensive.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000034"></a>The Minister may say that all the Bill does is to make provision to allow the Social Fund to be delivered by external providers. However, we cannot let pass this opportunity to discuss extending access to the Social Fund as a whole, however it is provided, to other low-income groups&#151;in the case of this amendment, to those whose sole income is contribution-based benefits. I beg to move.</p>

Although I do not say that pejoratively, I accept that it is a probing device to question the eligibility of individuals to apply for and receive a loan from an external provider. The proposed idea that such a person would need to derive their income wholly from benefits is too restrictive.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000036"></a>The point of the Social Fund schemes is to step in as a kind of safety net to provide emergency funds to those who find themselves in a very precarious position&#151;as a lender of last resort, one might say. Plainly, that facility cannot be available to everyone in the country, because it is not, nor should it be, the business of the state to legislate for providers to supply social loans without question. It is for that reason&#151;because people who are in receipt of benefits are already being taken care of by the state, after a fashion, and are therefore owed a particular duty of care by the state&#151;that the Bill allows for categories of persons eligible and the nature of the loan to be prescribed under new Section 140ZA.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000037"></a>The question asked by the noble Baroness, which I echo, is for the Minister to give your Lordships more of a clue as to the kind of the person whom the Government consider ought to be eligible for a social loan. What proportion of income should be derived from benefits before a person becomes eligible for a loan? In other words, what benefits will be prescribed under new Section 140ZA(2)(a)?</p>

<a name="90630-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000038"></a>The point of social loans is to help people out of a precarious situation on a temporary basis, as the term &#147;loan&#148; suggests. The support and advice that they get along with it will be vital, almost regardless of who actually qualifies for a loan, as I said on the previous group of amendments. It is important that people receive financial advice so that they might climb out of the hole that they are in and, I hope, prevent themselves falling back into it. I expect that such advice and support might cost money. If the Government intend to provide that kind of service to the very needy, will it be paid for out of the existing Social Fund budget? If so, will that substantially reduce the amount of money available to Social Fund borrowers and will that in turn have an effect on the stringency of the eligibility criteria?</p>

<p><a name="09063068000039"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0001.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09063068000126"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I gather from the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, that we are likely to have a broader discussion around the Social Fund on the next amendment, so I shall keep my remarks fairly focused at this stage. It is obviously difficult to comment on individual cases, but in the example that she cited a crisis loan would not necessarily be ruled out, because crisis loans are not linked to or precluded from people who are not on income-related benefits. I do not say that it would have been approved in that case, but it might have been.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000040"></a>As we have already discussed, Clause 15 is about external provider social loans and subsection (2) of this new section describes who would be eligible for a social loan from an external provider. It appears that the aim of this amendment is to ensure that eligibility goes beyond those in receipt of income-related benefits. It alters the eligibility criteria for Social Fund loans. The amendment would allow only those whose income was comprised solely of benefit payments to be eligible for external provider social loans. In particular, it would include people whose main source of income was a contributory benefit&#151;as the noble Baroness described&#151;such as contributory-based JSA or retirement pension. I can understand why the noble Baroness would want to ensure that those on contributory

<h5><a name="09063068000107"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000041"></a>It is our intention to provide that those on certain income-related benefits would be eligible. By accepting the amendment, we would increase the potential number of individuals eligible for loans by around 1.7 million. The money available for loans is likely to be cash-limited. Increasing the number of eligible individuals would place a significant burden on the scheme. This would lead to some difficult choices. Should we put modest maximum amounts on loans which may be awarded, or run the risk of having providers run out of money completely before the end of the year, meaning turning people away who could be in real need?</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000042"></a>Another effect of accepting the amendment would be that an individual whose sole income was from, say, contributory-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance could apply for and be awarded a loan. However, although the applicant may have no other income, he or she could have a partner in full-time work, with a healthy salary and perhaps even savings. The loan provider would still need to consider awarding an interest-free loan to someone in these circumstances, since the amendment makes no provision to take account of partners&#146; income.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000043"></a>There would be a further effect of this amendment, which I am certain would be unintended. This amendment would not only extend the groups eligible to apply for loans&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, quite correctly identified&#151;but exclude some people who currently have access to Social Fund loans. Current benefit recipients, such as lone parents on income support who have additional income&#151;say, from child maintenance payments or a part-time job&#151;would be excluded by this amendment from applying for a loan. The same would be true of a pensioner who is currently in receipt of pension credit and who has additionally a small occupational pension. I am sure that the examples that I have just outlined, and which I think were hinted at by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, are not what the noble Baroness had in mind when tabling her amendment and I hope, therefore, that she will withdraw it.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000044"></a>In relation to the question posed directly by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, the benefits to be subscribed have not been decided but it is likely that they will be income-related benefits, as they currently are in terms of eligibility. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, also raised the point about how social loans will be funded. External provider social loans will be in place of Social Fund provision, but funded from the same source, which is to say from the Exchequer. There is no intention to change funding, only the way that it is delivered.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000045"></a>I hope, in particular, that the noble Baroness will realise why, certainly at one level, her amendment is too restrictive. It would really make life difficult for people who have some income-related benefits but have some small income in addition. The broader approach that the noble Lord suggested could increase the number of people eligible very significantly, and in circumstances where they could be in quite a wealthy household. Again, I do not believe that that was intended.</p>

Presumably that is at a higher level than at present. I asked a direct question about how this is to be funded. Is it funded out of existing resources? If it is funded out of existing resources, including the Social Fund itself, does that mean that there is less money available to be used for the purposes of the Social Fund itself, which is to provide a bonus?</p>

<p><a name="09063068000048"></a>I caution the suggestion about a high degree of support. We hope that there will be significant support available but, frankly, until we are in discussion with possible providers, mapping out the detail of what that provision will entail and the terms on which it would be provided, we need to be a little cautious about the promises and commitments we are making.</p>

It gives the Secretary of State power to restrict crisis loans or budgeting loans from being provided by the Social Fund if external providers are available. Perhaps I should say a word about the clause at the beginning of my remarks on the group, before speaking to the amendment. The rationale for the clause is to prevent Social Fund claimants double-claiming from both an external provider and Jobcentre Plus. From the Peers&#146; information pack, I gather that it is also envisaged that external providers would be expected to give their customers financial advice to help them over the longer term, as we have just been talking about. That could be a useful measure, but it must be monitored properly and there must be an independent complaints system in place.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC45"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000051"></a>Having the clause in the Bill before anyone has an idea of how a Social Fund scheme from external providers would work is part of the deeply unsatisfactory nature of the Bill, where not just the fine detail but the bigger picture is to be enshrined in unamendable regulations. I gather that there will be two further sets of consultation before any action is taken, which is perhaps just as well because it does not look as though external providers are exactly falling over themselves to lend to this socio-economic group at the moment.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000052"></a>Before leaving the subject of consultation, I should say that I gather from one charity that makes one-off grants to individuals in need, primarily for basic household equipment, that the consultation held last December, before the Bill was published, lasted only three weeks and few people knew about it in time to respond. That charity, which tries to ensure that it does not replace any statutory funds available, last year made 3,000 one-off grants throughout the UK. It is concerned about the operation of the Social Fund, which has a direct impact on its charitable work, and it makes the reasonable point that the further and longer consultations to be held will take place after the Bill has become law. It is particularly concerned about the lack of an independent review, which I will come to in a moment. KPMG, which conducted a feasibility study on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions last November, found that the break-even point for running such a scheme would be achieved only by charging an APR of 37.7 per cent, although we know that the Government have said in terms that they have changed their minds about the charging of interest and that it will not happen. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us further about this part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000053"></a>My noble friend Lord Kirkwood will be particularly sorry that we have reached Amendment 128 while he is still away, as he was looking forward to moving it. During the Bill&#146;s passage in the other place, the then Minister, Kitty Ussher, confirmed that the citizen would have no statutory right of review against the decisions made by external providers of the Social Fund. Instead, a complaints process will be incorporated into the contract with the loan provider, which I suppose could mean different complaints procedures for different providers, for all we know at this stage. The amendment allows for the appeals process in respect of an external provider to be specified.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000054"></a>We gather that it is intended that external contractors will be regulated by the FSA. Borrowers could complain to the financial services ombudsman. In the view of the Independent Review Service and others, this is not an equivalent standard of redress for service users, who need an independent, proportionate and, above all, quick dispute process. The people who apply to the Social Fund for help are among the most vulnerable and needy. At present, the Independent Review Service completes more than 99 per cent of standard cases within 12 working days, 95 per cent of complex cases within 23 working days, and 88 per cent of urgent crisis loans within 24 hours. By anyone&#146;s reckoning, these are impressive figures. Compare that with the Financial Services Ombudsman&#146;s service standards, which show that it aims to settle most disputes within six to nine months.</p>

<p><a name="09063068000055"></a>The Bill also makes provision for goods instead of cash to those who were awarded community care grants for white goods or large furniture items. The bulk-buying power of central government should mean that these goods are cheaper and thus better value for the taxpayer, helping the cash-limited grant budget to meet more needs for more people. However, the intention is to exclude these awards from the statutory review process, save for the correction of obvious mistakes. The IRS sees many cases where decisions on grant awards have to be changed because the award for a particular item was not the appropriate one. Inadequate or inappropriate awards in the form of goods may not be reviewable, leaving the citizen without resolution of the difficulty which brought them to the Social Fund for help in the first place.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000056"></a>To sum up, I shall use the words of my correspondence from the charitable trust I mentioned earlier, the RL Glasspool Charity Trust. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09063068000103"></a>&#147;The Independent Review Service of the Social Fund is a great source of expertise, has a clear overview of the operation of the Social Fund nationally and the Commissioner reports to the Secretary of State&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09063068000097"></a>I urge the Government to accept the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09063068000057"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09063068000132"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> I have some sympathy with the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment&#151;it would imply the creation of an appeals process for those applicants whose loan applications had been refused&#151;not least because it will tease out the Government&#146;s thinking on this issue. She has started from the premise that there ought to be an appeals process. It is slightly unusual to appeal because it is not about what the applicant has or has not done but is rather an omission to pay him a loan. Should that decision be opened up to question and challenge? Having posed the question, I cannot see any reason why it should not. It would increase openness and transparency, which we are all in favour of. The fact that a decision is open to challenge might act as an incentive to getting it right first time.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000058"></a>As the noble Baroness has pointed out, the Peers&#146; information pack points to customer-care style complaints procedures and the FSA ombudsman as the likely regulator of the provider. However, if someone is not eligible for a loan or there are sound reasons for refusing one, then the applicant should not be able to bog the provider down in appeal after appeal. It ought to suffice that the reasons are made clear and the explanation for the refusal is made. Then there would need to be a limit on continuing to contest that decision, so openness on the refusal might be one way of making the procedures much clearer.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000059"></a>I imagine that that is made all the more likely by the power allowed under new subsection (3), which allows for regional variations. Although I support the localism agenda and agree that it is right that in different circumstances areas will require different approaches, none the less, if it becomes apparent that one applicant is refused and learns that another applicant in a similar circumstance in a different area has had an application for a loan approved, there might well be feelings of unfairness. &#147;The postcode lottery&#148; is a phrase that often turns up in these matters as a counterbalancing to localism. If it is acceptable that there should be

Then perhaps we shall have the smoothing of some very ruffled feathers.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000060"></a>I said that I was interested to hear what the Minister had to say about that because it must have occurred to the department that unsuccessful applicants would inevitably be very unhappy about being refused and might well cause a stir. The Bill is strangely quiet on what should happen next. Perhaps the Government were hoping that any problem would just go away. This is the Minister's opportunity to put the record straight.</p>

Can he remind us how many loans and grants are given? What is the degree of rotation and therefore possible arrears? What are the grounds for refusal, beyond the instances cited by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor&#151;ineligibility by virtue of non-benefit dependency, for example, or that on any points system or previous pattern the entitlement to loans has already been exceeded?</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000062"></a>In other words, can my noble friend tell me how many loans have been refused simply by virtue of financial capping from within the local Jobcentre Plus, as opposed to categories in the Bill or by regulation? That used to be the case: they were cash-limited by local office. If that is the case, given that now, seven years down the line, I understand that almost all the moneys originally lent out are recovered, is there any reason why that cash limitation should continue to apply? That money is recovered fairly quickly, over two to five years, and goes back to the department. As a result, we could avoid some of the real problems of debt, with very high APRs and the grey economy of pawnbrokers and the like. The huge advantage of Social Fund loans is that they are cheap. As a result, taking out a loan does not send you into further debt in the way that almost all other areas of finance do.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000063"></a>Can my noble friend tell us whether the main restriction is on ineligibility grounds&#151;where, as the noble Lord said, there may be paper hearings that simply say, &#147;You are not within the framework of the law or the regulations&#148;&#151;or is it cash-limited, in which case I suggest that my noble friend tells us how much of a problem that is? In the current climate, the Government should be investing in people with cheap credit to avoid the worst problems that come from expensive credit.</p>

As I said in response to an earlier amendment, further consultation will take place this year and we will consider all replies, including views expressed about the amendment.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000065"></a>My noble friend Lady Hollis asked for data on the number of loans from the fund. The discretionary Social Fund is a cash-limited fund. For the year 2007-08, which is the latest for which I have details, the total net expenditure for the community care grant was &#163;138.9 million. The average award was &#163;458. The number of awards was 247,000. To go through the table more logically, the number of applications received was 543,000 and the number of initial decisions was 535,000. There were 247,000 awards, which means that 46 per cent of the initial decisions led to awards. Gross expenditure was &#163;138.9 million. As regards budgeting loans, 1.5 million applications were received and there were 1.2 million awards, which amounts to 75 per cent of the applications received. Gross expenditure was &#163;511,000 and there was &#163;463,000 in recoveries. Therefore, the net expenditure was &#163;47,000.</p>

<p><a name="09063068000066"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09063068000135"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> My noble friend is being extremely helpful and I am very grateful. As regards the 46 per cent success rate for the community care loans and so on, was that primarily or exclusively because it was cash-limited or was it because of some more formal ineligibility? If it was cash-limited, and given the very high recovery rates that my noble friend has just elicited, why are we not increasing the cap in these very difficult times?</p>

In any event, I will follow up with further detail of that because it is not specifically identified in this tabulation. I also make clear on the record that 2.1 million applications were received for crisis loans. There were awards of &#163;1.4 million. Gross expenditure was &#163;121 million and recoveries were &#163;66 million. Thus the net expenditure was &#163;54 million. Applications for such loans have now stabilised at around 270,000 a month between January and May 2009, although in February we hit a record level of 305,000. Twice as many people now get crisis loans as two years ago. Over recent years, we have put additional money into the Social Fund.</p>

If decision-making is in the regions, are they budget-limited or do they operate to common criteria which are laid down centrally?

In 2008-09, there was a decision to significantly increase the number of decision-makers from 800 to 1,500. We have engaged extra decision-makers to meet that requirement. Because of the rise in crisis loan demands, Jobcentre Plus intends to further increase the number of decision-makers to something like 1,800 in total. So we are seeking to ensure that we meet the calls on that budget. The budget is cash-limited. Decisions made in benefit delivery centres involve calls on the national budget which are allocated locally. Part of the approach is to seek to manage that budget using experience and current data about the number of calls on the fund.</p>

Although I ask that it be withdrawn, I appreciate that it seeks to ensure that any individuals who are refused an external provider social loan have recourse to some form of review.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000074"></a>It is our intention that any external provider of social loans will have a complaints procedure. This would be made clear in our invitation-to-tender documentation and would be one of the key criteria to be met by any successful bidder. Any likely candidate to take on this work would be regulated by the FSA and customers would also have the option of complaining to the Financial Ombudsman Service. However, there would be a complaints procedure as well.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000075"></a>External provider social loans should be very different from the current Social Fund loans. We want to harness the innovation and expertise available outside government to help customers with money guidance and provide access to other financial products such as current accounts and loans.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000076"></a>This amendment would place the additional requirement upon these external providers of building an appeals process for those refused a loan, rather than allowing the provider to apply any existing complaints processes, where it has them, including recourse to the services of the financial ombudsman. Such action could well make any contracts less attractive to providers or could result in higher costs. It could also make these loans much less like mainstream financial services products than lenders typically provide, and which we want customers to be able to move to over time.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000077"></a>We are clear that it is important that any provider has a transparent complaints procedure. Therefore, as mentioned already, this will be a key part of any contract in addition to other important requirements, such as who will be eligible for these loans, how they will be repaid and what type of criteria lenders will apply to determine whether a loan should be granted. Together we believe this will provide adequate protection to customers applying for these external provider loans, without placing unnecessary and costly burdens on providers that would make it difficult for this policy to work effectively. In short, I believe the amendment would restrict the service which we aim to construct.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000078"></a>Finally, we come to the question of whether Clause 16 should stand part of the Bill. Clause 16 enables us to restrict the provision of Social Fund loans in areas where external provider social loans are available, as set out in Clause 15. In geographical areas where we put arrangements in place for the provision of external provider social loans, we need to restrict the availability of loans via the Social Fund so that there is not double provision for the same people. I think that the noble Baroness acknowledged that point.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000079"></a>Clause 16 allows us to make these restrictions to the Social Fund. The intention is not to remove access to loans but to create a new system of loans by external providers. People who might currently apply to Jobcentre Plus for a budgeting loan, for example, would instead apply to the external provider for a loan. We envisage that some people will still be able to apply for a Social Fund loan where, for example, legislation or best practice means that an external provider is not permitted to lend to the applicant&#151;for example, because he or she is under 18.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000080"></a>If we did not restrict the availability of Social Fund loans in these circumstances, there would be two parallel schemes. Given that we want o avoid giving a customer two loans for the same purpose or two loans at the same time, both Jobcentre Plus and the external provider would need to check with each other to establish whether they had already provided a loan for the same purpose. This would have administrative costs for both Jobcentre Plus and the external provider. It would also introduce confusion and delay for customers if they did not know which organisation to approach in the first instance.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09063068000081"></a>One of the key drivers behind the provision of loans by external providers is to increase financial inclusion by improving access to mainstream financial institutions and having access to other services, such as budgetary advice, which cannot be provided by Jobcentre Plus but can be provided by an external provider.</p>

We would be very keen for credit unions to be engaged in this process. I think it is right to say that their coverage is not necessarily universal, even within a geographical area, but if we can engage them in this&#151;we would obviously have to have discussions with them&#151;that would be a really good outcome, because they are embedded in their communities and this is a question of providing not only finance but support and financial advice.</p>

It is especially helpful to have that on the record. Oddly enough, I am less concerned about crisis loans where you are dealing with an emergency. Frankly, you may be dealing with young homeless people, substance abuse and so on, and the recovery rate is not going to be terribly good. One understands that. I am concerned about the budgetary loans, which go to lone parents or couples at stable addresses who do not have the capital to manage bumpy expenditure but for whom the recovery rate is pretty good and pretty secure. I am anxious about the rejection of applications from those people simply because the budget is cash-limited and, after the initial capital allocation, becomes self-financing.

Let us say that the external provider is credit union X and is cash-limited, either per month or per year&#151;it does not particularly matter. Surely it would be in a position to offer one of its normal interest-bearing loans once that budget had been reached. Is there anything in the provisions to prevent that?</p>

Some of these are to do with not being on the relevant benefit, or not being on a qualifying benefit for 26 weeks. There is another category but I do not know, at a glance, how much detail we have beneath that. I am certainly happy to write to my noble friend about it. I also do not have details of what would happen about repayments and bad debts under the loan scheme. Obviously, for people on benefits, recoveries are routinely made through deduction from those benefits and would therefore be secure.

We do not know anything about the complaints procedure. We do not know what sort of financial advice the external providers will be able to give.

They would have to study it in great detail if it was going to be part of the advice that they give, as I think it should be.

It would be possible, for example, for a grant to be used to pay for a computer for a disabled person. More normally, they would be used for other capital equipment, such as cookers and fridges, which are irreparable and need to be replaced. I have never heard of a grant being sought or granted for repairs, but I assume that this might be appropriate in certain circumstances. Equally, the community care grant can be used for services&#151;in theory, anyway, or perhaps by law. I confess that I have never understood quite what services are in this context and I am sure that the Minister will tell us which and what services can be applied for. Is it possible under this clause to bulk purchase services? I confess that I find that a difficult concept.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000002"></a>I see new subsection (2B) of Section 138 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 as applying principally to capital items. I also see it as a money-saving provision driven by the Treasury. Surprise, surprise&#151;I do not mind that. The Minister will remember that I had occasion last week to comment, &#147;Look after the millions and the billions will look after themselves&#148;. Last year, social care grants cost the taxpayer &#163;138.9 million, so perhaps that phrase is not quite so apt today. None the less, it is a great deal of money, and there is money to be saved by the bulk purchase of, say, fridges, cookers or computers. This is what new subsection (2B) is all about.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000003"></a>These probing amendments are designed to discover how the new system, which I am all for, will work. It would be beyond credibility for bulk-purchased items to be stored in social security offices and it would be wasteful of resources if the applicant could go and choose their replacement cooker, or whatever, from a government-run store. What then is left? I would expect the wholesaler or local shop to have the bulk-purchased item that the grantee would ask for. The question then arises: how physically would the money get to the seller? At the moment, my understanding is that the grant is given cash-in-hand to the shop by the grantee. However, how does the local jobcentre know that this cash is not being spent on a cheaper item and the difference pocketed? Would this not be an extremely profligate use of taxpayers&#146; money?</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000004"></a>Under new subsection (2B) it appears to my noble friend and I that money still changes hands from the Social Fund to the recipient. The only way for the jobcentre which administers the fund to know the right amount of money to pay out would be to know

That is not a practical proposition, especially as the bulk purchase would be done on a national or, at best, regional basis. </p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000005"></a>I am suggesting in Amendment 131 that the cheapest and most cost-effective way for things to happen would be if the grantee were given a voucher for a specific item&#151;a particular sort of cooker such as a Baby Belling, or whatever is appropriate&#151;which has been pre-purchased under the bulk contract, preferably with the manufacturer; although in that case, some recompense to the wholesaler or the local shop would of course be required to cover their costs in the operation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09063083000006"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09063083000057"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, for tabling these amendments which focus on the Bill&#146;s provisions for community care grants.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000007"></a>Before I address the amendments I should outline the thinking behind these provisions. Community care grants are designed to allow the most vulnerable individuals and families to be resettled or remain in the community. They provide valuable support for those who frequently have nowhere else to turn. We feel that the current system whereby, in general, cash is provided to individuals will be enhanced by requiring the provision of goods or services in most cases. It will not only help to secure value for money from the award, but ensure that all items are of an acceptable quality. It will also ensure that the grant is spent on the item it is awarded for. We aim to achieve discounts on the items supplied under contract. The savings that will be created should therefore allow the community care grant budget to help more individuals in need and provide greater value for money to the taxpayer. Not only will we protect the most vulnerable individuals by helping to secure quality items, we will also allow those who have special requirements&#151;for example, through ill-health or a disability&#151;in appropriate cases, to receive items or services which are not part of the standard contract or even cash in some cases.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000008"></a>Amendment 131 would require a voucher to be given to the customer that would then be exchanged for the goods or services from the supplier. I recognise that the amendment is probing. Prescribing that a voucher system must be used would severely restrict any room for flexibility and innovation regarding the potential delivery solution that could be utilised. How, exactly, this scheme is implemented must be flexible, user-friendly and, importantly, fit with both Jobcentre Plus and the suppliers. This is why we do not wish to commit to any specific method of delivery in the Bill. Indeed, it is possible that there may be very different solutions, say, for large goods that would need delivery; smaller items that it may be appropriate for the customer to collect; and unusual or specialist items that may not be subject to a contract. Specifying that level of detail in legislation could potentially discourage suppliers from bidding for a contract and could also impact on our ability to achieve the best price possible.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000009"></a>A similar issue arises with Amendment 132, which would require all successful community care grant applicants to be awarded goods or services under the  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC55"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arrangements made by the Secretary of State regardless of the item they applied for or their individual circumstances. Due to the wide range of customer needs that the community care grants are designed to fulfil&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, outlined some of them&#151;it is necessary to have the provision to award cash for goods or services not covered by the contracts. Not having these provisions would mean that some vulnerable individuals could be unsuccessful in their application purely because we did not have a contract with a supplier for the particular item that they needed. The alternative would be to have a wide range of contracts to cover every foreseeable circumstance. This would create problems in tendering for and managing contracts in order to maintain access to items that may be required infrequently, with the potential to diminish any savings that could be achieved.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000010"></a>While we accept that as many awards as possible should be provided in the form of goods or services under the arrangements, there will be circumstances in which such an award would not be appropriate. There must be flexibility to provide cash or other goods or services in such circumstances. We will ensure that these circumstances are clearly defined to enable decision-makers and customers of Jobcentre Plus to understand when such an award is appropriate. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked me what services we are talking about. If we look, for instance, at white goods, a cooker would be the good, and the service would be the delivery and the fitting. Cooker plus delivery plus fitting equals goods and services.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000011"></a>I was also asked about storage and payment. There would be no storage of items. The contract is with the supplier who will then deliver the item or arrange for the item to be collected. The payment will go directly from the DWP to the supplier. I hope that I have covered the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and, with that, I would urge him to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09063083000012"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0003.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09063083000058"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> That is all very helpful. Of course, I am the first to agree that where we are talking about capital items such as white goods or whatever, the individual item should last for a number of years and, in this day and age, use the lowest possible amount of electricity. These sorts of things fit into the idea of quality and I am 100 per cent for that.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000013"></a>I am also, as I said in my opening remarks, satisfied that the intention has always been that the grant should be spent on the item that is applied for, with or without the services. However, the noble Baroness has not answered the following question. Although I accept that vouchers would not be appropriate in every case, would they ever be appropriate? It would be helpful to have the answer to that question before I carry on.</p>

<p><a name="09063083000014"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0003.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09063083000059"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I am delighted to&#151;I hope&#151;answer that question. We are not ruling out the use of a voucher system. Many different delivery systems could be utilised, but this would have to be negotiated and specified in our contract with a supplier. As I have said before, the delivery system must be flexible and user-friendly and should take advantage of the most up-to-date technologies and processes, so nothing is being ruled out.</p>

They translate into two specific issues of note and one amendment which is purely textual.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000017"></a>I would first like to explain the purpose of the clause in order to put these amendments into context. Clause 20 replaces the existing system by which the Secretary of State may make a payment on account of benefit&#151;also called an interim payment&#151;with a more flexible system. Interim payments are an administrative tool that allows a payment to be made when normal benefit cannot be paid, usually because the claiming process is delayed or because the claim has yet to be determined.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000018"></a>The new system will allow the Secretary of State to make a payment earlier than it would normally be paid in cases where there is particular financial need. Also, payments made in advance will be recovered gradually from subsequent payments of benefit rather than set against the very first benefit payment, as now. In other respects the new system will retain many features of the old. A decision, for instance, to make a payment on account will continue to be non-appealable, although decisions regarding recovery will still carry the right of appeal.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000019"></a>The new system is designed to provide quicker and more effective help to those in need when they make their claim. Rather than having to make a separate   


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC57"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC57</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>application to the Social Fund for a crisis loan, the aim is that consideration can be given to making an advance payment within the claiming process itself.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000020"></a>The first issue of note on these amendments is that we wish to remove housing benefit from the scope of the new regime and put it back on its existing footing. This is achieved by Amendments 133 and 134. The current requirements are that a local authority must make a payment on account of a rent allowance if it is impracticable to determine a claim within 14 days, and the delay is not the fault of the claimant. This works perfectly well as it is. In these circumstances, we believe it makes sense for the existing arrangements for housing benefit to continue as they are rather than introduce a new regime where, in the unique circumstances of this particular benefit, there is no real need. I will say something about Amendment 133A later, once the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has had the opportunity to speak to it.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000021"></a>The second issue of note with the amendments in my name is that we want to remove a power that we believe is no longer required. It was originally thought that we would want to prescribe circumstances where a payment on account would not be brought into account against subsequent payments of benefit. On further reflection, we cannot envisage any such circumstance, so Amendment 135 removes the power in new Section 5(1B)(b) which would have been inserted into the Social Security Administration Act 1992.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000022"></a>By the very nature of what it is, a payment made on account of a benefit stands to be brought into account against a payment of benefit whenever it is made. That is not to say, however, that the Secretary of State will necessarily pursue recovery of every last penny of an interim payment if the person never becomes entitled to benefit, or comes off it before recovery can be completed. Even if the Secretary of State opts not to pursue recovery, that does not mean that the sums paid should cease to be repayable.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000023"></a>The final amendment, Amendment 136, is a technical change to avoid reference to an outdated side-heading in the Social Security Administration Act 1992 about&#151;would you believe it?&#151;community charge benefit. At this juncture, I give way to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, to hear what he has to say about his amendment.</p>
<div class="amendment_heading"><p align="center"><a name="09063083000077"></a><i>Amendment 133A (to Amendment A133)</i></p>

However, I was rather surprised by his statement that the clause puts housing benefit back to what it is without the activities listed in the Bill. How has it come about that in a very few weeks, the Government appear to have changed their mind on the housing benefit regulations?</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC58"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000025"></a>It is unrealistic to expect claims to be immediately determined and paid without hesitation. For a variety of reasons, as the Minister set out, delays may occur, and there ought to be a mechanism to resolve difficulties in making those payments. However, when I read the government amendment, I could not make any sense of the first paragraph of proposed new subsection (1ZA). It appears to describe an impossibility and is therefore quite pointless. Proposed new paragraph (a) allows for regulations to be made to cover cases,</p>
<ul><a name="09063083000052"></a>&#147;where no claim has been made and it is impracticable for one to be made immediately&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09063083000043"></a>I am confused. If there is no claim, how can anyone say if it can be made, let alone whether it can be made immediately? I have therefore proposed Amendment 133A, which amends government Amendment 133. It effectively rewrites proposed new paragraph (a) to state that, &#147;where it is impracticable for a claim to be made immediately&#148;, regulations to cover payment on account of housing benefit shall be used.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000026"></a>I expect that the Minister has had crack teams of civil servants and draftsmen working through the night to explain why the government amendment makes perfect sense and mine makes none at all. As this is a drafting point, I will listen with interest and I am sure that all will become clear, even if, as one Private Secretary in the department&#151;alas, she has now left the room&#151;said to me some years ago, it has the draftsmen spitting blood. I beg to move.</p>

Under the current system, people receive a leaving grant when they leave prison of &#163;46, which can be doubled if they have no fixed abode. Then, having come out of prison, they have to start the process of applying for benefits, which can sometimes take up to three weeks. You try to live on &#163;46 for three weeks.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000028"></a>When I was Chief Inspector of Prisons&#151;indeed I have mentioned it subsequently&#151;it seemed much more sensible that the benefits arrangements should be prepared before people left prison so that they did not get a leaving grant but received, in effect, the first benefit. This would be paid not necessarily from the jobcentres to which they would subsequently go but by the prison acting in loco jobcentre, if you like, because frequently they are held somewhere away from the area where they live. If that happened, you would save a tremendous amount of subsequent problems because the next week they would go and collect the next benefit. This would also introduce people to the whole jobcentre system. It is crucial that they have help in preparing the documentation, rather than suddenly being sent to what is frequently a foreign environment for them.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000029"></a>I therefore read these amendments with considerable optimism because it seemed to me that, in preparing Clause 20 and the amendments to it, the department had come up with a possible solution. I wondered whether in the preparation of the Bill the department had had consultations with the Ministry of Justice to see whether this was a practical way out of a problem

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000033"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, spoke to a point which he raised earlier in Committee, and we are looking into the issue with the Ministry of Justice. The flexibility that Clause 20 provides could help. There is a process of liaising with the Prison Service about people who are due to leave prison to get them into the Jobcentre Plus system, but I am not sure that that is the complete answer to the real issue raised by the noble Lord.</p>

<p><a name="09063083000034"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09063083000069"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> I welcome my noble friend&#146;s remarks. Could he press this issue, which has been raised on several occasions in the past? The obstacle then was not the DWP but that it was a Home Office responsibility. It was the Home Office which, for whatever reason, was reluctant to engage in the necessary preparatory work, either to release people out or to bring people in, to set this in place. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, is right: unless someone has a secure housing address that they can afford to go to, you will get a revolving door. But, from my memory, the problem did not lie with the DWP but elsewhere. If my noble friend can restart the discussions, I am sure that would be really welcome.</p>

<p><a name="09063083000038"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, explained, Amendment 133A seeks to alter the formulation of the Government&#146;s Amendment 133 to Clause 20, which deals with payments on account of benefit but in no way changes the effect of a provision that has been on the statute book for a very long time. The provision in question relates specifically to making a payment on account of housing benefit when no claim has yet been made, and the relevant wording in our amendment is identical to the equivalent existing provision in the Social Security Administration Act 1992, which itself derived from the Social Security Act 1986, for which the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, may have had some responsibility. This provision makes it possible to allow for such payments in circumstances in which there has been serious disruption to housing benefit services as the result, for example, of a catastrophic loss of computer services or an influenza epidemic that affected the number of staff available.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000039"></a>The power also makes it possible to provide for payments on account in cases of individual emergency where the customer is unable to claim. However, the Government foresee no need for regulations to permit a payment on account for such individual cases if housing benefit services have not been disrupted by a more general emergency. To date, this power has not been exercised, so the housing benefit regulations currently do not permit payments on account if no claim has been made. Although there are no plans to use this power in the future, it needs to be retained to permit the Government to address the sort of large-scale emergency that I have described and which drastically affects the ability of local authorities to process housing benefit applications.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09063083000040"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Lord seeks not to change the effect of this power in any way but merely to alter the language that is used to express it. The formulation in Amendment 133 has, as I have said, existed in social security legislation for a long time. It is clearly expressed and requires no change. On that basis, I ask that the noble Lord withdraw the amendment.</p>

I rather suspected that this was a reformulation, or indeed a copy of previous legislation, but I had not appreciated that it went back to 1986. I have a feeling that since I joined the department only in June or July 1986, that particular Act of Parliament may not have been my responsibility, but I am sure there are others behind the Minister who will be able to confirm or confute that piece of information.</p>

I understand, and indeed agree with, the principle that benefits payments cannot be unconditional. There cannot be so much money in the public pot that they can be paid out in any circumstance, and part of the contract between the citizen and the state must be that if the state is supporting an individual, it is entirely reasonable to expect that individual to comply with the law of the land. Such an obligation extends to everyone, of course, but the punishment in the case of a non-claimant is the criminal conviction and sanction that they receive. Because there is an added relationship between the state and the recipient of benefits&#151;that is the money they receive as welfare payments&#151;it is therefore logical and reasonable to consider these payments when an offence related to benefits is committed.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09063086000002"></a>This pair of amendments, therefore, looks at the relationship between a benefits offence and a benefits sanction, although in practice they are really drafting amendments. The first, Amendment 138, inserts a caveat into new subsection (6) on page 25 which makes clear that this sanction applies only until the abolition of income support under Clause 7. I expect that the Minister will argue that the addition of these words is unnecessary to the operation of the Bill, as he did on my previous amendment. I am even prepared to concede that he will probably be correct, but I wish to make the point that sanctions will migrate, just as the recipients do, from one type of benefit to another as the whole system is rationalised. That must be made clear to people if we are to have a sanction that includes loss of benefit. There must be no ambiguity about what that sanction may entail. I worry that some of the deterrent qualities of such sanctions may be muddied if people do not realise exactly what they stand to lose if they commit an offence.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09063086000003"></a>The second amendment deals with the definition of an offence. On page 26 we are told that a post-commencement offence,</p>
<ul><a name="09063086000016"></a>&#147;means any criminal offence committed after the commencement of this section&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC62"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09063086000014"></a>To me that is only half clear. I understand the post-commencement aspect, but the rest is rather baffling. If we track down through new subsection (13) on page 26, we are told, first, that &#147;benefit offence&#148; means (a), (b), (c) or (d), all of which are post-commencement offences relating to any benefit offence. That seems fair; but does the Bill really mean what it says, whereby a post-commencement offence is &#147;any criminal offence&#148;? Does that include murder, hunting with hounds, driving under the influence, smashing windows and any other criminal offence? Does the Bill really mean to open up the definition of benefits offences as any and all criminal offences? The last line of new subsection (13) appears to widen enormously the remit of the benefit sanctions regime. Is that intentional and is that correct? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09063086000004"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0004.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09063086000020"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I understand that Amendment 137 has been withdrawn, so I shall deal only with Amendments 138 and 139.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09063086000005"></a>Amendment 138 would include a specific reference to the abolition of income support in applying benefit fraud sanctions. Although I think I understand why the noble Lord has tabled this amendment, I hope that I can reassure him, as he anticipated, that it is unnecessary. We intend that loss of benefit provision resulting from benefit fraud will continue to be applied to income support cases only until such time that no-one remains in receipt of this benefit. For this reason, Schedule 7 of the Bill covers the required repeals and revocations resulting from the abolition of income support. This updates the Social Security Fraud Act 2001 sections where necessary and addresses the issue that the noble Lord raised. It is clear that a benefit fraud sanction cannot be applied to a non-existent benefit and therefore the amendment is not required.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09063086000006"></a>Amendment 139 would change the definition of a post-commencement offence. However, the change suggested by the noble Lord could cause confusion, as a benefit offence has already been defined as any post-commencement offence in new Section 6B(13) of the Bill. The use of the word &#147;criminal&#148; is intended to make it clear that the behaviour constituting the benefit offence is fraud, which is a criminal offence. It is benefit offences which are covered by this definition; they are offences which are criminal offences&#151;that is to say, fraudulent.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09063086000007"></a>The fraud sanction that leads to a one-off strike being imposed may be an administrative penalty or caution rather than a conviction in court, but before an alternative sanction can be offered there must be sufficient evidence that the criminal offence of benefit fraud has been committed to consider a prosecution.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09063086000008"></a>I hope that that covers the noble Lord&#146;s point and that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

However, I am now convinced that there is enough hard evidence from citizens advice bureaux around the country to highlight that there is indeed a problem. The CABs report that clients who were being called to an interview under caution for investigation of possible benefit fraud were often uncertain about what they are being accused of. In some cases, the call to interview is the first that they have heard of the allegation, and it is not adequately explained to them why they are being investigated. Some do not realise that they are entitled to be accompanied to the interview. A person whose benefit is being stopped due to investigation may be entitled to hardship payments, but many are left vulnerable to falling into rent arrears and losing their homes. A lack of flexibility in the system means that people who have made a genuine error&#151;sometimes due to major upheavals in their lives, such as the death of a partner, or because of complex reporting requirements related to some benefits&#151;are nonetheless prosecuted.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09063086000011"></a>A common theme running through the CAB evidence is that the reasons for a so-called fraudulent claim are complex and often result from a mistake by either Jobcentre Plus or HMRC. The following is a good example. Three years ago, a woman was receiving income support and child tax credit. She visited Jobcentre Plus to ask how many hours she could work without her benefit being affected. She was told that she could work for up to 16 hours a week, but that turned out to be quite misleading. If she worked for up to 16 hours a week, she would still be entitled to income support, but any earnings above &#163;20 a week would have to be declared and deducted from her income support. This poor woman started work only to find that both her income support and child tax credit were stopped. The following April she received a letter saying that she was no longer entitled to income support due to a change in circumstances, but she was also invited to renew her claim, which she did, including a statement of her earnings for work. She genuinely believed that she was entitled to the benefits but then faced a fraud investigation due to poor advice from Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09063086000012"></a>The complications in the system are such that great care should surely be taken to ensure that genuine claimants who are simply baffled by the complexities of the system are not accused of fraud and do not have their benefits cut. One has only to go to the Directgov website to try to find out about, say, child tax credit, to see the complexities set out. First, one is directed to the HMRC website. Then there are three

Many people are coming into the benefit system all the time who will be unfamiliar with it, let alone those whose knowledge of English is extremely limited.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09063086000013"></a>We all want genuine benefit cheats caught and prosecuted, but we do not want our enthusiasm to catch fraudsters to include in the net those who make genuine mistakes and find that they are sanctioned quite inappropriately. I will be interested to hear the Minister's comments.</p>

That is good news, but we must not be complacent; we recognise that there is still fraud in the system.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000002"></a>I acknowledge that, as the noble Baroness said, the system is complex. Part of what we seek to address in the Bill is to move towards a simpler system, but there will always be a degree of complexity in a system that tries to cater for a whole range of needs. That is the environment in which we live. Convictions are judged by the courts, not by the DWP, although I accept that that is not the case when we are dealing with cautions or administrative penalties.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000003"></a>On the point made about not many people knowing what they are suspected of and not knowing that they can be accompanied, a letter issued calling an individual in for an interview under caution states that they can be accompanied. The letter may be the first that they know about the fraud investigation&#151;sometimes for obvious reasons. The decision whether to offer an administrative penalty or caution is made by a fraud manager. I stress that that is only an offer; they do not have to accept. They can contest the case, in which case the court will decide. Notwithstanding that, we always need to ensure that the system recognises that there are vulnerable people and people whose understanding of issues is sometimes challenged, and that our systems are fair to those people. We seek to do that.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000004"></a>Clause 21 introduces a change to the benefit fraud sanctions regime. It amends the Social Security Fraud Act 2001 and allows for benefit to be withdrawn or reduced for those customers who commit benefit fraud for the first time. Our existing, successful two-strikes benefit fraud sanction, introduced in 2001, allows that customers convicted of benefit fraud twice within a period of five years are disqualified from benefit for a set period. We believe that it is now time to build on the success of the two-strikes initiative by extending the penalties that fraudsters face to deter more people from committing benefit fraud. The clause will do that through the introduction of a loss-of-benefit sanction for first-time benefit offences.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000005"></a>As a result, all fraudulent customers who have committed benefit fraud, whether as a first or subsequent offence, will now face the loss or reduction of their benefit for a set period. That is in addition to any administrative penalty, caution or court conviction and requirement to repay the overpayment. Given

Is there any give when that has happened, or will someone always be penalised if it looks like fraud?</p>

Many of the people who are in this situation have been on benefits or are dyslexic. Some cannot read and write, many cannot speak English, and many&#151;like me&#151;simply do not understand a lot of the details of these arrangements. The Minister talks of advisers in the jobcentre. If they are advisers, they ought to advise, not penalise. They ought to help the person to understand what the problems are, and if that person has made a mistake, they ought to accept an apology and put things right. Of course there are real fraudsters. I remember asking a question in Parliament when there was &#163;2 billion of housing fraud, but that was mainly as a result of landlords applying for housing benefit on houses that did not exist. I am sure that a lot of people who are on benefits do not understand the incredible complexity, and they really do deserve help.</p>

If the money has actually flowed, I can understand that it is fraud, pure and simple. If it has not yet flowed, I find it a lot more difficult to understand that it is fraud.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000010"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, made the point that customer error would typically be dealt with elsewhere in the jobcentre and would not come into the section that looks at the possibility of fraud. Clearly there has to be sufficient evidence to prosecute. Where someone had misunderstood the rules, particularly if they had been advised by Jobcentre Plus that what they were doing was in order, it would be quite difficult to see fraud being considered in those circumstances.</p>

I am sure that the three big areas of fraud are: first, that you are claiming the JSA and earning on the side; secondly, that you are a lone parent with a live-in boyfriend and therefore not really a lone parent; and, thirdly, where landlords and tenants collude in trying to maximise housing benefit. In almost none of those circumstances could you say that there was anything other than the intent to deceive. On the question of fraud arising from misunderstanding the paperwork, in my experience departments, civil servants and advisers bend over backwards to give people the benefit of the doubt. One knows and can recognise what conventional up-front fraud actually looks like.</p>

To a great extent, it is a framework set above a series of experiments which are in themselves a sort of framework. This supra-framework, for the want of a better expression, allows pilots to be conducted to see if particular threads in the Bill will work in practice. It is they which will finalise the schemes to be rolled out nationwide in due course. The final schemes could be very different from the original pilots. We just do not know, any of us, whether one pilot in respect of any particular thread of the Bill will be enough or whether a second or even a third, fourth or fifth will be necessary.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000020"></a>It goes without saying that the longer a pilot scheme is to continue, the more delayed the final countrywide rollout will be. No one can deny that. It is particularly relevant to the next group of amendments, to which I shall speak in due course.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000021"></a>This amendment concerns state pension credit. Clause 23 allows pilots to be run to establish whether the particular scheme in that pilot will increase the uptake of state pension credit. The objective of state pension credit is to bring the income of pensioners with little or no extra income beyond the state pension of &#163;95.25 for a single person per week, an extra &#163;57.05 for a dependent adult up to a minimum income of &#163;130 for a single person and &#163;198.45 for a couple. It could perhaps be described as a minimum wage for pensioners. The catch-all way of achieving this objective would be to raise the basic state pension to the level of this minimum wage. No Government could possibly contemplate that because of the expense, so this Government invented pension credit. The problem is that by no means all the people who are entitled to it  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC68"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>claim it. I understand that the Treasury never thought that it would be fully utilised and I am sure that the Minister will tell us the number of people who should be claiming it and are not.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000022"></a>Not surprisingly, the Official Opposition, particularly in another place, have waxed lyrical about this failing of the Government. This is the whole narrative for the clause, which has the effect of introducing a pilot scheme enabling HMRC to pay pension credit with no claim being made. The Government are 100 per cent correct to pilot this scheme, so that we can all see what effect, if any, it has&#151;not on the take-up, which will inevitably rise&#151;but on the living standards of pensioners.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000023"></a>My suggestion&#151;I would not put it any higher than that&#151;is that 12 months for such a scheme is not long enough to have a proper evaluation and then roll out this no-claim proposal to become the norm across the country. Given, in particular, that two-year pilots are now considered to be the right length of time for most pilots, why have the Government chosen the minimum possible time of only one year for this one? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000024"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09063098000214"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b><b></b>Perhaps I may start by reiterating what the Government have done on pension credit. When we came to office in 1997, because of the decoupling of the basic state pension from the earnings link, a huge raft of pensioners were in real poverty. Pension credit was an early act of this Government to seek to make sure that resources were channelled at the poorest. Indeed, that has helped significantly in taking hundreds of thousands of pensioners out of poverty. But the take-up is still not as high as we would wish. We believe that between 61 per cent and 70 per cent of pensioners who are entitled receive pension credit, although the take-up of the guaranteed credit, which is paid to the poorest pensioners, is between 72 per cent and 81 per cent.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000025"></a>Notwithstanding the provisions in the clause, which I shall come to in a moment in responding to the amendment, we are committed to ensuring that pensioners receive the support to which they are entitled. That is why we have simplified the claims process; you can now get housing benefit, council tax benefit and pension credit via one phone call and multiple claims are not necessary. A new take-up campaign was launched in early 2009 and will be rolled out across 20 regions where there are a high number of eligible non-recipients of pension credit. During May of this year, the DWP wrote to 230 pension credit recipients to encourage them to contact their local council to check whether they are entitled to council tax benefit and housing benefit. So we are looking to improve the take-up of these benefits on a joined-up basis.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000026"></a>In addition, we are conducting around 13,000 home visits a week to vulnerable customers to ensure that they are receiving all benefits and services to which they are entitled. We currently have joint working partnerships, live or at the implementation stage, with all 203 primary-tier local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales. These partnerships enable the Pensions, Disability and Carers Service, local authorities and the voluntary sector to provide a single point of access to social care and benefit entitlement.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC69"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC69</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000027"></a>Pension credit has been highly successful since its introduction in 2003. The number of pensioners with relatively low income has reduced by around 500,000 but it is becoming increasingly difficult, notwithstanding the action that we have taken, to reach those people we believe may be entitled to pension credit but who, for a variety of reasons, are not claiming it. As part of the Government&#146;s ongoing commitment to help people to get the support to which they are entitled, we are looking for new ways of encouraging such people to take up what help is rightfully theirs. The powers in Clause 23 will help us to do this by paving the way to exploring the potential for making better use of the information that government already hold to ensure that we maximise the number of older people who get the help to which they are entitled.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000028"></a>I understand that there is considerable and understandable interest in how the piloted powers in Clause 23 will be used. However, I hope noble Lords will indulge me with a little patience as the structure and design of the pilot has not yet been finalised. However, we are keen to ensure that the pilot is designed in such a way as to provide a robust body of evidence about the prospects for making better use of the information available to us in order to improve take-up of pension credit. The pilot will also provide evidence for an informed debate on whether we should seek new or better data sources, or simplify the benefit rules so that the claims process can be streamlined in the longer term.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000029"></a>In designing the pilot, it will clearly be important both that we work closely with our external stakeholders and that we subject the design to close analytical scrutiny to ensure that the pilot design and evaluation methodology is appropriate and robust. Until we have gone through that exacting process, I hope that noble Lords will understand that I cannot be too forthcoming in the detail of the design of the pilot scheme. That said, we plan to have the necessary regulations in place detailing how the pilot will operate by the end of this year, with a view to running the pilot no earlier than April 2010. While on the subject of regulations, I should say that they will be made using the affirmative procedures, so that both noble Lords and Members of the other place have the opportunity to debate them.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000030"></a>With regard to the duration of the pilot, which was the focus of the noble Lord&#146;s amendments, it may well be that it runs for only a relatively limited period of, say, three months, and so the 12-month period will allow us adequate time to do what we need to do. We are currently working on the detailed design of the pilot programme in conjunction with colleagues in government and the voluntary sector. In designing the pilot, we are looking at how best to evaluate the logistics of running an automatic payment system, the quality of administrative data used to make such awards and participants&#146; reactions to receiving an automatic payment. It is also right that we are carrying out qualitative research both with people who have gone on to claim pension credit at the end of the trial payment and with those who do not to find out about experiences of and attitudes toward the automatic payment itself and the reasons for subsequently claiming

As I said, we anticipate having the necessary legislative framework in place by the end of this year.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000031"></a>We are considering making estimated awards of pension credit for a limited period of around three months to a sample group of about 2,000 pensioners, based on the information that we already have and without the need for a claim. I think that that issue differentiates this pilot from the generality of pilots where we are testing new approaches. We are dealing with information that we already have in the system and looking at a fairly concentrated approach to automatic payment of pension credit, using the data that we already have. I hope that that explains our position clearly to the noble Lord.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000032"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09063098000215"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> I commend my noble friend on this. It will be wonderful if it works. It will square the circle of trying to have targeted help while avoiding some of the problems of stigma that are associated with take-up. That would be splendid. My noble friend may have to wait until the scheme has been further designed, but how is he going to manage the income derived from capital rules on this? There is some research on why people do not claim pension credit. The biggest single reason is that because we have made it more generous&#151;and rightly so&#151;people towards the end get so little for the last &#163;5 or so, that they decide that it is not worth the bother. There are also problems to do with the fact that people have applied for a different benefit in the past and therefore think that, as a result, they will lose this one. It might also be because they live with family members and think that they are not entitled when they are.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000033"></a>We know quite a lot of the reasons for this but it seems that one of the practical problems about investigating people&#146;s eligibility is that we know their income&#151;which ought to be fine&#151;but we do not always know about their capital and the putative income that is derived from it. I know that it has now gone up to &#163;10,000, which is great, and I know that, as a result, we have removed some 70 per cent of pensioners from coming within the effect of that rule. Does my noble friend yet have enough information to be able to tell us how he will overcome that hurdle? I can see how the rest of it could work in a pilot, including the five-year rules and so on, but I do not yet see how you can get around this problem. Can my noble friend tell us? It may just be too early&#151;I would obviously respect that&#151;but it would be helpful to know what sort of shape it might take and how we could address the problems that have bedevilled automaticity in the past.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000034"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09063098000216"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My noble friend is right in a sense; it is too early to address that in detail. The group that we are particularly hoping to engage with this are those who may have somewhat small entitlements to pension credit and those on savings credit who perhaps do not understand that they are eligible to claim. They may not have worked out that their income and capital still permits them to make a claim.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC71"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000035"></a>Obviously, there is a database, which I am sure is familiar to my noble friend, that has details of people&#146;s income on it. It certainly holds some data about people&#146;s capital holdings, such as bank accounts, ISAs, PEPs and TESSAs, but it does not necessarily have the totality of information on capital that we would need to be absolutely certain. That is one of the challenges that we face. We are helped by the change in the capital disregard that was put in place recently, and by the general data on the level of savings in aggregate that people have. I have forgotten the statistics, but something like 40 per cent of the population have savings income of less than &#163;1. Although the average is higher, it is highly skewed at the top end. The points raised by my noble friend are very relevant. There are some challenges in moving forward on this, but there is an opportunity here that we must grasp.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000036"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09063098000217"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I am grateful to the Minister and to the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, for her interest in this matter. In my belated speech&#151;or, rather, my backdated speech would perhaps be a better way of explaining it&#151;which the Minister very generously allowed me to make, I made the point that it is absolutely right for a Government, having set themselves on a particular course in policy terms, to ensure that those policy terms are met as far as possible. I readily understand why pilots are necessary; I did not in any sense seek to demean them. I take the Minister&#146;s point that pilots in this case are dealing with information already held, presumably by HMRC, which knows the income position of individuals. It is inevitable, I suppose, that pensioners who are sailing close to the limit&#151;in other words, who would attract only an extra 25 or 30 pence a week&#151;would not bother to claim. However, that is no reason not to allow them to claim. After all, the over-80 allowance of 25 pence has been on the statute book for goodness knows how long and no Government has proposed removing it.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000037"></a>One thing that the Minister said in this connection that rather surprised me was that the Government are now committed to the fact that pensioners should receive the support to which they are entitled. The words &#147;now committed&#148; seem very odd and I shall have to study the Minister&#146;s exact words.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000038"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0005.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09063098000218"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> With great respect, I do not think that I can let the noble Lord get away with that. The history of this Government shows that we have supported pensioners through a whole raft of policy initiatives and resources. We have supported and sought to help pensioners throughout the time of this Government. A figure springs to mind: if we had simply rolled forward the policies of the previous Government, pensioners in aggregate would be something like &#163;30 billion a year worse off. We have a strong record in that regard but there is more to do. We need to work to ensure that there is full take-up of the facilities and arrangements that exist to support pensioners.</p>

If he did, I was very surprised to hear them. I, of course, accept that the number of pensioners in poverty has been reduced by half a million, I think the Minister said, by the operation of pension credit, and that is clearly a good thing.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000040"></a>As far as these individual pilots are concerned, does the Minister really think that one three-month pilot will be sufficient, or will we have a succession of pilots before we have a final rollout? Clearly, the clause provides for that. Equally, it provides for a pilot of anything up to 12 months; it could be one month, it could be 12 months. I do not know whether the Minister wants to answer that question.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000041"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0005.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09063098000220"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> In designing the pilot we have a duty to ensure that it is set up so as to provide good evidence on automatic payments, as well as protecting participants and spending taxpayers&#146; money wisely. We believe that a pilot of around three months in duration strikes an appropriate balance between being long enough to enable participants to experience an automatic payment while not being so long that they risk becoming reliant on it or the pilot becoming prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we believe that three months is about right.</p>

The Minister said that it depended on what the pilot was for. I take the point but the appropriate length is particularly relevant to Clause 24,  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC73"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which is shorter than the explanatory note in the Peers&#146; information pack which covers two pages of A4. At first blush, it might seem to some that the Government protesteth too much but, on closer examination, this long explanation of the clause is necessary and I for one am grateful for it.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000047"></a>Specified enactments relating to working-age benefits are already being piloted. These pilots last for 12 or 24 months depending only on what is being piloted. We cannot but agree that 12 months is too short a period and that it has been necessary to have one pilot after another. Each pilot is subject to the affirmative procedure and the order can be laid while a pilot is running its course in order to set-up provision for the next one.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000048"></a>The object of the exercise is to ascertain how to establish schemes that will, or will be likely to, encourage people to obtain or remain in work or make it more likely that they will be able to do so. The Government claim that it is necessary to extend the time limits from 12 months to 36 months,</p>
<ul><a name="09063098000186"></a>&#147;to develop a good evidence base&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09063098000164"></a>for policy advances. The Peers&#146; information pack continues that,</p>
<ul><a name="09063098000187"></a>&#147;pilots today normally need to last longer than 12 months&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09063098000165"></a>not least because their proper evaluation,</p>
<ul><a name="09063098000188"></a>&#147;can take at least 18 months&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09063098000166"></a>and it takes a further 18 months to start a new one. Add the two together and you get the magic number of 36 months for a pilot scheme. Yet the Minister told us&#151;I think it was last week, although it could have been earlier; time flies when you&#146;re having fun&#151;that the pilots were to be evaluated not only at the end of their fixed period but throughout that period. That being so, it cannot possibly take a full 18 months to have an evaluation at the end of the pilot. Even six months into a pilot, the evaluators will have a pretty good idea of its likely success or otherwise on completion. In 18 months, you can be pretty certain of the result. It is just possible that it might throw up a wobbly in the last six months, but I think we can conclude that that is unlikely. To allow a further 18 months for this wobbly to evidence itself is ridiculous. Why, then, have the Government come to the conclusion that three years is the appropriate amount of time for a pilot?</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000049"></a>There is another point at issue here, which again I alluded to in Amendment 147. The whole objective of a pilot is to evaluate whether the scheme therein is appropriate for rollout nationwide. It may&#151;indeed, it often does&#151;take more than one pilot to establish a final plan that is suitable for everyone in the country. The problem is that the longer pilots continue the greater is the delay to this universal application, on the one hand, and, on the other, if pilots are unsuccessful in achieving their objectives, the longer the people who are likely to be affected by a national rollout will remain in suspense.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000050"></a>Lastly, the Minister&#146;s letter of 22 June&#151;which I received this morning and for which I am grateful&#151;shows that there is a great deal of inconsistency in the Bill. Some pilots, such as the pension credit pilot that we have just discussed, are to last for only up to 12 months.  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC74"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Others, like the one under the Jobseekers Act in Clause 24 or the right to control for disabled people, are to be for 36 months. To add to this complexity, the pilot for the transfer of sanctions on non-resident parents from the courts to administrative action is for two years, as is the initial pilot in the drug provisions in Schedule 3. As a result, I have come to the conclusion that two years is the right length of time for most pilots. I hope the Committee will agree that the Government have to have a very good reason to deviate from 24 months. Amendment 149 is consequential. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000051"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09063098000226"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank the noble Lord for the amendment. The clause modernises the powers to pilot regulations under the Jobseekers Act 1995 and the Welfare Reform Act 2007 in two ways: it aligns the scope of the piloting powers across the two regimes for greater consistency in the way that pilots are conducted for the two benefits; and it extends the duration of pilots to a maximum of 36 months before they need to be renewed so that they are better attuned to the current approach to commissioning and evaluation.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000052"></a>The amendment seeks to restrict the operation of pilots under the Welfare Reform and Jobseekers Acts to a maximum of 24 months.. Before I deal with the amendments, it might be helpful to provide some background to the pilot powers. The first working-age benefit pilot powers were introduced in the Jobseekers Act around 14 years ago. They were an innovative measure which set the framework for testing new approaches and the 12-month renewal limit set at the time was appropriate for the scale of the pilots then being introduced. As pilot design and practice has become increasingly sophisticated we have sought to extend the length of pilots. Hence, we took powers in the Welfare Reform Act 2007 to test the employment support allowance measures for up to 24 months. However, these powers were introduced before we developed the pilots to test conditionality regimes, which will be expected to last longer than 24 months. The existing renewal limits for pilots constrain the commercial strategy and effective evaluation of pilots.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000053"></a>DWP is increasingly making use of contracted provision for the private and voluntary sectors to deliver employment programmes, including pilots. We want to continue to draw on the expertise of these sectors but short-term contracts for employment support programmes are often unattractive commercially and may not be viable if significant investment is required. Longer pilots tend to be better value for money and attract wider commercial interest. Developments in evaluation practice also mean that we now need longer pilots in order to gather robust evidence on which to base future policy. In order to capture a true picture of the effectiveness of a pilot, we need sufficient time for the longer term outcomes of a programme to be determined.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000054"></a>We recognise that it is important to find the right balance between modernising these powers while retaining appropriate levels of accountability. I assure noble Lords that the pilot regulations will still require approval from both Houses when they are first made and if they require renewal. This will continue to provide a full

They will factor into the contractual terms on which they are prepared to undertake the work the prospect that the pilot might not be renewed at the end of, say, 18 months. The facility for them to have the assuredness of a three-year pilot&#151;if that is the judgment as to the length of pilot needed to test the proposition&#151;is a commercial benefit. That is why there is a value-for-money component.</p>

I shall be happy to share it with the noble Lord. He has referred to some of them. We spoke about the pension credit pilot and the three months relating to that. The noble Lord referred to the right to control Trailblazers in a case where we are looking for three years. Some of the others will require only two years. With the personalised employment programme we are looking for three years, with the possibility of extending it beyond that. There is different thinking about the appropriate lengths for a range of issues within the Bill.</p>

He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09063098000180"></a>&#147;We need a power shift from Whitehall ministers and civil servants that currently have the power and move it to citizens ... so we have been developing a strategy that takes public services away from a target culture to giving people rights and entitlement to core public services&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000167"></a>He may not have been talking specifically about the benefits system but my amendment setting out a claimants&#146; charter is surely in line with the Government&#146;s new thinking. The proposal is all about enshrining a claimant&#146;s rights and responsibilities in a charter that would be given to all benefit claimants at the beginning of their engagement with Jobcentre Plus or an external provider so that everyone knows where they stand. It would set out clearly the rights and obligations of Jobcentre Plus and the private providers and voluntary organisations that work under contract with Jobcentre Plus, and would be enforced by an independent ombudsman. It would set out clearly the claimant&#146;s rights and responsibilities.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000063"></a>My honourable friend in another place, Paul Rowen, moved a much more prescriptive amendment along the same lines in Committee in another place but this amendment is different and is very simple. In view of the groundbreaking nature of this Bill, it is surely a sensible provision and one that I hope the Government will not resist. How could they possibly resist? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000064"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0006.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09063098000236"></a>Baroness Turner of Camden:</b> I support this amendment. I thought that it was very admirable when I first saw it. It is clear that we are talking about a very complicated piece of legislation, which refers to the rights and duties of claimants. It is very necessary that those claimants should know what those rights and duties are. If they do not know what their duties are, they may not get their rights. It seems to me necessary to have some sort of charter which establishes where they stand and what they may do if they do not get what they think they are entitled to.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000065"></a>Subsection (3) of the proposed new clause refers to the provision of regulations to enable benefit claimants to make complaints to an ombudsman. That is very sensible as well because the Bill provides for employment services to be contracted out, so very often you will

In such circumstances it seems to me very necessary that there should be some means for claimants to make complaints appropriately and to be able to put them to an ombudsman service when they believe they have not received their rights. Therefore, I hope that my noble friend will feel that there is something to be said for this amendment, and that even if he does not like its wording he will produce something like it before the Bill leaves this House.</p>

It seems to me that it has enormous advantages. First, if it were suitably drafted, and the claimants&#146; charter were sufficiently well drafted, it could help to avoid the dangers that might confront not very clever claimants or claimants with not very good English. Such a charter could provide them with a clear picture of what will happen, what their rights are and who is available to help them. It might also have an important role to play in the image that jobcentres project. I expect that the Committee will remember what we used to think about traffic wardens&#151;little Hitlers. There is a very real danger that jobcentres could gain such an image. That difficulty could be avoided with a suitably designed charter.</p>

Her timing is absolutely impeccable, given the announcement last week or this week. I cannot remember when that was; time goes by so fast. I would not like to see a charter gather dust on the shelves and be hauled out only when somebody asks for it specifically. It should be handed out with every single first claim so that people know about it right from the beginning. I believe that it would also enormously help the people who would administer the charter because they will know where the lines are drawn as well. They will know whether somebody has the right to complain, and not seek to hide that.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000068"></a>I recall a case that occurred some years ago where somebody wanted to complain about the doctors who handled Benefits Agency claims. That was before Atos. That person complained to the GMC and got nowhere because they were told that the doctors were employed by that organisation. When they complained to the organisation, they were, of course, totally ignored, so they had a problem. An ombudsman would be the ideal person to deal with such a situation. Therefore, I support the amendment.</p>

Perhaps I should declare my interest as chair of a mental health trust. It occurs to me that this amendment would be incredibly helpful for our staff&#151;social workers and community psychiatric nurses&#151;who spend an inordinate proportion of their time guiding our patients through the benefits system. If they had access to a charter that set out the rights and responsibilities of their patients and service users, everyone would get a far better service. The precious

There is great merit in this amendment, which reflects the Prime Minister&#146;s wish to have a more transparent situation with our government departments. On those grounds alone, I would hope very much that the Minister would support this amendment. If he has any doubts about it, I hope that we can add it to our long list of issues that we wish to discuss with him when we meet before Report.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000070"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0006.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09063098000240"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, has made her case for a claimants&#146; charter. I was glad that she noted the importance of a claimant&#146;s duties as well as their rights. Charters serve to provide a framework against which providers and clients are able to transact their business and can strengthen the relationship of both. Duties as well as rights are important, as my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale pointed out in the debate on sanctions. It is a sort of two-way street. The concept of welfare needs to change so that the idea of money for nothing is abandoned. My noble friend mentioned this a short time ago when he said that committing a benefit offence needed to be punished with a benefit sanction. It seems to those of us on these Benches that especially, although not exclusively, at times like this when public finances are stretched to the limit&#151;if I can use that understatement&#151;every last million must be spent wisely. That is why we support the progression-to-work principle. It targets welfare spending in a constructive way and helps people into the workplace. We have made clear that the state must also honour its obligations. We proposed, for example, repaying wrongly confiscated benefits in a lump sum to right the wrong. So I am at one with the noble Baroness when we consider welfare schemes as having reciprocal obligations.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000071"></a>I am less certain that the charter is the right way to go about achieving the goal of reciprocity. Is there not a risk that once written down in one document the rights become immutable and inflexible? Would it not be better to tailor advice to individuals in their action plans so that they know what is expected of them, what they will receive and what they must do in return, rather than create a holy text of fixed rights? There must be a dynamic to any relationship between client and provider.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000072"></a>I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in response to all this in the light of announcements made by the Government in the past few days. The <I>B</I><I>uilding Britain&#146;s </I><I>F</I><I>uture</I><I></I>document&#151;some unkind critics have dubbed it the Labour Party&#146;s next manifesto rather than a national government plan&#151;apparently promises among other things, under the eye-catching headline &#147;Take a job or lose your benefit&#148;, the guarantee that young people will find a government-created job and, if they refuse it, will face having their benefit docked. That sounds rather like raising expectations. I hope that the Government are able to fulfil them.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000073"></a>I wonder whether such a charter as envisaged by the noble Baroness would cope with the expectations raised by this Government in the light of an alarming report in the <I>Telegraph</I> this morning. It said that the Local Government Association estimates that in the  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC79"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>first quarter of this year we are on course to have some 935,000 young people classified as NEETs, which is up from 810,000 in the same period last year. With a claimants&#146; charter in place, this Government might find themselves facing a very large number of complaints.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000074"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0006.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09063098000241"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I hope noble Lords will allow me to go into a little detail in response to our debate. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, for tabling this amendment, which proposes a claimants&#146; charter, and all noble Lords who have spoken to it: my noble friend Lady Turner, the noble Lords, Lord Northbourne and Lord Taylor, the noble Countess, Lady Mar, and the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000075"></a>I welcome the spirit of this amendment and the values behind it, which the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, has set out. Noble Lords may not be surprised to hear that I do not believe that the amendment is the best way to achieve the objectives that all noble Lords seek. The effects of the amendment would be twofold. It would require the department to have a claimants&#146; charter that sets out customers&#146; rights and responsibilities under the Bill. It would also establish a new employment services ombudsman to consider disputes between claimants and the department or its delivery partners.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000076"></a>As I have said, we agree with the underlying sentiment of the amendment, which aims to ensure that individuals understand the support that the department will provide them, what is expected of them in return&#151;as my noble friend Lady Turner has said&#151;and their rights of redress, which are very important, if the department does not meet its obligations. Indeed, the previous Secretary of State met the chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee and representatives of a number of groups, including Gingerbread, the Disability Alliance, Citizens Advice and the Child Poverty Action Group, to discuss how we can best meet these objectives. Officials have since met stakeholder groups twice to go into the detail of how we might address their concerns.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000077"></a>The suggestion of a charter is interesting and we have some sympathy for it. Work is already advanced in the development of a DWP customer charter of service standards to cover all DWP customers. This is based on what customers have told us is important to them. It might be a good idea to distribute this work to Members of the Committee so that they can see what kind of charter we have in mind.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000078"></a>The charter reflects four themes that were identified as important drivers of the DWP&#146;s customer experience. The first theme is the right treatment. We want to ensure that it delivers the best possible customer experience by listening carefully, offering good advice and treating our customers with respect. The second theme is the right result. We want to ensure that our customers receive the right benefit on time. We also want to help those who can move into employment to do so, rather than spend a life on benefits. The third theme is being on time. We want to improve processes, using the experience and the ideas of those who deliver and use them. We will give customers a good idea of how long things will take and keep them informed all the way along their journey. The fourth theme is easy access. By making systems more straightforward and helping

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000079"></a>These are aspirational goals on which the department is working as part of its strategic goal to be an exemplar of customer service delivery. Although detailed service standards vary according to operational needs, the charter will provide a common framework to deliver a consistent approach in our customer communications on service standards. Noble Lords might ask why, if we are planning a charter anyway, we do not accept the amendment. First&#151;I appreciate that this is a technical point&#151;the scope of the amendment is limited to the provisions of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000080"></a>As I have said, we plan to introduce a customer charter for all DWP customers. We believe that creating a similar charter for customers affected only by the provisions of the Bill would create unnecessary complexity and prove difficult to administer in practice as it would, in effect, exclude other key customer groups. A further issue is that by legislating for a charter, we may limit our ability to respond to changing circumstances and our ongoing discussion with stakeholder groups. Claimants&#146; needs change; policy moves on; aspects of law become irrelevant; and interest groups come up with new ideas on how to support our customers. We need to be able to respond to those developments quickly, without making changes to legislation. By not being bound by legislation, our approach to developing the DWP customer charter is more flexible and more easily amendable in the light of customer experience.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000081"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0006.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09063098000242"></a>The Countess of Mar:</b> The amendment does not specify word for word what has to go into the charter. Those words can be changed from time to time, as and when necessary. It would just include the foundation of the charter in the Bill, and I would like it to be there.</p>

The problem may be with new subsection (1), which states that regulations,</p>
<ul><a name="09063098000189"></a>&#147;shall make provision for a claimants&#146; charter to set up the rights and duties of claimants under the provisions of this Act&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09063098000168"></a>Clearly, there would be merit in removing the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09063098000190"></a>&#147;under the provisions of this Act&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09063098000169"></a>so that the charter would apply to claimants in general. The important point that I want to hear a response to is whether the noble Baroness has any objection to including the principle in the Bill&#151;a commitment to regulations to set out a charter. That would be very helpful.</p>

One problem with legislating for the charter is, as the Public Bill Office advised the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, that it would have to apply only to the Bill, which would limit what the Minister has suggested that the department is engaged in producing. It would help enormously for us to see the draft of the document. I believe that it is a step forward, and it should have the capacity to change, as the Minister said.</p>

However, noble Lords have put forward some interesting ideas. My noble friend and I will certainly consider them over the summer and come back after our considerations, but I cannot give any guarantees that we would move any further than I have stated today.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90630-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000087"></a>The rights and duties of customers will vary with their individual circumstances, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said. Indeed, it is an objective of the Bill to provide increasingly personalised support for individual customers in recognition of the fact that each of them has unique personal circumstances. While some broad principles will apply across the board, many of the detailed arrangements between the department and its customers will reflect what is appropriate in each person&#146;s particular circumstances.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000088"></a>We have already provided a range of information to customers about their rights and responsibilities and the help which is available to them. For example, the specific requirements of each benefit are set out in leaflets and on claim forms, and every JSA claimant is given a booklet which gives them their signing-on time and sets out the JSA conditionality requirements. We accept that we need to further inform our customers and to empower people more in the whole process. We need to make customers feel that they are far more in charge of the process than many feel they are at present. The amendment and the following debate actively help us to look at that in more detail.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000089"></a>Noble Lords will probably be aware of the discussion on a similar amendment during deliberations in another place. Following these discussions we have had some constructive exchanges with a wide group of stakeholders to see what more can be done to ensure that customers understand what to expect from Jobcentre Plus. We have incorporated a number of suggestions into a Jobcentre Plus leaflet, which brings together information about the service standards customers should expect and what they should do if they are not satisfied. Again, as with the mock-up charter, I shall ensure that Members of the Committee receive the draft leaflet that has emerged from the discussions with stakeholders over recent times. The leaflet is in the final stages of  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC82"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>drafting and stakeholder feedback has been positive. We are now looking at how to distribute the leaflet in a way that best meets the needs of our customers. This work will underpin the development of the charter that I have set out.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000090"></a>The amendment also proposes the establishment of a new role of employment services ombudsman to hear claimants&#146; complaints against providers of employment services in relation to rights and duties under the Bill. Detailed provisions already exist to inform customers of what they are entitled to, and of their right to seek a review of decisions made and to have their case heard by a tribunal. In addition, through the DWP&#146;s contracts, those providing services on behalf of the department are required to provide tailored help to support customers and improve their ability to access sustainable work.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000091"></a>Customers already have the opportunity to raise complaints against providers. They can complain to the provider and if not satisfied with the result may complain to the department. Complaints will be investigated at a district level and escalated to DWP contract managers where appropriate. DWP contract managers are responsible for ensuring that providers meet the obligations within their contracts, including effective service delivery to our full range of customers. This is an effective contract management process and customers&#146; complaints and quality of service delivery is integral to this process.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000092"></a>Customer service and complaints feed into the quality assessment of contract delivery and formal provider performance reviews. In supplementing this process, Jobcentre Plus holds provision engagement meetings with providers. A key feature of these meetings is the customer&#146;s own experience, where complaints and issues will be discussed and improvement actions agreed. Contracted provision is already exposed to extensive independent assessment&#151;for example, the training provision within the new deals is subject to adult learning quality inspections by Ofsted in England. Customer experience and the quality of the service to our customers are integral to this assessment.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000093"></a>We will be reviewing provider guidance to ensure that it is explicit in terms of complaints procedures and escalation routeways. If necessary, customers unhappy with their treatment by providers may have the matter investigated by our independent complaints examiner, and ultimately by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, Ann Abraham, using our normal arrangements. In this way, these customers are treated the same as those dealt with by Jobcentre Plus advisers.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000094"></a>We believe that the creation of an employment services ombudsman as set out in the amendment would duplicate many of the functions already covered by the Parliamentary Ombudsman, to whom DWP customers can already apply, and that could lead only to unnecessary bureaucracy and confusion. Such a fundamental change to the role of the ombudsman would also require a significant amendment to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 to avoid confusion and duplicated provision.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000095"></a>I apologise for the length of my response. This is an important issue that goes to the heart of empowering DWP customers across the range of benefit provision.

<p><a name="09063098000103"></a>I thank all noble Lords who have spoken in this short debate. I became very excited for a time given that four noble Lords were enthusiastically supporting my proposal. I thought that I might have scored a bullseye. However, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, rained on my parade a little and the Minister said that there was already a plan for a charter of standards, as I believe it is called. The Grand Committee would be very interested in looking at that. It sounds as if it could be what we are talking about. I suppose that it would be given to all claimants from the beginning of their claim.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000104"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09063098000255"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> That is not clear.

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000106"></a>There is obviously great support around the Grand Committee for the whole idea of a document which gives clear rights and responsibilities. I take the noble Baroness&#146;s point that we want it to apply more widely than just to the Bill, but welfare reform Bills, like No. 159 buses, come along quite often; perhaps soon we will have a third Bill in which a charter could be included. In the mean time, I shall read what the noble Baroness said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000108"></a>Three of the biggest themes of this Grand Committee have been: first, the flexibility needed for the treatment of lone parents with very young children; secondly, real concern about the treatment of those with severe but fluctuating mental health problems; and, thirdly, the importance of Jobcentre Plus staff and contracted staff being adequately trained to meet the needs of an even wider pool of claimants than ever.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000109"></a>How Jobcentre Plus and contracted staff deal with claimants will be crucial as to whether the reforms in this Bill will work in the way that they should. Discussions in the past few weeks in Grand Committee have demonstrated that there is, I regret to say, very little confidence that there is adequate training in place for staff having to meet the needs of the greater number of claimants with complex mental health needs in particular. We had a long debate on, I think, day three of Grand Committee about whether the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; scheme should not be rolled out unless  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC85"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Secretary of State was satisfied that jobcentres around the country were ready enough to manage it. But that amendment concerned only Clause 1.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000110"></a>I think the Minister indicated that he would deal in more detail with training staff on mental health and other issues when we reached later amendments, and I hope that he was thinking of this amendment. I expect he will say that claimants on the employment side of the ESA will already have had a work-related health assessment and that the JCP personal adviser or disability employment adviser will have that assessment on a claimant&#146;s file, whereby the staff can see if there is, for example, a severe but fluctuating mental health condition that would show that a claimant may need sensitive handling. This is not always happening.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000111"></a>The fear of many people who work in the mental health field is that vulnerable claimants who in the past would have been on incapacity benefit will, if they are new claimants, now be on the employment rather than the support side of the ESA and that JCP staff and private-sector staff may not have been sufficiently trained to deal with all the various mental health conditions that they are likely to come across. One MIND survey respondent said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09063098000182"></a>&#147;Advisers, employers and work colleagues still lack understanding of mental health issues&#151;stigma is alive and kicking. Just because my disability is not visible it&#146;s just assumed I was workshy&#148;.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000112"></a>There is, of course, also a strong likelihood that some long-term claimants of the JSA will fall into depression that could be mild or severe, and therefore it is not just ESA claimants with existing mental-health conditions that employment advisers should be aware of, but potentially all longer-term claimants. Will all employment staff, either in JCP or in outsourced companies, be sufficiently aware of the symptoms of undiagnosed clinical depression or of another condition common among ex-military personnel&#151;post-traumatic stress disorder? I received one case study about a woman with this condition and with mobility problems. She was told that she must attend at very short notice a two-day course 30 miles from her home called Activate. The outsourced provider had not received any medical information from JCP because of &#147;system problems&#148;. It was not until she had an advocate from her local advocacy service that her case was finally postponed until the provider had her medical assessment.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000113"></a>It is not just Members of the Grand Committee who have expressed concern about the training of JCP and contracted-out staff. The importance of sufficiently trained staff was highlighted by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its 14th report when it stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09063098000183"></a>&#147;The Bill expressly provides that any direction must be reasonable &#145;having regard to the person's circumstances&#146;. It is unclear whether advisers will have the tools necessary to assess an individual's circumstances effectively enough to know when a particular activity is appropriate or not. If work-related requirements place an onerous burden on individuals who are not able to meet them as a result of their mental or physical disabilities, or which may exacerbate their health difficulties, they may lead to an increased risk of a breach of that individual's right to respect for their private life and peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, without discrimination&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC86"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="09063098000184"></a>The DWP&#146;s own research suggests that even within &#147;Pathways&#148; regimes, personal advisers admit lacking knowledge and understanding of mental health issues. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09063098000185"></a>&#147;Mental health issues (including depression, suicide and self harm) ... were particular areas (Incapacity benefit personal advisers (IBPAs)) reported having difficulties with. IBPAs did not feel their initial training had prepared them for working with these kinds of customers&#148;.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000114"></a>Further evidence this year suggests that advisers should improve their knowledge of claimants&#146; mental health conditions. For example, the sedating effects of medication should be considered, which might make an early-morning start almost impossible for certain claimants. That could in turn lead to a sanction for non-attendance on a community work programme.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000115"></a>Another reported problem has been inappropriate referrals to join condition management programmes for the wrong condition. DWP research into the incapacity benefit personal adviser role highlighted the key skills needed for the job, which include communication skills, having a non-judgmental attitude, and having patience and empathy, which is all very good. Pathways-to-work personal advisers are provided with three months' training before beginning to work with claimants in the pilot phase of the particular programme, but many still recognised that they needed more training in what was called more challenging health conditions, including mental health problems.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000116"></a>Evidence from Citizens Advice also highlights a problem. It states that one year on from the introduction of JCP&#146;s Accessing Jobcentre Customer Services&#151;ACJS&#151; project, bureaux continue to report that vulnerable clients are not always directed to support that meets their needs. Telephone claims are encouraged, but claimants who need more help ought to be picked up when they make contact with a JCP office. Everyone recognises the extra pressure that JCP offices are under with the rapid rise in unemployment, but Citizens Advice evidence suggests that local staff are often unable to identify claimants who need extra support and for whom going into the office is the best way that they can be assisted.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000117"></a>The last thing anyone wants is for vulnerable claimants to be sanctioned inappropriately, as many of us have said already during Grand Committee. Not only would that be bad for claimants, it could be very costly in terms of how the pieces are picked up. Nor are we asking for those with mental health conditions to be parked in the non-sanctionable support group of ESA so that they will not get any help in preparing for or getting work. We are simply asking for competencies for employment advisers, whether in Jobcentre Plus or in outsourced companies, to be set by the Secretary of State to ensure that all such staff are able to work appropriately with claimants with the full range of mental health problems and other disabilities.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, would have wished to contribute to this debate, but she is heavily involved in the Chamber on the Coroners and Justice Bill. I know that she would wish noble Lords to be aware of her commitment to this amendment. Likewise, I am very committed to this amendment.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000120"></a>It is absolutely essential that levels of competency should be clearly specified for these crucial staff. When you look at the proposed new subsections under this amendment, the enormity of the job that these people are being expected to perform becomes clear. These front-line staff would need to have a detailed understanding of how to deal with people with a multitude of different mental health fluctuating disorders and other disorders, a detailed understanding of how to deal with people dependent on drugs and a detailed understanding of the childcare needs of a variety of different children, including those with and without disabilities and all the rest of it. From my small perspective, I am very conscious that personal advisers on the front line of jobcentres do not have the understanding that they need to deal effectively with people with mental health problems. They simply do not have those skills and they tell us that they do not.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000121"></a>It is profoundly important that there is clarity about the levels of competency that these people need in all these different areas. I would put a plea to the Minister that these levels of competency should be set out. If an office cannot show that the staff have those levels of competency for the various client groups, the conditionality clauses should not come into effect. If you sanction claimants&#151;or customers, as Ministers like to call them&#151;when staff are swimming around and do not understand what they are doing, the likelihood of gross injustice is very high. Again, I strongly support this amendment and I hope that the Minister does so too.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000122"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0007.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09063098000260"></a>Lord Northbourne:</b> I, too, support this amendment, which perhaps is one of the most important. Jobcentres would need to be successful in convincing their clients that they are both friends and advisers, but at the same time would have the power of conditionality to discipline them. Only if the advisers can achieve that degree of rapport with the people they are dealing with will they be successful and the reputation of the jobcentres will be the sort that we want them to have.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000123"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, spoke about people with disabilities. The amendment refers also to people on drug dependency and victims of domestic violence. But your Lordships will probably not be surprised if I say that the proposed new subsections in the amendment that interest me particularly are those that refer to &#147;claimants with caring responsibilities&#148; and &#147;parents with dependent children&#148;. In any forthcoming version of this amendment, I should like to persuade the noble Baroness to exclude the words &#147;lone parents&#148; because very often parents are not &#147;lone&#148;. There are parents who for a variety of reasons have very real problems.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000124"></a>I have previously said on one of my amendments how important and difficult it will be for these advisers to understand the family dynamics of the many people with whom they have to deal. Would it not be the right

<p><a name="09063098000125"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0007.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09063098000261"></a>Baroness Campbell of Surbiton:</b> I support the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas. For four years, I had the privilege of being the chair of the Social Care Institute for Excellence and, while reading the amendment and listening to the noble Baroness, I thought, &#147;These are the kinds of duties that we spend three years training social workers in: understanding and being empathetic to, but also having phenomenal knowledge of, the complexities that a whole range of disabilities bring, let alone all the social problems that attend those situations&#148;.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000126"></a>I take my hat off to any Jobcentre Plus worker who enters into this knowing that they might have to lay conditions on someone when they cannot quite understand where they are coming from or what they are doing because they do not have a degree in social work. I therefore absolutely support the noble Baroness on this one. Actually, I had already thought about it. After hearing noble Lords&#146; interventions, it struck me that I felt I was back at the Social Care Institute for Excellence, where we provided detailed guidance and practice to the very people whom we are talking about in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000127"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0007.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09063098000262"></a>The Countess of Mar:</b> I, too, having already moved amendments on training, support the noble Baronesses&#146; amendment. I have a horrible suspicion that the Minister will say, &#147;We do not like shopping lists&#148;, but I make a plea. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, was very persuasive about people with severe but fluctuating mental health problems. People with some illnesses, such as ME, fibromyalgia and the noble Baroness&#146;s own illness, start off looking well, as do people who are mentally ill, and they might be tracked into the wrong ESA; they might be tracked into the work-related ESA when they should be in the support ESA system. JCPs need to be able to differentiate between the two. I know that they are not medically trained.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000128"></a>I also recognise that a lot of these conditions are still disputed by the medical profession. Some people will give a diagnosis of ME, for example, and others will not; they will say that it is a mental illness. However, I repeat, again, that the World Health Organisation and the Department of Health say that ME is a physical, not a mental, condition.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000129"></a>I very much support the noble Baronesses&#146; amendment.</p>

That said, she has chosen to focus on Clause 25, which is about contracting out. One therefore assumes that a lawyer would understand the amendment to refer to contractors who are doing things such as carrying out work-focused interviews, preparing action plans or talking about specified activities for particular people, to mention just a few of the activities that, in Clause 25(2), can be contracted out under new Section 20E of the

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000132"></a>I now turn my attention to members of Jobcentre Plus, to which many of your Lordships have referred. Throughout our debates, the issue of training has surfaced time and time again. I am aware that the solution I have offered to many of the various suggestions is that we do not need more regulations or blanket legislation; instead we should focus on the individual action plans, on developing back-to-work interviews as a meaningful process and generally tailoring the job-seeking schemes to the individual who is using them. I stand by that as sound advice but I agree that delivering all these individualised plans will require that the staff helping to implement them know what they are doing and are able to do it well.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000133"></a>I hope that I have made it clear&#151;if it has not become clear by now I shall reiterate it for the record&#151;that I believe that jobcentre staff do a very good job and rise magnificently to the new challenges that are foisted upon them. I accept it is inevitable that there will be a few weak links in any chain but, on the whole, they do a very good job indeed. If that is to continue they will have to be equipped to meet new expectations, which is perhaps the purpose of the amendment. The Bill will place a great onus on staff who may not have a particular expertise in dealing with a particular type of person. This may be in the jobcentre, and remain in the jobcentre, but it is much more likely to be a stepping stone to the contractor and the contractor&#146;s personnel, and even to the subcontractor&#146;s personnel.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000134"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment makes some suggestions about the areas that need special attention, including claimants with disabilities, those with caring responsibilities, those with drug dependency and those suffering from domestic violence. Having foisted the responsibility of helping such claimants onto the staff of either the jobcentre or the contractors, the Government cannot let them swing in the wind. It is unrealistic to expect all staff to become experts; they cannot all become doctors, social workers, drug counsellors and much else besides, a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher. Standards of training which enable staff to do their job must be provided. The noble Baroness is right to zero in on the issue of training for jobcentre personnel. Noble Lords will examine the Government&#146;s proposals when we hear them from the Minister so that we can be satisfied that those proposals are sufficient.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000135"></a>Over the three weeks that we have been discussing the Bill so far, I have claimed that only three days&#146; extra training in this will be given to Jobcentre Plus staff. I have longed to be contradicted by the Minister. Perhaps he can do just that on this occasion.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, said that she hoped this would be the amendment on which we would discuss the details of the training of Jobcentre Plus staff. With respect, we have probably done that on more than one occasion along the way. However, I am happy to reiterate and go over some of it again.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000137"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said, the clause is focused on contracting-out functions. Of course there is a relationship between Jobcentre Plus and the contracting-out provider&#151;there is an interface&#151;but I recognise, as I hope I have done throughout our discussions on the Bill, the concerns that noble Lords have expressed. Whether they are to do with fluctuating conditions, mental health conditions, disabilities more generally or the need for sensitivity towards people with caring responsibilities, all have been reiterated in our debate so far today. I stress that we need to make sure that Jobcentre Plus is equipped to deal with the range of challenges that it has.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000138"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, described perfectly the breadth and challenge of the issues that present to our staff and to providers. It is never going to be a job that is completed. There will be a continual need to train and engage.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000139"></a>The amendment would require the Secretary of State, when contracting out functions under the Jobseekers Act, to specify in the contract the level of competency required by the contactors to enable them to address the specific needs of, and barriers faced by, each group identified in the amendment.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000140"></a>I understand the concerns that this amendment may be trying to address, as I have just expressed. However, I do not believe that it would be practical for contracts to include details about the specific level of competency required for them to meet the individual needs of each of the vulnerable groups that this amendment covers. Within the procurement process we will ensure that we contract only with providers who are skilled in delivering the support that each group to be assisted under the contract will need.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000141"></a>For instance, in the provider-led pathways invitation to tender, we asked bidders to describe the relevant skills held by the organisation or the experience of their employees, or their sub-contractors, to enable them to deliver the provision effectively and address the specific needs and barriers of their customers. We also asked for specific information on the roles, qualifications and experience required for each post needed to deliver the provision.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000142"></a>In addition, the procurement process will have requirements within the terms and conditions of contracts for contractors to ensure that their employees are suitable in all respects to deliver the programme. I can assure the Committee that the vulnerable groups mentioned will be given adequate protection so that the contractors&#146; employees will possess the relevant skills, training and experience they need to enable them to deliver the provision effectively and address the specific needs of their customers and the barriers they face in finding work. When we use the powers given in Clause 25 to contract out functions, we will take steps to ensure that contractors&#146; employees are properly trained to deliver the programme. However,  


<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC91"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column GC91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I do not believe that the specific proposals included in the amendment would be the right way to go. We need to recognise that providers will have to provide individualised support to their customers and demonstrate across the board that they have the capacity to draw in or have the expertise to deal with that.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000143"></a>On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, on three days&#146; training, that is not the only training that people will get. We will conduct a full training needs assessment before piloting the measures in the Bill. It is inconceivable that that would conclude that three days&#146; training was sufficient.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000144"></a>I shall pick up on one or two points raised. A lot of the discussion concerned the training that Jobcentre Plus staff have, rather than the training which providers have, which is what Clause 25 is about. I reiterate what should already be on the record. As for personal advisers, with reference to ESA, Jobcentre Plus pathways-to-work personal advisers undergo training on a range of mild to moderate health conditions. This includes extensive interview skills training and the skills to help customers to identify their work-related capabilities. As part of this training, advisers are signposted to sources of information and advice to help specific groups of customers. In Jobcentre Plus areas, the pathways personal advisers also have access to disability employment advisers and work psychology personnel. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, asked about the availability of particular expertise. These personnel have in-depth expertise on specific conditions. Customers with complex conditions can be referred to the DEA or work psychologist for additional advice and support where this is appropriate.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000145"></a>On lone parents, there are issues around those with caring responsibilities. As regards the training programme for lone-parent advisers, there is an adviser skills workshop, a two-day facilitated event to introduce learners to quality assurance framework 1 and enhanced skills; a further workshop, a two-day facilitated event, to provide learners with effective job placement abilities; a further workshop, a two-day facilitated event, to provide support to a customer in finding work; and a further workshop, a two-day event, to provide learners with the skills to work effectively with customers whose personal circumstances inhibit job search. There is a further workshop&#151;a two-day event&#151;to provide learners with the skills to work with customers who have health conditions and/or disabilities. That is just a snapshot of some of the training that takes place currently.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000146"></a>It is not only an issue of the training available, but about monitoring the performance of Jobcentre Plus advisers. Advisers are closely monitored through an internal adviser achievement tool to indicate the volume of interviews each adviser has conducted. When used in conjunction with our quality assurance framework it allows advisory service managers to monitor quality and quantity of interviews at the end of each monthly reporting period.</p>

They undergo extensive and specialist training on top of that undertaken by generic advisers. This includes 52 hours of training on effective communication and support to disabled customers with more complex support needs. I could also go on about the training for personal advisers on learning disabilities. A range of training is undertaken.</p>

<p><a name="09063098000149"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0008.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09063098000267"></a>The Countess of Mar:</b> When these workshops are being run, are there people from the individual categories who give their experience of their relationship with jobcentre staff? Explaining their difficulties would assist such staff. It is all very well to have a tutor at the front of the room who says this, this and this, but to have an individual who has undergone some of the processes would be enormously helpful. That has been recognised in a much wider field outside. Will the Minister take that on board?</p>

<p><a name="09063098000150"></a><b><a name="90630-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09063098000268"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> The noble Countess, Lady Mar, makes a very important point. The whole concept of service users being engaged in evaluating and helping to deliver a service is very important. We have had extensive discussions, as the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, will know, about how the benefits system impacts on service users, when they get paid and how expenses et cetera come into play, which could be an inhibitor for service users to engage. We are beginning to address that. There is a little way to go, but we are on the path to a satisfactory outcome. That is particularly important in the health service, but there is no reason why it should not similarly operate for Jobcentre Plus and DWP more generally.</p>

<a name="90630-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09063098000151"></a>In conclusion, I am conscious that that response will be a disappointment because we have not accepted the amendment as it is set down. But we have common cause in making sure that Jobcentre Plus personnel are trained to do the job that is required of them if we are to make a success of these proposals. That similarly runs to our providers. The key is not to be overly prescriptive in what we set down in legislation. Ultimately, it is a matter of how those contracts are constructed and how they are monitored. We will make sure that there is performance under those contracts to achieve what we want.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09063045000003"></a><b><a name="90630-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09063045000076"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Davies of Oldham):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09063045000004"></a>I wish to update the House on recent developments related to dairy farmers of Britain.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09063045000005"></a>I informed the House in my Written Statement of 9 June (col. 31WS) that on 3 June PricewaterhouseCoopers had been appointed as receivers and managers of Dairy Farmers of Britain Limited (DFoB). In the debate on food, farming and the environment on 18 June (col. 480), I reported that new buyers had been found for 96 per cent of the milk, leaving fewer than 200 of the 1,800 farmers affected yet to find an alternative milk buyer. A further 47 farmers secured new buyers before the end of last week.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09063045000006"></a>Throughout this time Defra officials and the regional development agencies have worked closely with the receiver, the DFoB members&#146; council and with many other parties, whether those affected or those offering support. All parties have worked to find new buyers for all the remaining farmers as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09063045000007"></a>On 26 June the receiver and Milk Link announced that all 143 farmers who were on short-term rolling contracts with the receiver at that time were being offered a contract with Milk Link. This would be for a three-month rolling contract paying a standard litre price of 18.45 pence per litre. Some farmers started to sign up to these contracts over the weekend.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09063045000008"></a>I welcome this initiative by Milk Link which, by making use of economies of scale and Milk Link&#146;s existing infrastructure, has enabled them to offer these farmers significantly more than the 10p/l being offered by the receiver, although whether that price is commercially viable for individual farmers is a matter for them to determine. Defra will continue to work with other parties to ensure affected farmers know how to access advice, including advice funded by the rural development agencies through the Rural Development Programme England (RDPE) where appropriate.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09063045000009"></a>I would like again to pay tribute to the hard work of the many individuals and organisations who have contributed to ensuring that no milk has been thrown away since the collapse of DFoB and that all farmer members of DFoB have now been offered a contract with a new milk buyer.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09063045000010"></a>I will update the House as necessary.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="09063045000017"></a><b><a name="90630-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="09063045000079"></a>The Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> Together with my noble friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department for Work and Pensions with responsibility for health and safety, we are today launching a consultation on our proposed restructuring of the Health and Safety Executive&#146;s Nuclear Directorate.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09063045000018"></a>The proposed restructuring is designed to reinvigorate the organisational arrangements of nuclear regulation to take account of current and future challenges in the nuclear environment. The restructuring will consolidate regulatory functions currently carried out by separate parts of government into a new, sector-specific statutory body that will have greater autonomy than at present but remain within the auspices of HSE. The Government propose to effect the restructuring through a legislative reform order.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09063045000019"></a>The regulator would be named in legislation as responsible for its regulatory functions, which at the moment lie with the Secretary of State, and the new body will be governed by an independent board comprising of predominantly non-executive members.

The Government believe that these measures will enhance the transparency and accountability of nuclear regulation overall.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09063045000020"></a>These proposals for reform seek to build on the existing regulatory strengths, whilst creating a modern organisation that is empowered to meet the challenges of the changing nuclear environment; creating a regulator that is widely acclaimed for its excellence in this new environment and can maintain its world-class reputation into the future.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09063045000021"></a>The consultation will close on 22 September 2009 and will be followed by a government response.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="09063045000022"></a><b><a name="90630-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="09063045000080"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government &amp; Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning (John Healey) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09063045000023"></a>I intend to publish a consultation document before the Summer Recess on reform of council housing finance. My intention is to dismantle the housing revenue account subsidy system and replace it with a devolved system of responsibility and funding. However I can confirm to the House today the principles on which this will be based.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09063045000024"></a>I want to provide more flexibility in finances and more transparency in the operation of the system. I want to devolve control from central to local government. And, in return, I want to increase local responsibility and accountability for long-term planning, asset management, and for meeting the housing needs of local people. The current system makes this difficult to achieve.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09063045000025"></a>On 12 December 2007 my predecessor as Housing Minister announced to the House a review of council housing finance to be led jointly by my department and the Treasury. Its purpose was to identify options for a sustainable, long-term system for financing council housing that would be fair to both tenants and taxpayers.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09063045000026"></a>The review has been conducted with a wide range of interested and expert organisations through meetings and workshops, calls for evidence, focus groups and questionnaires. Research and analysis were commissioned internally and from external experts.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09063045000027"></a>There is a clear rationale for the current redistributive housing revenue account subsidy system. Councils have different spending needs and different capacities to raise income. Without redistribution, some councils would have to charge higher rents or deliver lower quality services. By redistributing money, all councils should be able to deliver a similar level of service while charging a similar level of rent.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09063045000028"></a>However, there are significant drawbacks in a national system for financing council housing and in the relationship it creates between central and local government.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS12"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column WS12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09063045000029"></a>Our consultation following this review will propose a devolved self-financing alternative to the current system. This would remove the need to redistribute revenue nationally, whilst continuing to ensure that all councils had sufficient resources. With these reforms, councils would finance their own businesses from their own rents, in exchange for a one-off redistribution of housing debt. By freeing councils from the annual funding decisions in the current system, this will enable councils to plan long term and to improve the management of their homes, secure greater efficiencies and improve the quality of service to their tenants.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09063045000030"></a>This would provide councils with a financial framework in which they could plan and manage for the long term in the same way we expect of other social housing providers. It would give councils a greater capacity and more freedom to respond to local needs and, in doing so, increase their responsibility and accountability to local tenants and residents.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09063045000031"></a>Change on this scale is complex and will require primary legislation. The consultation will set out how moving to a self-financing system will require an adjustment of debt levels for most authorities. At present around &#163;17 billion of housing debt with annual servicing costs of around &#163;1.1 billion is spread across the 202 councils in the system. The self-financing model would enable each council to manage directly and fund their own debt.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09063045000032"></a>In addition to revenue redistribution, councils are currently required to pay government different proportions of the receipts from right to buy sales and sales of other HRA assets. There is a strong case for allowing councils to retain all of their capital receipts which could give councils the ability to develop a comprehensive strategy to maintain, improve and develop their housing. The consultation document will therefore set out proposals to end the pooling of all housing capital receipts.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09063045000033"></a>I want to see councils building and commissioning more of the new homes that people need in their area. We are therefore taking immediate steps to support this role for local authorities, based on the same principles I am setting out for our long-term reforms.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09063045000034"></a>For the first time, councils can now access the same capital subsidy through the social housing grant that is provided to housing associations for new affordable homes. Decisions on the first council schemes to be funded in this way will be confirmed in September.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09063045000035"></a>At the Budget, we announced &#163;100 million to fund some 900 new council homes. Yesterday, in his housing pledge, the Prime Minister announced a further &#163;1.5 billion to build an extra 20,000 affordable and energy efficient homes, increasing the scale of the programme for the next two years to a &#163;2.1 billion investment for 110,000 new affordable homes. This includes a fourfold increase in our plans for new council homes. Together, these changes will enable councils to become once again significant providers of new housing, with further flexibility to do more, where councils can act rapidly and offer good value for money.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09063045000036"></a>We want to maximise our efforts behind building of new affordable homes. So I can also confirm that we are closing the open market HomeBuy scheme to new

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09063045000037"></a>Tenants and council tax payers expect to see their services delivered with the very best value for money. I want to ensure that our reforms to the council housing finance system have strong incentives for improving efficiency, which will benefit councils and their tenants.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09063045000038"></a>We remain committed to completing our comprehensive decent homes programme and to maintaining this standard. The reforms I propose will safeguard this commitment. Capital funding will be provided to support this. We also intend to complete improvements required to common areas of estates and will ensure that there is sufficient funding in the system to maintain them in the future.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09063045000039"></a>Our aim in setting up the self-financing system is to ensure that it delivers the investment needed to sustain and maintain the existing stock of council homes.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09063045000040"></a>In the future within this self-financing system, local authorities may also wish to borrow to fund investment. Government are currently considering whether and how any local flexibilities for new investment could be reconciled with the need to ensure that the overall fiscal position for government is not undermined.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="09063045000041"></a>The benefits delivered by arms-length management organisations that manage council housing services should not be affected by a change in the system for financing council housing. We see a strong future role for ALMOs which are valued by their tenants. We would expect ALMOs to continue to develop their housing management capacity and to look for opportunities to extend the range of services they offer, including to other landlords, where this would improve efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="09063045000042"></a>Transferring to a housing association should also remain an option that council tenants can choose. There are potential benefits from bringing in a not-for-profit body with access to private finance to own and manage the homes. However, there should be equity in the terms of public funding whether they are transferred or retained in the future under self-financing. The value placed on the stock in a self-financing agreement and a transfer deal will be based on delivering the same standards of service at a comparable cost.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="09063045000043"></a>We will continue to work with councils whose tenants have voted for transfer and councils who are currently developing transfer proposals to bring these to completion. Future transfer proposals will not gain any financial support beyond what would be provided under self-financing.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09063045000044"></a>A number of councils have been developing proposals to establish local housing companies (LHCs) that combine public land and private finance to deliver new mixed tenure housing. Current market conditions create difficulties in taking the next steps, and the consultation document will confirm how we will assist the establishment of viable LHCs as quickly as possible. In future, self-financing will provide another option for councils who want to put their land and income into schemes to deliver new housing.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="09063045000045"></a>Responses to the review showed strong support for a more devolved approach to financing council housing.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS14"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column WS14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="09063045000046"></a>A fully self-financing, locally devolved system cannot be implemented in a single step but I want to move as rapidly as possible to put these reforms in place and the consultation document will set out my proposed timetable.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="09063045000047"></a>However, there are steps we can take without delay. So I am announcing that from today we will exclude all new-build council housing from the HRA subsidy system which means that councils will retain in full the rent and capital receipts from these homes.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="09063045000048"></a>I will work with all those with an interest in improving the system to make sure that these plans for reform are robust and deliverable.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="09063045000049"></a><b><a name="90630-wms0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="09063045000081"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="09063045000050"></a>I am pleased to announce today the next steps in the implementation of the National Identity Service. This started with the introduction of identity cards for foreign nationals in November 2008 and will continue later this year with the introduction of the first identity cards for British citizens including the rollout of voluntary identity cards at a fee of &#163;30 to people living in the Greater Manchester area.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="09063045000051"></a>There will be significant benefits to individuals from holding an identity card, which will become the most convenient, secure and affordable way of asserting identity in everyday life. Identity cards will also be valid for travel throughout Europe in place of a British passport.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="09063045000052"></a>I have reviewed the plans for introducing identity cards to the wider public and have decided to accelerate the rollout of cards by extending the initial coverage from Greater Manchester to other locations in the North West early next year. Anyone resident first in Greater Manchester and then in the wider areas to be specified will be entitled to apply for an identity card. Initially this will be through Identity and Passport Service offices based in central Manchester and at Manchester airport.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="09063045000053"></a>Precise arrangements for the extension of the roll out are being developed, but will include the extension of identity card enrolment to other Identity and Passport Service offices in North West England. There will be a particular focus on issuing identity cards at a fee of &#163;30 to those who will most benefit, particularly young people.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="09063045000054"></a>The Government are committed to providing real help now to people in these difficult economic times. Those over 75 are particularly affected and as a consequence the Government will also be looking at options which could allow pensioners aged 75 and over to receive an identity card free of charge. These identity cards will assist in asserting identity and will enable travel throughout Europe.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS15"></a><b>30 Jun 2009 : Column WS15</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="09063045000055"></a>The Government already have arrangements in hand for the production of identity cards. Later this year, and subject to the normal procurement processes, a further contract will be signed to cover production of cards for the medium term. We are currently engaged in negotiations to ensure the best value for money. We now have a much clearer view of our costs in the future as we have entered into 10-year contracts to upgrade the Identity and Passport Service's application and enrolment system and build and run the database that will support passports and identity cards.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="09063045000056"></a>At the same time, we will continue to look at ways of reducing costs across both passport and identity card work. A further cost report on the estimated costs of the identity cards scheme over the next 10 years will be made to Parliament in the autumn. However, the expectation is that the costs specifically relating to identity cards will be less than the 30 per cent of the total costs of the National Identity Scheme previously estimated.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="09063045000057"></a>However, holding an identity card should be a personal choice for British citizens&#151;just as it is now to obtain a passport. Accordingly, I want the introduction of identity cards for all British citizens to be voluntary and I have therefore decided that identity cards issued to airside workers, planned initially at Manchester and London City airports later this year, should also be voluntary. I continue to believe that identity cards will help deliver enhanced security in the airside pass-issuing process at airports by making it easier and more certain to verify an individual&#146;s identity. In consultation with the airport operators, we will be encouraging anyone applying for an airside pass to obtain an identity card. There will be significant benefits from a large proportion of airside pass holders having their identity verified and being issued with identity cards. We have listened to what the unions, airlines and others in the aviation sector have had to say about our plans and as a result we will now seek to achieve these results by inviting applications to be made on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="09063045000058"></a>The Government will, therefore, be withdrawing the Identity Cards Act 2006 (Designation) Order 2009 which was laid before Parliament on 6 May 2009. This would have made it a requirement for anyone applying for a criminal conviction certificate, as part of the process for obtaining an airside pass to access the restricted area at a specified airport, also to obtain an identity card.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="09063045000059"></a>The Government believe that effective identity assurance is the foundation stone of a good personnel security regime in airports and elsewhere and that is why we will be offering identity cards to those working airside in our airports from later this year.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="09063045000060"></a>In December 2007, Stephen Boys Smith was commissioned by the Transport Secretary to conduct an independent external review of personnel security arrangements in the UK transport industry. His key conclusion was that effective personnel security starts with identity and that identity cards would play a useful addition to identity assurance at airports and elsewhere in the transport industry. We continue to believe that this is correct and that identity cards will provide and help with enhanced security but we believe

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="09063045000061"></a>We believe the evaluation of identity cards for airside workers will demonstrate the benefits that identity cards can bring to the pre-employment and airside pass issuing processes at Manchester and London airports and that these benefits will encourage airside workers to apply for an identity card. We will continue to work with the aviation industry to agree the ongoing rollout of personal identity cards to airside workers, so these process improvements can also benefit others.</p>

<a name="90630-wms0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="09063045000062"></a>For foreign nationals (from outside the European Economic Area), compulsory identity cards will play an increasingly important part in the delivery of an effective immigration policy and for proving identity and entitlement to work. Therefore I have asked the UK Border Agency to look at how it can speed up the rollout of identity cards for foreign nationals including to foreign national airside workers.</p>

<a name="09063063000003"></a><b><a name="90630w0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09063063000167"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Davies of Oldham):</b> Defra has no plans to impose an import ban on cattle and livestock from areas in Europe affected by bluetongue. Provided that EU movement rules for bluetongue susceptible species are being complied with, the risk posed by bluetongue in other member states is very low, and does not justify such a ban. Also, BTV-8 is being effectively managed through vaccination in most EU member states.</p>

<a name="90630w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="09063063000004"></a>Movements of bluetongue susceptible species are governed by EC Regulation 1266/2007, which was developed with the best available scientific advice, balancing risks proportionately against impact on trade. Where new evidence has become available, rules have been adjusted. We will continue to consider emerging evidence and any implications for movement conditions.</p>

<a name="90630w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="09063063000005"></a>As of 3 November 2008, all of Great Britain became a single confluent restricted zone for Bluetongue serotype 8 (BTV-8). We are therefore effectively in the same BTV-8 restricted zone as neighbouring EU member states. Animals can be moved freely within this restricted zone, and to and from other BTV-8 restricted zones in Europe provided that they meet the generic import/export requirements and are accompanied by an export health certificate which has been signed by an official veterinarian. In the case of BTV-1, we are not part of this restricted zone which currently includes France and Spain. In this case movement controls into the UK are much stricter.</p>

<a name="90630w0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="09063063000006"></a>We have implemented a robust post-import testing regime for all imported livestock, and where livestock test positive for Bluetongue, appropriate risk management action will be taken, depending on the serotype detected. Since December 2008 no imported livestock have tested positive for bluetongue. We urge industry to consider the risks and check the health and vaccination status of livestock when sourcing susceptible animals from abroad.</p>

In the past two years our efforts have helped to secure unprecedented Security Council action on Burma, in the form of two strongly worded presidential statements. It is, however, highly unlikely that the council would agree to pass a binding resolution on this issue. Our efforts to secure a non-binding resolution on Burma in 2007 were blocked by other members.

We have instigated a system whereby fishers are granted additional fishing days where they adhere to closures to avoid spawning or young cod, and are willing to change gear that catches fewer young fish, or create fishing plans that commit to significantly reducing cod discards.</p>
