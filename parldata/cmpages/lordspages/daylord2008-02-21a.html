Before making this technology more widely available as an indefinite long-term treatment in end-stage heart failure, we need to be patient and ensure that there is clear evidence of benefit.

Perhaps he will confirm that. I ask a slightly wider question. Given the innovation that is taking place in this area with, for example, Professor Westaby at Oxford, who has managed to keep a man alive for seven-and-a-half years successfully with an implanted heart pump, and the problems with organ donation, including the issues of presumed consent, does he not think that the Government should be taking a more active role in promoting the development of alternatives to organ transplant?</p>

The Government are committed to innovation through the next stage review and the announcement in my interim report in October of last year of the creation of the Health Innovation Council. I see the NHS over the next 10 years being at the cutting edge of innovation. The development of technologies such as medical devices that will enhance the quality of life will be at the forefront of the efforts of the Health Innovation Council.</p>

As the noble Lord alluded to, innovation in this type of technology is moving fast and we are seeing second generation and even third generation devices. The last paragraph of an article by Professor Philip Poole-Wilson in <I>Nature</I> this week states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="080221100000265"></a>&#147;There is currently an overwhelming need for formal trials evaluating mechanical assist device therapy in patients with various diagnoses, in order to determine safety and efficacy, to better inform patients of their clinical options, and to direct expensive medical care in an appropriate direction&#148;.</p>

We all want to see more and I welcome the suggestion that there will be legislation on opt-out. But is the Minister aware that I have received letters from people stating that they would happily give most of their organs but that they do not wish a blanket provision for everything? For example, they might especially wish not to donate organs for use in embryology experimentation. Will he ensure that when the Government bring forward that legislation it includes an opt-out for only one organ? Without that, we may lose people who would otherwise give all their other organs, which would be very beneficial.</p>

In the context of the Question, we are talking about mechanical medical devices rather than tissue regeneration. However, R&amp;D funding is on a significant rise. Recent announcements by the National Institute for Health Research and the creation of a number of biomedical research centres and biomedical research units show that tissue engineering is one of the strongest themes in these applications.</p>

However, it is an important question. It is the view of the professional bodies and of the Government that the assessment of patients&#146; suitability for ventricular assist devices is best done in centres that also assess suitability for heart transplants. Those centres have the best concentration of highly skilled teams for assessing the treatment options and then carrying them out.</p>

It is very seldom used, family consent is almost always obtained and there is a very low family refusal rate. The net result is that three times as many organs are available in Spain as in the United Kingdom.</p>

Following the change in Spanish law to a system of presumed consent, it was some 15 years later, after systematic change in the donation process in Spain, that the rates began to climb to the successful levels enjoyed today. So we need to take that in the context of the initial recommendations of the task force, which the Government have fully recommended and which are in the public domain, and in the context of waiting for the new recommendations in relation to the opt-out. It is much more complex than just presumed consent.</p>

That has had a long history for many decades. Its policy was developed in close consultation with Westminster City Council&#151;the local licensing authority&#151;the DCMS and other stakeholders, including the police and local residents. The Royal Parks makes very good use of the commercial opportunities and the money that comes from them is ploughed back into maintaining the parks to the very high standards of which the noble Baroness and many other Members of your Lordships&#146; House obviously approve.</p>

It was well organised and well marshalled. It closed by 12.30 am. I understand that there was very little noise nuisance and in fact no complaints about these events have been received.

If for necessary reasons of public economy grant in aid is not enough to pay for the very high standard of maintenance that we require, are we really entitled to grumble if the Royal Parks raises additional revenue from occasionally permitting private or other events in the parks, however loath we are to see the public temporarily excluded from areas of the parks or otherwise inconvenienced?</p>

I did indeed raise the issue of these delays with President al-Bashir, as I did with a number of other Sudanese officials in Khartoum. Behind each of the specific issues lies the broader issue of Sudanese distrust of UNAMID&#146;s real purpose, around which they entertain some very disconcerting and inaccurate conspiracy theories. We seek to disabuse them of these through intense diplomatic engagement, and if it is of any comfort to the noble Lord, I should say that at the same time as I met with President al-Bashir, the President agreed in parallel meetings with the UN Secretary-General and the head of peacekeeping to the status of force agreement with the UN; to the deployment of various non-African troops&#151;an agreement that had previously been resisted; and to other steps that suggest that this is a little like a snakes and ladders board: we keep having setbacks, but we also make some progress up some ladders.</p>

There have been some modest but important results. There is now a small group of Ethiopian helicopters, which have been committed and meet UN standards. The UN has extensively recruited and leased commercial helicopters, and we now have some reasonable prospect of two other countries adding their helicopters to the force; so we are moving ahead. There are still constraints on flying, from the Sudanese but also from the helicopter owners for insurance purposes. We continue to work our way through this.

<a name="80221-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="080221100000085"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment sums up many of my concerns with this Bill and at the approach that the Government have taken to the nationalisation of Northern Rock. The Government have indicated that it is their intention to nationalise Northern Rock as soon as may be possible. To that end, they have limited debate on this Bill to three days across both Houses of Parliament and have already drafted the order under Clause 3 that will kick-start the proceedings. It is, therefore, inconceivable that anything the expiry of the sunset clause would prevent occurring could not be completed in a matter of days after this Bill receives Royal Assent.</p>

<a name="80221-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="080221100000086"></a>I have tabled this amendment to reduce the limit of the sunset clause from one year to one month. With the best will in the world, I can imagine no possible scenario where the order to nationalise Northern Rock, made under Clause 3 would take more than a month to be made. There is also no possibility that my amendment would make it possible for the Bill to trigger hybrid procedures, and so slow the proceedings down unacceptably. My amendment would prevent the future nationalisation of any other bank or building society under this legislation. This should not be a difficult limitation for the Government to accept, as they have repeatedly stated that they have no intention of nationalising any other financial institution, and have deliberately drafted the requirements in Clause 2(2) to be so high that it is apparently inconceivable that another financial institution will trigger them.</p>

<a name="80221-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="080221100000087"></a>If that is the case, there is no benefit to be gained by keeping these extra 11 months. There are, however, clear costs. As your Lordships made it so clear yesterday, this Bill does great harm to the reputation abroad of the United Kingdom&#146;s financial systems. For the Government to maintain a long-standing power to step in and nationalise any financial institution is an enormously destabilising situation. What sort of confidence does it show in the robustness of our financial systems if the Government cannot restrain themselves from holding these enormous powers over the heads of banks and building societies for a whole year? Added to that, we have identified a very real threat from hedge funds and large global speculative investors who will be able to sell a bank or building society short, deliberately take action to destabilise it sufficiently to worry the Treasury and then sit back and watch their profits come rolling in as the Government move in to nationalise.</p>

<a name="80221-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="080221100000088"></a>The Bill would cause exactly the sort of instability that the Government seek to avoid. I urge the Minister to resist the temptation to keep these powers for such a dangerously long time, as the Government propose. Even in the worst possible scenario imaginable&#151;that of another financial institution needing to be nationalised&#151;the proceedings for this Bill have shown just how necessary the role of Parliament is and how speedily such a role can be played. It is not only possible, it is desirable, that Parliament be given its chance to assess the need for every single nationalisation that the Government might wish to carry out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="080221100000092"></a>In the debates in another place on this amendment, the Liberal Democrats took the view that building societies should be included on the grounds that they should be on an equal footing with banks. I remind them that this Bill is not the banking reform Bill we expect to receive following the conclusion of the Government&#146;s current consultation. This is an emergency Bill to address the crisis surrounding Northern Rock. The merits of putting banks and building societies on an equal footing should be given a proper time for consultation and parliamentary scrutiny, and changes should be made via normal legislation. Proposals such as these should not be rushed through on the back of exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="080221100000093"></a>The debate in another place was also unusual for the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury&#146;s response She, unusually among her colleagues&#151;although the Minister made moves to join her in his winding-up speech last night&#151;made it clear that these provisions were a precautionary measure; that they were not included to avoid hybridity; that they were instead powers that she could contemplate using. To that I can respond only with what I said to my previous amendment: I find it deeply disturbing that the Government can conceive of another crisis occurring within the financial system of a sufficient magnitude to trigger the provisions that allow another nationalisation, without considering it desirable for Parliament&#146;s approval to be sought for that step to be taken. I most sincerely hope that the Minister will think again about the wisdom of awarding the Government such extensive powers. I beg to move.</p>

I was extremely disappointed by the Minister&#146;s response at Second Reading yesterday. Before he sat down, I was almost tempted to ask him if he would answer all the questions raised in the debate. Not a single question put in the debate by Members of this House was answered. A key question was asked repeatedly by a number of noble Lords: what was the reason for the urgency for rushing this legislation through the House? We have had no explanation, and it stands in stark contrast: if the powers are needed urgently, and if we can have only three days to debate this very comprehensive and extensive Bill, why do the Government need a year to use the powers being granted in such haste?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="080221100000095"></a>We need some clarity. A certain unsettling is occurring because of the lack of clarity on the part of Ministers. Do they expect another crisis somewhere else in the banking system? Do they know something that we do not? Some people might imply that that is behind the answers that we received from the Minister yesterday, when he implied that there might be some requirement to do it for another institution. That is deeply destabilising. I see nothing on the horizon to that effect. If Ministers think that they should come clean with the House and tell us so. Or do the Government need 12 months because the Prime Minister cannot make up his mind about anything and it might take him another five months to work out how the provisions should be implemented?</p>

<a name="80221-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="080221100000096"></a>These are extensive powers. They give the Government the ability to set aside the tax law and the rule of law in respect of particular institutions that they may or may not wish to take into public ownership. My noble friend is right: if we are to have such draconian powers whisked through without any proper and detailed scrutiny and without the Executive having the decency to respond to the legitimate questions that are raised in this House, it is essential that they are contained within a short window of time.</p>

I have the gravest concern that we may be embarking on the process and that the Government may want 12 months because, despite having had five months and spending more than &#163;100 million on advice, they have not carried out the necessary due diligence. I find it scandalous. Anyone buying any organisation or company would know the price, would have carried out the due diligence, would have a business plan and a plan for the future. I hope that a year is not required for the Government to do their homework which they should have done before they embarked on the process.</p>

That is why we have this Bill, but also why we are expecting a permanent Bill from the Government to amend the way in which the tripartite arrangement works and new powers to deal with situations such as we have seen with Northern Rock. We understand that that Bill will be introduced in May, which means that it will be through Parliament and on the statute book by the middle of the autumn, probably in October.</p>

That question does not need a specific answer. However, this is a time of financial instability when some serious commentators have clear worries about stability here and elsewhere. The Government have been forced to bring in a piece of legislation and to say that they did so to deal with Northern Rock alone. The legislation goes off the statute book in a month and if in six months another bank or building society finds itself in difficulties, we will have to start all over again, possibly in the middle of a Recess, trying to deal with the issue in the absence of any legislative cover. That is not a responsible attitude. It is not to say that we think a bank or building society will go bust, but that there is a reserve power if a problem arises.</p>

That is of crucial consequence because Parliament has not yet had all the relevant information put before it. It is therefore vital that, in the novel situation of Parliament passing a totally unprecedented Bill that takes control of the whole of the financial aspect of a bank for a year without a thought, as I mentioned yesterday, for what the Commission will say about state aid being given to a sector of financial activity and services, which itself has become totally disorientated by the threat of state-aided intervention&#151;and I do not know what the European Court of Justice is going to say about it&#151;we should help the other place to take the opportunity to think again about where it stands.</p>

If that is so, the Bill ought to refer to Northern Rock, and had that been the case, it would have been a hybrid Bill. The purpose of such a Bill, as my noble and learned friend Lord Lyell said yesterday, is for people to put their point of view&#151;in this case, not only those being nationalised, but also those not being nationalised&#151;in a committee with legal representation, because one party may be advantaged or disadvantaged in relation to the others. However, to avoid what is of course a lengthy process, the Government have produced this arrangement, which provides that for the next 12 months they can nationalise anything.</p>

<a name="80221-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="080221100000105"></a>This Bill is not for the nationalisation of Northern Rock, it is a Bill for the nationalisation of any bank or building society within the next 12 months, as the Government think fit. I agree with my noble friend Lord De Mauley that if this is just for Northern Rock, there is no reason why it should not be curtailed to a month because as we all know, there is a rush to get this through Parliament. But if it is required for longer than a month, of course my noble friend Lord Forsyth is right to ask why, and to ask what the Government have in mind. I do not believe that the Government have anything else in mind, but if that is the case, then I do not see why they cannot approve of it lasting for a month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="080221100000106"></a>With the greatest respect, I am horrified that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, thinks that it is a very good idea to keep this legislation for 12 months because the Government can nationalise anything that happens to go wrong. I do not think we are in that business.</p>

The magnitude is staggering. It has never been done for any other bank, let alone for any other industry. Leaving aside the &#163;100 billion for which, theoretically, the Government and the public are at risk, let me start with the &#163;25 billion. This was a unique situation which required action. We realised yesterday that we are in a Hobson&#146;s choice position and are being forced into nationalisation&#151;which people reluctantly have to accept at this stage&#151;but why have an open door to be able to nationalise from now onwards?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="080221100000108"></a>If a similar situation were to occur again tomorrow, serious alarm bells should ring that would require far more than the legislation that is being rushed through right now. I said yesterday that what is required&#151;and I believe the Minister and the Government agree&#151;is a complete revamp of banking regulation, supervision and governance. Whether that is to bring back what the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, referred to yesterday&#151;the board of governance, the board of directors of the banks or whatever&#151;we need the best for this country to ensure that we keep our openness and our standing as one of the leading global financial centres in the world. That is the important part. If it is going to take a month for such legislation to go through&#151;I do not think we should rush it&#151;we should not leave the door open for another Northern Rock situation to take place and have this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="080221100000109"></a>I agree that there is no reason to discriminate between building societies and banks, but building societies require matters to be looked at slightly differently and it would be unwise to lump them in with the banks.</p>

Why is it that she requires 12 months for consultation? She could undertake one month&#146;s consultation and if, at the end of that consultation process, it was concluded that 12 months was preferable, it could be reinserted.</p>

<a name="80221-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="080221100000112"></a>The amendment is irresponsible for the reasons outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria. This is an unprecedented situation because of the growth of the credit markets, their role in banking and the way they have developed over the past 10 years. Because of that, the wholesale financing of banking is today quite different from what it was when, for example, the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, was Chancellor of the Exchequer. The situation has fundamentally changed. That qualitative change has led to a massive quantitative change of the exposure in credit markets which can occur if a financial institution fails. That is why, for example, the Bank of England cannot use its own resources, as it traditionally has in the past, to take institutions into public ownership; the scale is so great. That is why this measure is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="080221100000113"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, asked whether there was any other institution the Government expected to be in crisis&#151;a very irresponsible question, I suggest. The main point is that financial crises appear out of clear blue skies; they are always unprecedented and they always have characteristics which have not been anticipated. That is why it is important that, until the legislation anticipated by the noble Lord, Lord Newby&#151;which has been discussed by the Front Bench and is now under consultation&#151;is available, we have these powers on the statute book to ensure that rapid action can be taken should, God forbid, there be a similar circumstance.</p>

It is unsatisfactory in any case to be considering legislation at this pace; it is effectively an abrogation of the entire parliamentary system of legislation. To produce a Bill like this with lots of complicated issues in it and to have points raised that are then not answered is wholly unacceptable. The argument for haste has certainly not been made to overcome that point.</p>

<a name="80221-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="080221100000116"></a>I wish to make a point that I made yesterday. As regards Granite, it was necessary for the Treasury to produce a quite complicated technical note explaining what it was. Granite is an important part of the structure of Northern Rock because it is the vehicle into which the mortgages are passed by the bank. It therefore contains many billions of pounds&#146; worth of mortgages. The Government have repeatedly made it clear that they are not nationalising Granite and say that it is all quite separate. However, the technical note says that it is a commercial decision for Northern Rock whether to provide new mortgage assets to the Granite financing vehicle or whether to allow the vehicle to run off in an orderly way. That implies to me that the future of Granite is entirely in the hands of Northern Rock, and therefore in the hands of the Government.</p>

<a name="80221-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="080221100000117"></a>I asked the Minister a question during his speech because I understood that there was another special investment vehicle called Dolerite, which holds the mortgage assets for the commercial properties of Northern Rock. When I raised that issue, he said he did not have an answer but he would find out, and he hoped to have an answer by the end of his speech. Not only had he not told me about Dolerite by the end of his speech, but he did not even mention it in his wind-up. These are perfectly legitimate questions to which we are totally entitled to have replies. The idea that the Bill should go back down the Corridor with none of the points that have been raised having even been replied to is unacceptable.</p>

I do not believe in monocausal explanations for all phenomena. First, the Bill has to be like this to avoid hybridity. We do not want it to apply just to Northern Rock because that would be a time-consuming process and this is a better way to do it. Secondly, as my noble friend Lord Eatwell and I said yesterday and previously, this is an unprecedented financial crisis. Only yesterday, Credit Suisse declared that it had lost more money than anyone had expected&#151;especially the Qatar Sovereign Wealth Fund, which had just bought into it, thinking that the market had bottomed out. The market has not bottomed out. As my noble friend Lord Eatwell also said, the whole essence of a financial crisis is the completely unexpected nature of what will happen next. I think it is prudent to insure yourself against  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_283"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 283</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this sort of problem.

<a name="80221-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="080221100000119"></a>Secondly, within the next 12 months we will have the result of the consultation and the new banking reform legislation. One thing we have learnt is that it will be an extremely complex piece of legislation, because we are just learning about all the new problems created by securitisation and so forth. I do not know how long the consultation will take. Even if that takes a short time, I do not know how long the drafting will take. Therefore, it is entirely prudent to have 12 months on the face of this Bill. It is not going to cause a revolution. It is just a precautionary measure.</p>

<a name="80221-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="080221100000120"></a>Secondly, as my noble friend Lord Whitty said, if you are going to give banks this kind of assurance that, in case anything happens, the Government are prepared with sufficient powers to do something about it, why leave the building societies out? The Opposition argue as though the fact that the Bank of England has lender-of-last-resort powers immediately implies that the Bank of England thinks that all the financial markets are going to collapse tomorrow. Of course not. Lender-of-last-resort power is an insurance, and we need that kind of insurance in these very uncertain times.</p>

Fundamentally, what is important is the question of hybridity. I assume in relation to the period of 12 months that the Government have received advice from their legal advisers that it is safe and copper-bottomed. What shorter period would be safe and copper-bottomed? That is where we go into the area of doubt. I do not know whether it is possible to have a definitive decision on this matter. Am I right in thinking that, in fact, the Speaker of the House of Commons certifies hybridity, in the same way as he certifies a money Bill? Has he given any indication of his attitude to a month? If a month is either impossible or dangerous, then most certainly this House should not contemplate any amendment along those lines.</p>

He said that we did not know what it would contain, but that it would be very complicated, and so we should keep the provisions of this Bill open for longer than a month because the new Bill might mean that something should be put in its place.

Listening to the discussion, a further point occurred to me. It is in response to the comments of my noble friend Lord Marlesford who referred to the special investment vehicle, Granite, on which some comments were made yesterday&#151;indeed I made some comments myself&#151;and in respect of which we received no reply. I appreciate the limited time that was available yesterday and the limited time we have to look into these matters. However, will the Minister, in the course of the discussion today, find a way of giving us more precise information about Granite and the other SIV which my noble friend has referred to? If there is another SIV similar to Granite, which has handled the commercial property&#151;we saw from yesterday&#146;s technical note that Granite has half of the notional assets; or at least half of what were Northern Rock&#146;s assets have gone to Granite&#151;and if another portion of those assets have gone off to Dolerite, I think this is a hugely important point with regard to the nature of the business. If he could find a way to say more about the nature of the SIVs&#151;that may not be entirely relevant to the amendment&#151;during the course of the day, we should all appreciate it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="080221100000124"></a>The basic point that I want to make in support of the amendment moved by my noble friend is simple. With regard to it, I invite the Minister&#151;and Members of the Committee&#151;to leave to one side all of the technical matters that we know about and to try to put himself in the mind of the man on the street looking at this. There was a crisis five months ago. The Government stepped in, guaranteed the deposits, made an unprecedented amount of money available and said that they were going to proceed to try to find a private buyer. That would have reassured the public, who will have taken what the Government said at face value: that we now had a plan in position to try to find a private buyer. They would have heard a little about Branson and others, and various bids which the Government were considering. However, the process of considering those bids was suddenly brought to an end. We had been expecting that the consideration of those bids would take a few weeks more, but the process was suddenly brought to an end and legislation was introduced to be handled as if it were emergency legislation. If the Government had been proceeding according to the plan of considering the bids; if they had come to the view that the bids were not terribly good and that the only thing left was to proceed to nationalisation; and if everything was in order&#151;if the deposits had been guaranteed and the money made available&#151;and stable, there would be no need suddenly to abbreviate the bid procedure or to rush in emergency legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="080221100000125"></a>The way in which the Government have acted in the past few days is bound to make people who are not fully informed and who do not have the background information that the Minister has concerned about whether there is some other problem. Ministers have also dropped hints that we need this legislation to deal with other problems that might arise. The noble Lord, Lord Desai, said that this is a matter of prudence and the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, said that the whole structure of the industry has changed with regard to financing&#151;I will not try to repeat the technical terms

All those comments will reinforce the feeling that people outside have&#151;that there is something else involved; that there are other problems that the Government are concerned about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="080221100000126"></a>There are obviously limits on what the Minister can say, but the Government need to address this issue and explain why we needed to proceed by an emergency procedure and why this has to be rushed through the House in a way that does not give Parliament the opportunity to consider it. The Prime Minister has famously said that he wishes to restore trust in politics and the effectiveness of Parliament, yet his actions point completely in the other direction. Something needs to be said. The man on the street may not be considering this in detail, but the way in which it has been handled is bound to increase the sense of unease and the sense that there are other crises waiting to happen and other matters about which the Government are seriously concerned. The Government need to address this.</p>

<a name="80221-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="080221100000127"></a>The amendment gives the Government the opportunity to make it clear whether they are dealing simply with Northern Rock or with Northern Rock plus other matters about which they have concerns. I know that there is a delicacy involved, but the Minister needs to find ways to make clear precisely what this is about. The amendment focuses the legislation on Northern Rock, which the Government say is the objective of the legislation. If that is the objective of the legislation, let us have that made clear.</p>

I say at this early stage in our proceedings that it is important to get the information that is required about Granite. I want to make two points on that. First, we have not yet had a reply from the Minister giving the assurance that I asked him for yesterday that no further assets would be transferred from Northern Rock to Granite. We need that assurance. The second point involves the nature of Granite. It is all very well to say that it is much bigger in relation to Northern Rock as a whole than are the similar vehicles for other lending institutions. However, that is not the only point. The Minister is to be taken to say, and government Ministers generally say, that these offshore structured investment vehicles happen all the time, but the precise contractual relations between the offshore vehicle and the lending institution vary in each case and they have a considerable bearing on the matter. We need to know, before we agree this Bill, precisely what the contractual relationship is in this case between Northern Rock and Granite.</p>

The Bank of England did not have the resources in my time. When an operation required greater funds than its resources

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="080221100000130"></a>As for the question about a year, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Desai, that we certainly want to put better arrangements in place because the present arrangements have failed, but even when better arrangements are in place there will still be the possibility of a bank collapse. You can try to make it less likely to occur by having better banking supervision. You can have a better deposit protection system in place&#151;to some extent that need has been achieved&#151;but there will always be the possibility of a bank collapse. That suggests that this Bill would have to be in perpetuity, not just for a year, so it really has no bearing on the year/month argument at all. I suspect that the real argument is that there is a fear that, if the period of time were too short, it would be so clear that the Bill was dealing only with Northern Rock that it would be hybrid&#151;some people consider that this Bill is hybrid anyway. We need the Minister to give us a precise account of what advice the Government have received on the hybridity question.</p>

We were brought up with mortgages being for 25 or 30 years; I do not know how many people are aware that the average life of a mortgage today is three years. I see that the noble Lord agrees with me. Things are moving quickly, yet I cannot but reinforce what the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, has said: we do not understand what is going on with Granite. Just today we have read in the press that another major bank is walking away from its SIV and losing several billion pounds. Northern Rock has money invested in Granite; Northern Rock in effect controls Granite, because it consolidates it in its group accounts. How can one say that no money has been transferred to Granite when mortgages have been sold to Granite that have to be serviced? The money has to be passed through; otherwise, Granite collapses. I do not think that we have a full understanding of this at all. Without a full understanding of over &#163;40 billion and something that is consolidated into the accounts of Northern Rock, I seriously do not see how we can proceed with confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="080221100000133"></a>The argument that has been made for maintaining the openness of the measure, apart from the hybridity point, is that in an uncertain market there may be other occasions where banks fall into difficulties. We need to understand that, even if the Government were aware of such specific possibilities, they obviously would not be able to reveal them to noble Lords today. My concern about the measure is that it may lend credence to the notion that nationalisation is the only or first option. We all ought to take the view that nationalisation should be the last resort and that wherever possible the appropriate response to a failing institution should be for it to be put in the

Therefore, irrespective of whether the provision applies for a month or a year, will the Minister explain to the Committee what criteria the Government would use, over and beyond the general criteria set out in the Bill, to decide that nationalisation was the appropriate response to a specific situation? If they are to use the provisions in the Bill to do that, how would they ensure that Parliament as a whole had the opportunity to discuss and challenge them on whether nationalisation was the right response in another instance? If we leave this as an open door for the Government, nationalisation too easily becomes the first resort when it should not be.</p>

Had I directed myself then to all the detailed questions that were asked, I would have at least doubled that time. Of course, it may be thought that we have plenty of time at our disposal, but I am conscious of the fact that a Minister ought to speak only for a certain time. That is why at the beginning of the debate I dispensed with the usual formula of going through the Bill clause by clause, although my speech was drafted in those terms, and addressed myself to the fundamental issues that had been raised&#151;we had the advantage of the other place having discussed it only the day before&#151;so that I could as far as possible reassure the House on those questions.

It was an SIV that was used, but it is not used now and it is therefore not relevant to this Bill. On Granite, I attempted to express this point yesterday. Granite has no shares in Northern Rock. Granite is an SIV and there has been no transfer from Northern Rock to Granite since September 2007. The relationship is in suspension in those terms. The reason why Granite is not in the Bill is that we do not need to nationalise Granite, as it is not directly relevant to the position of Northern Rock.</p>

According to the technical note, Northern Rock received value for those transfers at the time of the transfers so that, at the time of the transfers, it seems to me that the ownership of those assets moved from Northern Rock to Granite. Northern Rock may have been giving management services to Granite with regard to those assets, which it clearly did, but it no longer owned those assets. None the less, we are told

As Northern Rock exercises control over Granite, it means that Granite vehicles are consolidated on Northern Rock&#146;s group balance sheet; that is why they are there. This consolidation does not mean that the assets or liabilities of Granite are those of Northern Rock, or that Northern Rock is liable to Granite bondholders for the repayment of the Granite bonds. That is why Granite does not feature as part of the Bill. I sought to express this yesterday. The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, has emphasised his view that my response at the end of the debate was inadequate. I sought to make the position clear at the beginning of the debate and I am taking the opportunity of Committee stage to do so now. I have also answered his question on Dolerite.

If it still exists, does it have any debts or finances that have been passed to it and which themselves are still linked to Northern Rock?</p>

Dolerite was a securitisation structure similar to Granite. It was used by Northern Rock to fund its commercial mortgage book. All bonds under that structure have now been redeemed. Therefore, Dolerite is entirely irrelevant to Northern Rock. As I cannot be any more explicit than that, I hope the noble Lord will forgive me.</p>

It is therefore in some ways owned by Northern Rock. But Granite is apparently a legally separate entity, set up for charitable purposes in Jersey. How can Northern Rock own something that is legally independent? And what happens if Granite goes bust? Does Northern Rock have to pay out? If so, Granite is part of Northern Rock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="080221100000149"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Forsyth and Lord Lawson, asked me about a supposed bid last September, a question which was certainly raised yesterday. There was never a bid or a proposal to which the Government should have responded in those terms. Although the Chancellor made it clear, as did the Governor of the Bank of England and the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, that an enquiry by a possible buyer was made, no firm proposal was ever received. There was nothing on which the Government could act. It is therefore not right to give the impression that what was going on last September was similar to the issues relating to Olivant and Virgin over the past few months.</p>

I believe that Lloyds TSB said it was prepared to take over Northern Rock on the basis that the Bank of England would provide a &#163;30 billion facility for two years&#151;a draw-down facility which would not necessarily be used, because banks tend to want to match their long and short liabilities&#151;and that although the Government responded at first that they were not prepared to take the loan book as security on the facility, they then changed their mind. The facility would have been at a commercial rate of interest. Secondly, the Government were not prepared to have a commercial rate of interest but wanted a penal rate. When the Government rejected that proposal they committed themselves to a course which has brought us to this sorry state. The Minister owes it to the Committee to tell us whether that is correct. It is playing with words to say that they did not have a firm proposal. Was Lloyds prepared to take over Northern Rock as a private buyer on these terms or was it not?</p>

We are considering specific amendments but a range of other issues have been raised within that framework. Many of them have been raised before, and I have sought to respond to them. Perhaps I may now address myself to the questions. I have no further reply to the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, on the position last September. As the Chancellor made clear in another place and I have repeated, there was never a significant development regarding a bid for the Government to consider. The issue is therefore extraneous to the Bill, which is about how to deal with the present situation of Northern Rock.</p>

<a name="80221-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="080221100000154"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, deserves a reply on his two amendments. There was some concern when the amendment was put forward in the other place that a full year would not be needed for the process we are undertaking. Of course we recognise that concern, so it may be helpful if I set out why a full year is desirable. But first, to avoid any misunderstanding, I must make it clear that the sunset clause applies only to the powers to make transfer orders under Clauses 3 and 6. It does not apply to the powers to make compensation orders in Clauses 5 and 7 or to the other powers of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80221-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="080221100000155"></a>In addition, Clause 2(9) provides that transfer orders will continue in force even when the powers in Clauses 3 and 6 have expired. However, the powers in Clauses 3 and 6 may have to be used more than once in any particular case. So, following the initial order, further orders may be made under these clauses where, for example, provision must be made in connection with or in consequence of the transfer, or to deal with new matters or issues affecting the transfer. It is too soon to say whether further orders may be needed in relation to Northern Rock. We would not wish to take the risk that we will need to make consequential provision after the one-month time limit has expired. That is why we need time in relation to Northern Rock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="080221100000156"></a>As the Committee will recognise, the Bill is drafted in general terms, and I have explained the two reasons for this generality. The first, of course, is to avoid the issue of hybridity&#151;an issue which raises very real difficulties about the timescale in which any measure should be passed, when everyone recognises the urgency of dealing with Northern Rock. The second aspect of the timescale is that, as I sought to make clear yesterday, the Government are seeking to produce a significant Bill that will encompass permanent solutions to the issues of banking reform. We have had extensive consultations on that because it is an issue of the greatest import. The Government published a consultation document on the reforms at the end of last month and we will introduce a Bill in the present Session. That Bill is not likely to achieve Royal Assent for many months. In the mean time, we have to address significant issues about regulation of the banking system.</p>

I address that point to the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers. He will appreciate that very strict conditions have to be met under Clause 2 before the provisions are triggered. That is why they relate to Northern Rock and only to Northern Rock. They would only apply to any other financial institution if we faced the direst crisis with it.</p>

The Bill is not hybrid because, at present, the conditions under Clause 2 apply only to Northern Rock. They are emergency circumstances; they apply to Northern Rock. The reason why we require the provision for 12 months is that we cannot foresee the future. It is not a question of the Government knowing something that the rest of us do not know, as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, suggested&#151;as if the Government would ever be in a position to know more than the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth. It is not a question of us knowing something that he does not; it is the Government being prudent in these difficult times. What could be more absurd&#151;and just think of the criticism that would emerge from various parts of the House&#151;than if an emergency occurred and there were difficulties with another institution, and the Government came trailing back to the House again to say, &#147;We now need specific legislation with regard to this institution and we are asking the House to go through the whole matter&#148;? It is surely better that we are prudent.</p>

The Government are not about creating law in order to nationalise any other institution. The Government are creating law to make it possible for that to be done if the very strict conditions of Clause 2 are met&#151;that confidence in the financial system is threatened, the issue that Northern Rock raised, which is why we acted as we did with regard to Northern Rock.</p>

One is the &#147;carry on as you were&#148; option, which would involve Northern Rock offering reckless products. I think there is agreement that this is not the way forward. The second option is the administration, or Lawson, option: to wind down the bank as quickly as possible. The third option&#151;the Sandler option, and presumably the government option&#151;is that the bank should continue to take deposits and issue mortgages and try to trade itself out of the slough in which it finds itself.</p>

We have heard from the Minister and the Chancellor in another place that directions to the management of Northern Rock will be broad brush, high level and strategic, as of course they should be. Unfortunately, good intentions are sometimes not enough to ensure good outcomes.

The last thing any of us wants is redundancies or repossessions, but such are sometimes the inevitable result of decisions of an unfettered management doing its best for the shareholder&#151;in this case, the taxpayer.</p>

I note that the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, is no longer the room, so I might be straying slightly into Second Reading territory since I could not be here for the first part of yesterday&#146;s debate.</p>

<a name="80221-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="080221100000188"></a>We have talked about the interests of the deposit holders in Northern Rock; indeed, that was the reason for the intervention. We have talked about, and largely dismissed, the interests of the shareholders. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, and the unions have referred to the interests of the staff. However, the real people who are likely to miss out in the whole of this catastrophe are those on the edge of being given a mortgage in the normal way. A lot of the broad-sweep condemnation of sub-prime mortgages here and in the United States will, if we are not careful, rule out an awful lot of decent, hardworking people who would be paying back their mortgage but happen to be on relatively low incomes, to be relatively young, or to be in rather different family circumstances. Those are the real losers in all this. Advancing mortgages to them undoubtedly carries risk, but the vast majority of them have actually repaid their mortgage.</p>

<a name="80221-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="080221100000189"></a>We would certainly expect the management of the bank to be prudent and to take all risk into account, which the previous management of Northern Rock clearly did not do, but placing too great a constraint on the bank&#146;s mortgage-giving arrangements has severe social repercussions, particularly in a situation in which owning your house is often the most obvious and desirable option in the housing market. Noble Lords will have heard me talking before about the absence of flexibility and available social housing and private rented housing&#151;housing that in other circumstances would be the option. In a society in which owning your own house is vital and the best option for a lot of low-income families, we do not wish to see Northern Rock, or indeed the whole banking system, acting as an exemplar by excluding significant parts of the population from receiving mortgages. That point was not made strongly enough in yesterday&#146;s Second Reading debate. If the outcome of this crisis is that a significant proportion of the population can no longer get housing credit, then that is a problem. I fear that over-interpreting the words of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, in Amendment No. 5 could lead to that result.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Newby, has phrased his Amendment No. 5 with sufficient care in terms of risk minimising so as to leave the people in charge of Northern Rock with a broad guide, within which they can then do whatever they like. Yet I do

That would be a really bad thing.</p>

<a name="80221-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="080221100000191"></a>In the debate on the gracious Speech I pointed out that we have created a housing sector that is a monster by giving it tax advantages and treating it unlike any other asset. We are then surprised that there is a housing shortage. We really have to wean ourselves off giving mortgages to people who do not have the capacity to service them. I do not think that it is the responsibility of Northern Rock to reform society or the housing sector. It has got into enough problems, so it has to behave itself. Within that, it can do either of these things: draw itself down, or, perhaps, maintain a constant size&#151;a strategy that would be perfectly possible by granting a new mortgage only if it has retired another, or something like that. I like the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, because it correctly formulates how the management should behave.</p>

<ul><a name="080221100000275"></a>&#147;a quarterly report setting out progress made in relation to a deposit-taker's business plan&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080221100000261"></a>That is obviously a sensible proposal that I would happily support but I find it slightly difficult to understand why, given the emphasis of his remarks in moving that important amendment, he is happy to support the Bill when we have no business plan at the moment to look at. Therefore, Amendment No. 6 in the names of my noble friends Lord De Mauley and Lord Hunt is the key amendment in this group. It requires the provision of a proper business plan setting out how Northern Rock will be managed and its objectives. That is to be done before any order is made. It would have been courteous to the Committee to have had this business plan today. I understand that it will be made available to the European Union before 17 March. It would then have been much easier to form a view.</p>

<a name="80221-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="080221100000193"></a>On Amendment No. 5, I have my doubts. Those are not about the sentiments, for it is clearly sensible that an,</p>
<ul><a name="080221100000276"></a>&#147;order under this section shall ... make provision for a deposit-taker to be managed by the Treasury in a prudent manner&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080221100000262"></a>I would hardly expect it to be managed in an imprudent manner. Presumably, it will now, at least, be well and truly on the radar of the Financial Services Authority. I do not want to stray into Amendment No. 9, which is for a later stage of our consideration of these matters, but I wonder what Amendment No. 6 actually means if, as the management, you are told that you have to manage,</p>
<ul><a name="080221100000277"></a>&#147;in a prudent manner so as to minimise the risk to the taxpayer&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080221100000263"></a>If I were the chief executive, I would take that provision to mean that I should go out and compete vigorously, making as much money as I possibly could, as that would,</p>
<ul><a name="080221100000278"></a>&#147;minimise the risk to the taxpayer&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="080221100000194"></a>That would also maximise the uncompetitive behaviour subsidised by the taxpayer from the point of view of Northern Rock&#146;s competitors. With Amendment No. 5, then, we are trying to find a form of words to bridge an impossible gap. If the bank is to be run on a business as usual basis, as has been suggested by the chief executive, it will be impossible to achieve. It will not be business as usual, but a bank that is backed by a government guarantee and which has an advantaged position.</p>

<a name="80221-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="080221100000195"></a>In short, I support Amendment No. 3. I am not sure about Amendment No. 5, which is whistling in the dark. I am sure that Amendment No. 6, setting out the need for a proper business plan, is the most important amendment. I hope that your Lordships will have the opportunity for a proper debate, with proper time made available, when the order is made in your Lordships&#146; House and when we have that business plan to hand.</p>

I suspect, however, that the motivation behind the amendment was probably benign and proper&#151;to try to safeguard the position of mortgagors who find themselves in difficulties with repayments under their mortgages. The amendment is really an appeal for guidance in those narrow and perilous waters that divide Scylla and Charybdis; I cannot now remember which was the rock and which the whirlpool, but there was a rock&#151;albeit a southern rock. Therefore, it is a difficult situation if a mortgagee finds himself or herself having on the one hand to do that which is prudent and, on the other, that which is humane with regard to a debtor.</p>

<a name="80221-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="080221100000197"></a>I would make an obvious point without apology. The ultimate determination does not, of course, lie with the bank or mortgagee itself, but with the courts. The question of whether one triggers the mechanism to commence an action in the courts for sale or for foreclosure is a decision for the mortgagee, but the ultimate decision&#151;under the Administration of Justice Act 1970&#151;lies with the courts. In practice, it lies with a district judge, who would have to decide whether the debtor has a reasonable prospect, within the total term of the mortgage, of making that repayment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="080221100000202"></a>Last autumn, at the outset of this process, the Government set three clear objectives for the successful resolution of the situation: to protect taxpayers; to protect depositors; and to maintain financial stability. Those objectives have guided everything that we have done to date and will continue to guide our relations with Northern Rock as we develop our shareholder and lender relationships during this period of temporary public ownership. I can confirm that the Chief Secretary has said that we will publish a framework document that sets out the formal basis of those relationships, a copy of which will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="080221100000207"></a>Consistent with the Government&#146;s three key objectives for Northern Rock, the clear strategic aim that we have set for the management is to move the bank off all forms of public support, including the guarantee arrangements, as soon as possible, while ensuring that the taxpayer is exposed only to an acceptable level of risk. The bank&#146;s business plan, which will be developed in the coming weeks and must be agreed with the Government, needs to be directed at those aims. Ron Sandler and his team therefore are clear on what they have to do. As he stated, his priority is to develop a sustainable business plan for Northern Rock that enables

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="080221100000208"></a>We look forward to discussing and developing that plan with the new board. I can commit to keep the House fully informed as that planning work reaches a conclusion. The Government will also be committed to reporting on the future strategic direction of Northern Rock regularly to both Houses. I hope therefore that the noble Lord will think that this amendment is unnecessary. The board is clear on the strategic objectives. The framework for the relationship between the Government and the company will be made clear and a strategic plan will be communicated to the House in due course&#151;not quite as rapidly as the noble Lord has pressed me to deliver, but there certainly will be no delay.</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="080221100000209"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, spoke forcefully on Amendment No. 5 and in principle won the support to a large extent of my noble friend Lord Desai. Of course we should set out the principles and objectives that have been laid down for the new board. I hope that that reassures the Committee that we expect the company to be managed in a prudent manner.</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="080221100000210"></a>I take this opportunity to make some further points and to answer some of the questions that I notably failed to answer last night in my lengthy reply to the debate. I think that the whole Committee is agreed that during this period of temporary public ownership Northern Rock should be run on a commercial basis at arm&#146;s length from the Government. The Government are not best placed to make decisions on the sort of products to offer and how they should be designed for customers. The role of the Government is to set the strategic framework within which the bank can operate by agreeing a business plan. Let me be clear: Northern Rock has been taken into public ownership only on a temporary basis. The Government are not about the business of running banks. It will be for Mr Sandler to develop a sustainable business plan for the company and to decide which financial products to offer.</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="080221100000211"></a>I want to comment on one financial product, which was referred to several times in yesterday&#146;s debate and in recent weeks has been raised in questions in this House and, I think, in another place. There has been concern about the 125 per cent mortgages. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked a specific question on that. I reiterate what I said when I answered that question, which reflects answers given in the other place. It is far from unusual for lenders to offer products of this nature and the lenders understand well the risks that they are taking on. These products are often sold on a commercial basis to individuals with appropriate credit ratings, which is why I indicated to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that I was not entirely surprised that his personal application might have received a favourable response. That is standard practice across the industry.</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="080221100000212"></a>It is worth noting that the problems of Northern Rock have not been a result of lending at high multiples; they arose from raising liquidity in difficult international financial circumstances. I make it clear that the Government will approve Northern Rock&#146;s business plan and subsequent major decisions. Ron

However, it would be inappropriate for the Government to interfere with the day-to-day operations of Northern Rock. It should be operated on a commercial basis and returned to the private sector as soon as is feasible.</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="080221100000213"></a>I assure the Committee that, as Ron Sandler has said, his business plan will need to stabilise the business and establish a solid future in which the business can be returned to the private sector. As a part of this, he will look carefully at the quality of the assets of Northern Rock. He will agree the business plan with the Treasury. The Government will look at the business plan to see that it meets the three tests of protecting the taxpayer, maintaining financial stability and protecting depositors. Operational decisions of course will be a matter for the board of Northern Rock, but I assure the Committee that the Government will consider the plan to ensure that the risk to the taxpayer is appropriate. I hope that the noble Lord will accept&#151;</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="080221100000221"></a>We are clear on the need to keep the House informed. We will publish shortly the framework document and set out the operating agreement between the bank and the Government. It is our intention to do that at the earliest opportunity. It will include confirmation of the Government&#146;s strategic objectives, which are the protection of the taxpayer and the consumer and the maintenance of financial stability; the board will be expected to operate the company in a manner that is consistent with those objectives. Ron Sandler will publish his strategic business plan in due course. That will outline the strategic objectives of the company and will need to be agreed with the Government and be compliant with EU state aid rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="080221100000222"></a>Of course the Committee will not expect the company to publish any commercially sensitive information but

As I emphasised, Ministers will continue to keep Parliament informed on progress through, for example, the regular&#151;at least six-monthly&#151;update reports to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. We will expect Northern Rock in temporary public ownership to be run in a prudent manner, which is the burden of one of the noble Lord&#146;s amendments. I assure the Committee that the Government will ensure that there is no inappropriate risk for the taxpayer when considering the business plan.</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="080221100000223"></a>My right honourable friend the Chancellor has already explained that, having assessed all the alternatives for the future of the business against those objectives, he does not consider administration to be in the best interests of the taxpayer. In order to comply with state aid rules, the company will be subject to growth constraints. That will be entirely consistent with the Government&#146;s view of a company that has had to rely on government support to keep it afloat. We do not expect the company to return to the aggressive strategy of recent years that has proved so unsustainable. I hope that noble Lords will recognise the strength of the Government&#146;s response to the amendments and I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, will withdraw his amendment.</p>

I say to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, that my concern is not that as a result of the Northern Rock nationalisation young couples or anyone else will find it difficult to obtain mortgages. We are still in a situation where many mortgage lenders are lending imprudently. In any event, the share of the market that Northern Rock had and will have in future means that there is a lot of the market to go to if you are looking to take out a mortgage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="080221100000225"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, stressed the desirability of producing a business plan or at least some indication of the basis on which Northern Rock should be managed going forward. It is a major shortcoming of the way in which the Government have dealt with the issue that such a statement has not been produced by now. Noble Lords will recall that Ron Sandler was appointed in a shadow capacity before Christmas to look at Northern Rock. No doubt people in the Treasury have been working night and day since then. The kind of broad statement of principles that we are seeking could have been produced by this point. The fact that we do not have one, even though we are now promised one in the near future, is a great shame.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="080221100000226"></a>In Amendment No. 3, we asked for regular reports to the House. The noble Lord has gone a considerable way towards meeting that requirement. On our second amendment, I will read carefully what the noble Lord said, because he said an awful lot. I think that the word &#147;prudent&#148; appeared, but I am not sure how often the word &#147;risk&#148; appeared and what other words appeared around it. It may be that between now and Report we have the chance to look at that in more detail and decide what we want to do at that stage. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<ul>

</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="080221100000273"></a>&#147;( ) An order under this section shall also make provision for a deposit-taker to be subject to independent audit to be completed within 3 months of the date of the order and no less frequently than annually thereafter by the Bank of England.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80221-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="080221100000229"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a simple and straightforward amendment, which calls for a take-on independent audit if I may put it that way, as at the date of Royal Assent&#151;which I hope is today but might be tomorrow&#151;of what the taxpayer has bought. When we buy any business, as the Labour Member Mark Todd pointed out&#151;I heard his speech in the Commons the other night&#151;we like to find out what we have bought. There are important reasons why there needs to be an independent audit by a firm of auditors which is not associated with the previous regime.</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="080221100000230"></a>As I mentioned yesterday, quoting the distinguished banking analyst Sandy Chen at Panmure Gordon, there are serious concerns in the City about the last interim report&#151;the audited report from Northern Rock as at 30 June last year&#151;and whether the auditors had done their job properly. Did the FSA do its job properly when it looked through some of the funny pieces of paper&#151;the CDOs, SIVs and so on that Northern Rock was then holding? Was the bank even solvent at that stage? Those questions will need to be examined seriously. They should not be examined by the auditors who were responsible for those figures. The noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, was kind enough to give me a little preview of what he was going to say, and one cannot rely on the Financial Services Authority in this respect. It has blatantly failed in its regulation of Northern Rock, and we would not be here today if it had done its job properly. The authority itself has some serious questions to answer. There should be an independent audit commissioned by and reporting to the Bank of England&#151;effectively the banker for the taxpayer, which is lending the money&#151;which we can all see.</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="080221100000231"></a>It would be a gross dereliction of duty if we did not insist on this because there could well be a very substantial claim for negligence against the auditors of Northern Rock, from which the taxpayer could obviously benefit substantially. That is why it is important. Perhaps the Minister could confirm that the year-end audit of Northern Rock as a public company up to 31 December, which would normally have appeared at the end of January, is in train. That is all well and good, but that audit clearly was of the public company as at 31 December and is therefore a quite separate process from a proper, independent audit of the bank on the day we all buy it.</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="080221100000232"></a>It is also important that this independent audit should look into and explain simply the position of Granite. Frankly, a lot of nonsense was spoken by the Treasury and the Minister to my noble friend Lord Newby and me last night. I want to ask a simple question. Northern Rock has something like &#163;100 billion worth of assets, of which just under half, &#163;45 billion, are in Granite, and we know that the assets in Granite are all high-quality secured mortgages because they have to be under the terms of the trustee. We are  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_307"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 307</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>then left with &#163;55 billion of which we know &#163;8 billion is in unsecured loans, a lot of them the top slice of those pernicious &#147;together&#148; mortgages. If &#163;8 billion out of the &#163;55 billion left to the taxpayer is in unsecured loans, surely there is no way that the quality of the Granite portfolio can be similar to the quality of the rest of the Northern Rock portfolio. That is so obvious that I am surprised that the Treasury or anyone else tries to pretend otherwise.</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="080221100000233"></a>Moreover, I remind noble Lords that &#163;8 billion is five times the shareholders&#146; funds in Northern Rock in the last published accounts. So we will want to see from the independent auditor a full and frank explanation of exactly how Granite works, the economic and commercial reality of the relationship, not these weasel words, this legal fiction. We need a proper setting-out of the contracts between Northern Rock and Granite, realistic scenarios on how fast the mortgage book runs down, as well as, frankly, the prospect of various rates of house prices falling, which is the realistic assessment of the City and is mine too. That should form part of an independent audit.</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="080221100000234"></a>Those points are pretty clear and I would be amazed and surprised if the Minister could give any reason why we should not protect the taxpayer&#146;s investment in this way. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="080221100000235"></a><b><a name="80221-0006.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="080221100000695"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I share completely the demand of the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, for an independent audit. Among many other things, it should unearth the information so many noble Lords have been demanding on Granite. We also need a full review of the loan book. Amendment No. 10, tabled in my name and grouped here, is a simple one and seeks to make good on a government commitment to the recommendations laid out in the 2001 report in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, entitled <I>Holding to Account</I>. The National Audit Office&#146;s audit of public bodies provides Parliament and the public with impartial, accurate information about how public money is committed and spent, and as the Sharman report pointed out, such information contributes to accountability, transparency and public confidence.</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="080221100000236"></a>While no one is suggesting that the NAO should audit Northern Rock, there is a clear need for the Comptroller and Auditor-General to have the powers to go into such a company to appropriate evidence for its audit of the Treasury. The C&amp;AG already has the right to investigate and report on the accounts of a large number of non-governmental bodies which receive government funding. This amendment would simply add any nationalised bank and building society to that number. I hope very much that the Minister will continue to support the basic principles of the Sharman report and accept this amendment. In so doing, the Government will provide the public with the much-needed reassurance that their money is being appropriately spent on Northern Rock by the Treasury.</p>

The noble Lord said that it is a good idea to find out what you are buying. I would say that it is a good idea to find out what you are buying before you make the purchase. In these circumstances, we will find out what we are buying after we have paid the money&#151;although of course we do not know what the money is going to be. Looking at the test in the Bill, I suspect that it will be a very small sum indeed&#151;almost zero, I should think.</p>

<a name="80221-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="080221100000239"></a>Clearly it is sensible that we should have a proper audit, so I want to ask the Minister one question: was an accountant&#146;s report prepared for each of the bidders at an early stage? We had Mr Branson and various others. I find it difficult to believe that an accountant&#146;s report was not prepared which set out the assets. Was such a report produced, and if so, why can it not be made available to us?</p>

Of course I agree with the principle behind the amendments. There certainly should be clear, independent auditing arrangements in place for Northern Rock. The Government&#146;s proposal, however, is that the audit should be conducted in the normal fashion for private sector companies. We have already confirmed our intention that Northern Rock should be subject to the requirements of the Companies Acts 1985 and 2006. This will mean that the company&#146;s annual report and accounts must be independently audited by a professional firm and filed with the register of companies for public access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="080221100000241"></a>It may be helpful if I set out how we propose to apply these requirements to Northern Rock&#146;s 2007 accounts. Once the shares have been transferred, I am sure that Ron Sandler and the new board will want to consider and review whether he has an appropriate audit team in place. I can assure the Committee that the company&#146;s accounts will be published at the end of March, and I will ensure that a copy is placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="80221-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="080221100000242"></a>I contend that these are far more appropriate arrangements than the alternatives before us in the two amendments. The Government&#146;s proposal reflects our policy that the company should be run at arm&#146;s length from the Government on a normal, commercial basis to ensure that it is well placed to return to the private sector at the earliest opportunity. Neither the National Audit Office nor the Bank of England are well qualified to take on responsibility for the auditing of large and complex financial institutions. To state the obvious, the Bank of England is a central bank and not an auditing firm; its expertise lies elsewhere. Moreover, the skills and experience of the National Audit Office, and its statutory role, lie in auditing the financial statements of government departments and agencies, not a large mortgage-lending and deposit-taking institution. Independent professional auditing firms with experience of the City are surely far better placed to provide the necessary expertise and scrutiny.</p>

I reiterate that Northern Rock sold some of its assets to Granite and so it no longer belongs to Northern Rock. No new assets have been transferred to Granite since September 2007. The taxpayers&#146; exposure continues to be secured by high-quality assets that belong to Northern Rock. The whole of our consideration, therefore, has been about Northern Rock and not about Granite because nothing has transferred to Granite&#151;as I have reiterated time and again to the Committee&#151;since September 2007.</p>

I am not going into waters such as these with the noble Lord when I know his expertise. I merely reiterate the obvious fact that the Government have made it clear that Granite and Granite&#146;s assets are not part of this process with regard to law. It is separate from Northern Rock and there has been no transfer of assets since September 2007. The Government are considering Northern Rock and its assets, and they are sound.</p>

That is why necessary work was carried out on the preparation of possible legislation, as noble Lords have been quick to point out.

I know that noble Lords opposite have a fanciful notion that Northern Rock could have gone into some kind of Bank of England administration, an absolute canard on how the issue was meant to work to the benefit of anyone. Certainly it would have been a catastrophe for Northern Rock, a catastrophe for its shareholders and a catastrophe for its workforce. The Government never considered that, and are not prepared to consider it, as a realistic proposition. That is why we have taken Northern Rock into public ownership while, at the same time, being confident that there are assets in Northern Rock against which the loans from the Bank of England and the taxpayers&#146; contributions are secured.</p>

I apologise to the Minister if I had not made it clear&#151;I thought I had&#151;that we are talking not about the normal commercial audit of Northern Rock on 31 December 2007 but about a one-off event, to be followed up later, of an independent valuation of the bank on the day we buy it. That is quite a separate issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="080221113000007"></a>Listening to him, I was not clear whether he was saying that the auditors are likely to be changed for the year-end report, although I am bound to say that if they are going to be changed, that will need to happen quickly. I would have thought the existing auditors would be well advanced with their work. So that was not very clear, but then it is not the burden of the amendment. For all the reasons I have given, the amendment calls for a totally independent take-on audit to be conducted, not personally by the Bank of England, but on its behalf and on its instructions.</p>

That is quite different from kicking the tyres, going through the books and seeing properly what the quality of the mortgage book is. I am absolutely sure that the Chancellor and the Financial Services Authority are wrong, and that there are many cans of worms in Northern Rock&#146;s mortgage loan book regarding what has been granted over the past couple of years.

I understand that the clause is intended to ensure that the nationalisation of Northern Rock, or, as the Minister seemed to imply last night, any other financial institution, does not have an unintended effect on tax revenues. I understand that any steps taken under this Clause will be based on a tax analysis report which will be produced in a few months&#146; time. I wonder whether the Minister could just answer a couple of questions.</p>

Secondly, how far will the Government go to ensure that their tax revenues are not damaged by this nationalisation? The specific case that my amendment anticipates is that current shareholders in Northern Rock will potentially make a significant loss upon nationalisation. It would be natural for them to seek to offset that loss against any profit they might have made on other assets in their portfolios. Surely, the least the Government could do in these difficult circumstances is to avoid taking steps that might deny them this. I beg to move.</p>

Having said that, let me say that we have a lot of sympathy with the point that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, makes. The tax affairs of an authorised deposit taker are likely to be extremely complex. It is therefore necessary to have a broad power to deal with the tax consequences of the transfer of shares or property rights and liabilities which is very likely to give rise to various types of tax charges or losses. Given the aims of a transfer of an authorised deposit-taker under the Bill, it is important to have the power to deal with tax consequences that might arise as a result of a transfer carried out in the public interest.</p>

<a name="80221-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="080221113000022"></a>The tax provision is wide, but it must be so to deal with the complexity. As I said at the start, we take the noble Lord&#146;s point that it could deprive a former shareholder taxpayer of a right to claim a tax loss if one would arise from a transfer. I can now say that Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury would not use the power to deprive such persons from claiming the use of any tax loss that might arise from having had their shares transferred away from them. That concession, if it is one&#151;I certainly hope it is a reassurance to the Committee&#151;should give the noble Lord and the Committee the comfort that they are rightly looking for in this particular amendment.</p>

The Government should have nothing to fear from the truth, but they have chosen to shroud this whole issue in secrecy. The public does indeed have a right to know, but the Government&#146;s response is to run precisely in the opposite direction. I hope that the purpose of this

The draft order that the Government intend to make under Clause 3 contained a small clause, very near the end, exempting a nationalised Northern Rock from being affected by the Freedom of Information Act 2000. I was greatly heartened, the Minister will be alarmed to hear, by his words earlier today. He said that the Government have nothing to hide. Admittedly, he was saying that in a different context, but I just want to hear him say that again in accepting this amendment.</p>

<a name="80221-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="080221113000029"></a>I am slightly pessimistic as the Minister touched on this subject in the course of his winding-up speech late yesterday evening, when I heard him give two reasons, as indeed did the Prime Minister at Prime Minister&#146;s Questions in the other place. The first and most extraordinary argument, which I heard from both of them, is that the exemption is needed to protect commercially sensitive information about Northern Rock&#146;s business plan. Of course it would be inappropriate to release just that sort of information. Surely, however, the Minister knows as well as I do that Section 43 of the Freedom of Information Act contains three subsections. Subsection (1) exempts,</p>
<ul><a name="080221113000238"></a>&#147;information if it constitutes a trade secret&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080221113000212"></a>Subsection (2) exempts,</p>
<ul><a name="080221113000239"></a>&#147;information if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice the commercial interests of any person (including the public authority holding it)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080221113000213"></a>Subsection (3) provides that the obligation under Section 1(1)(a)&#151;to confirm or deny that the requested information is held&#151;does not arise. The Government therefore have nothing to fear so far as that is concerned. The Treasury always seeks to protect itself from private companies that attempt to use the Freedom of Information Act to gain competitive advantage. Why would Northern Rock be any different?</p>

<a name="80221-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="080221113000030"></a>The Minister also made the case that since no other bank is subject to the Act, Northern Rock should not be either. Well, to that argument I think the whole Chamber would immediately point out that no other bank is owned by the taxpayer and run by the Government. Northern Rock will be unusual among British banks in many ways. It is the very uniqueness of a nationalised Northern Rock that makes it imperative that there is sufficient transparency and accountability over its operations. Northern Rock will indeed be a special case; its directors&#146; salaries and bonuses will be paid out of taxpayers&#146; funds. That raises crucial questions of accountability. Is the Minister really saying that he does not believe that the public have, for example, a right to know how much they are paying a director to run their bank for them or how much he is being given in bonuses? It is bad enough that a serious regulatory failure has brought us to the pretty pass in which we now find ourselves.</p>

Had there been greater openness and more effective scrutiny in the first place, we would not be here today debating this extraordinary and anachronistic measure. Ministers and their proxies have sadly fallen asleep on the job once; they can hardly blame us for wanting robust systems in place to ensure that they do not do so again. I beg to move. </p>

<a name="80221-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="080221113000033"></a>The principle of the freedom of information regime is that when one has a public body, it operates under a different rule with regard to the openness with which taxpayers can approach it and find out what it is up to. Although Northern Rock is a bank rather than a government department, it is a publicly owned body&#151;or will be from tomorrow. That is the basic principle. The starting point in our mind is that it should fall into line with all the other bodies that are covered by the freedom of information legislation, not least those that operate in the commercial sector, including, for example, the Royal Mail.</p>

<a name="80221-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="080221113000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, dealt with two of the arguments that the Government have used to try to rebut proposals in this regard. He dealt comprehensively with the argument about material that is in commercial confidence. Ministers use two phrases to try to get out of holes that are of their own making: one is sub judice and the other is in commercial confidence. It is common practice in my experience for these phrases to be bandied about by Ministers who are in difficulty as a way of trying to shut down debate and to prevent information being put into the public domain or discussed. In this case, the argument about commercial confidence has been completely dealt with by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, when he talked about the trade secret exemption in the legislation.</p>

<a name="80221-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="080221113000035"></a>The other argument that Ministers have used about Northern Rock and why it is different from, for example, those other public bodies that operate commercially, is that it will go back into the private sector. Yes, it will do that, and when it does there will be legislation to enable it to do so. At that point, the application of the freedom of information legislation will no doubt be extinguished. The fact that it will go back into the private sector at some point is not, frankly, an argument for not applying the freedom of information regime to the bank when it is in the public sector. For those reasons, we support the amendment.</p>

In those circumstances, this amendment is of absolute importance. One is left wondering why on earth, uniquely, Northern Rock would want to be in a position&#151;as the noble Lord indicated, this may already apply to the Post Office, and I think that I am right in saying that it also applies to the National Savings Bank&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="080221113000039"></a>What is it about Northern Rock, other than that it will pay higher interest rates than National Savings to depositors, that makes it uniquely placed to be not covered by the freedom of information legislation?</p>

<a name="80221-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="080221113000040"></a>What is remarkable about this is that it is coming from a Government who boast about their commitment to open government and transparency. It is an extraordinary thing. Perhaps I am just getting old and cynical but I think that there must be something that the Government do not want us to know. Given the scale of the operation&#151;taking on to the Government&#146;s balance sheet &#163;100 billion of liabilities and &#163;25 billion of cash extended&#151;it is extraordinary that the Government should expect taxpayers to stump up and not get the information. I therefore support my noble friend in this amendment. I am deeply shocked that this Government of all Governments should be resisting this. Perhaps the Minister will have changed his mind; I hope so. I remember what the Prime Minister said on taking office. He talked about increasing the accountability and transparency of government. If this is an example of him delivering on that promise, it is no wonder that the electorate have begun to hold our institutions and our political process in contempt.</p>

After all, he accused me last night of saying exactly what the Prime Minister had said before. That is an accusation that I can bear with a certain degree of equanimity and I am prepared to repeat the position again today. What the Prime Minister was expressing at that time and what I hope to repeat as accurately today is the Government&#146;s carefully considered position on this matter. Of course we take freedom of information seriously.</p>

Lloyds TSB came along with a suggestion of how &#163;30 billion of public money could be made available for a particular project with which it would be involved. We did not think that that had a chance of coping with any issue with regard to state aid. As the proposition was put in those general terms, we were not able to respond positively.

He suggested that banks are exempt under Section 43 of the Act, but that is not an absolute exemption. In applying for an exemption, Northern Rock would need to balance the public interest in maintaining the exemption under Section 43 with the public interest in disclosure. Is a bank meant to be involved in this calculation of where it fits with regard to the Freedom of Information Act? Other banks do not have to, because it is automatic, but Northern Rock would have to make an assessment of what its obligations were in those terms. That would be difficult given the fact that we are seeking to ensure that this bank operates as far as possible like all other commercial banks.</p>

<a name="80221-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="080221113000046"></a>It has been suggested that, with its degree of public responsibility, this bank is in the same position as National Savings, but that is an executive agency of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is an entirely different body corporate. I want to emphasise that this bank is also meant to be in public ownership for a short period of time&#151;a temporary concept. National Savings, whatever else it is, is not meant to be in existence on the basis of the short-term relationship with government.</p>

<a name="80221-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="080221113000047"></a>The arguments underpinning the amendment do not hold up against that background. They would do if the Government were, as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, continues to suggest, bent on excessive secrecy with regard to all these relationships. We are not. We are committed to the Freedom of Information Act. We are committed to the application of the Act where it benefits the public. But some areas are excluded and our case is that Northern Rock needs to be one of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="080221113000048"></a>We want Northern Rock to run like other commercial banks: at arm's length from the Government. We want, as far as possible, business at Northern Rock to be on that basis. The bank will not perform a public function that would make it appropriate to apply the Act. This is not a matter to which the Government are determined to keep information confidential, because  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_320"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 320</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we enjoy the fact that the Freedom of Information Act will provide for the nation the necessary facts on the operation of Northern Rock. The Treasury, under its framework document, intends to develop effective plans for appropriate publication of reporting information on Northern Rock. That is the basis on which appropriate public scrutiny of Northern Rock can be made. The Treasury is governed by the Freedom of Information Act and will be obliged to make this information public. That is why I deny the concept that the noble Lord is putting forward: that somehow the Government are being excessively secretive about these arrangements.</p>

<a name="80221-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="080221113000049"></a>Maintaining commercial disciplines in Northern Rock and ensuring continuity of business are absolutely critical. If we are to maintain the prospect that this bank will be returned to the private sector as soon as possible, it is vital that we do not apply inappropriate public sector requirements which do not obtain to other commercial banks. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, was dismissive about commercial confidence, but there are good reasons why commercial banks have an exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. That was accepted by both Houses when it was debated. Commercial confidence is not a get-out phrase: it is a real issue with regard to the operation of the bank.</p>

<a name="80221-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="080221113000050"></a>I am not against the principle behind the amendment, but the amendment is unnecessary. The Treasury is a public authority subject to the Freedom of Information Act. The Treasury's relations with Northern Rock as shareholder and lender will be in the public domain. There will be opportunities on later amendments for me to dwell on this, but I have already mentioned the process by which the Treasury intends to make these relationships explicit and how it reports to both Houses of Parliament. As I indicated, that is what we intend to do with certain crucial formative aspects with regard to Northern Rock.</p>

<a name="80221-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="080221113000051"></a>The objectives of the Freedom of Information Act can be met by request to the Treasury about its relationship with Northern Rock. The Treasury would need to consider applications under the Freedom of Information Act in the normal way, including the application of exemptions. But the Treasury continually faces that position. The Treasury is part of a Government committed to open information, supported and promoted by the Freedom of Information Act. I am not saying that the noble Lord&#146;s intention is not benign or helpful, but that the amendments are unnecessary because the Government intend to fulfil the requirements of openness in the proposals that we make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="080221113000057"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 9 seeks to address a major flaw that was picked up by many of your Lordships yesterday during Second Reading, and was widely covered in the press this morning. As a nationalised bank, Northern Rock will, among many other things, have access to significantly cheaper money than its competitors, and so will be able to offer better terms to customers. This unfair practice would, of course, be damaging to the operation of the whole British banking sector.</p>

<a name="80221-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="080221113000058"></a>The Minister may tell me in his response that even without this amendment the Competition Commission or the EU state aid rules will be a sufficient check on such damaging behaviour. However, we are concerned about the Competition Commission&#146;s powers over state-owned companies. Furthermore, I cannot accept that a far off and extremely broad brush set of criteria in Brussels is an adequate substitute to a nationally recognised and respected body whose remit is exactly suited to maintaining a watching brief over a nationalised Northern Rock and the impact it will have on the wider banking sector. So my amendment seeks also to give the OFT the duty to report to Parliament, not only when it identifies an adverse effect but also annually

There has been a lot of discussion about the extent to which Northern Rock, if it were anything other than in a rapid run-down situation, would be able to operate in a non-competitive manner on the back of the government guarantees. While there have been various assurances from Ministers that that would not be the case it does seem to us, both in terms of the rest of the banking sector and the country more generally, that we need to have some assurance that this is not happening. The good thing about this amendment is that, if passed and approved, it means that the Northern Rock management would know that the OFT is on their case all the time. In this respect it will be interesting to see whether the OFT is more successful than the FSA has been in the past. But this is its area of expertise and one would expect that it would. Therefore, we support the amendment.</p>

The problem for the Committee is that we have to work from the phrase &#147;business as usual&#148;. We are not working from a phrase whereby Northern Rock is being wound down, where one could perhaps be more assured, but from the phrase &#147;business as usual&#148;. Further, we learnt as of yesterday that Mr Sandler is thinking about employing McKinsey. McKinsey is noted for several things, not least of which is its marketing. Since Sandler himself clearly does not have any real expertise in that world, I am quite sure that he will bring in consultants on the marketing front. So we do need some safeguards.</p>

<a name="80221-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="080221113000062"></a>If it is a case of business as usual, one of the areas that the Rock will have to look at is how it gets more direct deposits. A building society works on how much it can attract in as deposits and therefore how much it can lend. That does not apply to a bank. However, if I were the chief executive of Northern Rock, given the circumstances it is now in, and I was told it was business as usual, I would want to attract deposits. I have not checked today but as of yesterday Northern Rock was offering the most attractive cash ISA in the whole of the United Kingdom. I refer to the interest rate, let alone the fact it was guaranteed by the Government. It was also offering the most attractive deposit account, let alone given the government guarantee. It is wrong that that should continue. The only way we seem to be able to track what will happen at the moment is if somebody audits this. In my judgment it is not acceptable that the Competition Commission should do it. Its track record is not good and the pace at which it works is too slow. Certainly, we cannot leave this matter to Europe. That is why I believe this amendment should be supported.</p>

Here we have Britain&#146;s wonderful, internationally competitive, innovative banking sector up against an old-fashioned dinosaur nationalised industry with a badly tarnished brand image. How can anyone fail to compete with that?</p>

<a name="80221-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="080221113000064"></a>The argument just put by the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, seems to me to reinforce this point. Despite the government guarantees, Northern Rock is having to offer higher interest rates than anybody else in the market just to get the money coming in to it. So it seems to me that these fears are mostly a chimera which should be swept aside at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="080221113000065"></a><b><a name="80221-0009.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="080221113001187"></a>Lord Baker of Dorking:</b> I consider that comment rather naïve. It is able to offer the most attractive interest rates in the market only because it has two unique guarantees&#151;one to depositors and one on any bonds that may be issued. No other lending institution in the country has that degree of security. It is very important that there should be a level playing field. My noble friend referred to what the Rock was offering compared with competitors. I believe that this morning it was still offering mortgages at 125 per cent of the value of a property. Therefore, if the property is worth &#163;100,000, it will offer &#163;125,000. If the property is worth &#163;1 million, it will offer &#163;1.25 million. Yesterday, Alliance and Leicester and Abbey National both withdrew their 125 per cent mortgages. In fact, one went further and said that it was thinking of withdrawing its 100 per cent mortgages. But with a bank that has a total and complete guarantee, it can go on doing that. Does not the Minister agree that it is improvident for a bank to be taken into public ownership still to be offering 125 per cent mortgages? Does he approve of that?</p>

<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="080221113000066"></a><b><a name="80221-0009.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080221113001188"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> On the issue that has just been raised, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Baker, and, indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, forget that the banking sector in the UK is supported and underwritten by the lender of last resort&#151;the facilities of the Bank of England&#151;and by the fact that major banks in this country are deemed too big to fail. Therefore, the competitive advantage derived by Northern Rock is much smaller than has been suggested by the exaggerated claims that we have heard from Members on the other side of the Committee. That is one reason why this amendment is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="80221-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="080221113000067"></a>The other reason why it is unnecessary is that we have competent competition authorities in the OFT and in the European authorities who will be observing what is done in the UK banking sector and will operate according to their normal procedures. There is no need to gold-plate those procedures in the way that seems to be proposed here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="080221113000068"></a>However, there is one issue that the Official Opposition could helpfully address. When Johnson Matthey was nationalised by the Conservative Government in 1984, it was exempted from taxation, thus acquiring a remarkable competitive advantage over all the firms with which it then subsequently competed in the 10 years that it remained in public ownership. Perhaps

I happily agree with him that if we were dealing with the same circumstances, the same terms would apply to Northern Rock as applied to Johnson Matthey. But Johnson Matthey was being run down. It was not continuing to trade on a business as usual basis in the market. I would have thought that the noble Lord would have known that. I am sure that he would not want to give an incorrect impression in making that comparison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="080221113000070"></a>I very much support the amendment. Now that we have a change of Minister, perhaps I can ask him the question that his noble friend had begun to answer. This is a useful opportunity to do so. The noble Baroness, Lady Kingsmill, is not in her place, but yesterday she assured us that we had nothing to worry about because the European Union and the regulators would deal with these matters. If we can rely on the regulators to deal with these matters, why is it that Northern Rock is continuing to provide the very high deposit rates which my noble friend Lord Naseby referred to? It already has a competitive advantage, because the Government have guaranteed the deposits up to any limit. Were it not for the fact that we are parti pris, I would suggest to noble Lords that they should put their money into Northern Rock, because it has an absolute guarantee and it has a very high rate of interest. The Government should be worried about unfair competition, because they are competing with gilts&#151;they are competing with the Government&#146;s own gilt market. The Government are providing the same guarantee that applies to gilts. On gilts you can get something like 4.5 per cent, but go on to the Northern Rock website and you can sign up to an account for 6.5 per cent. The Government are competing unfairly not only with the market but with themselves.</p>

<a name="80221-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="080221113000071"></a>I do not want to talk for too long about this. However, could the Minister tell us what the European Union thinks about these competition issues? It has done nothing about what has happened so far. Can he help us with the criteria that will apply to the business plan? I also return to the question, which I still hope will be answered, of why the Government turned down the opportunity for Lloyds TSB to take on Northern Rock back in September. The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, gave me an answer in a previous debate; he said it was obvious that the Lloyds TSB offer had to be rejected because it would never have got past Europe. That offer was to borrow &#163;30 billion over two years on commercial terms and for it to be a fall-back facility. That is considerably less damaging an anti-competitive provision than was being suggested by Branson or by any of the other bids.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="080221113000072"></a>Can the Minister explain why Europe would not agree to that but is prepared to agree to this, which is a whole quantum leap of additional competitive threat to the existing private sector operators in the

We need to have clarity on where the Government believe that the competition rules will apply and on what the European Union&#146;s view is. In the absence of that clarity&#151;which I do not expect to get even with a new Minister&#151;the importance of this proposed new clause is paramount, and I very much support it.</p>

<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="080221113000073"></a><b><a name="80221-0009.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="080221113001190"></a>Lord Bach:</b> The amendment seeks assurances that Northern Rock will not be able to compete unfairly with other banks in the retail, savings and banking market. In responding to this short but interesting and important debate, I propose to do two things. First, I hope to reassure noble Lords that this will not be so and that we will not approve a business plan that does so. Secondly, I will address the specific proposal made in the amendment that would require the Office of Fair Trading to produce an annual report and to notify Parliament if it identifies any problems.</p>

<a name="80221-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="080221113000074"></a>I will attempt to assure the Committee that there will be no adverse competition impacts. As explained elsewhere, the bank is in receipt of public support and aid is subject to EU state aid restrictions. Clearly, the interpretation of those laws is a matter for the Commission, but we would be extremely surprised if the Commission interpreted those rules in such a way as to allow a bank to expand its business aggressively on the back of public support. The requirement for prior approval of the European Commission and the Commission&#146;s ability to hold Northern Rock to conditions imposed on approval is, we argue, an important and reasonable constraint on Northern Rock&#146;s business plan.</p>

<a name="80221-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="080221113000075"></a>As has already been said, we intend to submit a restructuring plan to the Commission by 17 March. This will need to reassure the Commission that Northern Rock does not abuse its position. Moreover, like any other company, Northern Rock will be subject to UK competition law in the normal way, including the Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise Act. That also provides an important check on Northern Rock&#146;s business model. I want to reassure the Committee that my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked officials to have urgent meetings and discussions with the British Bankers&#146; Association, the Building Societies Association and others, to reassure them of the position.</p>

<a name="80221-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="080221113000076"></a>Even if all that was not the case, let me attempt to offer three further points of what I hope will be reassurance to the Committee. First, Ron Sandler, the executive chairman, has already made it clear that he is acutely conscious of competition issues and has no intention of running the bank in a way that abuses its present temporary state ownership. Secondly, the clear strategic aim which the Government have set for the management is to move the bank off all forms of government support, including government guarantees, as soon as possible. The bank&#146;s business plan, which must be agreed with the Government, needs to be directed at that aim. A business plan that was built on abusing the present temporary government support, which in turn reflects the present distorted state of financial markets, would clearly not be consistent with

<a name="80221-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="080221113000077"></a>Thirdly, let me attempt to reassure the Committee on how the financing of Northern Rock will operate. At present, Northern Rock is subject to the same interest rate premium arrangements and is paying for government guarantees in precisely the same way as Northern Rock paid for those facilities in the private sector. It has not had overnight access to some different source of financing. In future, financing arrangements and fee arrangements for guarantees will need to be put in place that are consistent with the business plan and the requirements of the EU. It is too early to speculate sensibly on what those will be, but clearly we expect to be able to demonstrate both to competitors and to the European Union that the bank is operating in a way that does not distort the market.</p>

<a name="80221-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="080221113000078"></a>I have spent a little time attempting to explain to the Committee the safeguards that we have put in place. Let me move on to the amendment. It would, where an institution has been the subject of a transfer order under Clauses 3 and 6, require the Office of Fair Trading to conduct an annual report on the impact on competitiveness and, secondly, a report to Parliament as soon as it identifies a significant adverse impact on competition as a result. Largely for the reasons that I have already stated, we do not think that such an amendment is necessary, but again in an attempt to reassure the Committee, I will say that the Office of Fair Trading is an effective watchdog that oversees competitiveness in UK markets. It has wide powers, including powers to investigate whether any market in the UK is distorted by unfair competition. It does not need specific new powers to report on the competitiveness of the banking market; it can do so in any event. My officials have spoken to the Office of Fair Trading, and I can now say to the Committee that it has proposed that it will publish an annual report assessing any competitive implications of Northern Rock&#146;s business on the banking market.</p>

The OFT will not in the first instance stop any abuse. That is why I have tried to explain to the Committee the various courses that we have taken. When the OFT reports&#151;I cannot give the Committee a date on which it would, as that is a matter for the OFT&#151;it would point out any abuses and by doing so make sure that they would not occur again. I am telling the Committee that the noble Lord&#146;s noble friend on the Front Bench is proposing something with which we largely agree.</p>

It is far from unusual for lenders to offer products of this nature and the lender well understands the risks it is taking on. These mortgage products are offered on a commercial basis to individuals with appropriate credit ratings, as is standard practice across the industry. It is worth noting that Northern Rock&#146;s problems have not arisen as a result of lending at high multiples; its problems have been around raising liquidity in what have turned out to be extremely difficult financial circumstances. That is all that I want to say on the 125 per cent mortgages.</p>

However, anyone who studies the financial press, particularly at weekends, would spend the whole of the following week trying to decide which offers for savings were competitive and which were not. This matter is well beyond interest rates&#151;people are being offered insurance, interest rates that include bonuses or rates that stop when your balance reaches &#163;2,500. It would require a genius to determine which products were competitive and which were not. In those circumstances, I do not see how the Office of Fair Trading could sensibly, on a daily, weekly or monthly basis, produce something that would be helpful to anyone. If we could deal with this matter broadly along the lines of National Savings, the answer is already there.</p>

I really do not think that it is the role of this House or the Government to attempt to micromanage what Northern Rock does. I had understood that the Official Opposition were very much in favour of the bank being managed at arm&#146;s length. If so, surely they should not be second-guessing what particular products or behaviour the bank displays. They should accept the commitment made by my noble friend on the Front Bench that the OFT will report regularly on the impact of Northern Rock&#146;s activities on competition in the banking industry. The OFT is an organisation that has the skills and will have the detailed information to assess the impact on competition. We are just cherry-picking here; we are not being serious. We are just making arbitrary arguments, not doing the detailed investigation and careful study of the facts that the OFT will be able to do.</p>

The only such enactments that we would want to apply would be certain provisions of insolvency law, but this is now dealt with by the additional reference to Sections 90 and 90A of and Schedules 15 and 15A to the Building Societies Act 1986, which deal with the application of insolvency legislation to building societies.</p>

Section 24 of the 1985 Act requires a public company limited by its shares, such as Northern Rock, to have at least two members and imposes unlimited liability on its shareholders and other persons in certain circumstances for breach of that provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="080221113000117"></a>There will be only one member of Northern Rock after its transfer; namely, the Treasury Solicitor. It clearly is not in the interests of taxpayers for unlimited liability to accrue to him. This power is also to be exercised to exclude Ministers, the Treasury and the Bank of England from the application of shadow directorship provisions in the Companies Acts, the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. There are precedents for that in Schedule 2(15) to the Commonwealth Development Corporation Act 1999 and other Acts. It is not feasible to provide narrower powers simply because it is not possible to foresee all the circumstances in which the Bill&#146;s different transfer powers might be used. I emphasise that the use of the powers is subject to parliamentary scrutiny and the Government would expect to explain their use of such powers in the customary way.</p>

Again, these amendments deal with issues raised by the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. In my earlier contribution, it was remiss of me not to thank the chairman and the committee members for the very assiduous work which they discharged at very short notice to the great advantage of the House. We very much applaud that work. At Second Reading, I said that the Government would take the committee&#146;s recommendations seriously. Its thoughtful scrutiny of delegated powers provides an important resource for this House and, I might add, for the other place where its views are equally rightly respected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="080221113000126"></a>I have tabled Amendments Nos. 16 and 18 in response to the committee&#146;s important recommendations and one of the most important issues. They provide for the orders under the Bill which concerns compensation in Clauses 5, 7 and 8(6) and the use of the Bill&#146;s powers in relation to a building society in Clause 11 should be made under the draft affirmative procedure. We have responded to the committee&#146;s recommendations through other amendments that narrowed the scope of the power in Clause 7 in the manner advised in the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="080221113000127"></a>Amendments Nos. 17 and 19 seek to go further, ensuring that all orders made under the Bill are subject to the affirmative procedure. That builds on the committee&#146;s report, which also advises that transfer orders under Clauses 3 and 6 together with orders under Clause 4 and 12 switching off subscription rights and consequential and supplementary provisions should be made under the draft affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="80221-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="080221113000128"></a>We considered that argument carefully. We understand the concerns expressed about the scope and significance of the powers set out in the clauses. We have also considered carefully what the committee said about the speed with which, should the occasion warrant it, a draft affirmative order can be passed, and about the certainty such approval can bring. We have also noted the possibility of a dehybridisation provision and the possibility of an urgency procedure whereby in urgent cases an order can be made subject to confirmation later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="080221113000129"></a>In the kind of grave and exceptional circumstances where the powers may be exercised in the future, carefully circumscribed in Clause 2&#151;a recurring theme of my comments from this Dispatch Box is the significance of Clause 2 and the circumscription on the powers reflected in the clause&#151;we would be faced with a serious threat to the stability of the financial system. Let us be clear: a failing bank or building society collapse would create systemic damage to other financial institutions and the UK financial system before there would be any question at all of these powers being used.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="080221113000130"></a>We may be faced with this problem at a weekend, in the middle of August or at any time when the House is not sitting. Something may need to be done before markets open the next day and queues form at branches. I have heard it argued on several occasions that other emergency provisions have not sought the exemption that we are seeking today. There is a difference in the industry that we are considering with regard to the legislation. The Committee recognises the significance of confidence in the banking system. Maintenance of financial confidence is of the greatest significance. That is why we have to conceive of action in circumstances such as an emergency is one where we need to act before others in the markets are able to take account of a developing crisis.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="080221113000131"></a>I realise that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not fully endorse that argument and I find some difficulty in disagreeing with its position. And I accept its proposition in every other set of circumstances that I can think of. But these powers in Clause 2, which are at the absolute  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_338"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 338</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>heart of the Bill, are all about responding to an issue of the greatest financial crisis and the necessity for action prior to markets being able to respond. We may need to complete the transfer of the whole bank to another institution because it is sound and able to absorb the troubled bank, or transfer the deposit book to a sound bank. If we could do so only after the draft order had been debated and approved by both Houses, the damage to the financial system could already have been done.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="080221113000132"></a>I hope that the Committee will not consider me to be overly dramatic about this issue, but I am obliged to emphasise the difference between the particular circumstances of the industry which is the subject of this regulation and any other. We saw with Northern Rock last September how quickly events can unfold. The matter would be especially acute if the problem were to arise in the Recess. To recall Parliament is no answer as that would only heighten the drama and increase the level of the crisis. Enabling an order to be made immediately, subject to later confirmation by resolution of both Houses, is not an answer to this point. In the case of a transfer of the deposit book, how would depositors have any certainty that their money would remain with the new sound bank rather than being sent back to the failing one? The answer is that they would not. They would want to withdraw their money to a safer haven, and we would have another run. I put it to the Committee that we cannot contemplate that.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="080221113000133"></a>It is because we are dealing with banks and building societies, not something like British Leyland, that we are doing this. We all recall the implications for the British economy as a result of the significant problems at British Leyland, as well as the challenges for the workforce and the community where it was located. I do not decry the significance of British Leyland, but I want to emphasise how very different this legislation is, dealing as it does with banks and building societies. That is why we think it is right for this Bill to use what would otherwise not be appropriate. We ask noble Lords, in considering the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, to balance the clear legal concerns which have been expressed against the real issue of financial stability which is at the heart of this Bill, and the particular importance of confidence as much as legal certainty to the sound operation of the banking system.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="080221113000134"></a>We continue to maintain our respect for the committee, and of course we have sought to respond as positively as we can in other areas of its work, but I hope it will be understood that in this particular respect, the Government must dissent from the recommendations of its report. Given that, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able not to press his amendments when the time comes, and instead will support the government amendments. I beg to move.</p>

Hurrah! This is coming to an end!&#148;. I am sure that the points he has made are very important but perhaps he could help me with one particular point, and then on another one.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="080221113000137"></a>Before I come on to the particular point, perhaps I may explain yet again that some of us, of whom I am one, feel that this ought to be a hybrid Bill, because it is dealing in effect with one bank as opposed to all the others. I know that the Government and the noble Lord do not want it to be a hybrid Bill, because that would take up so much time, but as he will realise, the purpose of hybridity is fairness, so that people can have their counsel, put their case, and have it considered. By not making it a hybrid Bill one is deliberately removing fairness. I understand why the Government have done that. We all know that the Bill refers to Northern Rock. But it does so with this caveat that it could refer to anything over the next 12 months.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="080221113000138"></a>I am surprised that Amendment No. 16 seeks to insert new subsection (2B) into Clause 13. The subsection states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="080221113000235"></a>&#147;If a statutory instrument to which subsection (2A) applies would, apart from this subsection, be treated as a hybrid instrument for the purposes of the Standing Orders of either House of Parliament, it is to proceed in that House as if it were not such an instrument&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080221113000217"></a>In other words, if the colour appears white, you pretend it is not white and say it is black. It appears to me that this is conscious and deliberate reasoning by the Government to say, &#147;We do not want hybridity to be part of this. If anyone sees the possibility of hybridity coming up, just tell them that it is not because we have to go on as if it is not hybrid&#148;. I question whether that is a good thing for Governments to put into Bills. Perhaps the noble Lord will explain why that is done.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="080221113000139"></a>My next question is of much less concern. In explaining what the amendment is about, the Minister said that it is necessary because action might have to be taken on &#147;certain urgent occasions&#148;. Is that in case something goes wrong in another bank in the next 12 months&#151;another urgent occasion when the Bill&#146;s facilities need to be used? Or is it referring to Northern Rock, in relation to which another order or statutory instrument might need to be laid in the next few months? I would be grateful if the Minister can explain.</p>

On major issues in secondary legislation, I agree that one should as a general principle proceed by affirmative resolution. However, this is a very particular situation. One of the main arguments for going for an affirmative as opposed to negative  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_340"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 340</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>resolution is to give Parliament time to think and to debate the issues. We have been thinking about and debating this issue for much longer this week than we ever would if we were simply considering secondary legislation introduced under the affirmative resolution procedure. Therefore, in the narrow case of Northern Rock, is there any advantage to Parliament, or to any of us as individuals, in having a debate on an affirmative resolution, which we could not amend, as opposed to the debates that we have been having this week? Is there or is there not an advantage for Northern Rock and for broader stability in resolving this matter very speedily indeed?</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="080221113000141"></a>In this case, on balance and somewhat reluctantly, I accept the argument that a negative resolution which enables us to get to the end-point on Northern Rock at the earliest possible moment is desirable. Heaven knows, most of those who have spoken have said that one of the major arguments against the Government&#146;s handling of the case has been their dilatoriness rather than their moving too swiftly.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="080221113000142"></a>As for any future circumstance, the likelihood of finding ourselves needing to go through this procedure again during the operation of the Bill is very limited and very unlikely. As discussed earlier, it is useful to have this guarantee&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Desai, described it&#151;on the statute book, but we do not expect to use it. The Minister talked about what happens if we find ourselves unexpectedly requiring to use it in the depths of August. August, incidentally, is a peculiarly unfortunate month. If you plotted the history of great British economic disasters against calendar months, there would be a huge peak in August. That is undoubtedly the case, and no doubt there is a PhD in it. If we find ourselves, in the first week of August or at any point in that month, with a bank or building society unexpectedly in real difficulties, there will be a significant advantage in being able to move quickly without recalling Parliament. For those reasons we support the Government on this group of amendments.</p>

It is all the more worrying that the Government are resisting the control of transfer orders in Clauses 3, 4 and 6. Even the Minister gracefully admitted that he had some difficulty with that.

<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_341"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 341</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the necessary emergency provisions for the nationalisation of Northern Rock would pass through Parliament by the end of this week and we have now considered the Bill for three consecutive days in both Houses. We on these Benches and our honourable friends down the other end are quite happy to consider it again tomorrow, if necessary, to fulfil that commitment. However, what we have rushed through Parliament has been something completely different. We would almost be justified in rejecting the Bill outright, so far is it from what we were expecting. I hope the Minister and his colleagues in another place will acknowledge that at no point have we threatened to do so, nor have we taken anything other than a genuinely constructive approach to the proceedings.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="080221113000146"></a>These proceedings have been successful in a rather sad way, in that they have finally teased out of the Government their admission that the Bill is not just about Northern Rock but about the whole of the next year, a year in which they are clearly anticipating yet more instability and more crises in the financial sector. I state again, as I stated last night, that it is right and proper that Parliament should be involved in any future decision to nationalise another financial institution. The Government&#146;s claim that they need to be able to instigate another nationalisation on the sly and the provisions that make that possible are far more damaging to the public confidence in our financial sector than any possible parliamentary involvement.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="080221113000147"></a>I accept that a normal affirmative resolution procedure may in some cases be too lengthy; however, the DPRRC has, in its customary thorough way, given a perfectly adequate alternative. We will be tabling amendments on Report to put the order-making powers in Clauses 3, 4 and 6 under the same sort of procedure as was implemented in the Northern Ireland Act 2000. That will allow the Chancellor, when he considers it expedient, immediately to make an order overriding the usual draft affirmative procedures, which would remain the default option.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="080221113000148"></a>The Minister will no doubt tell us that even this slight involvement of Parliament will make it impossible for the Government to effectively resolve a looming crisis. Is he also telling us that, if the Government had had the powers in the Bill last summer, Northern Rock would have been handled differently?</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="080221113000149"></a>I have made my position clear. We will return to this issue on Report in the hope that the Government will finally acknowledge that either they are creating a man of straw in order to demand a big stick with which to beat it or they are cynically exploiting Northern Rock in order to grab exceptional powers on the sly.</p>

If there is one thing of which the Government cannot be accused, it is enthusiasm for nationalising the banking and building society structures.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="080221113000151"></a>As I have said on numerous occasions, the Bill&#146;s provisions obtain for only 12 months to bridge the gap between the current position, where we have inadequate legislation to respond to potential emergencies&#151;and I cannot emphasise enough that we are talking about emergencies&#151;and the ability to take necessarily drastic and dramatic action to meet a threat to the financial system, such as a potential run on a bank or building society and the destabilisation of the financial markets.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="080221113000152"></a>That is the nature of the emergency addressed in the Bill. The Government do not intend to act when, as we all fervently hope and expect, such an emergency does not materialise in the next 12 months. But how imprudent would it be if we had nothing in place? The reason for the Bill&#146;s temporary nature is that, after the 12 months, after the fullest consultation with the banking and financial sector and all other interested parties, and after the most intensive debate in the other place and undoubtedly in this place too, we are planning to produce a reform of the banking and financial system later in the year. But we presently have a gap in dealing with any potential emergency. We do not foresee using the provisions, but the nature of emergencies is that they cannot be foreseen. Equally, however, it is prudent to be able to cope if an emergency materialises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="080221113000153"></a>As the Committee will recognise, the international financial market is disturbed and troubled. That is why all serious actors on the world stage are bending themselves in taking action to protect the world&#146;s financial structures as best they can and to improve the position over the coming months. It is a challenge that all of us face internationally. It is a challenge that states also face nationally. This is the British Government&#146;s proper response to an emergency that has already occurred with Northern Rock. We are merely being prudent in making provision for our ability to cope, if in fact such an emergency materialises. That is the basis of the Bill. It is why we are saying on this occasion that, if an emergency did occur, it would be different from any other kind of emergency to which the Delegated Powers Committee referred or legislation on which it contributed&#151;because of the sheer shortage of time in which a Government could act.</p>

<a name="80221-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="080221113000154"></a>I recognise the consistency of the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, in arguing that the Bill should have been conceived of in entirely different terms&#151;that it should have applied only to Northern Rock and been a hybrid measure. If so, our solution to Northern Rock would have related to the somewhat distant future and we could not have dealt with the issue promptly now. In addition, such a Bill would contain no provisions about how to cope with troublesome times if an emergency occurred. We do not anticipate that one will&#151;we cannot foresee any emergency&#151;because, like the rest of the Committee and the rest of the country, we expect this country to get through these troubled times successfully. However, we would be exceedingly imprudent if, given the necessity of

He will recognise that we need to make orders with regard to one institution; namely, Northern Rock. The Bill is a general Bill with powers that go beyond the issue of Northern Rock, but we will have to act on the issue of Northern Rock. In moving such orders, we must avoid falling into the trap of hybridity. As has been indicated, that involves a range of difficulties. That is why the clause is expressed in the way that it is; it is not because of deceit but because of the need to enable a general Bill to deal with a specific problem. We all know that a great deal of this general Bill is about the specific problem of Northern Rock.</p>

The Minister has insisted that the purpose of these powers is limited to some unforeseen although not perhaps unforeseeable emergency during the lifetime of the Bill within the sunset clause. The request that I am about to make comes from the decision that the Law Lords can have regard to what has happened in Parliament when determining the proper purpose of the Bill. In the light of that, is he prepared to give an express undertaking on behalf of the Government that these powers will not be used, save in the circumstances that he has envisaged time and again today and yesterday? He may not be able to give that express undertaking at the moment, but will he secure it at some later stage of the Bill?</p>

I know that we have been talking about the particular part of a potential order, but if the Committee does not mind I will refrain from trying to produce the multisyllabic word that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, used with such facility. We are proceeding with the order on the basis of past precedent and the Government will need to make orders with regard to Northern Rock.</p>

I asked the question in respect of hybridity because the Minister is on record as saying that we are introducing this Bill with these wide powers in order to avoid the problem of hybridity. If Pepper v Hart applies to considerations of hybridity, and if I wanted to argue that the Bill was hybrid, I would point out that the Minister had told Parliament that he had made it this way in order to get round the problems of hybridity. That is rather like setting up tax-avoidance schemes with the express purpose of avoiding tax&#151;something the Revenue tends to take as not being valid.</p>

They are general because they apply to any conceivable institution in the event of an emergency which we do not anticipate and can therefore in no way, shape or form identify but merely make prudential legislation for. Secondly, there are the issues raised by Northern Rock. But because the Bill has these general objectives it is certainly not hybrid.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>
&#147;On 12 December 2005, in response to a Parliamentary Question from the right honourable Member for North East Fife, the then Foreign Secretary, my right honourable friend the Member for Blackburn, updated the House on the subject of terrorist suspects (renditions) stating that:<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="080221113000254"></a>&#147;Careful research by officials has been unable to identify any occasion since 11 September 2001, or earlier in the Bush administration, when we received a request for permission by the United States for a rendition through UK territory or airspace, nor are we otherwise aware of such a case&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 12/12/05; col. 1652W.]</p>
</ul>&#147;This was supplemented by two further Statements in January 2006, and a subsequent letter of 6 February 2006 to the right honourable Member for Richmond.&#147;In March 2007, the then Prime Minister Tony Blair gave an assurance to the Intelligence and Security Committee that he was satisfied that the US had at no time since 9/11 rendered an individual through the UK or our Overseas Territories. In its report on rendition, the ISC said:<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="080221113000256"></a>&#147;We are satisfied that there is no evidence that US rendition flights have used UK airspace (except the two cases in 1998 referred to earlier in this report) and that there is no evidence of them having landed at UK military airfields&#148;.</p>
</ul>&#147;The Government welcomed these conclusions in their response to the report published in July 2007. Parliamentary Answers, interviews and letters followed this evidence.&#147;I am very sorry indeed to have to report to the House the need to correct these and other statements on the subject, on the basis of new information passed to officials on 15 February 2008 by the US Government.  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_347"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 347</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;Contrary to earlier explicit assurances that Diego Garcia had not been used for rendition flights, recent US investigations have now revealed two occasions, both in 2002, when this had in fact occurred. An error in the earlier US records search meant that these cases did not come to light. In both cases a US plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the US facility in Diego Garcia. The detainees did not leave the plane, and the US Government have assured us that no US detainees have ever been held on Diego Garcia. US investigations show no record of any other rendition through Diego Garcia or any other Overseas Territory or through the UK itself since then.&#147;Yesterday US and UK legal teams discussed the issue, and I spoke myself with Secretary Rice. We both agree that the mistakes made in these two cases are not acceptable, and she shares my deep regret that this information has only just come to light. She emphasised to me that the US Government came to us with this information quickly after they discovered it.&#147;The House and the Government will share deep disappointment at this news, and about its late emergence. That disappointment is shared by our US allies. They recognise the absolute imperative for the British Government to provide accurate information to Parliament. I reaffirm the Government&#146;s commitment to that imperative today. We fully accept that the US gave us its earlier assurances in good faith. We accepted those assurances, and indeed referred to them publicly, also in good faith.&#147;For the avoidance of doubt, I have asked my officials to compile a list of all the flights where we have been alerted to concerns regarding rendition through the UK or our Overseas Territories. Once this is ready we will be sending this list to the US and seeking its specific assurance that none of these flights was used for rendition purposes.&#147;Our counterterrorism relationship with the United States is vital to UK security. I am absolutely clear that there must and will continue to be the strongest possible intelligence and counterterrorism relationship with the US, consistent with UK law and our international obligations. As part of our close co-operation, there has long been a regular exchange with the US authorities, in which we have set out: first, that we expect them to seek permission to render detainees via UK territory and airspace, including Overseas Territories; secondly, that we will grant that permission only if we are satisfied that the rendition would accord with UK law and our international obligations; and, thirdly, how we understand our obligations under the UN Convention Against Torture.&#147;Secretary Rice has underlined to me the firm US understanding that there will be no rendition through the UK, UK airspace or Overseas Territories without express British Government permission. &#147;The House will want to know what has become of the two individuals in question. There is a limit to what I can say, but I can tell the House the following: the US Government have told us that

One is currently in Guantanamo Bay, and the other has been released. The House will know that the British Government&#146;s long-standing position is that the detention facility at Guantanamo should be closed.&#147;My officials and their US counterparts continue to work through all the details and implications of this information. We will keep procedures under review to ensure that they meet the standards we have set. I will, of course, keep the House updated&#148;.

I echo what my right honourable friend the shadow Foreign Secretary said, which was that, in coming to the House to inform us of this new information quickly after it had come to light, the Government acted very properly.</p>

<a name="80221-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="080221113000190"></a>As the Minister recognised, this information will cause widespread concern, owing to the categorical nature of the assurances given by the Government previously. The assurances given in another place by the then Foreign Secretary, the right honourable Mr Jack Straw, to the right honourable Sir Menzies Campbell and to my colleague the shadow Foreign Secretary, and by Mr Blair to the Intelligence and Security Committee, have proved to be false, albeit that they were given in good faith. More worrying still, this means that the specific assurances about the use of facilities at Diego Garcia given in a series of Answers to Questions from my noble friend Lord Ashcroft turned out to be false. In July last year, the Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="080221113000237"></a>&#147;The US authorities have repeatedly given us assurances that no terrorist suspects have been, or are being, held on Diego Garcia, or at any time have passed in transit through Diego Garcia or its territorial waters or airspace&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/7/07; col. <I>WA</I><I></I><I>2</I><I>4</I>.]</p>

<a name="80221-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="080221113000191"></a>It is of course much better that this new information is revealed now than that it continues to be concealed, but it raises a number of serious questions, which I will list. How confident are the Government that further cases of this nature will not come to light? How exhaustive has the checking of records by the US now been? Can the Minister say any more about exactly how this omission occurred and whether the US has made any administrative changes to ensure that any other cases will now come to light?</p>

<a name="80221-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="080221113000192"></a>The noble Lord said that the Government will now compile a list of all previous flights that have alerted concerns and will pursue them with the US authorities. From this side of the House, I can say that we strongly approve. We hope that in compiling the list the Government will take account of the investigations undertaken by a number of outside organisations, such as Liberty, of possible cases of extraordinary rendition. These cases, of course, include not just flights transiting the Indian Ocean but also the use of UK domestic airspace. The rumours abound and need to be quieted. On these Benches, we trust that, whatever  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_349"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 349</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the outcome of their investigations, which we hope will be conducted as speedily as is consistent with thoroughness, the Government will report fully to the House. The investigation conducted last June by the Association of Chief Police Officers on behalf of the Government, which resulted in a nil return, was evidently not exhaustive.</p>

<a name="80221-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="080221113000193"></a>Will the Government also impress on the US Administration the importance of ensuring that all agencies of the US Government, not just the State Department, understand the importance of respecting the rules that the Minister has reiterated relating to UK law and practice? Can he assure the House that, if any further concerns are raised, he will pursue them immediately with the US on a systematic basis, rather than as a one-off exercise?</p>

<a name="80221-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="080221113000194"></a>In the light of what has happened, does the Minister expect procedures for the future to be tightened up or reinforced in any way? Again, this might involve changes in internal procedures in the US so that the British Government can be confident that the American Administration would indeed make a formal request, when appropriate, for use of our airspace or facilities. It would be good for any new arrangements to be reported to the House. The delay in releasing this information and the evident absence of a request in these cases are bound to undermine public trust in the arrangements that we have with the United States. Is it not important to do everything possible to strengthen the credibility of such arrangements for the future?</p>

<a name="80221-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="080221113000195"></a>I think that I reflect the feeling of this House when I say that extraordinary rendition is a subject that makes us feel very uneasy. If there is more to come out of the closet, it would be better for trust and confidence that it should emerge as the result of government investigation rather than in&#151;if I may put it this way&#151;more informal ways.</p>

<a name="80221-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="080221113000196"></a>Whatever the specifics of these two instances, their revelation inevitably focuses attention again on the wider issue of how rendition is used. As we on this side of the House have said in the past, extraordinary rendition raises the risk of losing control over the conditions under which a rendered suspect is then held&#151;and possibly tortured&#151;in a third country. This danger is not necessarily just history. Recent reports of secret prisons in Afghanistan in which terrorist suspects are held are grounds for concern. If such reports turned out to have substance, given our close support for the Afghan Government, there would be a risk to the good name of this country. Have the Government been able to substantiate or refute these allegations?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="080221113000197"></a>The efforts of the US, our most important ally, to fight international terror are essential to the security not only of America but of Britain and many other nations. We agree entirely with the Government on that point. However, allegations that rendition has led to the torture of terrorist suspects have been used to undermine the moral standing of the United States and its allies. Indeed, such torture, if it has occurred, is fundamentally wrong. The Government take the view, which we share, that rendition leading to torture is unacceptable and have said that they would not

<a name="80221-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="080221113000198"></a>I have to say that the position of the US and all its allies would be strengthened if they were to adopt a definition of torture that corresponded more closely to international norms and if they adopted a higher threshold for rendition to third countries than satisfying themselves that they believed that the transferred suspect would not be tortured. As my right honourable friend the shadow Foreign Secretary asked in another place, is this not something that the Government should now advocate to America as its candid friend? Such differences of practice and definition are at the root of international concern and their satisfactory resolution would mean that, rather than permanent suspicion and occasional revelations, real trust&#151;a most important commodity&#151;might be restored for the future. Like, I am sure, others on all sides of the House, I look forward with great interest to the noble Lord&#146;s responses to these important questions.</p>

<ul><a name="080221113000241"></a>&#147;the extra-judicial transfer of persons from one jurisdiction or State to another, for the purposes of detention and interrogation outside the normal legal system, where there is a real risk of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080221113000218"></a>On 26 December 2002, it was reported in the <I>Washington Post</I> that the United States authorities were using Diego Garcia not merely for the transit of prisoners from one state to another but for their incarceration. The matter was raised on the Floors of both Houses and denied by the Government. We did not believe them then and we do not believe them now. We have increasingly put pressure on the Government to make the necessary inquiries to assure us that these practices are not continuing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="080221113000200"></a>In December 2005, as the Statement says, the matter was raised by my right honourable friend Sir Menzies Campbell in another place and an assurance was given that there had been careful research by officials, who could not identify any occasion when there had been a request by the United States for permission for rendition through United Kingdom territory or airspace. On that day, the then Foreign Secretary, Mr Jack Straw, told the &#147;Today&#148; programme that he knew that 180 charter flights and 210 private jets operated by the CIA had passed through our airspace and had used British airports for that purpose. Again, there was a denial that that was anything to do with extraordinary rendition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="080221113000201"></a>Last June, the Council of Europe published a report that concluded that the CIA ran secret detention centres in Europe throughout 2003-05, in particular in Poland and Romania, where detainees were subjected to interrogation techniques tantamount to torture. Similarly, the Council of Europe concluded that Diego Garcia was playing a major role in a worldwide CIA prison network, both as a black site and as a transit point. That brings us to last June. At every stage, the Government have denied that there

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="080221113000202"></a>Today, the Minister says that he has asked his officials to compile a list of all the flights where we have been alerted to concerns regarding rendition through the United Kingdom or our overseas territories. The list is then to be sent to the United States and specific assurances are now, years after the <I>Washington Post</I> article in 2002, being sought that none of the flights was used for rendition purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="080221113000203"></a>One has to wonder whether the statements made to Parliament were based on inquiries made of the US authorities at the time that they were made. As was just said, the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, stated that the US authorities had repeatedly given us assurances that no terrorist suspects had been or were being held on Diego Garcia. How can we trust this Administration any more? Is this just some error by an official in relation to two flights back in 2002? Are we not going to hear in future years, &#147;Oh well, we forgot about other flights&#148;?</p>

That is similar to the way in which this Government have behaved in relation to the United States. Yesterday, we were discussing the one-sided extradition that has been agreed between the United States and this country. We look for a public inquiry, as we have called for several times, which will investigate what extraordinary renditions have taken place not just to European countries but to places where we know that torture takes place&#151;places such as Syria, Egypt, Morocco and Jordan, where it is thought that there are secret holes where United States detainees are held. We cannot be satisfied by assurances given by the Government today on this matter.</p>

I think that we must accept that US assurances were given in good faith. They have proved false in the case of the omission of the two transfers through Diego Garcia in 2002, but I urge this House not to assume from this disappointing lapse that our most important ally is not to be trusted in a broader sense. The most compelling defence of the good intentions of the United States is that it volunteered this finding to us; there was no investigative journalist close to another expos&#233; in the <I>Washington Post</I>, as far as we know. This was volunteered to us at the highest level on the ground that it was understood in Washington, as much as it would be here, that misleading Parliament is a major breach of parliamentary and democratic government, which must be corrected as quickly as possible. As the Statement made clear, there is as much remorse and concern on the part of Secretary Rice and her colleagues in Washington as there is on my part, on the part of the Foreign Secretary and on the part of this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="080221113000206"></a>As regards my own assurances in July, since 2003, and therefore after the <I>Washington Post</I> article,<I></I>we have received regular assurances from the United States that Diego Garcia has not been used in any form for renditions. I will come back to the other steps that have been taken since then but, on the question of how confident we can be of the assurances that we have now received, I think that we must trust but verify. I accept the point that we cannot afford any longer to take them at face value&#151;hence the Foreign Secretary&#146;s decision to submit a list of suspicious flights, drawn from those identified by Liberty, Amnesty International and other inquiries. We will send as full a list as possible and make that list public, so that if people feel that flights have been omitted they can make their point. This will be a transparent process. We feel that we have every right to ask of the United States that it confirms to us that each and every one of these flights has not been used for rendition; it owes us that after what has happened.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80221-0013.htm"/>


<a name="80221-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="080221113000207"></a>We recognise that this is not a problem in far-off oceans alone. We must include flights that may have passed through Prestwick or used UK airspace. Only through this process can we restore trust among the British public and the two Houses of Parliament in our ally&#146;s good word and good faith. We hope that the United States will recognise that this exercise has become inevitable and vital in the light of the announcement today.</p>

<a name="80221-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="080221113000208"></a>Let me reconfirm to this House that, when it comes to extraordinary rendition, we oppose and would block any request to move people through our territories if there was any expectation that they would be tortured at the other end. We do not rule out rendition, but we have made it clear to the United States that we expect to be consulted, and our permission to be received, for any rendition, and that it will occur only when we feel that it is consistent with international norms and our own domestic legal requirements.</p>

<a name="80221-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="080221113000209"></a>Let me make it clear, to those who think that we are lying on our back and having our tummy tickled, that on a number of issues related to this we have been quite open about our disagreement with the United States. We believe that Guantanamo should be closed. Although we believe that there has been an improvement in the US justice arrangements for dealing with the Guantanamo cases, we still have our concerns about that justice system. We are opposed to torture and to activities that the US believes are not torture, such as waterboarding, but which we believe are torture.</p>

<a name="80221-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="080221113000210"></a>We are still more the bulldog than the poodle on this. After all, the concerns to which articles such as the one in 2002 gave rise led not only to questions in this House and another place but to actions by committees and the Government to review cases and to try to reach certainty that no such renditions had occurred. During those reviews, which ultimately took place in 2005-06, noble Lords will recall that of the four cases, which went back to 1998, two involved renditions but two involved individuals whom we had refused to be allowed to move through our airspace or territories for this purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="080221113000211"></a>Since 2003 for Diego Garcia and a little later for British airspace and territories worldwide, we have received regular assurances that no renditions are occurring and would occur only with our full agreement and consultation. The most recent such discussions took place in September 2007, so I insist to the House and to all noble Lords here that we have been fully vigilant in seeking to ensure that there is no secret trade in renditions.</p>

Since the earliest indications of the practice of extraordinary rendition, there have been persistent calls for a full and impartial inquiry, which is required under the terms of the UK obligations as a signatory to the UN convention against torture. Although some of my concerns have already been voiced by others, and indeed to some extent answered, I make no apology for repeating them because we are dealing here with a matter of such fundamental importance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="080221123000009"></a>The UK&#146;s role has been called into question time and time again.

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="080221123000010"></a>Furthermore, despite the Government&#146;s reluctance to reveal the names of the individuals concerned, if those individuals come before a military commission and are charged on the basis of information extracted under torture, they can be protected by the international community, including us, only if we know who they are and the details of their current circumstances.</p>

We need to take this one step at a time. The ISC looked extensively into this, but its findings have obviously been compromised by the discovery of these two cases. The first step is to establish the facts: hence the list that we will send to the US to seek its confirmation that no renditions were involved.

Their very prompt decision to come before the House is reassuring. However, does my noble friend also appreciate that there will be continuing profound anxiety

There is precious little indication that serious concerns, expressed by the Council of Europe and other responsible bodies after a great deal of detailed research, were pursued, investigated and evaluated with the rigour that we should have been able to expect. Can we have reassurances on that score?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="080221123000013"></a>Will my noble friend also reflect that phrases such as &#147;We believe water boarding to be torture&#148;, or saying that we are reassured by some of the steps that have been taken on the legal situation in Guantanamo Bay are not in fact reassuring because they suggest that we are not being as resolute and firm as we should be? We should simply say that water boarding is torture and that Guantanamo Bay is illegal and cannot be condoned, whatever changes may be made in how it is handled.</p>

The United States is our principal ally, and the special relationship has done us well over a very long time. However, I suspect that, when it comes to an ally, we may be guilty of taking as true its express assurance that something has not happened. The steps that the Foreign Secretary has authorised today&#151;to present the US with a list of flights, about which Members of this House and organisations such as Amnesty may have concerns&#151;show that we are no longer willing to take trust at face value on this issue. We recognise that we have, sadly, reached a point where we need to press much more explicitly for clear, unequivocal certainty that these flights were not used for rendition.</p>

Which answer should we believe from this Statement? Whichever it is, as somebody who has for 30 years been a strong advocate of the special relationship, the Minister has demonstrated that assurances from both Governments cannot be relied on in this area.

That was when the issue became one of public concern; there was public debate and enquiries and investigations were undertaken by different organisations, including the ISC. It was during that period that these more systematic arrangements occurred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="080221123000018"></a>While already under existing informal practice we would have expected the cases in 2002 to be shared with us, the system has been systematised since.

It is not, I think, the case&#151;students of this issue would confirm this&#151;that we have no assurance that all those who might have been subject to rendition or might now be subject to extra-judicial punishment are in Guantanamo Bay. Another component of this rendition problem is people who were sent to third countries. Unfortunately, the case load at Guantanamo is not the entirety of the problem. One of the two individuals moved through Diego Garcia in 2002 is this day in Guantanamo. Again, the issue is to get as full an exposure of the facts as possible, once we have received the US response, in order to determine the appropriate next steps.</p>

I give one brief example; I will not take too much time. Is the Minister aware of the number of people who are kidnapped from the border areas of Pakistan, handed over to American forces in Afghanistan and rendered to secret detention centres? One does not hear about those people in the media here, but they come back&#151;if they do at all&#151;with their lives completely damaged. Not only should the UK not be complicit in this but we should set the lead by working to ensure that all EU countries are not complicit. Does he agree?</p>

I agree with her, but I probably should not walk out too far on that branch. However, the US has put it to the Government that in its internal housekeeping of going through its files it uncovered those two cases and felt that it should bring them to our attention as quickly as possible. At the risk of ridicule in this House, I am forced into using famous phrase, &#147;We&#146;ll have to take it at face value&#148;. The US has been insistent that it did this because it recognised that it had led us to mislead Parliament and that we needed to correct that as soon as possible.</p>

While in a House of lawyers I am reluctant to get into a definition of the term, I am told that, unlike the narrower term &#147;rendition&#148;, it means moving people to somewhere where they are likely to suffer torture or other infringements of their legal and civil rights. We are agin it in all its forms. On the final point, I see the attraction of a proposal for European airspace. We should explore that.</p>

In one of his replies he mentioned Prestwick. He may know that, when I was Lord Advocate, I was asked to use my powers to direct the police to conduct a criminal investigation into the alleged use of Prestwick and other airports in Scotland for extraordinary rendition.

He has caught me a little with his second point about flights returning without anyone on board, which is of course a harder issue, on which we need to reflect. But again let me make it clear that the US assured us that no detainee had been or would be rendered through UK airspace or that of our overseas territories without our knowledge. These assurances were sought in 2005 as a result of the concerns raised then and have been repeated on numerous occasions since. Particularly as regards Diego Garcia, as I said, this had started in 2003, so we continue to believe that what we are discussing is a problem of failed reporting&#151;an historical problem about that earlier period. It will be a huge disappointment and cause of difficulty in our relationships if we find that there are more recent cases; we devoutly hope that we will not. However, for that reason, the list that we submit will be as exhaustive as possible, because we have to slay the demons on this in order to restore trust and confidence to both sides of the relationship.</p>

Whereas the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, focused on the business plan that Northern Rock would follow, our amendment looked in addition at the framework agreement that would govern the relationship between the Treasury and the board of Northern Rock. I know the Minister addressed the matter to a certain extent during the debate, but whereas I was pleased to note his categorical assurance that the business plan would be published and laid before Parliament, I did not catch the same assurance for the framework agreement.</p>

We now discover that this is not the case. Instead of the assurance I was hoping for, I discover that the Government are still unable to be as open and transparent about their dealings with Northern Rock as they should be.

I would just like to say how much we all appreciate the strenuous efforts of the staff of the House and all those involved in producing so quickly the documentation. It is quite remarkable that we have public servants of the quality we have and I am very grateful to them. If we criticise the speed, it is not in any way critical of those who have done such hard work; it is the speed with which the Government are trying to rush through procedures. My second point is that we have here a very important move by the Government to ignore the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. That is, as I understand it, the first time that the Government have decided to ignore such recommendations. When I press further on these amendments, it might be right for the Government to set out their policy on the committee.</p>

To make a general point that I have made many times in the past in your Lordships&#146; House, there is a bit of a myth about the affirmative resolution procedure and the degree of scrutiny that it allows. I have sat through many debates involving affirmative resolutions. They are short, desultory affairs because we know that we cannot amend the resolution; we know that we cannot throw out the resolution except in extreme circumstances. Affirmative resolutions do not give this House the power that is sometimes ascribed to them. That does not mean that in all circumstances we say that they make no difference but, in this case, and combined with the other arguments that I gave earlier, we cannot support the amendments.</p>

I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, will permit me to make one observation: in so far as he shares our concern about the way in which Parliament is once more being ridden over by the Executive, I cannot help but point out that had his party been a little less reluctant to join in the dance, we might have had an opportunity for more careful scrutiny of the Bill. In this respect, the Government are their own worst enemy. We have seen how this Government have progressively destroyed Cabinet government in our country and marginalised Cabinet Ministers, who discover from the newspapers what policy is. Now we are seeing the same thing happening to Parliament with this kind of roughshod procedure. It results, in the end, in governments making mistakes and in weak government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="080221123000071"></a>I am sure that because this House has not had a proper opportunity to scrutinise and consider the legislation and that there will be no proper opportunity to scrutinise the secondary legislation, the sweeping powers that are provided will result in the Government making mistakes that will damage them. It is no part of my brief to try to save the Government from themselves. Unfortunately, the taxpayers and the people of this country will pay the price.</p>

I speak with some hesitation having not been in this House for as long as he has, but I find myself amazed at his proposition. I understood his argument to be that we should not have an affirmative resolution because it did not give any serious opportunity for scrutiny. If that is his view, surely that must be a view of general application. If that is the view that he takes, he must surely take the view that there is no point ever having an affirmative resolution procedure in this House. I find that an astonishing proposition.</p>

<a name="80221-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="080221123000075"></a>The noble Lord says that he does not think it is worth having an affirmative resolution procedure because you cannot amend the order. I agree that that is a serious defect in procedure. It would be a good thing if that defect was remedied and the opportunity was there to amend affirmative resolutions. But one surely cannot use that limitation in our procedure as a reason for throwing out affirmative resolutions as desirable things.</p>

<a name="80221-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="080221123000076"></a>Furthermore, I remind the noble Lord that the conventions committee, in its consideration of this matter, recommended that this House should be prepared more often to use its power to reject affirmative resolution orders. The House has been properly cautious in approaching that matter, but who is to say that that caution will remain at its present level? I am sure that at some point in the future, cautiously no doubt, the recommendation of the conventions committee will be followed and that orders subject to affirmative resolutions will be rejected.</p>

<a name="80221-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="080221123000077"></a>We should consider those factors plus the importance in this situation of ensuring that there is some debate. On a negative resolution, there is no debate. There is no doubt about the importance of this matter and ensuring that parliamentary accountability goes a little further than dropping a piece of paper onto the Table in front of us. A proper debate is surely desirable.</p>

The main one was in respect of Northern Rock. We have spent far more parliamentary time in detailed consideration of all aspects of the nationalisation of Northern Rock this week than we would have had regardless of whether there had been an affirmative or a negative resolution to consider. The argument for an affirmative resolution on Northern Rock, where urgency is of the essence, therefore does not hold as it would in normal circumstances. As for the generality, like the noble Lord, I agree that we should be able to amend affirmative resolutions. The view of the House ought to be that rejecting an affirmative resolution is anything but the nuclear option. Rejecting an affirmative resolution within your own party or more generally in the House is not seen as an acceptable way of proceeding except in the most extreme circumstances.

But I was talking about the situation and practices of the House with which we currently contend.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, seems to predicate that a Labour Government foreshadow the death of parliamentary democracy. The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, has one supreme advantage over many of us here in that if he was not here in 1971 someone connected with the family certainly was, and in 1971 the Upper House permitted the Government to nationalise an important company in a single day. The outcome of that development, as was attested by the Opposition earlier, was regarded as wholly beneficial by the nation and enabled Rolls-Royce to succeed subsequently.</p>

Does the Minister not think that was a different situation from the one we are faced with today?</p>

<a name="080221123000081"></a><b><a name="80221-0014.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="080221123000184"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, it might have been a single-paragraph Bill but the significance of that decision was such as to engage the nation in very great debate. The Upper House at that time delivered within the space of 24 hours. I am therefore not going to receive lectures about it being a decline of parliamentary democracy to ask this House to consider this Bill which has emergency provisions within the timescale that we have put forward. As for the contentions put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, with regard to affirmative resolutions, that is easily said but there are issues with regard to this House being able to negative or even amend affirmative resolutions. That would represent quite a shift in the balance of power between the two Houses. That may well be broadly accepted, but let the noble Lord not think that that decision would apply to this House alone. Elected Members of the other House would look askance at the regular arrival of negative action against affirmative resolutions, and rightly so. Anyone would think that it is only a Labour Government who use such devices. I know it is a long time since noble Lords opposite have been in government but they are lively and have green and verdant memories and they can surely recall the fact that they have used these instruments many times and certainly would not have tolerated regular rejection by the Upper House at that stage. If they say, &#147;We would not have anticipated rejection of our instruments in such circumstances&#148;, then a real issue of democracy arises&#151;that when one party is in power at the other end, certain conduct is acceptable in this place, but when another party is in power, a rather different strategy is pursued. I give way to the noble Earl.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="080221123000086"></a>But enough of this banter; we are, after all, here to discuss immediate and serious issues. This issue before us in the amendment is a serious one. It derives also from the serious report of the Delegated Powers Committee, which, as I said earlier today, the Government respect fully. We discussed the issues with some members of that committee. Earlier this afternoon&#151;I nearly said this morning, but it was earlier this afternoon&#151;the House recognised that the Government had made considerable movement. I tabled amendments that showed we had accepted certain parts of the committee&#146;s report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="080221123000087"></a>However, I hope that the House will appreciate why we cannot accept this amendment. We are dealing with an emergency position. As I sought to emphasise this morning, the emergency position is different even from that of Rolls-Royce. Rolls-Royce involved the expenditure of a considerable sum of public money to buy out the company. We should not pretend that the situation at Rolls-Royce was trivial. Although it involved a one-clause Bill, it was a mightily significant asset. But we are dealing here with confidence in the financial institutions of this country and with confidence, potentially, in one institution. The issue is all about&#151;</p>

When we talk about confidence in financial institutions, what is at stake is the confidence of depositors in an institution. That is not something to be trifled with.

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="080221123000090"></a>Of course we recognise that the Delegated Powers Committee had a substantial argument, and we recognise the Northern Ireland precedent. No one will underestimate the importance of the emergencies and the provisions that were necessary in response to the Northern Ireland situation. But I ask the House&#151;I must have great confidence in being able to appeal to such knowledgeable Conservative Members with regard to the City and City finance&#151;to recognise that the Bill is about emergency in a particular industry and with regard to a certain kind of way in which the emergency would manifest itself; namely, potentially, in the loss of depositors&#146; confidence.</p>

<a name="80221-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="080221123000091"></a>If noble Lords opposite are saying, &#147;The procedure we envisage is one in which Parliament will in due course validate this position, and that individuals only have to recognise that this emergency will be resolved, that the Government are taking action, and that both Houses may well eventually endorse the required order&#148;, all I would say in response is that that is scarcely conducive to action by those who have anxieties. It is scarcely conducive to their acting with confidence. I recognise the pressure that the Government are under. It is very rare indeed for the Government to argue against a case put by the Delegated Powers Committee, and I cannot pretend that I undertake the task with the greatest enthusiasm. I have great respect for the committee, as do we all. I know how much it means to this House and to Members of the other place. However, that is the circumstance for a particular industry that requires particular consideration. I therefore hope that the noble Lord will recognise why I am asking him to withdraw his amendment.</p>

It was a marvellous speech for the noble Lord, who of course was previously Chief Whip; it is the sort of speech that every Chief Whip would love, because it was arguing with passion. But the Minister was quixotically chivalrous, if I may say so, in tilting at the windmills posed to him by my noble friend Lord Trimble, who set out a spectre which he quite rightly sought to tilt at.

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="080221123000094"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, who undertakes this vitally important task with the committee, has set out that there have been other occasions, but I do not think that I have ever seen&#151;I am talking only from my memory and not his&#151;such a strong report so clearly rejected by the Government as this has been. That sets an unfortunate precedent. I must say in defence of the Minister that he did say that he found it a very uncomfortable position to be in, to be arguing that we should ignore some of those provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="080221123000095"></a>I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Forsyth, who once again reminded us of the context in all this. The noble Lord, Lord Desai, said, &#147;But we passed the terrorism provisions in 36 hours&#148;. I have only two things to say. First, this is not about guns, bullets and terrorism. Secondly, I do not think that the legislation to which he refers can be held up as a shining example of the best legislation in the circumstances. It would have been far better to have had more detailed scrutiny. That is the great thing about this House. We take things really seriously and go through legislation line by line. We are not being given that opportunity on this occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="080221123000096"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that I recognise his argument. However, I think that my noble friend Lord Trimble countered it. Of course we currently have limited powers on statutory instruments, but it is not necessarily the amendment or the refusal to accept a statutory instrument that is important&#151;it is the opportunity of debate so that the issues can be brought out and considered carefully. I thank my noble friend Lord Onslow for the point he raised.</p>

I do not think that we in this place have been treated with the respect that we deserve. This is legislation being rushed through. It is not an emergency. We should have had more time to consider it carefully. The Minister&#146;s rejection of these amendments is probably a classic example of what I am trying to put across.

I begin by paying tribute to the Opposition for the constructive way in which they approached discussions in the House on that Bill and for their stamina and endurance in seeing it through to Royal Assent. We are especially grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lords, Lord Sharman and Lord Razzall&#151;some of whom are not sitting in their places&#151;for their contributions, which benefited the legislation.</p>

<a name="80221-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="080221123000103"></a>These regulations relate to the regime of civil penalties for companies and limited liability partnerships that deliver their accounts after the due date. The purpose of the regulations is to provide transparency for customers, suppliers and other stakeholders by ensuring that the UK has a complete public register of company accounts. Until the register was introduced in 1992, only 60 per cent of companies filed on time. The figure is now 84 per cent. The penalties in the regime have not changed since 1992 and have, therefore, reduced in real terms. In the past three years, we have started to see a small decline in the number of companies filing on time. So far, there has been a reduction of only half a percentage point, but in a register of more than 2 million companies that represents an extra 10,000 companies filing late each year. The purpose of the regulations is to reverse that trend. The regulations are based on the principles of the Hampton and Macrory reports on risk-based and proportionate enforcement. They focus on those who do not comply, rather than on those who do.</p>

<a name="80221-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="080221123000104"></a>First, the regulations increase the basic &#163;100 penalty to &#163;150, reflecting inflation since 1992. Secondly, the penalties will increase in real terms for any company that files more than one month late, from &#163;100 to &#163;375. For a company filing just over three months late, a &#163;250 penalty becomes &#163;750. Thirdly, they target repeat offenders. A company that files late twice consecutively will pay double the penalty.</p>

<a name="80221-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="080221123000105"></a>The draft regulations provide for the first of the changes to come into force on 1 February 2009. In the interests of simplicity, they will apply to all accounts filed after that date, whether under the Companies Act 2006 or under the transitional regime for accounts prepared under the Companies Act 1985. The repeat offender provision will apply only where both sets of late-filed accounts were filed under the 2006 Act. In practice, most companies will not be at risk of a double penalty before February 2011. That is the earliest time when a private company with a normal 12-month financial year will be able to file late twice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="080221123000106"></a>In addition, the regulations align the penalty regime for limited liability partnerships with the regime for limited companies, as is the case now. Finally, they reduce the statutory filing deadline for limited liability partnerships from 10 months after the year end to nine. Again, that will apply the same rules to limited liability partnerships as will apply to private companies under the 2006 Act. The regulations follow a consultation process that concluded that, on balance, the proposal as it stands is right. I commend the regulations to the House and I beg to move.</p>

By and large, these measures are very welcome. There is a clear need to update the fines and penalties for late filing and it is absolutely right that the arrangements should apply to limited liability partnerships in the same way as they applied to limited liability companies. I was reminded that in 1999 I made my maiden speech in this House on the Second Reading of the Limited Liability Partnerships Bill. I am pleased to see that the Companies Act 2006&#151;the noble Baroness referred to our deliberations on it, which were lengthy, I might add&#151;has ensured that this sorely needed form of business enterprise is being widely adopted. The regulations will make them fully on a par with limited liability companies. We support the regulations.</p>

It replaces the 2005 order under which powers are currently delegated to the Professional Oversight Board. That order was made under the Companies Act 1989. The regulation of audit was reformed between 2002 and 2005 in response to corporate scandals such as Enron. Both the 2005 delegation order and the 2006 EU audit directive require independent oversight of the professional accountancy bodies' regulation of auditors. Some adjustments to the existing UK audit regime are needed to comply with the audit directive and a new delegation order is needed to reflect those changes. It is also required to reflect changes in the corporate structure at the Financial Reporting Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="080221123000120"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the Companies (Trading Disclosures) Regulations 2008 ensure that anyone doing business with a company, or who has a complaint against a company, can easily discover its legal identity. The registered name of the company is sufficient for anyone to access the information that a company is required to make public by filing at Companies House. The regulations require that the registered name be included in all forms of business communication  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_372"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 372</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and documentation and in applications for licences. They also require every company&#146;s name to be displayed at its registered office, at any place where its records can be inspected and at any other premises at which it carries on business, provided that those other premises are not used primarily for living accommodation. The exception for living accommodation is new. It is in response to concerns expressed during consultation that company signs at homes may place people at risk.</p>

<a name="80221-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="080221123000121"></a>Every name on the registrar&#146;s index of company names is unique. For a UK company, its name is all that is needed for anyone to find information about it on the public record. However, other jurisdictions could also have companies with the same name. The regulations therefore require the place of registration and the registration number, together with the address of the company&#146;s registered office, to appear in business letters, order forms and websites.</p>

<a name="80221-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="080221123000122"></a>These regulations replace requirements that are currently under both the Companies Act 1985 and the Business Names Act 1985, and the corresponding Northern Ireland legislation. Companies that carry on business under a name other than their registered name are also subject to the Business Names Act 1985. At present, these companies have to comply with both sets of requirements. The companies that have the double set of requirements include many of our largest companies, as well as small companies, particularly retailers. By replacing these two sets of requirements with a single set of regulations, it has been possible to reduce the total burden on those companies that are subject to both. I commend these regulations to the House and I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="0802222000008"></a>The first amendment revolves around audit. We have already confirmed our intention that Northern Rock should be subject to the requirements of the Companies Acts 1985 and 2006. This will mean that the company&#146;s annual report and accounts must be independently audited by a professional firm and filed with the Registrar of Companies for public access.</p>

<a name="80221-0015.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="0802222000009"></a>It may be helpful if I set out once again, and I hope for the last time with regard to this measure, how we propose to apply these requirements to Northern Rock&#146;s 2007 accounts. Once the shares have been transferred, the board will confirm the appointment of the company&#146;s independent auditors, who will then complete the audit of the accounts. The board will also review and approve them. The accounts will then be published at the latest by the end of March. I will of course ensure that a copy is placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="80221-0015.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="0802222000010"></a>I contend that these are far more appropriate arrangements than any alternative proposed, for the reasons that I gave earlier today and which have been agreed subsequently by the other place. In particular, it will be recognised that the Bank of England is not well qualified to take on the responsibility for auditing large and complex financial institutions. It is, to state the obvious, a central bank, not an auditing firm. Its expertise lies elsewhere. Independent professional auditing firms with experience of the City are far better placed to provide the necessary expertise and scrutiny. These arguments were also persuasive in the Commons and have led to this Motion.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="0802222000011"></a>The second amendment, which also exercised this House to a great extent, dealt with issues revolving around the Freedom of Information Act. Our argument against applying the Act to companies transferred under the Bill has at its heart our principle, which I think is shared right across the House, that once the bank has been brought into temporary public ownership it should be run on a commercial basis at arm&#146;s length from the Government. It was suggested that National Savings &amp; Investments was an example of an organisation that falls within the Freedom of Information Act&#151;it does&#151;and was therefore a parallel for Northern Rock. It is not. National Savings &amp; Investments is an executive agency of the Treasury, and has the public function of raising finance to provide the Exchequer with a source of funding&#151;that is, public borrowing. No commercial bank is subject to the terms of the Freedom of Information Act, and a bank transferred under these powers should not be. That is our case on Northern Rock. The regime under that Act would be entirely inappropriate for any commercial bank, even one run at arm&#146;s length from the Government, as Northern Rock will be.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="0802222000012"></a>As was mentioned in this House and in the other place, the Bank of England also has an exemption from the Freedom of Information Act in relation to information that it holds on the provision of private banking services and related services. That seems to be a direct precedent for how we are tackling Northern Rock in public ownership. It has been observed that there are exemptions under Section 43 of the Freedom of Information Act for trade secrets and information  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_374"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 374</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>likely to prejudice commercial interests. That is not, however, an absolute exemption.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="0802222000013"></a>It would be the case&#151;as I sought to put before the Committee earlier today&#151;that Northern Rock would have to consider all freedom of information requests, and balance the public interest against its own commercial interests. That would be wholly inappropriate for a commercial company with no public function; as a result, it could conceivably be ordered to disclose information under that Act that other banks would not have to disclose, which would cause practical problems and hinder the bank&#146;s ability to operate on a sound commercial basis by diverting resources to dealing with publication schemes and answering requests.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="0802222000014"></a>In the interests of achieving a return to private ownership and repaying the taxpayer&#151;the cardinal principles of this legislation&#151;I want to avoid Northern Rock being disadvantaged by operating in temporary public ownership. As I also mentioned earlier today, in accordance with the Companies Act and other regulatory requirements, banks, including Northern Rock, have reporting and information requirements to publish company accounts and company reports and to undergo an audit by independent auditors, all on an annual basis. If we are to maintain the prospect that this bank may be returned to the private sector as soon as possible, it is vital that we do not apply inappropriate public sector requirements. We want the new management to be focused on producing a business plan that meets our objectives, not instituting a training programme for all staff in how to deal with freedom of information requests.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="0802222000015"></a>As I explained earlier, under its framework document the Treasury intends to develop effective plans for appropriate publication of reporting information on Northern Rock. That will enable appropriate public scrutiny of Northern Rock, which is why&#151;the Commons having agreed with the position put forward by the Government in this House earlier today&#151;the amendment to which Motion B refers is not necessary. The Treasury is a public authority, subject to the Freedom of Information Act; information relating to the Treasury&#146;s relationship with Northern Rock as shareholder and lender would therefore be covered by that Act. Those who wish to see the objectives of that Act met&#151;and I pay due testimony to noble Lords opposite who were concerned to emphasise this in their representations today&#151;should note that they can be met by requests to the Treasury about its relationship with Northern Rock. The Treasury would need to consider applications under the Freedom of Information Act in the normal way, including the relevant exemptions.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="0802222000016"></a>I turn to the third and last amendment that is covered by the Commons Motion. The third issue revolves around the important aspect of competition. Under the amendment, Northern Rock should not be able to compete unfairly with other banks in the retail savings and banking market. I want to assure the House that there will be no adverse competition impacts, which was of course the argument sustained in the other place.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="0802222000017"></a>The bank is in receipt of public support. This aid is subject to European Union state aid restrictions. Clearly, interpretation of these laws is a matter for the  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_375"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 375</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>courts. But I would be extremely surprised if the Commission interpreted those rules in such a way as to allow a bank to expand its business aggressively on the back of public support. The requirement for prior approval of the European Commission, and the Commission&#146;s ability to hold Northern Rock to significant compensatory measures, are reasonable restrictions on its business activities. Such measures will need to be applied to Northern Rock.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="0802222000018"></a>As has been explained during the course of the measure before the House, we intend to submit a restructuring aid plan to the Commission shortly. This will need to reassure the Commission that Northern Rock does not abuse its position. In addition, like any other company, Northern Rock will be subject to UK competition law in the normal way, including the Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise Act 2002. That provides a further important check on Northern Rock&#146;s business model.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="0802222000019"></a>As has been made clear to both Houses, the Government recognise that other banks and building societies will want to be reassured about the impact of taking Northern Rock into temporary public ownership on competition. I can assure the House that officials have been asked to have urgent meetings and discussions with the British Bankers&#146; Association, the Building Societies Association and others to reassure them of the position.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="0802222000020"></a>I can offer three further points of reassurance to the House. First, Ron Sandler has already made it clear that he is acutely conscious of competition issues and has no intention of running the bank in a way which abuses its present temporary state ownership. Secondly, the clear strategic aim we have set for the management is to move the bank off all forms of government support. Thirdly, let me reassure the House on how the financing of Northern Rock will operate. At present, Northern Rock is subject to the same interest rate premium arrangements and to paying for government guarantees in precisely the same way as it paid for those facilities in the private sector. It has not had overnight access to a different sort of financing.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="0802222000021"></a>There is another aspect with regard to competition which I am sure is of very real concern to the House and is a reassurance to all noble Lords. The Office of Fair Trading, under Clauses 3 to 6, will be required to conduct an annual report on the impact of competitiveness of Northern Rock&#146;s activities. A report to Parliament as soon as it identifies a significant adverse impact on competition as a result of this is also necessary. The Office of Fair Trading is an effective watchdog that overseas competitiveness in the UK markets. It has wide powers, including powers to investigate when any market in the UK is distorted by unfair competition. There is no need therefore for the additional amendment which was passed earlier in the day by the House, which is why the Commons has rejected it. The amendment would be an unnecessary duplication of powers under the Competition Act and the Enterprise Act 2002, and the European Commission&#146;s powers under the EC treaty. It does not need to specify new powers to report on the competitiveness of the banking market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="0802222000022"></a>We also agreed that the Office of Fair Trading would publish an annual report assessing any competitive implications of the public support to Northern Rock. My officials have spoken to the Office of Fair Trading and I can now report to the House that the OFT has proposed that it will publish an annual report assessing any implications of Northern Rock&#146;s business on the banking market from the perspective of competitiveness. I hope that this reassures noble Lords on the third amendment.</p>

It was clear during the debates at Report and Third Reading here that there was much about the Bill that we regretted we had not been able to change. It was unfortunate that we were unable to remove many of the provisions which the Government had shoehorned into what should have been a Bill with the sole purpose of nationalising Northern Rock. Some of the concessions that we were able to wring from the Government were also rather less than we might have hoped. There were long debates on the proper role of Parliament in the nationalisation of Northern Rock and of any other bank or building society that this Government might take it into their heads to nationalise within the next 12 months. We were, unfortunately, not as successful in persuading the Government as we would have liked. Although we are pleased that many of the orders will now be subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny, the most important powers in the Bill are left subject to no parliamentary scrutiny at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="0802222000025"></a>However, when the Bill left this House there was much to be celebrated. Your Lordships had succeeded in establishing in Committee that the framework agreement between the Government and the management of Northern Rock will be laid before Parliament &#147;as rapidly as possible&#148; and that the Government will report,</p>
<ul><a name="0802222000055"></a>&#147;on the future strategic direction of Northern Rock regularly&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802222000052"></a>Although I would have preferred to see those commitments on the face of the Bill, they are nevertheless significant victories for transparency and will I hope encourage the Government to maintain a genuinely arm&#146;s-length relationship with Northern Rock. We also won a notable concession from the Minister that the Office of Fair Trading will report annually on the competitive implications of Northern Rock&#146;s business on the banking market.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="0802222000026"></a>Of course, not all of our achievements in this House were conceded by the Government. We voted successfully three times, inserting useful provisions into the Bill, such as an independent audit and a statutory commitment on the watching brief for unfair competition, which we believe would have been absolutely feasible. But the most important vote was on freedom of information. The amendment was ably  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_377"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 377</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>introduced by my noble friend Lord Hunt of Wirral, who whipped up the largest majority of the day and successfully ensured that Northern Rock would not enjoy an exemption from public scrutiny, but would instead be as open as any other government or public body, subject&#151;as your Lordships made sure the Government knew&#151;to an exemption for commercially sensitive information.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="0802222000027"></a>I opened this speech with a statement of regret. Before I get carried away with my enthusiasm in remembering how successful this House was at improving the Bill, I must bring myself back to earth by considering the Motions before us. It is deeply regrettable that the Government have decided to reject out of hand every one of the votes that your Lordships won on the Bill. It is most regrettable in the case of their rejection of our attempts to insist on the applicability of the Freedom of Information Act. It might seem cruel to put the Minister through the ordeal of defending his party&#146;s line on this matter again, but the Labour Government&#146;s inconsistency on this matter beggars belief.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="0802222000028"></a>Many of us remember the fine words of the Prime Minister as recently as 25 October 2007, in his speech grandly titled &#147;Speech on Liberty&#148; and published on the No. 10 website, where he stated quite clearly:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="0802222000054"></a>&#147;Freedom of Information can be inconvenient, at times frustrating and indeed embarrassing for governments. But Freedom of Information is the right course because government belongs to the people, not the politicians&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802222000053"></a>I promise not to make a habit of saying this about the Prime Minister, but I agree with him. Very shortly Northern Rock will belong to the people, not the politicians, so freedom of information will also then be the right course here.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="0802222000029"></a>The inconvenience, frustration and embarrassment that the Prime Minister sounded so willing to face last year have now resurfaced to inspire all the Government&#146;s arguments against our amendment. We have heard from the Minister that Northern Rock would be put to some difficulty in resisting demands from its competitors to release commercially sensitive information. That this argument, originally suggested by the Prime Minister on Wednesday at Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time, is still being peddled by the Government despite the comprehensive dismembering it received today, both in this House and in another place, says a lot about how much attention the Government pay to your Lordships and to parliamentary procedure.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="0802222000030"></a>The alternative explanation is that, although Ministers are listening, they are so incapable of justifying the freedom of information exemption that they are resorting to ever more extreme arguments to avoid admitting defeat. This evening, the government Front Bench in another place even accused this amendment of being a wrecking amendment. That suggests that the Government are so scared of freedom of information that they would rather not go through with the nationalisation of Northern Rock at all than subject the running of it to public scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="0802222000031"></a>The Government practice of resorting to extreme arguments in the face of opposition has unfortunately been a feature of this Bill&#146;s rapid progress through Parliament. Every time we have tried to impose a safeguard or to limit an unreasonable power, we have  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_378"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 378</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been told that we are threatening not only the nationalisation of Northern Rock but the entire stability of the United Kingdom financial sector. That we have managed to make what improvements and extract what concessions we have has been nothing short of a small miracle given the pressure of time that we, and particularly another place, have been put under. I can only congratulate noble Lords on showing the Government just how important proper scrutiny is and hope that we have given them reason to think again before they introduce such ill conceived provisions.</p>

<p><a name="st_276"></a>
<a name="0802222000032"></a><b><a name="80221-0016.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0802222000060"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords, when I stood in this place in November with as much confidence as I could muster and said that there were only two options facing the Government and Northern Rock, one of which was nationalisation and the other administration, I did so with some trepidation. I was greatly cheered on that occasion because I had the immediate support of the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, and several noble Lords on the Labour Back Benches. However, I was not surprised when on that occasion the noble Lord, Lord Davies, gave me a metaphorical pat on the head&#151;the first of several&#151;and said, &#147;There, there. What would we expect from the Lib Dems? Don&#146;t worry, it&#146;ll be all right&#148;. Well, it obviously has not been all right.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="0802222000033"></a>In the intervening three months, the Government have clearly crept with extreme reluctance towards the option of nationalisation. However, I was reassured in my own mind that at least contingency planning was being undertaken and that no doubt a crack team of the finest minds at the Treasury was working night and day to ensure that, if the dread day in the Government&#146;s mind ever came to pass when nationalisation had to take place, a plan of Rolls-Royce smoothness would swing into action, enabling the Government to carry all the arguments before them on how they expected the nationalisation to take place.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="0802222000034"></a>We have had a lot of discussion about nationalisations over the past few days, and British Leyland was mentioned. It deserves a final mention because at times the Government&#146;s progress and ability to deal with some of the ascents and bumps on the road have matched those of some of the less impressive British Leyland models in that company&#146;s worst years. Far from being able to come out of this debate knowing, for example, exactly how Granite works and how the Government intend to deal with it, we are left with considerable confusion.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="0802222000035"></a>However, we have had robust and remarkably full debates within the time constraints and I think that, in their arguments and attempts to reach agreement where that was possible, the parties have reflected British parliamentary democracy as we know it not necessarily at its best but certainly very far from at its worst. We have made amendments that have improved the Bill, although we had hoped that the amendments that we sent back to the Commons would have been approved.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="0802222000036"></a>On the amendment that my noble friend Lord Oakeshott moved earlier today on an independent audit, it is rather sad that the Government produced a technical argument to rebut it when we know that that is not their real reason. Why do they not just say what  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_379"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column 379</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the real reason is? We know that Mr Sandler, who is being consulted at every second by the Government, does not want the bother of independent auditors to upset what he is doing at this point. The amendment proposed that there should be an annual audit by the Bank of England, but the argument that that is defective because the Bank of England does not do audits does not stand up. The Bank of England could get other people in to carry out audits as its agents. There are arguments against the amendment but that one, frankly, is not valid. The same applies to the arguments about freedom of information. We have been back and forth over them and, much as I am tempted, I shall not go over them again, but we are equally unconvinced in that regard.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="0802222000037"></a>However, as noble Lords who sat through today&#146;s debates know, on several occasions, not least when talking about statutory instruments, I argued strongly that it was important that Northern Rock be nationalised tomorrow rather than at some time in the future. As we are very near tomorrow now, it would be inappropriate to test the opinion and the patience of the House by debating this further.</p>

<a name="0802222000038"></a><b><a name="80221-0016.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0802222000061"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to both noble Lords who have spoken in this short debate and I congratulate them on their powers of endurance over the hours in which we have been involved with the Bill. I congratulate particularly the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, who has substituted for the Opposition&#146;s regular Front-Bench spokesperson, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, whom we wish well in her recovery. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, made his contributions to our debates and enlivened our side of the House from time to time by some rather strident claims. However, I must warn him at this point that the Government who introduced the Freedom of Information Act are not going to be lectured by the Conservative Party on how the Act should be implemented.</p>

<a name="80221-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0802222000039"></a>I greatly enjoyed the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Newby. He said that we had promised a Bill of Rolls-Royce smoothness. In order to pass such a Bill through both Houses of Parliament, you need not only a determined Government but one with a majority of more than 600 in the upper House&#151;which, of course, the Conservatives enjoyed when they nationalised Rolls-Royce in 1971.</p>

He mentioned determination. Progress on the Bill has taken a lot of determination since it started 30 hours ago; it seems a long time ago, but it was only 30 hours ago. I began my speech yesterday by referring to a losing of trust because of the whole Northern Rock situation. Now we are being asked to trust the Government with this Bill. I do not think that anyone would disagree that we are in a Hobson&#146;s choice situation. We have to back the Bill and we wish it every success. However, the Government have been determined to push it

The Cross Benches have made an important contribution to our debates over the past 13 hours, particularly the noble Lord. I therefore re-emphasise his recognition of the importance of getting Northern Rock properly established to engage confidence in its operations and to return it&#151;as we intend to do, despite the contentions on the other side of the House about the extent to which we are bent upon nationalisation&#151;to the private sector as soon as we are able. I am grateful for the noble Lord&#146;s contribution, which enables me to thank the Cross Benches and the other two parts of the House for the way in which the Government have been pressed and tested with regard to the Bill.

<h4 align="center"><a name="08022195000005"></a>The Committee met at two o'clock.</h4>

<p><a name="08022195000008"></a><b><a name="80221-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08022195000163"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Northumberland (Structural Change) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000009"></a>The noble Baroness said: The order was laid on 8 January. Today we are debating five orders which bring into effect unitary authorities for Northumberland, Wiltshire, Durham, Cornwall and Shropshire. This initial debate addresses the Northumberland order, but since many of the same issues and processes will arise on each order, I hope the Committee will agree that it is sensible if I set out the main issues as context for the more detailed description of each case as we come to it. In that way, we will have a context for the individual situation and choices evident in each order without, I hope, too much repetition. I apologise to the Committee in advance: I have a rather long speaking note. However, I think it will serve the purpose of the Committee if we do it this way than if we have individual debates and I find myself repeating what I have said before.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000010"></a>I shall therefore explain to the Committee the general approach we have adopted to unitary restructuring; the precise approach we have taken&#151;</p>

I was about to explain to the Committee our general approach; our precise approach to assessing proposals, especially when looking at the criteria against which we have made our judgments; and our approach to implementation. I shall then address the points raised by the Merits Committee of this House and the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments in their reports, which I feel noble Lords would want me to do.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000013"></a>When we debated these issues in the context of the local government Act, I could refer only prospectively to the process which was then unfolding as we considered the merits of the various proposals put  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC24"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>forward as a result of the invitation issued to local councils to come forward with a proposal for restructuring the local area. The Committee does not need me to speak at any length about the principle which inspired this, or the way in which it was set out at every stage of the process, save to make the fundamental point that it was in no way driven or imposed by government, and that any invitation that was taken up was a local decision which reflected local aspiration and circumstances. In fact, we needed to be persuaded that a case had been made, based on the evidence that had been brought forward. We were also well aware that, like every other reorganisation of local government, there was bound to be controversy and local disagreement&#151;we certainly were not blind or deaf to that.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000014"></a>The orders that we are considering are the final legislative step in a process which started formally in October 2006 with the publication of the local government White Paper and the invitation to councils to submit proposals for unitary structures by 25 January 2007. I say that this is the final legislative step rather than the final step because, in terms of achieving the outcomes of better governance in the areas concerned, the order is but a milestone, albeit an important one.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000015"></a>If the orders are approved by Parliament, made and come into effect thereafter, there will in each of the areas concerned be a process of transformational change to deliver new local governance arrangements&#151;different arrangements that fit the circumstances of each area&#151;which both those who made the initial proposals, and we in government who evaluated them, believe are likely to facilitate the areas&#146; economic, environmental and social success. It is interesting to note not only how different are the six proposals that have come forward, but how clearly they demonstrate a difference in the notions of strategic leadership and neighbourhood engagement.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000016"></a>Our conclusions about two-tier and unitary local government and our decision to issue our invitation were based on extensive discussions across the country. That debate has continued during the past few months: there has been intensive debate within the new unitary areas. However, what is significant&#151;and it was evident in the debates on each order in another place&#151;is that although there has been heated local debate, involving particularly those who are loyal to the district councils that are being abolished, a genuine willingness has emerged to make work what has been undertaken.  In the areas which we are discussing today and in the very different proposals that have come forward, officials and elected members alike have put differences aside and have come together in a determination to work through what is best now for the local area as swiftly and as clearly as possible.  I pay tribute to all those who have been part of that process and who have served councils so well in the past. It is to the enormous credit of those who did not want to see a unitary council that they are now committed to making the process work and making the most of the benefits. They now need and seek the approval of Parliament.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000017"></a>That approval has been forthcoming.  As noble Lords know, these orders have been considered in detail in another place. The debates showed some sharply argued disagreements, sometimes between parties and sometimes within parties, but were good and constructive. A number of local MPs who opposed the decision and the process have committed to making it work.  That reflects the progress that has been made to make it a success.  I have every confidence that your Lordships will assist this process and support the orders, I hope without delay or division.</p>
<h5><a name="08022195000156"></a>2.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000018"></a>The most important point is that these orders represent successful advocacy and evidence from local authorities. Noble Lords will remember that some 26 proposals were submitted which followed consultation and rigorous assessment against the five criteria and led to the five orders we are considering today. Only nine proposals came forward.  There is a draft structural change order for Cheshire that we shall be considering another time, and the Government have yet to take a decision on proposals which they have received for unitary structures in Bedfordshire.  We decided not to implement 15 proposals and referred three proposals to the Boundary Committee for advice.  In short, we failed far more local authorities against the criteria we set than we passed.  </p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000019"></a>The local authorities before us today satisfied the criteria against which the proposals were assessed. Let me reiterate why we went down this path in the first place.  The aim was to put in place local governance that would best enable an area to achieve greater economic, social and environmental success. We set out criteria to reflect that aim. Our invitation set out three criteria which specified the outcomes that any new unitary form of local government, if it were to be implemented, should deliver.  It is significant that even those who opposed the eventual outcome have often made the case&#151;it has been a historic case in some instances&#151;for some unitary solution on the grounds that it offers greater clarity and accountability. Indeed, some have put forward alternative proposals for unitaries that did not meet the criteria&#151;for example, the district councils bid in Cornwall. These criteria focused  on strategic leadership, genuine opportunities for neighbourhood flexibility and empowerment and the delivery of value for money and efficiency in public services. The judgment against these criteria was necessarily prospective because it was about future outcomes if the proposal were to be implemented.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000020"></a>It was also important to consider not only what the proposal would achieve once implemented, but also the cost of the change. Would it be worth the candle?  Would it have sufficient support locally for the new unitary structure to be a success? Therefore, the invitation set out two additional and practical criteria to ensure that if a change were to be made, it would be able to succeed and that we would set up no new councils to fail. That meant, first, that those advocating change had to show that it was affordable and, secondly, that it would have the support of people who would ensure, pragmatically through their partnership and commitment, that its purposes would  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC26"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be achieved in terms of better services and better places for people to live. That is why we specified that there should be,</p>
<ul><a name="08022195000149"></a>&#147;a broad cross section of partners and stakeholders&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08022195000140"></a>These criteria also involve prospective judgments. </p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000021"></a>Since these criteria generated a great deal of public and parliamentary debate, I shall explain a bit more about them and how local authorities satisfied them. I shall take affordability first. For a proposal to meet the affordability criterion, the transitional costs must be expected to be more than offset by the savings that the proposal is estimated to generate, and that is expected to be achieved within less than five years. It also means that implementation will not involve capitalisation, using capital resources to meet revenue costs; it will not involve incurring costs that would have to be met by increasing the council tax; and to the extent that in any year the costs of transition are not covered by savings, they are expected to be met by council reserves.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000022"></a>In assessing all the proposals, the financial cases were subjected to rigorous scrutiny.  I am aware that some local authorities brought in their own academic reviews.  Quite rightly and properly, we engaged independent financial experts with wide experience in local government at chief finance officer level through CIPFA and the Institute of Public Finance to scrutinise the business cases and the additional information provided during the consultation process not only from the proposers, but also from those who expressed concerns about the financial viability.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000023"></a>For Northumberland and the other unitary proposals we are considering this afternoon, we are satisfied that there is a reasonable likelihood that all the outcomes specified by the affordability criterion will be achieved.  Our financial experts concluded that in financial terms the proposals were low risk.  Each of the new unitaries will effect projected annual savings of between over &#163;9 million and over &#163;18 million annually, a total of over &#163;75 million.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000024"></a>However, in relation to the definition of &#147;broad support&#148; there has been, predictably, the greatest and most heated debate. Therefore, it is very important that I set out what it means. It is, essentially, about whether the new unitary authority will genuinely meet its objectives and will work for local people.  We have done things differently from in the past.  No other reorganisation has proceeded by invitation. We have wanted to ensure, given the strain and stress in any change&#151;I know that noble Lords have been very concerned about this&#151;that the proposals would be tested against whether they would work because they had the support of those outside local government itself, who would have to make them work in the interests of local people.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000025"></a>Therefore, we deliberately did not look for public support, we did not require local referendums, and we did not make this a test of public opinion. We did not base support on whether a majority of stakeholders, of local citizens or of some other group of interested persons supported or approved the unitary proposal. In our original invitation we explicitly said that no single council or body, or group of councils or bodies,   


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC27"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would have a veto, and we recognised that a proposal might not carry consensus from or within all sectors. However, we thought that there needed to be sufficient confidence about the new council among those public sector bodies that will need to work with it.  There also needed to be confidence in the future prosperity and success of the area, which is why partnership with the business community, in its wider sense&#151;from tourism to public sector industries&#151;was a key element. There also needed to be a level of confidence about the improvements among local people, if the council&#146;s plans for community engagement and empowerment were to work. </p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000026"></a>Indeed, to reinforce that point, one of the proposals we received&#151;that from Somerset&#151;in our judgment met all the criteria fully apart from the support criterion. We considered that the bid commanded some support, but it was not sufficiently broad in range and we did not progress that proposal.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000027"></a>Therefore, I understand that much of the debate has turned on the nature and extent of public support, and in each area the prospect of change has been greeted differently, not least because we left it to local authorities to work out how they wanted to do this themselves and solicit opinion in the way they thought effective. A wide variety of methodologies was used, from Ipsos MORI polls to questionnaires and surveys, public information leaflets, meetings and focus groups. The opinion polls were usually postal polls or surveys, undertaken by the district councils. Inevitably, that provoked a great deal of heat and hostility to the prospect of change. There has been a febrile atmosphere in some local areas, with claims and counterclaims and a campaigning strategy has been evident, but in each case, although it has been variable, we have seen sufficient positive support for change in principle and in practice, which has led us to conclude that there is reasonable support for the proposal among local people. </p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000028"></a>For example, in Northumberland, the public sector support ranged from Northumbria University; the local NHS trust, the Northumberland Care Trust; the fire authority; the North East Chamber of Commerce; local businesses; and there was also significant campaign correspondence expressing a preference for a single unitary option.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000029"></a>It is significant that this approach to determining a broad level of support was precisely one of the grounds on which we were challenged in the courts last year. Last autumn, the court dismissed the challenge brought by Shrewsbury and Atcham, and Congleton. The court found conclusively that the Secretary of State was entitled to take the approach she had followed in relation to assessing proposals against the support criterion. That judgment is currently the subject of an appeal and we await the court&#146;s decision.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000030"></a>Much of that support is bolstered and, we believe, will grow due to the fact that each of the new unitaries, reflecting the size and range of the local authority itself, proposes to put in place new arrangements. The duty to involve, which we introduced in the Bill last year, will ensure that local people are represented properly, have local influence  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC28"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and will be connected in new ways to the local authority. That has been a very important part of what makes this a new organisation.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000031"></a>I turn briefly to implementation, the timetable and the impact on elections. Each of the orders provides for the creation of new single-tier local government from 1 April 2009, with the existing district councils being dissolved and the county council being transformed into a new unitary council with both district and county functions. They also put in place transition arrangements. Each one establishes an implementation executive to discharge transitional functions until elections are held, and provides for the creation of a team of officers to support the implementation executive.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000032"></a>In two cases&#151;Northumberland and Durham&#151;the orders provide for elections in May 2008. In Cornwall, Shropshire and Wiltshire they will be held in 2009, and the orders also provide for the cancellation of district elections in two districts which elect members by a third&#151;Penwith, and Shrewsbury and Atcham respectively. I stress that in each case the decisions on timetabling and the implementation processes have been driven by what local members and their officers think is best for their area.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000033"></a>I would like to cover three connected issues arising from this: first, elections; secondly, the reports of the JCSI and the Merits Committee; and, thirdly, the rationale for the county council as a continuing authority. I know that noble Lords raised the last issue when we debated the Bill.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000034"></a>As I explained, the orders make provision for elections in Durham and Northumberland in May 2008. Our approach to deciding when the first elections should be was essentially as follows. As a matter of principle and as a starting point, we believe that elections to the new unitary councils should be held as early as possible to reduce delay and disruption. That would point to elections in May 2008, but there were also reasons why that might not be appropriate or right for a locality.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000035"></a>The first reason was that, if there was a consensus among all councils and across all parties that the first elections should be in 2009, then, as a matter of principle in terms of devolution, we should adopt that. The second reason was that elections earlier than 2009 would necessarily be on the basis of existing wards or electoral divisions. In some cases, those simply did not fit with the neighbourhood or community arrangements envisaged as part of the new governance arrangements.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000036"></a>In Northumberland and Durham, there was agreement for elections to be held in May 2008 because the councils wanted to proceed rapidly to determine their future and felt able to do so. In Cornwall, Shropshire and Wiltshire, the councils accepted or agreed that the first elections should be in May 2009, thus allowing the Boundary Committee to undertake a full review of the electoral arrangements to reflect the new community governance arrangements in the proposals.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000037"></a>I turn to the reports of the Merits Committee of this House and the JCSI. The Committee will know that the Merits Committee reported on all five draft  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC29"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>orders, drawing attention to what it saw as the uncertain support, the cancellation of elections in some districts and parishes that would otherwise be held in May 2008, and the use of the orders to specify the structure and political balance of implementation executives.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000038"></a>The Committee will also know that the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments reported on the draft orders for Cornwall and Shropshire, and highlighted what it described as,</p>
<ul><a name="08022195000150"></a>&#147;an unexpected use of powers in specifying the membership and political balance of the Implementation Executive in each case&#148;. </ul>
<p><a name="08022195000141"></a>It also concluded that there was doubt as to whether, if the order was approved and made, its provisions on cancelling district council elections would be intra vires.</p>
<h5><a name="08022195000157"></a>2.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000039"></a>I have discussed the support for the proposals. The structure of the implementation executives was discussed and agreed in each case by the affected authorities, and it was the authorities themselves that asked us to cement the arrangements&#151;in some cases they had proved hard to negotiate&#151;by prescribing them in the orders, for the avoidance of any doubt in the future.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000040"></a>Noble Lords would expect that, with regard to the cancellation of district council elections, we would have considered the reports of the committees very carefully indeed, and we did so.  However, we remain of the view that there is both an overwhelming practical case for cancelling these elections and, on advice, that an order giving effect to this policy would clearly be defensible if legally challenged.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000041"></a>As we explained in our memorandums to the JCSI, the cancellation of the elections is based on compelling practical grounds. It is necessary to maintain the confidence of the electorate during the move to unitary local government. To press ahead for those district councils affected would have serious consequences. First, it would mean holding elections whose purpose would be open to question, since those elected on this occasion would not have key functions that those elected would normally be expected to undertake; those functions have been transferred to the implementation executive, as I explained. They would have nothing to do with setting budgets or council tax for the next year.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000042"></a>In such circumstances, there would be a question about whether candidates would be prepared to stand for a council left with only residual functions. Would there be any point in standing if one could not carry out any manifesto commitments? If there were candidates, could that not be confusing and damaging to an electorate who would have thought that they were voting for a fully functional councillor? It would also be extremely wasteful to elect an officer for less than 11 months; they would not have the opportunity to take key decisions, as I said.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000043"></a>The second point is about the defensibility of the order against legal challenge. We have been advised that, while there are valid concerns about our powers in the 2007 Act to provide in the order for the  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC30"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cancellation of district council elections, there are reasonable arguments that there is a power under that Act to make such provision. In short, there are two arguments, as my right honourable friend in another place set out in a letter that I passed on to the Front Bench, but I shall put it on record. The first argument is that Section 11 of the Act lists certain matters for which an implementation order may make provision, including &#147;electoral matters&#148;; I think that that is in subsection (4). Section 12 defines &#147;electoral matters&#148;, specifying a number of matters that fall within that definition. Although many of the matters listed in Section 12 appear to refer to the holding and not the cancellation of elections, it is arguable that Section 12 matters, particularly,</p>
<ul><a name="08022195000151"></a>&#147;the election of councillors for any electoral areas&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08022195000142"></a>are wide enough to cover the cancellation of elections.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000044"></a>There is an alternative argument, which is that Section 13 of the 2007 Act enables an order to include any,</p>
<ul><a name="08022195000152"></a>&#147;incidental, consequential, transitional, or supplementary provision&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08022195000143"></a>that that should be read broadly, and that it encompasses any matter which has a sensible connection to the main thrust of the order. Particularly given the powerful policy case for cancellation, it is arguable that election cancellation provision in the order is part and parcel of an efficient and effective implementation of the unitary proposal, and hence could be included under Section 13 powers.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000045"></a>We believe that there are precedents, both in terms of policy and legal powers, for the order&#146;s cancellation provision&#151;for example, a 1995 order on the restructuring of Humberside, made under the Local Government Act 1992. Our advice is that there are sufficient similarities between the Cornwall and Humberside orders for them to be seen as reasonable parallels.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80221-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000046"></a>Before I come on to Northumberland, I assure the Committee that we are clear that the process is not in any way the county council just carrying on and taking over the district councils.  This is a wholly new start. There will be new members, a refreshed senior management team, new and innovative service delivery and neighbourhood engagement arrangements, which we can discuss when we come to the individual orders. They will be new councils, even though they are technically continuing councils, because that approach reduces the turbulence in each area and makes the transfer process much smoother and more tolerable.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000047"></a>We are very concerned to ensure that this is as smooth a process for loyal and committed staff as possible, and the staff of each of the new unitaries will be treated in the same way. It is an unsettling time for employees of the affected authorities. Detailed arrangements are for the local councils as employers to consider, but we are putting in place a framework to ensure that all staff are treated fairly. We have made it clear that all staff employed immediately prior to 1 April 2009 by the authorities which are to be abolished will become employees of the new unitary authority and will be protected in line with the principles of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006&#151;  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC31"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC31</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>TUPE&#151;as if those regulations applied. We made that clear on 5 December. This means that all staff that transfer to a new unitary authority will do so on their current terms and conditions. It will then be for the new unitary councils to decide their new staffing structures in accordance with TUPE and employment legislation generally.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000048"></a>I am very grateful for the Committee&#146;s patience as I have set out that detail. I shall now say very briefly a few words just about the Northumberland order. In the case of Northumberland, we received two proposals&#151;one for a single-unitary authority, which this draft order implements, and another for a two-unitary authority solution for Northumberland, submitted by the district councils. As I told the House on 5 December, our judgment is that if the proposal for the single-unitary authority were to be implemented, there is a reasonable likelihood that it would achieve the outcomes specified by all five criteria in the invitation. That is our judgment. In contrast, I also told the House that in our judgment the proposal for a two-unitary Northumberland met only two of the five criteria&#151;those on neighbourhood empowerment and affordability.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000049"></a>On the basis of the proposal that we received, and having regard to all the other material and representations that we have received and to the advice provided by our independent financial experts, which shows the financial viability, the expectation is that the change in Northumberland will lead to annual savings of more than &#163;17 million. Therefore, the proposal is affordable.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000050"></a>Secondly, we judged that the proposal met the support criteria, which we have also discussed. I gave a few examples of that and the mixed response from the public. But in the north-east, we were also in the unique position of being able to look at the results of the referendum held in 2004, which asked voters explicitly whether they wanted unitary authorities. In Northumberland, two in five people said that they did&#151;I think that it was 44 per cent. Yes, a majority said that they did not want a unitary, but that was relatively narrow. There was support from public agencies for a single-unitary solution, and there were mixed views among town and parish councils, although the Northumberland Association of Local Councils expressed a preference for a single-unitary authority.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000051"></a>The order establishes the new unitary Northumberland Council, following consultation and full discussion with the councils, so that the arrangements that we are setting up are those which local people believe are best for them. The order provides that from 1 April 2009 there will be a single tier of local government in Northumberland. The existing district councils will be dissolved and the county council will be transformed into a new unitary council with both district and county functions. This is a wholly new start; there is no question of the county council simply taking over the district councils. There will be a refreshed senior management team and potentially, once elections are held in May 2008, new members.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000052"></a>Thirdly, the order makes provisions for the key transitional arrangements and provides for the establishment of an implementation executive to be  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC32"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>led by the county council, whose membership will be drawn from the county and all the district councils. The membership and make-up of the implementation executive was discussed in detail with all the affected councils and a consensus was reached and is reflected in the order.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000053"></a>The order provides that the county council will have the function of preparing for and facilitating the economic, effective, efficient and timely transfer of the district councils&#146; functions, property rights and liabilities to the respective new council. It also requires that these transitional functions be discharged by the implementation executive prior to the election of the new Northumberland Council in May 2008, which is the earliest practical date for fresh elections. That means that there will be a democratic mandate as early as possible.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000054"></a>To provide the necessary support for implementation, the orders also provide for the creation of a team of officers in each area, again drawn from the county and all the district councils. Those arrangements can start to bear fruit and deliver the outcomes that local people will rightly expect only if all the councils in each area work closely with each other. The order places duties on them to do so, and the indications are that this is happening.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000055"></a>The order provides for the next elections after May 2008 to be held in May 2013, which is the normal election day for county authorities. We recognise, of course, that after the May 2008 elections, the Boundary Committee and Electoral Commission will be undertaking electoral reviews in each of the new unitaries with the aim of revising as necessary the counties&#146; electoral divisions in light of the new unitary arrangements. Under the statute, it is for the Electoral Commission to decide when these new electoral arrangements should be implemented, be that at the 2013 elections or some special interim elections. In the discussion document last August, we explained that we thought that the first few years of a new unitary should be as stable as possible, to get the new council off to a good start. Such considerations would point to avoiding any interim elections between 2008 and 2013.</p>

We will be bringing forward those regulations over the coming months as we work them up in consultation with all the councils, trade unions and other key stakeholders.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000058"></a>I believe that this approach will provide for a transition that is effective, that avoids disruption to services and people, that gives a good deal to service users and citizens, that is fair and equitable to council staff, and that, above all, will open the door to the creation of, in each case, a council that will be more effective in giving power and influence to the people it represents and in promoting the prosperity of its area.

Two years after I arrived, a royal commission reported on the structure of local government in the shire areas of England. It recommended that there should be a single tier of all-purpose authorities&#151;this is quite interesting&#151;with an average population of between 800,000 and 900,000. The consequence would have been that every shire area would either have to be amalgamated with territory from elsewhere or lose territory.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000062"></a>Inevitably, the recommendation was opposed because everyone felt that there would be a loss of identity. There was almost united district council opposition; there was almost united Member of Parliament opposition because MPs identified very closely with their districts, as was entirely reasonable and proper, although there was never quite the same relationship with county councils; and there was remarkably strong opposition from Members of this House, many of whom served in local government. Some of them were simply not going to go to a county hall in some other county&#146;s territory&#151;you could not do that sort of thing in 1964. The result was that a very deep pigeonhole was found for that report, and the whole subject of the structure of local government has been a political football ever since, which is a matter of great regret.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000063"></a>What is worse is that, for 40 years, much of the best intellectual capacity and drive within local government has been distracted from the proper provision of services to the public that it serves because of the constant irritation of the possibility of this or that proposal being introduced at the whim of this or that Minister. I realise that I stand here as a shadow Minister and I say &#147;Heaven help me&#148; in this situation.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000064"></a>At the same time over those 40 years, we have seen an increasing centralisation of resources, of standards and of pressures on authorities to conform. It would therefore be nice if the Minister indicated that this is perhaps the end of the game, at least for the authorities that we are considering today, because without that assurance the exercise is worthless.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000065"></a>It is axiomatic that if you ask any group of people in a position of executive authority whether somebody else should do their job, the inevitable reaction is, &#147;Of course not. We&#146;re doing it very well&#148;. That is a position in which we still find ourselves: local councillors are rightly very proud of what they do. They are dedicated to making the system work.  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC34"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Whatever system the Government impose on them, they will do their level best to make it work. I pay tribute to all the work that was done, particularly by those in the areas which today&#146;s orders affect. They will now find they have a limit to their capacity to serve their communities. These are people who have often given much of their lives to serving their community, and we should honour them.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000066"></a>For some people, this is a matter of great sorrow and regret, but it has to be faced. The Minister made two points on which we need to concentrate, partly because they are relevant to the future. First, she used the phrase &#147;a reasonable level of support&#148;. She decided that 40 per cent was a reasonable level of support. Well, 40 per cent support indicates that 60 per cent might have no view, but they might be opposed&#151;it is difficult to read that. We need to recognise that the Government have judged that this is the way that they want to go, and they are to a certain extent fitting the facts to the theory, rather the theory to the facts. The electorate may make a judgment on that at some point in the future, not in local elections but in a national election. I was interested in the Minister&#146;s remarks, particularly in the light of other proposals which may come forward in the not too distant future.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000067"></a>The second point to which I wish to draw attention, because I find it slightly odd, is that, in two of today&#146;s cases, we are creating a situation where people will serve six years without election. That is not impossible or intolerable, but it is interesting because it is beyond a normal parliamentary term. We need to recognise that that is what we are doing: certain parish councils which have been on a three-year cycle and which were elected last year will remain in a valid elected position until 2013. That is the reality. I am grateful to the Minister for her letter setting out the justification for the electoral processes for parish councillors, which rightly raised the interest of, and appropriate comment from, the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. We need to recognise that it is an oddity.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000068"></a>There is not much more that I want to say. If the proposal for Northumberland is the endgame, whether I like it or not becomes irrelevant: it will be in the best interests of the community. However, if there is any possibility of this subject being reopened, at least in the foreseeable future, it would be better if we were not doing this at all.</p>

Adopting what is almost a Second Reading procedure is absolutely right on this occasion, and I will respond in the same way. I will make most of my remarks now, and only refer occasionally to specifics on each order&#151;unless I am provoked. We on these Benches have always held the view that the principle of unitary authorities is right for all the arguments with which we are familiar: clarity, economies of scale and so on. From that point of view, we have no problem with the Government&#146;s presumption that unitaries were probably the way forward. However, we have problems with how it is  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC35"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rolled out. I have had a great deal of correspondence on this over the past six months, which can broadly be put into three categories. Some simply do not agree that unitaries are the right way forward. Some think they probably are but are very unhappy about a lack of clarity, particularly in the process that the Government adopted. The last category consists of those who were broadly happy with the first two, but are now unhappy with how it is rolling out.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000070"></a>We identified the basic problem when the Act was going through your Lordships&#146; House; namely, this sense that there is no real strategic vision for local government&#151;its shape, size, form and function. There is a sort of vague &#147;one tier good, two tier bad&#148; thread running through the White Paper and the Act. However, lots of people in local government did not feel that that was backed up by robust analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the current system, and whether that would be better addressed by closer two-tier working or unitaries.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000071"></a>A sense of a lack of clarity about the balance between, on the one hand, issues such as strategic leadership and economies of scale and, on the other, questions of local responsiveness certainly came strongly through that. One of the best examples of that is, indeed, Northumberland&#151;the subject of the order we are discussing now&#151;where many of the large organisations, such as the business community, voluntary groups and so on, were very much in favour of a unitary model for the county. They could see that it would assist them in their work.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000072"></a>However, it is fairly clear that a significant proportion of the population was not happy with that model, and preferred the two-tier solution. That is not surprising. Northumberland is very much a county of two halves. My noble friend Lady Maddock, who cannot be here today, has pointed out to me that, in the south-east of the county, the population density is 10.6 people per hectare; in the remainder, there are three hectares per person. There is a very different feel. They have a different set of problems to do with sparsity, second homes and so on. It has been clearly picked up that people do not feel content with rule from an urban area; they think that they will not be understood. The Government have in some ways unintentionally made that worse, by insisting on what they call the &#147;strong leader&#148; model, such as elected mayors or having all the power vested in one person. I genuinely believe that, under a model which gave local authorities more flexibility to choose their governance styles, counties like Northumberland could have come up with a governance solution which might have addressed rural areas&#146; concerns. However, I feel strongly that that option has now been taken away. Whether the leader comes from the urban part or the rural part, as sure as eggs are eggs, the other side will think that they are not being properly represented or looked after.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000073"></a>There is an issue with the reduction in the number of councillors&#151;in Northumberland, for example, from 305 down to 67. There are probably people who say &#147;Jolly good job, too&#148;. Nevertheless, whether one thinks that it is a good or a bad thing, it will  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC36"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fundamentally alter the nature of the role of councillors. There really has not been enough debate around that.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000074"></a>When councils were asked to make their case for unitary status, they did so without a real sense of what they were aiming at&#151;what they had to tell the Government in order to win. The Government&#146;s tests were too vague&#151;all rather motherhood and apple pie. As a result, local authorities have provided information that obviously is partial. They provide the information that suits their case, as is perfectly natural. The Government can argue that this is a bottom-up process but that does not absolve them from the responsibility of checking whether councils&#146; assertions about levels of local support can be properly verified. That is the point that the Merits Committee makes.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000075"></a>I was intrigued by the noble Baroness&#146;s citing of Somerset, which apparently ticked all the boxes but, because there was not sufficient public support, the bid did not go ahead. It fell not on any intrinsic merit but because the case failed to be made. In my local area of Ipswich, the council had its knuckles rapped by the Minister in another place for spending too much money on public information. Where an authority is trying to make the case and build up a campaign, that is wrong, but if it does not do so it loses the bid. The Government need to think about that.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000076"></a>I very much welcome the noble Baroness&#146;s assurance about the abolition of existing councils and the fact that the unitaries will be genuinely new. That topic was discussed at some length during the various stages of the Bill last year. However, the Government have not listened enough to the arguments that we put forward then. I understand that there are technical reasons why they want to proceed in the way that they have, but that has ignored some of the local sensitivities about continuing authorities and the perception of &#147;county takeover&#148;. I imagine that my noble friend Lord Tyler may have some words to say about the Cornish situation, but it is the same across the country. It has become particularly difficult in Durham, where the county council insists on calling the new authority &#147;the county council&#148;. The order is clear that it is not the county council. However, the county council deciding that it is going to use that term has put it at odds with the districts, which are now talking about taking out some kind of injunction. I hope that the Minister will take that away, have a word with her colleagues in Durham and send them the order in very large font.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000077"></a>I wish to ask some questions and make some comments about elections. The first is on the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, about the postponement of parish council elections to 2013. We are not quite into Fidel Castro territory but, nevertheless, they are long terms of office, especially in some places where people were not elected in the first place but co-opted or whatever. The Government could look at that.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000078"></a>I am concerned about the capacity of the Boundary Committee to do the work that it has to do in time for next year&#146;s elections. I understand from  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC37"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>debates in another place that Ministers are confident that it can all be done by February 2009, but that is very tight for elections to be held next May. There is no room for slippage. If parliamentary orders are required, there could be some difficulties.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000079"></a>Durham has again been in touch with me, because the Boundary Committee proposes that it has three sets of elections in five years&#151;one this year, another in 2010 and another in 2013. What strikes me as odd about that is that the Government are defending the postponement or cancellation of elections in Cornwall and Shropshire on the basis that having too many sets of elections would be expensive and confusing, yet that is exactly what is proposed for Durham. That lack of consistency is confusing.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000080"></a>I will leave my comments at that. It is fair to say that these Benches have concerns about the process so far, and I have raised some of them. However, the authorities have gone a long way down the road. There is a lot of uncertainty for councillors and staff, but most importantly they are the people who provide the vital services. Our very strong feeling is that we need to progress this now and let them get on with it. If the Government have got it wrong, it is for them to sort it out at some later date and pay the price, but at this point we feel that we would like to see the orders moved through.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000081"></a>However, I hope that, once the orders are through, there will not be a sense of the Government breathing a sigh of relief and saying, &#147;That is it; we can move on&#148;. We are at the start of the process with Cheshire and Bedfordshire and authorities such as Norwich and Ipswich are further down the road. I hope that some of the lessons that we have learnt from this can be taken forward so that we do not have the same debate in 12 months&#146; time.</p>

<p><a name="08022195000082"></a><b><a name="80221-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08022195000168"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> This has been a fascinating debate. As the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said, it has been almost like a Second Reading debate: very thoughtful and much informed by people who have had many years&#146; experience in local government, which shows.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000083"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, I was involved in the reorganisation of 1974, when there was the nitty-gritty of transferring assets and staff and deciding which jobs were ring-fenced and which went out to public advertisement and so on. We have been through it once. I was also involved in very constructive discussions with his right honourable friend in the other place, David Curry, when it looked as though there might be further progression.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000084"></a>What 1974 taught me was that going from the original concept of a unitary to a two-tier structure in places such as Plymouth, Bristol&#151;my own authority&#151;Nottingham and Leicester, which became district councils, the citizens paid a cost as regards transparency and accountability. The result was that services such as housing and social services, which should be together, were splintered. Other services, such as planning, were concurrent; others were overlapping, such as environmental health and weights and measures; and some services, such as  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC38"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC38</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>highways, were delivered by agency. The result was that each district council had a different set of arrangements with the county council regarding the services that it did or did not offer.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80221-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000085"></a>As a result, the poor public did not know who did what, to what level of service, at what price and whom to hold accountable. There cannot be decent local government if there is not sufficient transparency to produce accountability. From that, I learnt the desirability of unitary authorities. Whether they should be county councils or enlarged district authorities depends on the assessment or judgment in local areas about the appropriateness of service delivery and the needs and cohesion of the local community. I am open-minded about that, but I am convinced that they need to be unitary.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000086"></a>The second point, already touched on briefly by my noble friend, is that you cannot have reorganisation by popular plebiscite. I know it was not done by plebiscite in 1974. As the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, rightly said, Norwich would have been against it and the country would have been for it&#151;plus c&#146;est la même chose. You cannot do it by plebiscite and it was not done by plebiscite in the mid-1990s. There are some good reasons for that&#151;for example, boundary extensions; I remember Plymouth back in the 1950s having boundary extensions. Anyone in the adjacent area who currently enjoys urban services but at lower rates because they are in rural areas&#151;I mean this in no moral sense at all&#151;is effectively free-riding on some of those urban services. I do not criticise them as they are absolutely entitled to use those services, but why would they want to see any such boundary extension when they already receive the services at a cheaper rate than those in the city area?</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000087"></a>A second reason for not thinking that a plebiscite is the appropriate way forward is that what makes local government work is not just a head count in democracy&#151;too often councils are composed of the few people who can be bothered to stand, elected by the few who can be bothered to vote&#151;but a community of interest locally. I refer to voluntary organisations, which may be instrumental in addressing social services problems or working with challenged families, faith groups and, above all, businesses, whose ability to work smoothly and easily with the planning authorities ensures that local authorities get the economic growth, the green growth and investment in industry that they want to see. They are major players in the life of the community and there is no way in which one can pick them up in a plebiscite. You have to hear their voices, which is why I very much welcome my noble friend&#146;s remarks about seeing who the stakeholders are. You need to ensure that the major stakeholders and those who in a pragmatic way&#151;I believe that was the word she used&#151;deliver local government services believe that they can make it work in the best interests of the people of their community.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000088"></a>I wish these orders well and I very much hope that the House will support the Government in all ways possible.</p>

In these debates, I am always conscious that I am confronting noble Lords with many years of experience and great commitment to local government. I always feel that I am a relative novice on this, and I stand in awe of that collective experience.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000090"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and my noble friend took us through some of that history and made me aware again that the concept of the unitary council has a long and honourable, if somewhat complicated, history. It commands a lot of intrinsic support and receives positive responses. I am equally aware from the passion with which the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, spoke that, as we have searched for better solutions for things, there has inevitably been disruption. I join him in all that he said about the work of local government. He said it with a full heart. It was partly because of our awareness of that sort of distraction, and our desire to minimise it, that we did things by invitation this time.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000091"></a>I assure the noble Lord that we do not have hidden plans for future change or a rolling programme up our sleeves. During the debate on the local government Bill, I said several times that we have no plans for a rolling programme, restructuring or any further invitations to councils. As the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, said, we are where we are now with other aspects of this initiative. We have some way to go with the outstanding councils and there is no rolling programme, but we recognise that in certain areas there might in future be an appetite for more unitary structures and it might be right to issue a targeted and focused invitation, but under specific and exceptional circumstances. This programme has been discrete and sufficient unto itself.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000092"></a>The noble Lord raised a point about the length of elections, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Scott. For those county councils which are moving to hold elections in 2008, we are conscious that when the Electoral Commission and Boundary Committee carry out their review, they might indicate that 2010 is a better alternative to 2013. Our feeling is that we need as much stability as possible. While it is up to the Electoral Commission to make its recommendations&#151;it has the power to do so&#151;our view is that we should be looking for stability. I feel fairly confident that the Electoral Commission and Boundary Committee will take into account the views of the people they are working with as a result of these changes. They will look at the implications, the local geography and so on, and I am sure that they will have regard to the representations they receive. We cannot second-guess them but we have made it clear that, although it is a longer time than usual, it is probably wise to have stability.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000093"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scott, raised a point about parishes. Parish council elections are usually held at the same time as elections to the principal authority. That is a sensible use of resources and sensible timing. The problem is that parish councils  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC40"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are not always successful in finding people to stand, so one has to look at the conservation of resources as well. Most parishes held elections in 2007 and we think that having to hold elections again in 2008 or 2009 would be disruptive. Most local authorities agree with us, and many parishes that responded also agree. The order cancels parish elections so that they can be held at the same time as future elections.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000094"></a>[<I>The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 3.20 to 3.30 pm.</I>]</p>

My right honourable friend said this in the other place in response to similar concerns; we have always recognised that six-year terms are not ideal, so with the 2009 elections we would ask the implementation executive to consult the parishes and county and consider moving parish election dates if that is wanted locally. These long and indefinite periods are not set in stone.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000096"></a>The noble Baroness raised important points about the nature of Northumberland. I appreciate that the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, is not here, as she would speak very eloquently on these matters. We recognise the sparsity and the differences between parts of a very large county, but there are a lot of cross-commuter flows these days; it is not as if those rigid distinctions and barricades are as high as they used to be. There is a high degree of strategic co-ordination. One thing that is most encouraging about the process is the way in which each of these authorities has come forward with community governance arrangements.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000097"></a>The noble Baroness referred to the character of Northumberland. The area partnerships of local partners and stakeholders will be based on area committees, based on three characteristic communities: the urban south-east, the rural commuter belt and the genuinely rural north and west. Underneath those, they are creating what they rather beautifully call &#147;belonging communities&#148;&#151;26 community areas that will have some powers and opportunities devolved to them, which will also include people from councils and the VCS, and so on. It will give people who feel the loss of their district councils another form of local influence, visibility, profile and connection. We have seen that in all the different proposals that have come forward in different ways. I hope that that will help to make that transition more comfortable for people and that they will be effective bodies.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000098"></a>The noble Baroness also raised the question about what to call the new council in Durham. In the order, as she said, the authority is called the County Durham Council. The order adapts its approach to reflect the new start and specifically provides that all members of the current Durham County Council cease to hold office on the fourth day after the 2008 election day. There should be no doubt that that is what is intended.</p>

<p><a name="08022195000144"></a>In other words, it is acting in contravention of the order. This could be seen as angels dancing on the head of the pin over a name, but locally it is particular important given the sensitivities of Durham city and Durham county. It is also important because of the legal position, which has led to the city seeking an injunction to stop the county using the term &#147;the county council&#148;; it wants the county to use the term expressly set out in the order.</p>

They expect the reviews to be completed by February of that year. Those bodies are very efficient and I think we can take comfort from that.</p>

<h5><a name="08022195000160"></a>3.35 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08022195000102"></a><b><a name="80221-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08022195000173"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Wiltshire (Structural Change) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000103"></a>The noble Baroness said: This order, which was laid on 8 January, establishes the new unitary Wiltshire Council. It implements a proposal which Wiltshire County Council submitted to us in response to our invitation to councils issued in October 2006 in parallel with our White Paper. We have judged its proposal against the same five criteria set out in our invitation to councils, against which, as I discussed earlier, we assessed all 26 of the proposals that we originally received.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000104"></a>As I informed the House on 5 December, our judgment is that, if the proposal for a unitary Wiltshire were implemented, there is a reasonable likelihood that it would achieve the outcomes specified by all five criteria in the invitation&#151;that is, we believe that the proposal, if implemented, would achieve the outcomes on strategic leadership, neighbourhood flexibility, empowerment, delivery of value for money and efficiency in public services as specified in the criteria. Equally, we believe that, if made, the change would be affordable and would be supported by a broad cross-section of partners and stakeholders.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000105"></a>Our judgment on affordability reflects Wiltshire County Council&#146;s proposal. Having regard to all the other material and representations we have received, including the advice which our independent financial experts provided on the financial viability of the  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proposals, the expectation is that the change in Wiltshire will lead to savings of more than &#163;18 million.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000106"></a>Our judgment is that the proposal meets the support criterion which we discussed earlier in this debate. In the case of Wiltshire, the consultation last spring revealed both support and concerns. There is wide support from the business community. Most local chambers of commerce, for example, express support for the proposal. There was a substantial response to the consultation from members of the public, the vast majority of it in campaign form and by postal ballot. Two-thirds were opposed and one-third in favour. There was also an Ipsos MORI survey, which showed that 78 per cent agreed that councils should work together more closely. That was the only conclusion supported by subordinate questions.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000107"></a>Many public sector stakeholders who responded cited the benefits of a single unitary council for Wiltshire. These benefits included coterminosity with its own boundaries and the gains that would arise through rationalised partnership working. Many of the local strategic partnerships welcomed the idea in Wiltshire&#146;s proposals for area boards.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000108"></a>Some voluntary and community sector respondents felt that a unitary Wiltshire Council would eliminate confusion over roles and responsibilities, although the majority were concerned that the unitary council might be too large and remote.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000109"></a>The district councils had concerns about the affordability of the proposal and about the support for it. The Wiltshire Association of Local Councils consulted its membership, which expressed a range of views from welcoming a unitary Wiltshire to having concerns about it.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000110"></a>It is clear from that that there was a wide range of views across all sectors. However, in the terms of the criterion discussed above, our judgment is that the proposal would command a broad cross-section of support from a range of stakeholders, both in the public and private sector as well as some support from the general public, and that this would make the proposal workable and effective.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000111"></a>Turning to the order, as with the Northumberland order and all the orders we are discussing today, it is by no means a &#147;one size fits all&#148; approach, but one which allows each of these authorities to adopt the arrangements best suited to it. This order, on Wiltshire, was prepared following consultation and full discussion both with Wiltshire County Council and all the other affected councils in the area. The order provides that, from 1 April 2009, there will be a single tier of local government in Wiltshire and that the existing district councils will be dissolved and the county council transformed into a new unitary council having both district and county functions.  It makes provisions for the key transitional arrangements, and provides for the establishment of an implementation executive to be led by the county council, whose membership will be drawn from the county and all the district councils. As in all the areas for which we are considering orders today, the membership and make-up of the implementation  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC43"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>executive was discussed in detail with all the affected councils and a consensus reached. That is reflected in the order.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000112"></a>The order provides that the county council will have the function of preparing for and facilitating the economic, effective, efficient and timely transfer of the district councils&#146; functions, property, rights and liabilities to the new council. It requires that these transitional functions be discharged by the implementation executive, which will remain responsible for these functions until April 2009 when the functions, assets and liabilities of the district councils are transferred. It provides for the creation of a team of officers in each area, again drawn from the county and all the district councils, to provide the necessary support to the implementation executive.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000113"></a>Where this order differs from that for Northumberland is that, in Wiltshire, elections to the new unitary Wiltshire Council will take place in line with the usual county cycle in May 2009. There was agreement between the county and the district councils that elections should be held in May 2009. As I said, we understand that the Electoral Commission will be able to undertake an electoral review by this time, and put in place electoral arrangements that have regard to the new community and neighbourhood arrangements reflected in that proposal.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000114"></a>In short, the order establishes a new unitary Wiltshire council that will have the form of local governance that local people should expect and demand. It will empower local communities, promote prosperity and deliver high quality services. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000115"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Wiltshire (Structural Change) Order 2008. <I>6th Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, 7th Report from the Merits Committee</I>.&#151;(<I>Baroness Andrews</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="08022195000116"></a><b><a name="80221-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08022195000174"></a>Lord Geddes:</b> I intervene not as an expert&#151;I am in a minority of one on that score&#151;but simply as a resident of Wiltshire. I have four brief points for the Minister, and then a request.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000117"></a>The first, smallest, point is that the Minister said in her opening remarks that there has been consideration in detail in another place. That rather depends on the definition of &#147;detail&#148;. Others might take a slightly different view.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000118"></a>My most substantive point, to which the Minister has just referred, is about consultation and its results. As we know, the Department for Communities and Local Government has, as its second objective against which it is meant to assess the plans for unitary councils, the requirement that they,</p>
<ul><a name="08022195000154"></a>&#147;be supported by a broad cross-section of partners and stakeholders&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08022195000145"></a>In another place, my honourable friend the Member for Westbury said,</p>
<ul><a name="08022195000155"></a>&#147;there is no support worthy of the name for the proposal in the county of Wiltshire. There are no grounds for the Minister&#146;s opinion, given in his letter of 25 July 2007 to Wiltshire county council&#146;s chief executive, that the proposals would &#145;command a broad cross section of support from a range of stakeholders&#146;.  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC44"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC44</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Furthermore, the breezy assertion that there would be &#145;some support from the general public&#146; is true only in the most literal sense, with &#145;some support&#146; meaning more than no support&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 5/2/08; col. 924.]</ul>
<p><a name="08022195000146"></a>My honourable friend has told me, and he repeated it at col. 924, that he has photocopies of all the responses that came in from Wiltshire. There is no doubt that, by any criterion, the vast weight of those responses was against the order.</p>
<h5><a name="08022195000161"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000119"></a>My second point is brief but pertinent and regards costs. Wiltshire County Council&#146;s submission did not cost the proposal for area governance based on 20 areas. The county submitted a costing of some &#163;868,000 as the cost for its area governance proposals. Her Majesty&#146;s Government were apparently content to accept that neighbourhood empowerment could be obtained for that sum, which works out at some &#163;43,000 per area. I repeat that I am not an expert in local government, but that seems to be an astonishingly low sum. The Minister may want to comment on it.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000120"></a>My final point before my request regards the pending appeal to which the noble Baroness referred. It relates directly to Shropshire but, although I am talking only for Wiltshire, I am sure that it has clear implications for the other orders. It seems extraordinary that Her Majesty&#146;s Government would press forward with the orders when the result of that appeal hearing is imminent. In this context, I genuinely try to help Her Majesty&#146;s Government by saying that there have been instances in the not too distant past where the Government have fallen foul of the law and have had to backtrack. It might help the Government quite a lot if there were a slow-down in the process pending the result of that appeal. It could save a lot of embarrassment and it would not do a lot of harm.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000121"></a>I do not expect that the Minister will agree with my first request but I shall make it for the record: it is that Her Majesty&#146;s Government withdraw the order for Wiltshire or, to use her terminology, &#147;do not progress with it&#148;. If she is not able to help me in that respect, I earnestly ask her to postpone consideration, or at least approval, of the order pending the result of the appeal to the High Court.</p>

<p><a name="08022195000122"></a><b><a name="80221-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08022195000175"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> I hesitate to intervene but I have a general question about all the orders. The wording in Article 6 of each of them is similar, stating:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022195000148"></a>&#147;On the coming into force of this Order there shall be added to the functions of the Wiltshire council the function, which is to be exercisable only during the transitional period ... of preparing for and facilitating the ... effective, efficient and timely transfer of the district councils&#146; functions, property, rights and liabilities&#148;. </p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022195000147"></a>Nowhere in the orders or the Explanatory Notes is it explained, apart from implicitly in Article 9, where they are to be transferred to. Having looked at what happened with Northern Rock, I found myself naughtily wondering about that. I am sure that the Minister will explain that this is a standard way of drafting the orders, but it is a peculiarity to which I would have objected.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000123"></a>I turn to my noble friend&#146;s point. I have had a long correspondence with the Government Whips&#146; Office on what to do about the Cheshire orders, which are due to come forward in about a fortnight. I shall summarise the correspondence: &#147;Would you agree a date?&#148;. &#147;Hang on a minute. That is subject to a judicial appeal. I don&#146;t think we should hear it until we have the result of the appeal.&#148; &#147;Do you know something I do not know?&#148; One thing that the Whips&#146; Office knew that I did not was that the judicial review was heard and the Government won, as the noble Baroness said. It has since been appealed. However, the judge said, in accepting the situation, that none the less it was thought that the audit should progress. I said, &#147;Fine, I understand that, but what happens if the judgment goes against the Government? Will the Government have to backtrack?&#148;. The reply was, &#147;Well, it would depend on the terms on which the judgment was made&#148;. That is why my noble friend&#146;s point is important.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000124"></a>The judge would have the power to find against the Government but, because of administrative and other costs already incurred, would not stop the process going forward. That struck me as an improper use of force majeure. I was told that, even if that were so, there was still no reason for the orders not to go forward because we did not know what the judge was going to decide and when he was going to decide it. Therefore, after two and a half pages of swapping e-mails, I had to climb down and agree a date for Cheshire. This is the dilemma that we face: the Government are in a procedurally correct situation that is not satisfactory, but there is nothing that we can do about it, so there we are. I do not know whether I have saved the Minister some trouble, but that is the position we are in.</p>

<p><a name="08022195000125"></a><b><a name="80221-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08022195000176"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord for going through that process. He was absolutely correct about the judgment that we had before Christmas. We were able to proceed. However, as I said in my opening speech, we wanted to reduce the delay and disruption as much as possible to give some certainty to those authorities with which we had agreed proposals.</p>

<p><a name="08022195000126"></a>Whether the order is quashed will now be within the discretion of the court and we will have to await the judgment. The court could find against the Government but could also decide not to quash the order, so there are clearly a number of possible options. We shall just have to await the judgment of the court.</p>

I was grateful for how the noble Lord addressed the other important points. With regard to what he said about the degree of detailed scrutiny in the other place, we have more detached debate on these issues in this place, and it is incumbent on me seriously to address the questions that the noble Lord raises.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000135"></a>On popular support, I do not want to reiterate what I said at some length in my opening speech. However, in Wiltshire, there was both a significant amount of campaign correspondence and an Ipsos MORI poll surveying about 1,200 residents. What was interesting about the postal polling was that, as was borne out by some academic work in Shropshire, postal polls of this order are not subject to the rigour of voting by post. The Electoral Reform Society may be involved but it does not oversee the process in that way, so there is a question over the validity of how some of that polling reflects genuine opinion. We must therefore be careful about how we treat some of it, which is what we said in our correspondence. Nevertheless, about a third of those returns showed that people were in favour.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000136"></a>The other bit of polling in Wiltshire showed that 78 per cent of residents were in favour of the status quo but were looking for more co-operation between councils. When they were asked the question in another way, 81 per cent said that they wanted more information on any proposal before making a proper decision, and 53 per cent agreed that with a single council it would be clearer to demonstrate who was responsible. I said that there was a balance of opinion but it is when you get under the radar of some of these questions and how they are asked that you determine a sense that people want an improvement on the two-tier system.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000137"></a>I also said at the beginning that we never intended this to be a popular referendum, for the reasons given by my noble friend. That would not show to anyone&#146;s satisfaction that there would be something deliverable at the end of the day. You tap into emotion and  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC47"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC47</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>loyalty, which are perfectly valid, but perhaps that is not what you should be looking for in introducing a change of this sort, when you need to deliver better local government and better services.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022195000138"></a>We determined that there was a broad cross-section of support in Wiltshire. We found that there was support from many public sector stakeholders, many in the voluntary and community sector, most of the business chambers and, as I said, some of the general public. On that basis, we judged that it was right to proceed because we had a broad cross-section of support. It was interesting that some of that was reflected in the debate in another place in the responses of local Members of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="08022195000139"></a><b><a name="80221-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="08022195000185"></a>Lord Geddes:</b> I am most grateful to the noble Baroness. I have just two points. First, on the &#147;favourable&#148; statistics that she cited, if I can call them that&#151;and she is quite right to cite them in the Government&#146;s favour&#151;she mentioned the remark about the Electoral Reform Society not quite having supervision of the two-thirds/one-third result. What happened on the results that were in the Government&#146;s favour? Did the Electoral Reform Society have a view on that? Why should one give more credence to one set of figures than another? Secondly, the noble Baroness has now emphasised twice, with great skill, that one-third approved. I am sure that that is right, but two-thirds did not.</p>

<p><a name="080221116000005"></a><b><a name="80221-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="080221116000096"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> The noble Lord is quite right: two-thirds did not. I cannot argue with that. I was making a general point about the Electoral Reform Society. Many districts commissioned their own polls by postal votes, campaign cards and so on, and the Electoral Reform Society was involved in collecting the product, but it was not a supervisory agency in the way that it is when we put postal voting in place for elections. There is not that degree of scrutiny, so you do not always know that you are getting what you seem to be getting. The Ipsos MORI poll was done with orthodox polling: you ask questions and you get a different sort of result.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000006"></a>We have dealt with the situation in relation to the JR. I hope the noble Lord thinks that we dealt with that sufficiently. Finally, as much as I would like to be able to accept his suggestion to withdraw the order, I am afraid I have to resist it.</p>

<p><a name="080221116000007"></a>It is very interesting to read the debate in the other place. Tribute was paid to the leader of the council, Jane Scott, in relation to the capacity of the new council to deliver on its promises as set out in the unitary proposal. Members of Parliament who had been bitterly opposed at various stages of the process came round to say that this proposal is in safe hands and can be made to work with that leader. We recognise that it is important to give that support at this stage.</p>

<h5><a name="080221116000092"></a>4.02 pm</h5>

<p><a name="080221116000010"></a><b><a name="80221-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="080221116000098"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the County Durham (Structural Change) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000011"></a>The noble Baroness said: We now come to Durham. The order establishes the new unitary County Durham Council. It implements a proposal that Durham County Council submitted to us in response to our invitation to councils issued in October 2006 in parallel with our White Paper. We have judged this proposal against the same five criteria set out in our invitations to councils against which, as I discussed earlier, we assessed all 26 of the proposals that we originally received.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000012"></a>Again, as I informed the House on 5 December, our judgment was that if this proposal for the single unitary Durham Council were implemented, there would be a reasonable likelihood that it would achieve the outcomes specified by all five criteria in the invitation. That is, we believe that the proposal, if implemented, will achieve the outcomes on strategic leadership, neighbourhood flexibility, empowerment, delivery of value for money and efficiency in public services specified in the criteria. Equally, we believe that the change, if made, is affordable and is supported by a broad cross-section of partners and stakeholders. We also received a proposal for a unitary authority from a number of district councils. However, we judged that that proposal was not reasonably likely to meet any of the criteria.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000013"></a>Our judgment on affordability reflects Durham County Council&#146;s proposal and, having regard to all the other material and representations we have received, including the advice that our independent financial experts provided on the financial viability of the proposals, the expectation is that the change in Durham will lead to savings of more than &#163;11 million annually once the new unitary council is established. Our judgment on the support criterion reflects that there was support from public agencies including, for example, the PCT, the strategic health authority, the police and fire and rescue. There was also support from the North East Chamber of Commerce and the CBI. All those from the business sector who responded expressed broad support.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000014"></a>There was a mixed response from the public. Responses during the consultation were fairly evenly split between those expressing concerns and those highlighting the benefits. As with Northumberland, we were able to look at the results of the referendum held in 2004, which asked voters explicitly whether they wanted unitary authorities. In Durham, of those who voted, 50.6 per cent supported a single Durham unitary. In short, the evidence we received, in particular that which I have just described, led us to conclude that if the proposal is implemented, the expectation is that the level of support for it will be sufficient for it to be a success.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000015"></a> As with the previous orders, this order is not &#147;one size fits all&#148;. It is a specific approach that allows local government in Durham to adopt the arrangements best suited to it. We therefore prepared this order following consultation and full discussion with the Durham County Council and all the affected authorities in the area. Like the order establishing Northumberland, this one provides that from, 1 April 2009, there will be a single tier of local government in Durham. The existing district councils will be dissolved, and the county council will be transformed into a new unitary council having both district and county functions. It makes provisions for the key transitional arrangements, in particular providing for the establishment of an implementation executive to be lead by the county council, whose membership will be drawn from the county and all the district councils. The membership and make-up of the implementation executive was discussed in detail with all the affected councils. A consensus was reached, which is reflected in the order. It provides that the county council will have the function of preparing for and facilitating the economic, effective, efficient and timely transfer of the district councils&#146; functions, property, rights and liabilities to the new council. The order provides that those transitional functions be discharged by the implementation executive prior to the election of the new County Durham Council in May 2008. It also provides for the creation of a team of officers in each area to provide the necessary support for implementation, again drawn from the county and all the district councils.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000016"></a>Like the Northumberland order, this order provides for elections in 2008, which is outside the normal county council election cycle, so it also makes consequential provision so that the following elections are in 2013. That restores Durham to the normal election cycle for county authorities. We have already discussed, in the context of the Northumberland order, the role of the Boundary Committee and Electoral Commission in determining when the new electoral arrangements should be implemented. The issues are the same for Durham.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000017"></a>In short, this order will establish a new unitary County Durham which, in common with the others we have been discussing today, will have the form of local governance that local people should expect and demand. I beg to move.</p>

As an old county councillor, I am bound to say that that will lead to a great deal of confusion because it will not in fact be a county council; it will be a council for County Durham, which is quite properly made clear in the order. I am deliberately putting on the record that I think that it ought to be told quite clearly that this will lead to  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>confusion because, although I entirely accept that there is only one council for County Durham, there are a lot of county councils. The noble Baroness is a serving member of one, I am an ex-member of another and other noble Lords here have a similar history. There is a clear distinction. It would be useful if that was explained in plain English to the implementation committee in County Durham.</p>

<p><a name="080221116000020"></a><b><a name="80221-gc0004.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="080221116000100"></a>Baroness Scott of Needham Market:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord for following on on that point. I shall raise the question of elections again. I hope the Committee will forgive me, but because of the length of the last debate and the interruption for the Division, if the Minister replied, I missed it. She has just said again that the order refers to elections taking place this May in order to start work next April with the next set of elections in 2013. That was certainly the understanding of the people in Durham. The county council has written to me to say that the Boundary Committee has raised the possibility of an election in 2010 and it is very concerned that the people of Durham will go to the polls in May and elect someone who will take office in April for 11 months, and that then there will be another set of elections and another a few years after that. It believes that the cost and confusion of having three sets of elections in five years is unacceptable. I would be grateful if the Minister could take that up.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000021"></a>That gives me the opportunity to make the more general point that I am not clear about the extent to which the Boundary Committee takes these wider considerations of governance into account when it makes its decisions and who is the final arbiter in all this. If the committee digs its heels in and insists on this happening, does Durham just have to accept it or would the Government be able to intervene if they felt that that was appropriate?</p>

<p><a name="080221116000022"></a><b><a name="80221-gc0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="080221116000101"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am happy to confirm what I said earlier in response to the title of County Durham Council. We shall be writing. The noble Lord has made his views clear on the record, which is helpful.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000023"></a>I partially answered the noble Baroness. We were interrupted by a Division and I did not come back to the point, but I shall state it as clearly as I can because it will be helpful. The position on the elections is that we are providing for elections in Durham and Northumberland in 2008 and in 2013. After the 2008 elections, the Electoral Commission will undertake an electoral review of the wards and the electoral divisions. It is for the commission to decide&#151;and it has the last word on these things&#151;whether the new warding should be implemented in 2013 or whether there is a case to be made for earlier special elections in 2010.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000024"></a>We made it clear from last August, when we put out the consultation document, that stability is important and councils need to bed down. Although it is a longer period than usual, there are real advantages in having this time. We expect the Electoral Commission to consult fully and widely before deciding whether to have an extra 2010 election. The new council will have to make its case to

We expect the commission to give careful consideration to all those representations that they receive and the arguments, including the case for stability.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000028"></a>The noble Baroness said: The order establishes the new unitary Cornwall Council. It implements a proposal which Cornwall County Council submitted to us in response to our invitation to councils, issued in October 2006 in parallel with our White Paper. We have judged their proposal against the same five criteria set out in our invitations to councils against which, as I discussed earlier, we assessed all 26 proposals that we originally received.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000029"></a>On 5 December, I informed the House that our judgment was that if the proposal for a single-unitary Cornwall were to be implemented, there was a reasonable likelihood that it would achieve the outcomes specified by all five criteria in the invitation. That is, we believe that the proposal, if implemented, will achieve the outcomes on strategic leadership, neighbourhood flexibility and empowerment and delivery of value for money and efficiency in public services specified in the criteria. Equally, we believe that the change is also affordable and supported by a broad cross-section of partners and stakeholders. We also received a proposal for a unitary authority from a number of district councils. However, we judged that there was not a reasonable likelihood that the proposal, if implemented, would achieve the outcomes specified by each criterion and hence should not proceed to stakeholder consultation.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000030"></a>On the basis of the proposal that we received from Cornwall County Council, having regard to all the other material and representations that we have received, including the advice which our independent financial experts provided on the financial viability of the proposals, the expectation is that the change in Cornwall will lead to savings of more than &#163;15 million annually once the new unitary is established. On the basis of the criteria which we have already discussed, we judge that the proposal meets the affordability criterion. As I have said, it is our judgment that the proposal meets the support criterion, which we have also discussed earlier in this debate.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000031"></a>However, as in other instances, the consultation last spring revealed both support and concern. The district councils had already put in their own bid for a unitary solution. They were clearly opposed to the solution proposed by the county. They commissioned polls which appeared to support their position. However, there was a wide range of public sector support, including from the South West Strategic Health Authority, the Cornwall Partnership NHS Trust, the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, and the police authority. There was support, too, from across the business and enterprise communities, including Connexions Cornwall and Devon, the Cornwall Commercial Tourism Federation and some local but important businesses such as St Austell Brewery.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000032"></a>The majority of responses that we received directly from the public were opposed, but they came from only a small proportion of the overall population. A poll of 1,750 people out of a population of 500,000 cannot be seen to represent a majority of people hostile to the proposal. There was an interesting exchange in the other place during the debate on the Cornwall order. It was pointed out that 700 people, which is half that number polled, protested against a proposal for a supermarket in Saltash. The Cornwall districts polls, which again were postal and therefore, as I pointed out earlier, not subject to the same degree of protection and scrutiny as national postal voting, were described in the same debate as &#147;deficient ... and partial&#148;. The case was made by a Member of Parliament not just about the Cornwall poll, but about the way in which postal polls are conducted generally. The majority of parish and town councils that responded also expressed concerns, but others such as Newquay expressed support. However, overall, we concluded that there was a reasonable likelihood of the proposal achieving the outcomes specified by this criterion.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000033"></a>As with all the orders being discussed today, we have prepared this order following consultation and full discussion with the councils concerned. Like the other orders, it provides that, from 1 April 2009, there will be a single tier of local government for Cornwall. It provides that the existing district councils will be dissolved, and that the county council will be transformed into a new unitary council, having both district and county functions. It makes provisions for the key transitional arrangements. It provides for the establishment of an implementation executive, to be led by the county council and whose membership will be drawn from the county and all the district councils.

<a name="80221-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000035"></a>Where the order differs from those for Northumberland and Durham is that, in Cornwall, as in Shropshire and Wiltshire, elections to the new unitary council will take place in line with the usual county cycle in May 2009. As we have discussed previously, that will allow the Electoral Commission to undertake an electoral review and put in place electoral arrangements. This order, together with that for Shropshire, which we shall come to finally, also differs from the others in that it provides for the cancellation of district council elections that would otherwise take place in May 2008 in any district council that elects in thirds. In Cornwall that applies to Penwith only.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80221-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000036"></a>One of the new features, which is worth reflecting on in relation to the nature of the debate with district councils in Cornwall and between Members of Parliament, is that the new unitary will bring a far closer connection across this large and dispersed area because there will be new opportunities for local connections, based not on artificial district boundaries, such as Restormel, but on real places.  It is encouraging to see that the proposal envisages 16 community networks as the single forum for each area. They will include other public sector partners, local people and the VCS. They will be multipurpose bodies with some devolved powers to influence service delivery and to monitor performance. They will be a basis for gathering intelligence at local level and a public consultation forum. The proposal also envisages community access points&#151;one-stop shops&#151;to enable greater public access to council services. They will involve local parish and town councils, with delegation of responsibilities where appropriate and where wanted and access to shared community network architecture. The proposal is to parish unparished areas to provide consistency across the county through a new local council charter. That is excellent.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000037"></a>I shall not reiterate what I said about the argument for cancelling the elections; it is powerful and widely recognised locally. I explained that we reflected on the JCSI report in that context.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000038"></a>In short, this order will establish a new unitary Cornwall Council that will have the form of local governance to which local people can look forward. It will deliver a clearer strategy and better, higher quality services. It will have more appropriate local connections, which will be helpful to local communities. I beg to move.</p>

Most of the points I wanted to make were covered in our initial debate. When listening to the Minister talking about the consultation process, it struck me that the extent to which one can judge this has been a recurrent theme in these orders. It is an odd thing for someone from my Benches to say, but it strikes me that in future rounds the Government may need to be a little more directive about how councils collect information about public opinion. Perhaps a little more guidance on that would have saved much of the accusation and counter-accusation that we have had. After all, these things do not come cheap. If one has to disregard the outcome because it is not seen as statistically valid, money is spent to no good purpose. I put that forward as a helpful suggestion because on that one occasion I would not make the usual cry about too much central direction. It would be needed.</p>

<p><a name="080221116000041"></a><b><a name="80221-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080221116000105"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> In common with other Members of the Committee, I ought to give my credentials. I was elected to a county council in 1964. It was to my considerable surprise and to the even greater surprise of my Conservative opponent because I was just eligible; I was 21, which was then the age of consent, as it were. Professionally and as a representative, I have lived through so many reorganisations that I hope I come to this one with that experience in the bag.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000042"></a>In Cornwall, there is real recognition that we are rather special. We have a special identity. To illustrate that, when my noble friend Lord Teverson and I cross the Tamar we have a more distinct boundary with the rest of England than the Welsh or the Scots or than Northern Ireland has with the Republic. It is the Tamar, which almost goes up into the Irish Sea. Indeed, at the time of the millennium there was a proposal that we should get a large JCB and complete the process, and join up with Ireland where we would perhaps get better treatment from the EU than we would from London.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000043"></a>In this context, it is extremely important&#151;my noble friend has already referred to this&#151;that we see these orders not just as little piecemeal operations but hopefully as part of a general proposal that we should be looking at for greater decentralisation in this country. Where an identifiable area can take on greater responsibility, devolution rather than greater centralisation should be the order of the day. If we saw these orders simply as rearranging centralised government in this country, we would be missing an opportunity.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000044"></a>I pay tribute to the Minister&#146;s colleague in another place, who made specific reference to that in the extensive debate&#151;a much better debate on this order compared with the others&#151;in the Delegated Legislation Committee on Thursday 7 February. The Minister for Local Government, John Healey, said, apropos Cornwall in particular, that the new authority will,</p>
<ul><a name="080221116000090"></a>&#147;increasingly be able to draw down some of the responsibilities that currently sit at regional level, and increasingly we will be looking to devolve more from the centre as well, where there is a good case for doing so. I think that this would be the argument of the hon. Member for North Cornwall: Cornwall should be well

<p><a name="080221116000083"></a>In that context, I am sure that my noble friend and I would agree that this order could be a real step forward for greater self-determination&#151;home rule, if you like; a good Liberal principle&#151;for Cornwall. However, if it is not going to be considered in that context but, instead, there is to be a simple moving around of the proverbial deckchairs on the &#147;Titanic&#148; for an ever-increasing centralisation of government, that would be extremely unfortunate. This is not the first time that we have been here. There have been proposals in the past and, regretfully, the Conservative Government never sought the opportunity to give Cornwall greater authority and autonomy over its own affairs.</p>

<p><a name="080221116000045"></a>Specifically on the point about the different options put before the Government as a result of the bid process, it would be fair to say that there was considerable confusion. At one stage, as the Minister will recognise, there was even a suggestion that there should be two unitary authorities in Cornwall, splitting the great Royal Duchy of Cornwall down the middle. Frankly, that did not go down particularly well with my colleagues and fellow residents in the county. We are proud of the unity of Cornwall. The slogan&#151;it is more than a slogan&#151;used in recent months of &#147;Cornwall united&#148; has some meaning here, when it is perhaps not so evident in a number of the other areas that the Committee has been discussing today.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000046"></a>As my noble friend did earlier in relation to all these orders, I welcome the Government&#146;s emphasis on the fact that this is not just a county council rebuilt. These are new councils, and I am delighted to see that that is in the order. There is constant reference to &#147;the Cornwall Council&#148;. That is helpful, and it emphasises all the more that this is a new beginning for the county and not simply the county council in a different format with existing powers. That, again, relates to the issue I referred to just now. If the Government simply seize this new council as a vehicle for exercising county council responsibilities and concerns, it will be an opportunity lost and will not meet the strategic objectives to which the Minister has already referred. The Explanatory Memorandum is specific, as the Minister has said this afternoon. If she can refer to it again in her wind-up in a moment, that will be helpful. The more we say that this is a new way to bring together existing powers and potentially add new responsibilities to a distinct area, the better.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000047"></a>There is one area where there is still a bit of doubt, about which I am anxious. This was very much reflected in the Delegated Legislation Committee on 7 February by all my honourable friends, who are naturally persuasive on this issue, being Liberal Democrats. We all believe that it is extremely important that the whole new framework&#151;the new unitary authority and the network to which the Minster has just referred&#151;is in place at the same time. To delay the parish and town council elections until 2013 is, frankly, flying in the face of local democracy. It would mean that those local councils would be left behind in these changes. The so-called neighbourhood networks&#151;I think the reference is in

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000048"></a>Annexe B of the Explanatory Memorandum sets out the reasons for the Secretary of State&#146;s decision, and the situation under &#147;Neighbourhood empowerment&#148; will be gravely weakened if new members are not in place on the town and parish councils in the county. References have been made on previous occasions to the difficulty in getting people to serve on those councils. If they are left behind in this important change to the governance of Cornwall, if they are not in place on the same date as the new Cornwall authority in 2009, I think it will be a grave mistake.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000049"></a>In the legislative committee on 7 February, the Minister for Local Government made a specific promise. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080221116000087"></a>&#147;I am perfectly willing to consult the implementation executive, and if there appears to be a widespread sense that we should have parish council elections in 2009 we could bring forward an amending order to make that change&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Eighth Delegated Legislation Committee, 7/2/08; col. 27.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080221116000084"></a>It would be very helpful if the Minister made that specific commitment and gave us that assurance this afternoon: that the order as it stands in Article 13(2)(c) can effectively be overruled by a subsequent order to that effect. I recognise that the implementation process should be involved in that. We would not want a number of individuals here in either House to say that this must happen, but I believe that there is a very strong move now in Cornwall for the whole democratic structure to be in place at the same time. Frankly, there will, quite rightly, be new responsibilities at that level. Those of us who have argued for a unitary authority for many years have always said that this is an opportunity for double-devolution: devolution from central government, from the regional agencies of central government to Cornwall, but also from the centre of Cornwall to local neighbourhoods.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000050"></a>I believe that like so many orders, this is like the curate&#146;s egg. Members of the Committee will recall that, when asked by the visiting bishop, the curate said that parts of it were excellent. I believe that parts of the order are excellent and it is better to have some breakfast rather than none.</p>

I identify myself with the points made by my noble friend Lord Tyler. An order not being dealt with this afternoon is for Exeter and a unitary authority in Devon. I congratulate the Government on rethinking and hesitating on the solution for Devon and Exeter because the one that came out initially was not the right one. I believe that Devon County Council itself welcomes the full review that is now taking place. That is a much better way forward than was originally discussed on the eastern side of the Tamar.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000052"></a>On Cornwall, I congratulate the Government on giving the proposal from the county the opportunity to move forward. This will be a huge improvement.

This is a very exciting period and the Government&#146;s work with Cornwall now gives it those opportunities. Having said that, the course has been bumpy, but it has not all been on the Government&#146;s side; the way in which much of this has been communicated locally has not been satisfactory, and I regret that. However, I am very sure that residents of Cornwall looking backwards and those who will go through this issue will welcome the solution in this order.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000053"></a>The order is very much concerned with the future. Generally, in Cornwall we see this as a very important step, but it is only a first step towards bringing other powers and responsibilities down to the Cornwall Council once it has shown itself to be a responsible, effective and successful authority: powers relating to the economy, social issues and perhaps even health issues. That would be a very valuable way forward which we would welcome. I understand that we have to prove ourselves before we get to that situation. As my noble friend said, there will be an important duty on the new Cornwall authority to ensure that it fully devolves its own powers locally as much as possible.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000054"></a>Reading through the instruments and the explanations, I understand entirely why the new council is, in effect, a rebranded county council in terms of legal aspects, but I am unclear&#151;I apologise if I missed this in the Minister&#146;s opening remarks&#151;what the council will be called when it is established and comes into force in 2009, given that legally it is the county council at the moment. Reflecting the remarks of my noble friend Lord Tyler, for us this is a new start. I understand that legally it might not be quite that, but in every other way it needs to be so.</p>

<p><a name="080221116000055"></a><b><a name="80221-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080221116000107"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am extremely pleased that noble Lords with such powerful local connections and authenticity welcome the order. It is very good for the Government to be able to have that reflection on their judgments. I have a soft spot for Cornwall because I feel that we Celts are very special and usually do things effectively when we are left to get on with it.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000056"></a>I also welcome what the noble Baroness said about the nature of local democracy. It is something that we should reflect on in terms of public opinion in these situations. It is very difficult; democracy is extremely untidy. It was part of the devolutionary principle that we would not dictate to local areas how they went about gathering the voices in those areas. We live with the consequences of that.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000057"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, spoke passionately and eloquently. I am very happy to repeat what my right honourable friend said in the other place. This is very much at the leading edge of our devolution proposals; it has not been a series of one-off considerations but part of a movement to demonstrate that we really do want to take the next step and the one after, from devolution to double-devolution, not least in terms of neighbourhoods and local areas. He made it very clear that Cornwall in this position can speak with one voice, so it is in a very strong position to make the most of every other

He specifically referred to the sub-national economic review. That is work in progress, but it will be bound to look for ways in which we can put control into the hands of the sub-region as a way of generating its own intelligence and action about the labour market, local skills and business and all the other things that will deliver for Cornwall in future. With that coherence, it is extremely well placed to envisage what it wants to do and deliver on it.</p>

<p><a name="080221116000060"></a>In terms of the title of the council, we have always made it clear that we were creating a new animal, with a new set of responsibilities and a new profile. The title of the council will be the Cornwall Council, as specified in the order. We could either have made it a completely new legal entity, and gone through all the complications of creating a shadow council with elections and so on, or have done what we thought was best for local people and used the technical opportunity open to us to make it a continuing council for that purpose to reduce the disruption and bureaucratic intervention. We did the latter.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000061"></a>The noble Lord asked about the timing of elections for parish councils. I am happy to reiterate what the Minister said in another place. We are trying to achieve some consistency between the dates of elections for various councils, but, as the Minister and others said in the other place, we are perfectly willing to consult the implementation executive. If there appears to be a widespread sense that we should have parish council elections for 2009, we could bring forward an amending order to make that change.</p>

<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC59"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC59</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>establishes the new unitary Shropshire Council. It implements a proposal which Shropshire County Council submitted to us in response to our invitation to councils issued in October 2006 in parallel with our White Paper.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000066"></a>We have judged its proposal against the same five criteria set out in our invitations to councils, against which, as we have already discussed, we assessed all 26 of the proposals that we originally received. As I informed the House on 5 December, our judgment is that if the proposal for the single unitary Shropshire Council were to be implemented, there is a reasonable likelihood that it would achieve the outcomes specified by all five criteria in the invitation; that is, we believe that the proposal will achieve the outcomes on strategic leadership, neighbourhood flexibility and empowerment, and delivery of value for money and efficiency in public services specified in the criteria. Equally, we believe that the change, if implemented, will be affordable and supported by a broad cross-section of partners and stakeholders.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000067"></a>On the basis of the proposal, and having regard to all the information and representations that we received, including the advice of our independent financial experts, it is expected that the change in Shropshire will lead to savings of more than &#163;9 million and therefore meets the affordability criteria. It also meets the support criteria.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000068"></a>Consultation last spring revealed that opinion was divided about the unitary proposal. Significantly, the proposal was originally supported by two district councils, Oswestry and South Shropshire. South Shropshire withdrew its support following the May 2007 local elections; Oswestry is still in support. However, there was strong opposition from some other districts. Three of the districts commissioned local polls, by post, which showed that the majority of those who responded opposed the proposal. A critique of the postal polls in Shropshire was made by Professor Rawlings and Thrasher, noting that the tone and content of the information provided was likely to have had some impact on the poll results, that there could be no guarantee that they were true one- person, one-vote polls, and that the relatively low turnout meant that only a small minority of the electorate supported either position. But overall, in spite of the district poll results suggesting that the majority of the public opposed the unitary, the county council&#146;s own telephone survey of 1,000 residents in June 2007 showed that 78 per cent wanted more information about it before making their mind up about a single council.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000069"></a>In addition, the majority of the public who wrote in during the consultation also supported the unitary proposal, as did some town and parish councils. In addition, the majority of representations from the public stakeholders, such as the Shropshire county primary care trust, the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS trust and the Shropshire and Wrekin Fire Authority, expressed support for the proposals, along with almost all voluntary and community sector organisations, some town and parish  councils and the Shropshire enterprise partnership, representing part of the business community. Overall,  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC60"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column GC60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we concluded that there was a reasonable likelihood of the proposal achieving the outcomes specified by this criterion.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000070"></a>In common with all the orders being discussed today, we have prepared this order following consultation and full discussion with the councils concerned. As with the others, this order provides that from 1 April 2009 there will be a single tier of local government for Shropshire, and that the existing district councils will be dissolved, and the county council transformed into a new unitary council, having both district and county functions. It makes provisions for the key transitional arrangements and provides for the establishment of an implementation executive, to be lead by the county council, whose membership will be drawn from the county and all the district councils. We discussed the membership of the implementation executive in detail with all the affected councils, and reached a consensus on that which is reflected in the order. It also provides that the county council will have the function of preparing for and facilitating the economic, effective, efficient and timely transfer of the district councils&#146; functions, property, rights and liabilities to the new council, and requires that these transitional functions be discharged by the implementation executive until April 2009. It provides for the creation of a team of officers in each area, again drawn from the county and all the district councils to provide the necessary support to the implementation executive.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000071"></a>Where this order differs from those for Northumberland and Durham is that in Shropshire, as in Cornwall and Wiltshire, elections to the new unitary Shropshire Council will take place in line with the usual county cycle in May 2009. That was on the basis of a consensus that has been reached. Again, that will enable the Electoral Commission to undertake an appropriate electoral review and put in place appropriate electoral arrangements before the first elections. In common with the order for Cornwall, this order also provides for the cancellation of district council elections that would otherwise have taken place in May 2008. In Shropshire, that applies to Shrewsbury and Atcham alone, where one-third of its members would normally have become due for re-election.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000072"></a>The proposal that has now been further developed by all councils in Shropshire envisages the council having a convening role, developing a cross-sector vision for the county. The leader will sit on the regional assembly, chair the public service board and be vice-chair of the local strategic partnership. The public service board would be set up with representatives from key stakeholders. Thematic partnerships will represent the four blocks of the local area agreement. Area partnerships will meet quarterly, have a budget of up to &#163;500,000 for each area and will co-ordinate the work of local area agreements and the development of the sustainable community strategy.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000073"></a>The new council will very much bed its arrangements into local area agreements, as it should. That will be supported by local joint committees, made up of the various partners, including town and

<a name="80221-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000074"></a>In short, the order will establish a new unitary Shropshire Council that will have the form of local governance that local people should expect and demand. In common with the others we have debated today, it will empower local communities and promote prosperity so that Shropshire will be one of the flagship councils for the future for the rest of the county.

Local finance is a subject that has always interested me intensely. I have always said that if you control the finance and manpower in a local authority you control everything and do not need to be on all the other service committees. For a long time, I did precisely that. Partly as a result of what the Minister said, and partly because we need to be clear on this for the sake of the new authorities, we ought to press the issue of the financial arrangements under which these new authorities are to operate.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000077"></a>They have all been created on the presumption that there will be an efficiency gain from a financial point of view. In the case of Shropshire, &#163;9 million per annum will be saved. The key question is how that &#163;9 million is to be treated, given that so much of the money now comes from central government. Will the &#163;9 million be deducted from the assessed expenditure level of the authorities within Shropshire so that when the new authority comes into being it will effectively have to be working to a lower budget? If one was highly optimistic, one would ask the question the other way round and ask whether the assessment of financial resources for the first year of the new authority will be on the basis of the existing level of expenditure, which would give the new authority a wonderful opportunity to show what could be done with the little bit of extra resource that it has saved because it is its proposal. Or is there going to be some other compromise arrangement? One is very advantageous for the Government&#151;and given the financial situation of the Government, I can see the temptation for them to go for it, but that would not be a very honourable way to proceed. I suppose one could accept a compromise because the Government could rationally argue that they have given the new authority the opportunity to do this and therefore can claim part of the gain. The really wonderful thing to do would be to say that they will calculate the financial resources on the historical basis of what has been spent there and will see what use the new

I know this question is introducing a new topic, and I know it is late, but psychologically what the Minister says in response to it will be very important for all these new authorities.</p>

I am slightly less optimistic than the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. My worry is not about what happens with the savings but about what happens if the savings are not as high as we think they will be. I do not think that need necessarily be down to bad planning or anything of that nature. It is simply that when estimating how much is likely to be saved it is very difficult to be accurate. All sorts of things might occur. What bothers me is what will happen to local authorities if the costs, through no fault of their own, begin to escalate beyond those that they expected. Would expenditure on transitional arrangements be counted as part of the overall expenditure and therefore be capped, or would it be treated separately? I have absolute confidence that in the long run there will be savings, but the transition bothers me. My fear is that if in the short term the costs are high and authorities are capped, we will have restructured at the cost of public services.</p>

On the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, I can do no better than to quote what my honourable friend said in the other place. He was asked a very similar question and gave a very clear answer, as expected. The question was whether there can be an assurance that,</p>
<ul><a name="080221116000091"></a>&#147;any efficiency savings will not be top-sliced off any subsequent revenue support grant in 2009, if the order is passed&#148;.</ul>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080221116000088"></a>&#147;Yes, if that is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern I can say that over the next three years&#151;a period for which we have made decisions about the distribution of the core grant from central Government to local authorities&#151;efficiency savings, which we expect from all councils, will be entirely available to those councils that make them. Nothing will be clawed back to the centre and there will be no penalty incurred in any reduction of the core revenue support grant for councils that make efficiency savings. Those savings will be available for councils to use to improve services or to keep council tax pressures down&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/2/08; col. 302.]</p>

<p><a name="080221116000086"></a>I think that covers the range of references.</p>

<a name="80221-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080221116000080"></a>On capping, we always anticipated that there would be short-term costs which would lead to long-term gains. It is interesting that the gains range from &#163;9 million to &#163;18 million in those councils. The invitation made it clear that councils should ensure that all costs incurred were to be met locally without increasing council tax. That was always central to the entire analytical work that they had done and on which we evaluated them. We have also said that we cannot bail out councils if they go beyond that, if they find that their initial costings were not quite accurate. I am confident, having regard to the rigour

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08022197000007"></a><b><a name="80221-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08022197000044"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Lord Adonis):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Kevin Brennan) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08022197000008"></a>I am publishing today the findings of the independent review of the security procedures of ContactPoint, conducted by Deloitte, and the Government response. I acknowledge Deloitte&#146;s recognition that security is ingrained in the ContactPoint project team&#146;s work. The Government accept all the report&#146;s recommendations and will address them.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08022197000009"></a>ContactPoint is a key element of the <I>Every Child Matters</I> programme to transform children&#146;s services by supporting more effective prevention and early intervention. Its goal is to improve outcomes and the experience of public services for all children, young people and families. ContactPoint will provide a tool to support better communication among practitioners across education, health, social care and youth offending. It will provide a quick way for those practitioners to find out who else is working with the same child or young person.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08022197000010"></a>ContactPoint will be a simple basic online tool containing:</p>
minimal identifying information for each child; name, address, date of birth, gender, and contact details for parents or carers. Each child will also have a unique identifying number; contact details for the child&#146;s educational setting and GP practice and for other practitioners or services working with them; and an indication as to whether a service or practitioner holds an assessment under the common assessment framework or whether they are a lead professional for that child.
<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08022197000011"></a>No case information will be held on ContactPoint. </p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08022197000012"></a>Security is of paramount importance in the development of the ContactPoint. A number of measures will be in place to ensure security:</p>
access will be restricted to those who need it as part of their work and will be limited to that needed to fulfil each role;everyone with access to ContactPoint, including operators or administrators, will be subject to stringent security checks, including enhanced Criminal Records Bureau clearance and membership of the Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) Scheme;at least 2-factor authentication will be used to access ContactPoint. Users will need a security token and a password; all users will be trained in the importance of security and the importance of good security practice; 


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS54"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column WS54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>every access to a child&#146;s record will be detailed in the ContactPoint audit trail. This will be regularly reviewed;sanctions will be in place for any misuse. These sanctions can include, if appropriate, prosecutions under the provisions of the Data Protection Act and Computer Misuse Act which may lead to fines or imprisonment; andthe design and implementation of ContactPoint will continue to be reviewed by independent security experts during system build and before it is implemented. Security will of course be audited during operation. 
<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08022197000013"></a>These issues will be reflected in the guidance and staff training that will govern the operation of ContactPoint.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08022197000014"></a>On 20 November, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families decided to commission an independent review of ContactPoint&#146;s security procedures, and I announced this in a Written Ministerial Statement to Parliament on 27 November. The review was undertaken by Deloitte. The Secretary of State and I received Deloitte&#146;s confidential report in early February. I am today publishing the executive summary of this report, which includes Deloitte&#146;s recommendations. This Statement includes the Government&#146;s response to the recommendations. Both this Statement and the executive summary will be placed in the Libraries for reference.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08022197000015"></a>The main body of the report necessarily includes information about the security arrangements for ContactPoint. We will not, therefore, publish the full report in order to minimise the kind of security risk our procedures are designed to prevent.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08022197000019"></a>The Government welcome the report from Deloitte on the<I> ContactPoint Data Security Review. </I>We acknowledge their recognition that security is ingrained in all aspects of the ContactPoint Project team&#146;s work. We accept all the report&#146;s recommendations and will address them. The first task is to undertake an impact assessment of the detailed recommendations contained in the report. A statement outlining ContactPoint&#146;s security policy is available from <a href="http://www.everychildmatters">www.everychildmatters</a>. gov.uk/deliveringservices/contactpoint/security/. The statement will be updated to reflect changes as a result of ongoing work on security, including addressing the recommendations in this report.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08022197000021"></a>Clear communication of responsibilities and accountabilities when the governance process is communicated to sponsors and partner organisations.</p>
We recognise the need for the department to communicate clearly to local authorities and partner organisations, who will use ContactPoint, exactly what their responsibilities are and what is required of them. We are developing a comprehensive programme of training, readiness assessments and accreditation checks to ensure these organisations are properly prepared for these responsibilities. The  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS55"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column WS55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>review has identified a number of areas which will be critical to get right as these plans develop. We welcome this advice and will follow it as we finalise our plans.
<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08022197000022"></a>Technical and procedural controls are subject to formal assurance under a recognised standard.</p>
In determining the security policy for ContactPoint, the project followed government guidance on risk assessment and security controls set out in the Manual of Protective Security. The manual was updated in August 2007. The design of ContactPoint is currently undergoing a re-baselining exercise. Once this is complete, we will fully update the risk assessment against the new criteria and initiate a formal, external assessment to ensure these risks are effectively controlled. The scope of this will include the self-certification and local data quality tool process issues highlighted by the review.
<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08022197000023"></a>Further controls are introduced over the access to data by central system users such as database administrators and report programmers.</p>
The review has correctly identified that we have significant controls in place to ensure the security of the core database, but has identified some areas in which these could be further improved. The ContactPoint project will undertake a rapid impact assessment to determine the most effective approach in our specific context, and will build this into the deployment plan.
<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08022197000024"></a>Processes are defined for the secure disposal of electronic and hard-copy media.</p>
Temporary guidance was issued to ensure secure storage and/or disposal of media used for initial load of data into the database. This was effective at the time, and will be reviewed against latest government-wide best practice to inform standards for production processes. These additional controls will be in place before any data are loaded into the user acceptance test or live systems. The live system will also be designed to minimise, and where possible eliminate, the use of physical media.
<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08022197000025"></a>Clear guidance about information security matters is provided to all helpdesk staff on the production system.</p>
The Deloitte review has highlighted one occasion where helpdesk guidance did not reflect best security practice. Formal helpdesk training has not yet taken place, and training plans will be reviewed to ensure that helpdesk staff are aware of security best practice, including the areas highlighted by the review.
<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08022197000026"></a>The project board should consider the appropriateness of obtaining formal independent assurance and accreditation of the supporting security operating procedures at connecting organisations before allowing connectivity or sponsorship.</p>
 The department is still preparing plans for accreditation of connecting organisations, and will take this recommendation into account as those plans are finalised.

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="08022197000028"></a><b><a name="80221-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08022197000045"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08022197000029"></a>I will tomorrow launch a strategy for the creative economy, in partnership with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills. Copies of the strategy, <I>Creative Britain: New Talents for the New Economy</I>, will be deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08022197000030"></a>Our creative industries have grown by 7.3 per cent over the last decade&#151;around twice the rate of the rest of the economy&#151;and are in a strong position globally as demand for high-quality media content in English grows. However, we need to ensure we remain competitive in a growing world market.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08022197000031"></a>Following extensive consultation and discussion with industry, the strategy makes a series of commitments for government and industry to secure the continuing success of this dynamic sector of the economy. This includes setting out the challenges for these industries, and measures to exploit British talent to the full through education and training, the removal of barriers to business growth, investment in research and innovation and protection of intellectual property.<I> </I>  </p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08022197000032"></a>The Department for Culture, Media and Sport will work closely with BERR, DIUS and other government departments to implement the strategy which we hope will adapt and evolve in response to a fast-moving sector of our economy.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="08022197000033"></a><b><a name="80221-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08022197000046"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> My right honourable friend, the Minister of State (David Hanson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08022197000034"></a>I have for some time been seeking more ways to remove foreign prisoners from our prisons, and to remove them earlier. I believe this will work to the benefit of our system, and today I can bring forward proposals that will help us to do this. The early removal scheme established under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 enables the Government to remove foreign national prisoners liable to deportation or administrative removal up to 135 days before the halfway point of their sentence. Since its introduction in June 2004, over 3,000 prisoners have been removed  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS57"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column WS57</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>under the scheme. This has made a significant contribution to reducing the number of foreign national criminals in our prisons and on our streets. Given this success, the Government now believe the scheme can contribute more.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08022197000035"></a>As of December 2007 there were 11,310 foreign national prisoners within the prison system, representing 14 per cent of the total prison population. Foreign national prisoners represent a significant proportion of the prison population, although at 14 per cent it is low in comparison to most other European countries. Of 17 western European states, the UK&#146;s proportion is the third lowest. France has 21 per cent, Germany 28 per cent, Italy 34 per cent, Greece 42 per cent and Austria 43 per cent</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08022197000036"></a>The early removal scheme applies only to those foreign national prisoners who are able to be removed to their country of origin. Such prisoners only benefit from the scheme if their removal from the UK can be given immediate effect. We have been working to ensure that arrangements are in place so as to enable us to remove prisoners to their country of origin.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08022197000037"></a>Prisoners serving a life or indeterminate sentence are not eligible to be considered for removal under the scheme. Determinate sentence prisoners serving a sentence of four years and over under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 for a sexual or violent offence are removed under the scheme only if the Parole Board considers that they would present an acceptable risk to the community.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08022197000038"></a>Details of prisoners removed under the scheme are placed on the Home Office&#146;s warnings index. Should they seek to return to the United Kingdom during their sentence they can be detected by the border control officer on arrival at the UK border and  


<notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS58"></a><b>21 Feb 2008 : Column WS58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>returned to prison custody until the point at which they would have been released had they not otherwise been removed.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08022197000039"></a>Based on the successful experience of the last three and a half years, and in particular our increasing experience of and success in securing travel documents from overseas countries and making other arrangements with them that enable us to remove prisoners, I believe the scheme can make an even greater contribution to removing criminals from our shores. I have therefore decided to extend the early removal scheme so as to enable prisoners to be removed 270 days early rather than the current 135. I will be laying the appropriate draft Order, which is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, and time will be found for a debate shortly.</p>

<a name="80221-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08022197000040"></a>The measure is entirely consistent with our strategy and with our earlier announcements, and I commend it to the House.</p>

The National Health Service breast screening programme does not identify women who are at an above average risk of developing breast cancer and therefore does not invite such women more often. It is therefore important that these women take up their invitation to be screened when it is offered and to be breast aware, so that they can spot the signs/symptoms of breast cancer and seek medical help early.</p>
