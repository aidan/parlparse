<A NAME = "70702-01_para0"></a>The Right Honourable John Haggitt Charles Patten, having been created Baron Patten, of Wincanton in the County of Somerset, for life--Was, in his robes, introduced between the Lord Quinton and the Lord Harris of Peckham.

<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Cox </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "70702-01_para2"></a>What is their policy towards the Government of Sudan, with particular reference to the human rights of its people and its continuing military action against civilians.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="70702-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, for the second time in 24 hours, it falls to me to pay tribute to the noble Baroness's efforts on behalf of the victims of human rights abuses. In line with our overall priority on human rights in our foreign policy, the Government are very concerned about the situation in Sudan, in particular the widespread lack of respect for human rights and the continuing civil war. We would press the Government of Sudan to comply with the UN resolutions on human rights in Sudan. We are strongly behind the EU embargo on arms sales. We are pressing the Government of Sudan and all parties to the civil war to end human rights abuses, and for a negotiated settlement of their differences.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Cox: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply, which will give encouragement to those who are suffering in Sudan.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-01_para3"></a>Is the Minister aware that during four visits to Sudan this year I have witnessed and can testify to the atrocities the Government of Sudan are perpetrating although they deny those atrocities, including the encouragement of slavery in Bahr El-Ghazal, the massacre of civilians in the Nuba Mountains, the scorched earth policy in Southern Blue Nile, and the deportation of the Beja people from their homelands in north-eastern Sudan? Will the Government step up their pressure on the Government of Sudan to allow access to all parts of Sudan by human rights monitors, and perhaps put increasing pressure for United Nations Security Council sanctions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I accept that those kinds of atrocities are going on within Sudan. We are very <P>


<a name="column_194"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 194</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concerned about the repeated refusal of the Government of Sudan to allow access to a number of locations in Sudan. The UK has strongly supported the efforts of the UN to press the Government of Sudan to lift their restrictions and to allow humanitarian assistance to be delivered to all people in urgent need. We have also taken the view that the best way to secure the broadest access to people in Sudan is to continue to operate under the Operation Lifeline Sudan umbrella. We have also given over &#163;135 million in humanitarian aid to Sudan in recent years. So far as the UN Security Council is concerned, we will examine the situation. However, it depends on the support of others. We have acted through the EU and we will examine the UN situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that everybody in this House admires enormously the work that is done by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, and particularly her work in the Sudan? It has brought to light so many of the evils inflicted by the NIF regime on civilians throughout the whole country, not merely in the south.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-01_para4"></a>In the particular case of the Security Council which the Minister mentioned, is he aware that the Sudanese authorities themselves allege that military attacks on their territory were made by forces from Ethiopia? Is that not a reason for having the matter dealt with by the Security Council, and asking the Government of Sudan to agree to international observers in any areas where they allege military action has been taken on their territory by neighbours?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of a number of allegations of border incursions in both directions. I agree with the noble Lord that that is the best way of dealing with the matter. However, it requires agreement at the United Nations Security Council; and it would require the agreement of the Government of Sudan, who have hitherto been fairly obdurate in their response to allowing independent observers in those areas.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Robertson of Oakridge: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that any long-term solution to the problems of Sudan will have to take into account the fact that the people of northern and southern Sudan have very little in common?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, there are certainly different cultures and religions between the south and the north of Sudan. We believe, however, that negotiated settlements are possible within the international boundaries of Sudan. We will use our best efforts to ensure that such negotiations start taking place. I believe there has been some minor progress in that direction, although as yet all the parties to the resistance in the south of the country are not yet involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe: </B>   My Lords, would Her Majesty's Government consider establishing alternative mechanisms for the evacuation of wounded from Sudan, where the suspension by the NIF regime of the operations of the International Committee of the Red Cross since last November has caused needless death and suffering for <P>


<a name="column_195"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>thousands; and, in particular, will the Government consider providing financial assistance for non-governmental organisations which can reach those areas of the Sudan which are designated by the Sudanese Government as "no go" areas to rescue the wounded, who will otherwise suffer and die without treatment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the organisation I have already mentioned, Operation Lifeline Sudan, which consists of a large number of NGOs, gives us the best prospect of reaching areas that are otherwise inaccessible to relief operations. So far as the International Red Cross is concerned, I regret the break-off. As I understand it, the International Committee of the Red Cross is now negotiating again with the Government of Sudan to re-establish its operations. In the meantime, Operation Lifeline Sudan is undertaking air evacuations of war wounded under the green light criteria. Previous ICRC operations were still subject to flight restrictions imposed by the Government of Sudan. The International Committee of the Red Cross continues to operate the hospital and provide support to hospitals in Juba through the Sudanese Red Crescent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister tell the House whether it is the case that the Sudanese Government discriminate between different tribes, largely on account of their religion? Is it not also the case that there is a desperate lack of medical supplies, not least for those who cross the southern Sudan desert by camel and for whom there is sometimes no medical help within reach?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl has a detailed knowledge of southern Sudan which I cannot hope to match. Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly true that there are certain communities within southern Sudan for whom access to medical supplies and other forms of relief is very difficult indeed, and the Sudanese Government are making it no easier.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew12"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Lichfield: </B>   My Lords, given the extremely fruitful mediation in the conflict in Zaire by President Mandela--whereby, I understand, Kinshasa fell without extensive bloodshed--and given the principle that African conflicts may sometimes be best helped by African leadership, does the Minister believe that help might also be given from this direction to Sudan's deadlocked agony, as I understand may also happen in the troubled area of the Great Lakes?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the Inter-governmental Authority on Development, which consists of several African states within that area, is already actively involved in seeking a peaceful solution in Sudan. Like the previous Government, this Government support its endeavours in that direction. The right reverend Prelate is absolutely right. The best solution is one that is achieved by African countries acting together themselves to end this terrible conflict.

<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister kindly indicate whether the presence of two Sudanese ambassadors in the United Kingdom is consistent with Britain's obligation to decrease the numbers and activities of Sudanese diplomats in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, following the United Nations sanctions that followed the apparent involvement of the Sudanese Government in the assassination attempt on President Mubarak, the British Government cut back Sudanese representation in London. The alleged second ambassador is not on the Diplomatic List; and we have therefore cut the number of diplomatic representatives in the Sudanese embassy as substantially as any other country.

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "70702-01_para5"></a>Whether they support the introduction of a national screening programme for diabetes.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="70702-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Jay of Paddington): </B>  My Lords, the Chief Medical Officer now chairs a national screening committee for the Department of Health which prioritises existing or possible future screening programmes against criteria that have been internationally established. The committee will consider national screening for diabetes as part of its developing work programme. Any future decision on implementing a national programme will be made in the light of those considerations.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that interesting and encouraging reply. Does she agree that it is easier to diagnose younger people; and would it not be best to have a screening policy for the over-40s in order to try to prevent some of the very serious complications, such as strokes, eye problems, ulcers of the feet etc.?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I am very much aware of the complications described by the noble Baroness. One of the problems is that, since the condition can occur at any time--the noble Baroness rightly draws attention to those who may be older and who get the illness at a later stage in life--if a general screening programme is established it is not possible to do the screening only once. It may have to be done several times. That is one of the concerns being taken into account by those examining the illness in the context of a screening programme. A further point is that, if we think about screening in terms of those conditions that can be cured rather than simply helped, diabetes is unfortunately not a condition that can be cured.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mowbray and Stourton: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that I have personally suffered through <P>


<a name="column_197"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>my wife getting this horrible illness in her fifties? Her grandfather had had it; however, we were idle and did not do much about it. Suddenly we found that she had the illness. Having various grandchildren, I should like to ask the Minister about the importance of this being recorded in someone's medical history. It is known that if someone has an antecedent with the illness, the likelihood of getting diabetes is considerably increased. As I am sure the noble Baroness is aware, the degree of lessened resistance suffered by diabetics to every disease known is quite incredible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for drawing attention to those important matters. The point about the continuing vulnerability--if one can call it that--of different generations, where one person has diabetes, is recognised. It is clearly an issue where more public information about those things which make people more vulnerable or which may be indicators that people are potential diabetes sufferers is important. But, as I said in reply to the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, the problem is that if you test a person for diabetes once, you may have to test them regularly in order to achieve anything.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Robson of Kiddington: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree--I am sure that she does from the replies she has given--that it is quite common for people to develop diabetes as they grow older? Often they are not aware of it because they put down the tiredness they feel to getting older. There is a good way of diagnosing diabetes: through the eye test. Will the Government therefore consider reinstating free eye tests?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is correct that it is older people who tend to get this unexpectedly in later life. I believe that 2.4 per cent. of the population are concerned. As I understand it, and I am not a medical expert in this field, the more complicated test to ascertain diabetes is far more unpleasant and difficult than the eye test. But I am sure that is something that the screening committee, under the chairmanship of the Chief Medical Officer, will consider.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Howell: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that her answers are welcome, together with the further consideration to be given to the subject that she has announced? Will she acknowledge that only 50 per cent. of diabetic people are known to be diabetic? Therefore, the failure to deal with the other 50 per cent. at an early stage brings enormous expense later on to the health service when serious illnesses arise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for reinforcing those points. As he is aware, people who have already been diagnosed with diabetes are regularly screened to ensure that the medical treatment they receive once the diagnosis is made is appropriate and helps them with what is obviously a serious condition.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Cox: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that recent research in the United States shows that a slight reduction in the diagnostic threshold level for diabetes results in a substantial increase in the proportion of the population recognised to be at risk? Given the complications which arise if diagnosis is not made early, does the noble Baroness agree that the research highlights and strengthens the need for a national screening programme?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I am aware that there has been additional research in the United States which was presented at an American national medical conference recently. I am sure that it will be drawn to the attention of the Chief Medical Officer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that while a full nationwide random screening for late onset diabetes is not a viable option, those at risk of developing diabetes should be advised to attend their GP for a properly controlled blood glucose check? Does she agree with the British Diabetic Association that those at risk include not only those with a family history of diabetes but also those who are overweight and those whose origin is from south Asia, Africa or the Caribbean?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend, with his expert information on the subject from his experience in general practice, underlines the point that I was making earlier--that the more information that is available to encourage people who may feel themselves to be vulnerable to attend their general practitioner to receive the appropriate screening, the better.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McColl of Dulwich: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that the noble Lord, Lord Butterfield, carried out a great deal of work on this subject? He discovered a large number of people potentially with diabetes. But the problem is that if we discovered the extent of it throughout the nation, would we have the resources to deal with it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I was interested to see the noble Lord, Lord Butterfield, rise behind the noble Lord, Lord McColl. Perhaps he was going to give us more detail of his extremely good work in the field. One of the questions that arises if one is examining the potential for a national screening programme is the resource implications, as well as clinical ones. That is something that the national screening committee, with its capacity to prioritise both in terms of clinical need and resources, will look at.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Butterfield: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the British approach will be to base screening on community physicians in general practice? I am sure that that is the right place for it and we must not lose the general principle.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say whether the incidence of diabetes is rising, particularly in some ethnic groups?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, as has been mentioned in response to several supplementary questions this afternoon, as screening develops and as more people become aware of it, we appear to have rising numbers of people with diabetes. But as my noble friend said, it may simply be a question of identifying people in the community who were already suffering from the disease. There is a problem with some of the minority ethnic groups.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that very good Answer. Can he give the House a little more detail as to the direction in which the Government are moving and whether they have plans to consult other nuclear powers with a view to forming a common policy towards elimination?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend will realise that it is far too early to anticipate where the results of the Strategic Defence Review will lead us.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-02_para1"></a>My noble friend will probably wish to take into consideration the fact that other nuclear weapon states will also probably be concerned about other weapons of mass destruction, like chemical and biological weapons, when they come to their conclusions as to how to approach global nuclear disarmament.

<P>
<A NAME="70702-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to give my noble friend some good news. The Secretary of State for Defence has made it absolutely clear that at the end of the review he wants no one to be in a position to say that their voice was not heard. At least one representative from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has been invited to one of our all-day seminars.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Chalfont: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recall that in the gracious Speech which opened this Parliament one sentence stated that it is the intention of Her Majesty's Government to keep,

<P>

<A NAME = "70702-03_para0"></a>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, it certainly remains the policy of Her Majesty's Government to keep a minimum strategic deterrent in the form of Trident. I would not be standing at this Dispatch Box if that were not the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the principles of the non-proliferation treaty would be immensely strengthened if the three smaller nuclear powers were to make a declaration that, as long as Russia and the United States continue to decrease the number of their nuclear weapons, there will be no question of our increasing our own arsenal? Will the Minister assure the House that this principle will in any case apply to the number of warheads deployed on Trident?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, as regards the suggestion of a get-together by what my noble friend calls the "smaller nuclear powers", I possibly touched on the point in the earlier reply which I gave to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins. There is not much more that I can add at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, at the moment we are conducting negotiations about the kind of range and subjects that this fissile material cut-off treaty should cover.

<A NAME = "70702-03_para2"></a>I thank my noble friend for what I think is a promising reply. Is she aware that there are a number of reasons why the law should be changed? Two of them are very widely held and not only by head teachers. First, it is hypocritical to ask teachers to force religion on children who do not hold religious beliefs. Secondly, there is the more practical point that many schools, including three-quarters of the secondary schools, are physically unable to have such an assembly because the room or hall is not big enough. As this reform has been talked about by both religious and non-religious groups for many years, is it now time to do something very quickly?

<FONT SIZE=3>provide daily worship. We understand those problems. But the law permits several acts of worship for separate groups of pupils rather than one big event for the whole school. Moreover, we are aware that there can be a problem, especially for head teachers, when teachers refuse to take daily acts of worship. But there are other solutions. Suitably qualified people from the local community can also lead worship. So far as concerns parents, my noble friend will be aware that any parent has a statutory right to withdraw his or her child from the daily act of worship, if he or she wishes to do so.

<A NAME="70702-03_spnew15"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Lichfield: </B>   My Lords, with regard to the review that is being undertaken, do Her Majesty's Government recognise the value and the importance of the Government themselves consulting the Churches and other faith communities if any change is to be made in this matter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-03_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate for raising that question. Yes, of course the Government will want to consult very widely if any change is to be made as a result of the review, and we want to include the Churches in any consultation that takes place.

<A NAME = "70702-03_para3"></a>Does the Minister agree that the act of school worship is a vital ingredient in the spiritual and moral life of a school?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-03_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority is developing guidance on spiritual, moral, social and cultural development, all of which the Government regard as important. That will extend beyond the curriculum and will embrace the contribution that daily collective worship can make.

<A NAME="70702-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, bearing in mind that this is a legal requirement and, I understand, has been a legal requirement since the 1944 Act, a measure which has been supported by governments of all political persuasions, will the noble Baroness inform the House just what the Government will do before the results of the review? I believe that it is the 28th review that the Government have announced since the election. Before that review is completed, what action will the Government be taking to ensure that that legal requirement is enforced?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-03_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may explain to the noble Lord--I am a little surprised that he is not aware of it, as he was a Minister of State in the Department for Education and Employment--that this review was set up under his own Government and not during the office of the new Government. We want to see the results of collective worship reviewed before deciding whether to take any further action. With regard to the question of non-compliance, which I believe is <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the question that the noble Lord is raising, we must keep the matter in perspective. Inspection evidence shows that the vast majority of primary schools comply with the law. It is the case that only about a quarter of secondary schools do so. However, they generally hold regular worship but simply fall short on the act of daily worship.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-03_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Sefton of Garston: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree, as pressure builds up in society for an extension of the privileges now enjoyed by the Christian religion to be extended to other religions which are just as credible, that we should even now give consideration to the question of installing a secular system of education as applied in the USA?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-03_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, to respond to that question at this stage would pre-empt the results of the review. We must wait to see what it says. Perhaps I could add that it is perfectly possible for schools to have secular assemblies as well as a daily act of worship that involves religion.

<A NAME="70702-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elton </B>   rose to call attention to the importance of youth crime prevention initiatives; and to move for Papers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, first, I should like to welcome the large number of noble Lords who intend to speak in this debate and particularly the noble Lord, Lord Evans, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester, who are to embark on the waters of this House for the first time under circumstances which mean that the ordeal will be quite brief.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para3"></a>Last autumn the Audit Commission published a seminal report on young people and crime. Its title is, Misspent Youth. It is a lucid source book for all those anxious to improve our practices. It draws attention not only to the volume, but also to the cost of crime to this country and to the modest results and the far from modest costs of what we are doing about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para4"></a>The report calculates, convincingly, that 28 million offences are committed every year at a cost to taxpayers and victims of &#163;16,000 million. Our concern today is with young people. They contribute handsomely to that total. In 1994 two out of every five known offenders was under 21; a quarter were under 18 and that quarter accounted for around 7 million offences a year. Under one fifth of those offences were even recorded by the police and a bare 5 per cent. cleared up. Only a microscopic 3.1 per cent. of crimes committed resulted in any attempt at corrective action and that attempt often failed. While 1.8 per cent. led to a caution, only 1.3 per cent. ended in court. Of that microscopic 1.3 per cent., roughly a quarter were either discontinued or dismissed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para5"></a>That leaves three quarters of 1.3 per cent. of all crimes committed ending in a conviction. Even of that tiny percentage who were convicted, one in four was given either an absolute or conditional discharge. I hope others will have time to talk about the prevention of re-offending; I alas have not. But it is clear that the majority of the tiny proportion who do go to custody re-offend after release. Can the Minister confirm that only 2.5 per cent. of all youth crime committed in this country results in any corrective action at all and that only just under 1 per cent. leads to a conviction? The 2.5 per cent. figure means one in 40.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para6"></a>Of course I agree that the assured prospect of being caught and punished would deter. But even if those figures are seriously flawed--and they are not--it would still be clear that the prospect of arrest and conviction never has been assured and never will be. Criminals, particularly the optimistic young criminals about whom we are talking, do not expect to be caught; do not expect to be tried; do not expect to be convicted, and expect least of all to be sentenced.
<P>


<a name="column_205"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 205</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para7"></a>The effects of custody on the select few are minimal. In Gloucestershire, in a recent year, no less than 88 per cent. had re-offended within a year of release from custody. So, however draconian the sentences the courts hand down, their deterrent effect on the general offending population is very close to zero. Therefore prevention must be better than punishment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para8"></a>As the general offending population commits around 32 per cent. of all crime at a rate of one or two offences each and at a cost of around &#163;1,250 million, that really is a pity; and we must not pretend it is otherwise. Even significant improvements in any quarter's figures are simply the melting of a few splinters of ice on the bit of the iceberg that we can see--welcome but small. And at what a cost we melt them. Merely identifying a single young offender costs the police around &#163;1,200; a successful prosecution costs a further &#163;2,000; providing a place for a week in a local authority secure unit in Greater London costs over seven times as much as providing a place for a week at Eton College. Our combined efforts to catch and deal with young criminals cost the taxpayer roughly &#163;1 billion a year. Prevention really must be better than such a ruinously expensive and grossly ineffective cure as that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para9"></a>Happily, that was agreed by the last government at the beginning of its Green Paper and has been agreed by the new one at the beginning of their term of office. If this debate achieves nothing else, it should welcome and hold them to that conclusion and the policies that must flow from it. The aim must be to get people before they turn to crime, not afterwards. If these were our children we would act at once.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para10"></a>On 17th June the Home Secretary announced the Government's response to this new perception of the problem of youth crime in a glimpse of the forthcoming Crime and Disorder Bill. This major initiative--setting up a new task force on youth justice--comes, in my view, late; outrageously late; dreadfully late; far too late. The noble Lord may look startled; that is because he misunderstands me. I did not mean late in the life of the Government; I mean late in the life of the child.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para11"></a>The press release shows that every item on the agenda of that task force is punitive. I do not object to the punishment of crime--far from it. But I object to waiting for the crime to be committed and, worse still, waiting for the criminality to develop. There is a temptation to wait because of the difficulty of deciding who exactly is going to turn into a criminal. Massive research has produced an impressive list of pre-disposing conditions but none of them is certain in its effect. Applying statistical rules seems worse than random choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para12"></a>In one series of experiments four out of every five children indicated as embryo criminals, without their knowledge, grew up to be absolutely respectable citizens. There are two important lessons to be learnt from that. It is not just that if we try to spot budding criminals we will almost certainly get it wrong. It is that in the process we may do needless and possibly serious harm to those who have been wrongly labelled. Had those children been told that they had been labelled as criminal material and treated as such, the result would <P>


<a name="column_206"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 206</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have been disastrously different. Much of childhood consists of finding out who one really is. If authority says that one is a criminal, one will react either by adopting this exciting new role with enthusiasm and, as one may say, with conviction; or, with similar results, by violent hostility to the authority making the suggestion. Pre-labelling or stereotyping children as potential criminals or, indeed, as disruptive pupils is a largely self-fulfilling prophesy and must be avoided.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para13"></a>Yet it may be said that we cannot prevent juvenile delinquency if we do not know in whom it is going to break out. I believe that to a large extent we can, partly by identifying stages in children's development and areas of their activity in which easily defined deprivation or other circumstances make the risk obvious; and partly by a modest redeployment of government expenditure to unlock a formidable and under-exploited resource.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para14"></a>That enables the teaching, explicit or implicit, of the simple lesson that must undergird our society if it is not altogether to fail, and by which social behaviour ultimately is judged: that the first duty of citizens is not to look after themselves; it is to look after each other.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para15"></a>Anyone who has seen the school-age child of a school-age mother attempting to cope with herself becoming a school-age mother, will recognise the danger in which she and her child stand. That is an acute example of a need for education in parenting, very often met in milder forms, which has concerned many of us for many years. The paper published by the noble Lord's then honourable and now right honourable friends last November shows that they take it seriously. I hope he will tell us a little of their concrete plans now that they are in government.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para16"></a>The next area of obvious risk is school--not every school. I am not one of those who believes that the whole of our education system has become degenerate since so-called "child-centred education" made its damaging appearance. But in those schools which do not provide, and firmly enforce, standards of behaviour which the pupils can understand and identify with, which are backed by all staff--academic and non-academic--and explained to and supported by the parents; or where individual children fall irremediably behind their peers in both academic and non-academic work until they are starved of both achievement and self-esteem; or where a pupil insecure or persecuted at home can find no friend among the staff in whom to confide; or where they are conveniently, but prematurely, labelled as trouble or troublesome pupils--those children are at risk.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para17"></a>If pupils are at risk in school, they are at greater risk out of it. A recent survey for the Home Office showed that 22 per cent. of non-truant pupils were offenders--that is a shocking figure in itself--but more than 30 per cent. committed crimes while they were temporarily excluded; 50 per cent. of truants and no less than 78 per cent. of those permanently excluded from school committed criminal offences.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para18"></a>These pupils, who are all out of school in term time, have one enemy in common with many who join them in the holidays, and also with the young unemployed. It <P>


<a name="column_207"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 207</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is intensified in rundown estates and anywhere else where there are no sporting or recreational facilities, little or no public transport, no money with which to escape into a better environment and where the parents are away at work. These children are full of all the natural vigour, curiosity, enthusiasm and love of excitement of youth. Your Lordships surely remember how it was when you were young yourselves. But they have no legitimate means of employing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para19"></a>If they are boys they also have a need for rivalry, to excel at something and for the addictive thrill of adrenalin in the bloodstream. In that environment, where every exciting activity is illegal, breaking the law has its own cachet among the young; escaping the law can be very exciting if you are prepared to take the risks and the thrills of the chase. Joyriding a stolen vehicle is of the essence. I do not want to legitimise that crime. It is costly, dangerous and altogether deplorable. But I want the House to understand its fascination and the need therefore to provide other, better, legal occupations. Imagine the tedium for a 12 or 15 year-old of 12 weeks with absolutely no provision for recreation. Of all people, surely your Lordships should best recognise the call of the chase after a long summer with no sporting activity!
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para20"></a>An even more dangerous, and more easily obtainable, stimulus is provided by drugs. Suffice it to say that, with a quite modest habit of, say, &#163;50 a day, and the street value of a decent stolen car stereo at &#163;20, a single young addict has to break into 18 cars a week to stay solvent.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para21"></a>These crimes are the product of unrestricted idleness. Yet the country is full of responsible young adults, anxious to preserve the standard of life in communities threatened with a flood of juvenile crime and needing only advice and a modest amount of cash to start up anything from a jazz band to a football team--and many points in between--to offer youngsters challenging activities and the chance to grow up into happy, contributing members of society.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para22"></a>Educational excellence is the business of professional teachers and the DfEE. Yet adults exist wanting only training and the entree to schools to serve as mentors to youngsters whose home life and school careers may be equally unstable. As chairman of the Divert Trust, which funds both sorts of activity, I declare an interest and tell the Government that there is a sleeping army of volunteers out there that they cannot afford to neglect. For a list of other organisations I refer them to the lecture last Wednesday night on youth justice of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para23"></a>Some youth crime is unavoidable, but much is unnecessary. That sleeping army--with the huge advantages of enthusiasm and commitment and the fact that they represent none of the authorities with which children may be in conflict--needs funds. It is brilliant at raising them. A survey of clients of the Intermediate Treatment Fund showed them raising &#163;5 from other sources for every &#163;1 of government money. But the many who do not get lottery money are up against it. Thanks again to the lottery, they are increasingly reliant on corporate donors--i.e., commercial companies prepared to shave a little off the dividend to give to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>charity. Does the noble Lord know that Harrods, for instance, already gets 800 such requests a week and the Nationwide Building Society gets between 6,000 and 10,000 a year? Into this desperate competition between largely amateur fund-raisers, the Government have now thrown a professional fund-raiser with the task of taking &#163;150 million out of what little there is to go round. That money is to help to pay for a building to celebrate the birth of Our Lord. A better memorial would surely be to shave just a half of 1 per cent. off the budget for detecting crime and punishing criminals and giving it to the voluntary sector to prevent crime. The results would delight both him and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.

<A NAME="70702-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Evans of Parkside: </B>   My Lords, I crave the indulgence of the House to make my maiden speech. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Elton, on his choice of subject because crime truly is a major problem in Great Britain today. It is an activity which impinges on the lives of millions of our fellow citizens. It affects their happiness and well-being.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para24"></a>Sadly, levels of crime have risen sharply over the past 18 years. Home Office statistics show that since 1979 recorded crime has doubled--I stress the words "recorded crime"--violent crime has almost trebled--and rose by 11 per cent. during last year alone--and the chance of being a victim of a burglary has risen from one in 32 in 1979 to one in 11 today. The reverse side of that coin has been that the number of people convicted of these offences has slumped by a third. In fact only one crime in 50 results in a conviction and only one in 750 in a prison sentence. The chance of a criminal being convicted of burglary has fallen from one in 11 to one in 33.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para25"></a>The number of crimes committed by youngsters--those under 18--rose by around 36 per cent. between 1984 and 1995, yet the number of young people cautioned or convicted slumped by 36 per cent. Delays have worsened, costs have risen and in some areas persistent offenders have got away with scores of offences before any effective action has been taken.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para26"></a>One of the five early pledges in Labour's manifesto referred specifically to youth crime. It referred to "fast track punishment for young offenders". I am very pleased that the Home Secretary is honouring that pledge by announcing that the Government are to bring forward a major crime and disorder Bill which will include overhauling the failing youth system. In practical terms, the Home Secretary has made an excellent start with the establishment of a task force on youth justice which has been formed to drive forward the Government's proposed changes for dealing with young offenders.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para27"></a>I think perhaps that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary might like to give consideration to another task force which would consider preventing young people embarking on a life of crime in the initial stages. I should also like to offer a small criticism of the committee that my right honourable friend has established in the sense that it is very heavily <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>metropolitan based. North of Watford, the north of England seems to be rather under-represented, with the sole representative being the chief probation officer from Manchester. I should like to suggest to my right honourable friend that he should give some consideration to appointing someone to the committee who resides in the northern part of England, has some knowledge of inner-city estates and has an understanding of the link that exists between unemployment, poverty and crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para28"></a>I shall concentrate briefly on two issues in the proposed Bill. The first is the fast-track system which proposes to halve the time it takes from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders and to streamline the youth court system. This measure is truly long overdue. In my 23 years as a Member of Parliament, first for the Newton constituency and then for the St. Helens, North constituency, I have been only too well aware that nothing infuriates the residents of housing estates more than seeing a persistent young criminal who everyone knows is a thief or a vandal, or frequently both, being arrested time after time by the police, getting repeated warnings from the police but simply carrying on with a life of crime; or worse, being taken to court, often getting bail, and then proceeding to commit dozens of further offences and finally winding up with a community service order which he then proceeds to ignore. One thing that has emerged from that is considerable cynicism among people about the attitude of the police and the magistrates. Too often the attitude seems to be, "Your insurance will cover the burglary, the car theft or the car break-in". To halve the time between arrest and sentence will be welcomed by the victims of criminals everywhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para29"></a>The second measure is the proposition to give courts new sentencing powers, with an action plan order, a new reparation order and a parental responsibility order to make parents face up to their responsibilities. That is also welcome because much more emphasis needs to be placed on making young offenders face up to the consequences of their actions for themselves, for their victims and for the community.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para30"></a>Young offenders account for an incredible estimated 7 million crimes a year. The Audit Commission in its report Misspent Youth last year revealed that the youth justice system cost the taxpayer &#163;1 billion a year. It is obvious that the system that deals with them is in urgent need of radical reform. We want a youth justice system that is more effective and efficient and in the longer term reduces crime dramatically.

No one can be confident that we have all the answers, or even most of them, to the important and intractable problems which exist in this area of our national life ...

If such a Royal Commission or revived Advisory Council were able, with the benefit of intensive world-wide research and consultation, to reach authoritative conclusions which commanded the respect of public and professional opinion, and if those conclusions were given legislative effect, this Parliament would earn an assured and honourable place in the history of this country". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para32"></a>I urged the setting up of at least the Advisory Council on the Penal System because it is clear that our penal policy is in a mess. In 1990, followed by the legislation in 1991, imprisonment was carefully established as the punishment of last resort. About three or four years later, as a result of rather low-grade jury speeches to the party faithful, it was suggested that more use should be made of prison. As a result the prison population has gone up by 50 per cent. in the past four years and it has reached a crisis state. It is increasing at something like 200 prisoners a week--in other words, the capacity of a prison ship in a fortnight--and that is the situation as regards to which a different answer has to be found.

<A NAME = "70702-04_para33"></a>As regards the youth side, I refer to the Audit Commission report which has already been referred to by two of the earlier speakers. It says this at page 96:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The current system for dealing with youth crime is inefficient and expensive, while little is being done to deal effectively with juvenile nuisance. The present arrangements are failing the young people--who are not being guided away from offending to constructive activities. They are also failing victims--those who suffer from some young people's inconsiderate behaviour, and from vandalism, arson and loss of property from thefts and burglaries. And they lead to waste in a variety of forms, including lost time, as public servants process the same young offenders through the courts time and again; lost rents, as people refuse to live in high crime areas; lost business, as people steer clear of troubled areas; and the waste of young people's potential. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Resources need to be shifted from processing young offenders to dealing with their behaviour. At the same time, efforts to prevent offending and other antisocial behaviour by young people need to be co-ordinated between the different agencies involved; they should also be targeted on deprived areas with high crime rates, and piloted and evaluated". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para34"></a>Dealing with the question of evaluation in the last moments of injury time, so to speak, I invite your Lordships' attention to a handbook Community Programme for Young and Juvenile Offenders, produced this year by the Institute for the Study and Treatment of Delinquency. In a foreword by the Director of Public <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Prosecutions, she points out that a wide range of schemes exist for young offenders across the country. She goes on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is an overwhelming need for a more co-ordinated and informed approach between these agencies to ensure that resources are used effectively and good practice is identified". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para35"></a>
In none of the examples given in the handbook is there any evaluation. These are the essential reasons for suggesting that the matter should be the subject of a careful, balanced and non-political inquiry of the status of a Royal Commission or the like.

<A NAME="70702-04_spnew6"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Leicester: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for bringing the issue of youth crime to our attention and I am pleased to contribute to our debate in this my maiden speech. It seems that crime is a young man's game, and I say "man" advisedly because it seems to be young men rather than young women who are most prone to crime. The peak age is between 16 and 18. The noble Lord, Lord Elton, in his introduction said that if these were our children we would do something about it. I am sad to say that many of them are our children.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para36"></a>In a confidential poll carried out recently, 67 per cent. of boys from that age group admitted to committing at least one offence. The good news is that most grow out of crime by the age of 30; the bad news is that some do not. Of those sentenced in court, nine out of 10 have no educational qualifications, two out of three are unemployed, one-third are involved with drugs and one-quarter have no fixed accommodation. The most worrying statistic for me is that it seems that four out of 10 of those locked up in young offenders' institutions have previously been in care. That is a vital connection: the link between youth crime and parenting. Most young men grow out of crime, but it would be better if most never grew into it. The seeds of crime are planted at a young age and it seems that we should also be planting the seeds of the cure at that same young age.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para37"></a>I recently visited a primary school on one of our large housing estates. The head told me that he had had a bad day. A nine year-old child had, in the words of the head, "flipped his lid" that morning and had gone out of school, shouting and swearing. By the time the class teacher had found another adult to look after the class, the child had left the school, was out of the school gates and well on his way home. The teacher went after him. The child saw the teacher coming and jumped on the back of a passing milk float, pulling a couple of crates of milk on top of him. The teacher, to his horror, saw the child lying on the ground, covered with broken glass and milk. The milk float driver stopped, went round, saw the carnage and began kicking the child, at which the boy got up, ran back down the road, climbed over the school gates and said to the teacher, "Do him, sir". That child might well have had a very wobbly sense of right and wrong--certainly, he had not been listening to my school assemblies--but he had a clear sense of where his true friends were, in the school. Sadly, for many children from wobbly homes, the primary school is their only place of security. Surely that is where we <P>


<a name="column_212"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should start our crime prevention. We should be working with harassed parents before the problems of crime really begin.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para38"></a>When I visited another local estate school I saw a classroom that had been turned into a parents' centre. Carpet had been laid on the floor, comfortable chairs had been brought into the room and tea and coffee-making facilities were provided. A teacher was even allocated to the room for an hour or so every afternoon to be around when the young parents arrived. That teacher then encouraged those young parents--some no older than children themselves--with their own literacy and parenting skills, under the guise of helping them to help their children with their homework. I believe that that is time and money well invested.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para39"></a>One of our neighbouring parishes has an even more ambitious project--again, aimed at young adults. The project is located in a church hall and is funded by both public and private finance. It teaches young mothers word processing and computing skills--very marketable skills in today's world--but at the same time it provides a nursery and a creche. Those young women are getting companionship, dignity, skills for the world of work and skills for the world of parenting. I believe that as a result their children are far less likely to fall into crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para40"></a>Another strategic group which we should be targeting if we are serious about crime prevention comprises first-time offenders. The aim here is surely to divert those young people from custody and from becoming involved in more serious crimes. Eighty per cent. of those receiving a formal caution from the police in the presence of their parents never offend again, whereas 80 per cent. of those locked up in custody do offend again. Those are dramatic statistics. Obviously, the gross overcrowding in young offenders' institutions at the moment makes it difficult for the regime to give any attention to education or rehabilitation, but the fact is that intensive supervision in the community pays dividends in changed lives.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para41"></a>Forty years ago Leicester was the location for the first college which trained youth leaders. Sadly, in more recent times the youth service has been decimated. That means that we must all co-operate in running bail clubs, community service schemes and employment training schemes. A partnership must be developed between the police, the education service, the Probation Service, the social services, the churches and the voluntary agencies. Too many of our young people are being lost to crime. Too many of our young people are lost morally and socially. Now is the time to hold hands and to reverse the trend.

His voice, so familiar on the eight o'clock programme, will become even more familiar here, but I hope that he will not allow his love of the marathon to influence the crispness of his speeches. He has climbed every tower and spire of his diocese; he has climbed a new one here today, and most successfully, and I congratulate him on that.

<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para42"></a>By the year 2000 there will be 10,000 teenage criminals, each one responsible for some 20 crimes. The effect of every crime on the victim can be catastrophic. On becoming adults, that very small minority of youths are likely to cascade a criminal role model to their children. As my noble friend Lord Elton described, few are caught and even those are seldom punished, so prevention is the better course than cure.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para43"></a>Steps to prevent youth crime need to be taken by a wide range of agencies before those at risk start to offend. Parents need to be helped to bring up their children to respect the law. Schools play a major role. Social services, health, housing, leisure, youth training and drug and alcohol services all need to be involved. Both central and local government need to commit resources to implement crime-prevention initiatives, particularly aimed at this minority group.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para44"></a>I can personally speak of initiatives already in place within the Cleveland Constabulary. The force has recently appointed a community safety officer for youth issues. It has produced a youth strategy to encourage an appropriate local response to the needs of all young people. It is seeking to work with and to encourage young people through public, private and voluntary organisations to address underlying social issues which contribute to crime and to anti-social behaviour. That police force has, with other agencies, been seeking to divert youth from criminal activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para45"></a>I should like to give some examples of its outstanding work. All juveniles in the "Prison! Me! No Way!" scheme are required to attend a presentation by prison officers and a member of the cautioning support project as part of the cautioning procedure. The prison officers frankly describe prison life and a video recording charts the life of a juvenile from the commission of a criminal offence to his entry into the prison regime. Some mothers attending with their sons become distraught at the prospect. The post-cautioning support project then offers support in an attempt to divert the juveniles from re-offending. The support offered consists of positive help and a realistic plan for the future for that individual to remain crime-free.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para46"></a>Another project, the Safe in Teesside Project, has negotiated discounts with the leisure providers, cinemas and fast-food outlets. Discount cards are offered to all young persons in Teesside aged 11 to 18. The aim of the scheme was to divert young people from offending through boredom during the summer holidays by encouraging them to make more use of the leisure and recreation facilities available across the area. There was a very high take-up of the offers available.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para47"></a>A summer leisure activity programme, sponsored by the local authorities, takes place annually during the schools' summer holidays. The scheme has attracted 1,500 young people to take part in 54 quality leisure activities. Several young persons with convictions attended the scheme which thrived throughout the summer. The area saw a reduction in crime during that period, some of which must be thanks to the <P>


<a name="column_214"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>scheme. A measure of the success can be taken from a worthy comment made by the parents of one attendee to police officers:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Before this you wouldn't have got across my doorstep. You are welcome any time now". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para48"></a>There are 15 junior crime prevention panels in the force area. One such panel, at Grangefield School, Stockton, is acknowledged to be the most successful junior panel in the country. Started four years ago as a direct result of crime within the school, the panel has raised thousands of pounds to finance security systems for the premises, virtually eradicating crime. The Learning from Landscape scheme has also been very successful.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para49"></a>Police liaison with schools continues to foster citizenship to build mutual trust and understanding. A drugs awareness package has been produced by the force in partnership with the health authority. It is aimed at children in primary education. The scheme has significantly raised the level of awareness of drugs by children in the nine to 11 year-old age group.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-04_para50"></a>There is another field of initiative set up by Youth at Risk, a national charity that devises schemes to enable offenders to face the future without crime. That has had great success in the provision of places at a cost of &#163;6,000, compared with &#163;50,000 per place at an offenders' institute. Divert is another organisation, and there are many more. I hope that the Government will support these highly cost-effective charities, along with the methods that have been successfully used in Cleveland and elsewhere by government agencies.

I know the difference between speculation and disclosure. I hope that the Leader of the House will not use that as his first answer to my questions. Of course speculation occurs all the time; but this morning when I awoke I heard on the radio some speculation about whether the Government would remove the tax allowances for private health care for the over 60s. That is fine. However, the BBC, which <P>


<a name="column_215"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 215</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appeared to believe that it had a story of some import, reported that Treasury sources had confirmed the story. I may be slightly wrong in my choice of words because I am relying on my memory; but it was perfectly clear that that had been confirmed by the Treasury. That goes beyond speculation about the Budget; it is disclosure of the content.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-05_para1"></a>When I arrived in your Lordships' House today I read the Financial Times and the article on the front page written by very responsible journalists: Mr. Robert Peston (who may well be known to quite a few Members of your Lordships' House), Mr. Edward Luce and Mr. Steve Thompson. The article discussed speculation that the Government might be about to drop their plan to abolish dividend tax credit on advance corporation tax. If so, that would mean that pension fund income would be reduced by &#163;3.5 billion. Whether or not ACT is to be abolished is a fairly sensitive piece of information. The speculation has been that it would be abolished. We now move across the boundary between speculation and disclosure. I quote the article in question:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A senior member of the Government said:'The markets are bonkers ... we are pressing ahead'". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-05_para2"></a>Either these three respectable journalists are wrong or they are right and a senior member of the Government--whom I take to be a Treasury Minister--used those words to one or all of those three journalists. That is not speculation but disclosure. I believe that the Government should take this matter much more seriously than they are. Of course the Government have every right to follow their manifesto pledges; but one of those pledges was to refrain from indulging in disclosure before the Budget of price-sensitive information. If the noble Lord the Leader of the House looks at the markets this morning, he will see that that information is indeed price-sensitive. I would be interested to know the identity of the senior Member of the Government who spoke to the FT. Perhaps he should do what Hugh Dalton did and come clean, but perhaps the motto should be "New Labour, old habits".
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-05_para3"></a>It is rather unfortunate that Treasury sources and a senior member of the Government should disclose information before the Budget. It is doubly unfortunate that the Government do not take these matters seriously.

<A NAME="70702-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Leader of the House for repeating the Statement. I also pay tribute to the noble Lord who has just resumed his seat. We should also thank him for repeating what Mr. Lilley said in the House of Commons about 15 minutes ago, except that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, did it rather better than Mr. Lilley. Mr. Lilley gave one of the most pathetically inept performances that I have ever seen in the House of Commons.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-05_para4"></a>Is the noble Lord aware that the comparison between what the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, has just said and the Dalton leak in the early years of the 1945 Labour Government is manifest nonsense? Is he also aware that, curiously enough, no Select Committee was set up when the Daily Mirror received a copy of the previous Chancellor's Budget? I do not recall that the previous <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Government suggested that there should be a Select Committee of the House of Commons to investigate that matter. However, I do remember--perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Richard, will also recall it--allegations made in 1969 that a budget leak had taken place which had appeared on the front page of the Sunday Express. Those were allegations made by Sir Gerald Nabarro and were taken up with energy by the Conservative Opposition. A Select Committee was appointed. I quote from paragraph 12 of the committee's report:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Your Committee are forced to conclude ... that Sir Gerald has no evidence which would support this allegation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-05_para5"></a>There was a Select Committee appointed to look at an alleged budget leak which led to substantial expenditure of public time and money but reached no sensible conclusion.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-05_para6"></a>Further, a leak took place when Mr. Nigel Lawson was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Disclosures were made by a national newspaper that the Chancellor intended to withdraw tax privileges from those who took out endowment policies. I do not recall that the then Government set up a Select Committee to investigate this matter, despite the fact that tens of thousands of people took out endowment policies in order to obtain tax relief and so save themselves a great deal of money.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-05_para7"></a>Is the noble Lord the Leader of the House aware that many of us would prefer a situation in which there was far greater sensible discussion before Budget statements and that a great deal of Budget secrecy is unnecessary? Further, is he aware that perhaps we would all benefit from much more mature debate on the options facing the Chancellor before he presented his Budget?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that the House should become too excited about this. It is perfectly obvious what is going on. This is a very transparent attempt by the Opposition in another place to disrupt the Budget of my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is not a new tactic. It has happened before and no doubt it will happen again. I wholly agree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich. What he said was powerfully expressed. He had his facts right. The argumentation was good and I agreed with it.

As I understand it, it is based on one comment by the BBC and one sentence in the Financial Times. The article in the Financial Times bears looking at for a moment. Perhaps we shall see the extent of this leak. There has been speculation about ACT for a long time. The article states:

The quicker he gets a job the better, and then we can all relax. The noble Lord is using sleight of hand. Yesterday the market shifted 147 points, as I remember it, for no apparent reason. Normally the day before a Budget one would expect all the dealers to sit on their hands for very obvious reasons. One of the issues that has been around is tax credits and ACT, as the noble Lord rightly said. There was a great deal of expectation that that was the Government's policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-05_para12"></a>If a government source said, "The market is bonkers", that is a statement that the opposite is a fact. It can only be one or the other. The noble Lord may be able to jump up to say in retrospect, "As a matter of fact, the Government have been highly intelligent and sensible. They decided not to proceed with such an idiot idea". If that is so, obviously it had no effect on the market. But if the Government have decided to proceed with action on ACT and tax credits, and they were told yesterday that the rumour that they were not so going to do caused the market to shift, and therefore it was bonkers, that is a leak.

We look forward to hearing many more such contributions from them both in the years ahead.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para1"></a>Criminal and anti-social behaviour by the young too often adversely affects those least well equipped to deal with it--the frail, the elderly, and the vulnerable, frequently trapped on housing estates. It is difficult to exaggerate the sheer hell it can mean for those who have no means of escape.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para2"></a>It is therefore encouraging that the Government have indicated their resolve to look beyond the immediate priorities and not to limit themselves to essential, firm reactive action alone, although that firm, reactive action is clearly essential. Understanding and the ability to ask, "Why?"--"Why is this happening?"--are the basis for taking effective and rational rather than emotional action. Rational action must lie in the realm of prevention--obviously the best lasting solution.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para3"></a>I am glad to be president of the YMCA in England. That brings no executive or trustee responsibilities, but it enables me to be a privileged witness of extensive practical community service. The YMCA has come to understand that an integrated social programme is imperative in its work with young people at risk. That includes housing, training, family services, preparation for, and support in, parenting, counselling--often drugs counselling--childcare, nursery school provision and sporting, health and fitness facilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para4"></a>It is essential to recognise what contributes to offending behaviour by the young and to address it at source. The London City YMCA, for example, focuses on detached youth work on estates at the edge of the city. Youth workers go where young people are likely to be, especially in the evenings, and build up relationships of trust, using informal education techniques to work on drug and alcohol misuse, on sexual health and on criminal behaviour.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para5"></a>Elsewhere, in all regions of England, the Foyer scheme has proved a highly relevant way of breaking the no-home, no-job cycle by providing accommodation, training, job search, and counselling under one roof. It has certainly been the experience of YMCA, with some 50 per cent. of the total Foyer projects, that that work has achieved significant success across the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para6"></a>Problems with the behaviour of young people can rapidly escalate out of control as a result of inadequate skills in parenting or lack of confidence on the part of parents in dealing with difficult behaviour patterns which could end up as criminal offending. The YMCA is therefore now starting programmes which will be designed to provide at community level at least some support and guidance for parents of teenagers.

<A NAME = "70702-06_para7"></a>Where young offenders are in custody, the appropriateness of their treatment also requires close scrutiny. Punishment is important, but rehabilitation is the bigger challenge. There is no point in just producing fitter hardened criminals. I have seen some of the interesting pioneer work already being done by the YMCA in two young offender institutions. I understand that discussions are taking place with a view to extending that work to a further seven such institutions. The key to that work, as I see it, is to invest the offenders with a sense of personality, of personal worth, personal self-respect, and personal responsibility--certainly never to dehumanise them, for many of those young people have known little love or appreciation in their lives and may have never had the opportunity to sense what they might become.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para8"></a>The pre- and post-release training and personal development cover formal training--numeracy, NVQs and the like--and the informal training--life skills, handling and resolving conflict, team building and, most important of all, preparation for the harsh realities which will be encountered on release. The positive results from all those activities, as monitored in the post-release records of offenders, are already encouraging.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para9"></a>The vital strength which I detect in what I have been describing is the continuity of support through custody to post-release help with accommodation, training, and other support. That continuity is indispensable if we are serious about rehabilitation and reducing the risk of re-offending. There is a need to take the hand of the young offender, as there is of those of the young at risk, and walk with them through the trauma to a better life. We are very good at talking severely about the young, but where is our solidarity?
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para10"></a>It has been suggested that young offenders should make reparations and apologise to their victims. That makes a lot of sense. We cannot be sentimental about anti-social or criminal behaviour. Society must be firm about its essential rules, but those rules have to be based on confidence and self-evident consistency about what are the civilised values which we embrace. Our deeds and vocabulary, our culture as a nation, have demonstrably to be those of integrity, responsibility, care, compassion and vision. We have to be able to say to the young, "Do as we do" not just "Do as we say".
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para11"></a>As it is, it may be that society has itself to make reparation to many of the young and to apologise for its hypocrisy and inconsistency--too much greed at the apex of the social triangle--for the unemployment, the soulless estates, the abuse of the environment, the inadequate educational and recreational resources, parents overwhelmed by adversity and by the struggle to survive and the general hopelessness which confronts the millions of excluded. Indeed, to what will many young children be going home under a curfew? Sometimes, tragically, the streets may be preferable.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para12"></a>There is an urgent need for integrated social, economic, and employment policies which bring together all the key elements in a battle for the young rather than against them. In so far as the Government <P>


<a name="column_220"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 220</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>can set that direction, they should have our unqualified support. For that, surely, is the real, unsentimental road of hard-headed common sense.

<A NAME="70702-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Warnock: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for initiating today's debate. I am also very pleased indeed to be following two such outstanding maiden speakers as we have heard this afternoon. I should simply like to make one suggestion; namely, that we should ask the Government to think again, dispassionately and without prejudice, about the provision of boarding education for some children who, I believe, are children in severe need. What they are in need of is often not punishment, even though they have offended: they are in need of preventive care and, more importantly, education.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para13"></a>I am sure that no one will disagree with me when I say that education is at the heart of the question of preventing young persons from committing crime. Therefore, we ought to take that thought seriously and not allow ourselves to be prejudiced against boarding education which has fallen into decay largely because local authorities have not been able to afford fees for such schools as, for example, Peper Harrow, which is probably the best known of the schools for boys suffering from behavioural and emotional deprivation, or difficulties, at school. Many of those boys fell into crime through having been excluded from their normal schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para14"></a>I believe that such schools ought to be reinvented. The fact that we all know horror stories about boarding education ought not to entail the closure of such schools, thus shutting off this possible source of help for society; rather we should devise better and more efficient ways for inspecting such schools. It is impossible to blame local education authorities for not being able to afford the fees for those schools, which are inevitably very high because the student-teacher ratio has to be very tight.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para15"></a>I blame the situation on a policy which has made it impossible for local education authorities to take their duties seriously. After all, many of the young people about whom I am talking had statements of special need when they were thrown out of their schools and the local education authorities could not--and, indeed, have not been able to in the past--do what they had a duty to do; namely, to supply proper and suitable education for such children.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para16"></a>No one should be too much committed to keeping a child in the family when thinking about the kind of problems that we are discussing this afternoon. For one thing, and as we have already heard, many of the children who offend are already in care and have virtually left their families. However, for a large number of them, the difficulties that they have in concentrating, in being interested in anything or, indeed, in having any set of moral standards, stem from the family. Very often there is tremendous conflict within the family for which a steady, continuous and absolutely solid supportive school is the proper solution. I simply want to emphasise the great difference that I believe there is between <P>


<a name="column_221"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>punishment of offending children and the support that they receive from education. I should add that education for some of them must be a 24-hour process and not just a matter of going in and out of school, and often truanting.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para17"></a>I know that boarding schools for such offending children have to be secure, but that does not turn them into prisons. I say that because the intention behind all that they receive from those schools is not punitive; indeed, it is disciplinary and educative. One cannot exaggerate the importance that education might have in eventually turning these children away from crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para18"></a>I do not believe that such schools should be closed simply because they do not deliver the whole of the national curriculum. That argument has been used in the past as a reason for closure. Of course, the delivery of the whole of the national curriculum should be an ideal for such schools, but often the young people who attend them are in no position to learn anything at the beginning. It is a long process to prepare these offending children for education and thus enable them to benefit from it, especially if they are drug abusers, as many of them are. Therefore, if the schools are trying to deliver the national curriculum and have that aim very much in mind, but have much more at the front of their minds--namely, the preparation for education which, for example, drug abusers need--they should not be closed or subject to closure on academic grounds. I beseech the Government to look again at the policy of causing such schools to be closed based on the financial difficulties experienced by local education authorities in supporting such children and paying their fees.

<P>
<A NAME="70702-06_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Caldecote: </B>   My Lords, in his excellent introduction to the debate, my noble friend Lord Elton emphasised the urgent need to prevent crime occurring. The detection, arrest and punishment of crime all indicate a failure to prevent it, and the cost is enormous; indeed, something like &#163;4 billion a year is spent dealing with juvenile crime. One of the vital contributions to the prevention of youth crime is made at school. Those leaving school with a constructive outlook, who see life ahead as a great opportunity, will be unlikely to embark on a life of crime. However, maladjusted children leaving school with no clear purpose for their life in sight, and perhaps with some grudge against society stemming from an unhappy home, family neglect, poverty or drugs, can all too easily be led astray into a life of crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para19"></a>I believe that we should devote far greater efforts and resources to helping young people to leave school without such disadvantages. That involves pastoral care on a one-to-one basis. Although most teachers no doubt recognise the need for such care, they have no spare time for it in a very busy life. Experience shows that the best way of helping disturbed and disadvantaged children is through well-trained pastoral workers coming into the school by invitation of the head teacher and working closely with staff and parents.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para20"></a>A charity, Schools Outreach, is one organisation which carries out such work supremely well, as I know from connection with it over many years. The <P>


<a name="column_222"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 222</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>organisation gives very thorough training to pastoral workers. Its success is undoubted and well documented. I should like to give your Lordships two such examples, although there are many others. In 1992 Berkshire County Council approached Schools Outreach and a pastoral careworker was allocated to each of two schools which drew pupils from an estate beset with unemployment, social and drug problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para21"></a>The head teacher at one of those schools reported that before a Schools Outreach worker was appointed, pupils were running riot. She said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We had a lot of very aggressive children, but having a resident pastoral care worker has changed the school. There is a sense of calmness now. Children come to school feeling a greater sense of security". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para22"></a>In another school, the headteacher reported on the outcome of the appointment of a Schools Outreach pastoral worker and said that, two years before the appointment, there were 38 and 50 temporary exclusions in each of those two years, one of which was permanent. Two years after, there were three temporary exclusions in one year and two in the next with, again, one being permanent. On staffing, the year before the appointment of a Schools Outreach pastoral care worker, there was a 90 per cent. staff turnover, while two years after there were no staff changes. I believe that that indicates the real success of the Schools Outreach workers in those very difficult schools. The report of that headmistress continued that the Schools Outreach project was of tremendous value to the school, to the children and community, enabling staff, parents and carers in the local community to work closely together.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para23"></a>Those are just two examples and they are very clear and decisive examples. They are surely convincing of the value of those pastoral workers and there is no doubt that a major factor in the success of those workers is that they are seen as non-official adult friends. They remove the reluctance of children to approach staff and, of course, they have the time available for that demanding work.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para24"></a>Workers like those can make a major contribution to ensuring that those young people leave school in a constructive, positive frame of mind without hang-ups. Therefore, they are far less likely to embark on a life of crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para25"></a>But of course, all that costs money. It costs some &#163;20,000 to &#163;25,000 per year per worker, including training costs. At present, the number of Schools Outreach workers is severely limited by lack of funding, with minimal support from the Department for Education and Employment and local education authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para26"></a>Over the past five years, I have tried to persuade HMG to allocate more money. The Department for Education and Employment says that it is a matter for the LEAs and the LEAs say that there is no money to spare. Therefore, I tried the Home Office, for which it would be a marvellous investment because it would save some of the huge costs spent on juvenile crime later on. But the Home Office says it is a matter for the DfEE.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para27"></a>We now have one Secretary of State responsible for transport and the environment which is a very good idea. If we are to take seriously crime prevention among <P>


<a name="column_223"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 223</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>young people, surely we need one Minister with overall responsibility, for that is not just a Home Office or DfEE responsibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para28"></a>I urge Her Majesty's Government first to provide extra funding, rising to perhaps &#163;100 million per annum over the next four years. That would fund another 4,000 pastoral workers among our 25,000 schools and would cover most of those in need of such workers. It is a drop in the ocean compared with the &#163;4 billion which is now spent on dealing with juvenile crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para29"></a>Secondly, I urge the Government to clarify and concentrate responsibility in that field. If it is impracticable to give responsibility to one Minister, perhaps it could be shared effectively between the Minister of State responsible for criminal policy at the Home Office and the Minister responsible for school standards in the DfEE. Moreover, it would be absolutely essential to give them a budget specifically for that purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para30"></a>I hope that the noble Lord who is to reply will be able to say something encouraging in that respect because I believe that it is of immense importance and a very good investment for the nation.

<A NAME="70702-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   My Lords, I am conscious when the clock says seven minutes that time has been well exceeded and I do not intend to do that in my speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para31"></a>I begin by thanking most warmly the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for giving the House an opportunity to discuss what has been demonstrated clearly to be a very interesting topic. I want also to congratulate my noble friend Lord Evans. He spent most of his younger life on one side of the Tyne in Jarrow, whereas I spent most of mine in Scotswood Road, Newcastle, looking across there. For the past 25 years we have been comrades in the Labour Party at various levels. I know that he will make some down-to-earth contributions to our discussions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para32"></a>I know that the Minister who is to reply is a caring Minister. I speak for the Association of London Government, of which I have the pleasure to be a joint president. In the past, there was a lack of cohesion and of an overall strategy. The previous government had many fine initiatives but they were disparate. My noble friend Lord Evans referred to the initiatives by the present Home Secretary where there is to be a co-ordinated effort to deal with the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para33"></a>The size of the problem is not only sad; it is horrific. Many statistics have been introduced into the debate. But when I did my research what I found particularly sad was the enormous cost involved to family life, industry and the prospects of young people who have wandered into crime of one sort or another. However, I was interested that a research paper of March 1997, Preventing Children Attending, indicated that there were "significant family risk factors". Those factors relate to a child's environment, parental control, hereditary matters and many other aspects. Inherent in criminality among young people are factors such as poor parental <P>


<a name="column_224"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 224</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>supervision, parental neglect, harsh or erratic discipline, parental conflict, long-term separation from a biological parent and having a parent with a criminal record. While it is not suggested that those are the causes of delinquency, they are bound to have an influence on the youngster and whether he drifts into or is kept out of crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para34"></a>The two major institutions involved in whether a youngster drifts into or is kept out of crime are the family and the school. I am sure that none of us is brave enough to say which is more important. School risk factors include low educational achievement, disruptive behaviour, persistent truanting and permanent exclusion from schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para35"></a>When the dust dies down, I hope that the Minister will be able to give us a pointer in the right direction. Yes, we must look after the victims of crime but we must examine also the causes of crime. We must be fair and recognise that the issue is not black and white. It is not even a party issue and it is certainly not a party political issue because we are all members of the same community.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para36"></a>The House will be well aware that I have the pleasure to be associated with the retail business. I am secretary of the all-party retail group. The retail industry is extremely conscious of the enormous cost to industry of youth crime. Perhaps I may give one or two statistics. The Retail Crime Survey showed that crime committed against retailers cost the industry &#163;1.42 billion. In addition, retailers spent &#163;450 million on crime prevention. Therefore, the total for the year was almost &#163;2 billion. That is paid for by other customers who subsidise those who do not pay for what they take from a shop.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para37"></a>I am glad to see the initiatives by Marks & Spencer, among others. There is a genuine programme of collaboration between retailers and schools in order to alert youngsters to the fact that they need to have more respect for property. They need to be well aware of the dangers when they go into a supermarket or a department store and look upon it as an Aladdin's Cave.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para38"></a>In order to keep to my earlier threat or promise, I shall deprive your Lordships of the very interesting tail end of my speech and sit down now.

<A NAME="70702-06_spnew5"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Lichfield: </B>   My Lords, I add my congratulations to our two maiden speakers and also to the noble Lord, Lord Elton.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para39"></a>To the evidence from Gloucestershire, Jarrow, Newcastle and Cleveland, I should like to add evidence from the West Midlands. I come from a diocese covering a population of 2.5 million, including communities in Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton, West Bromwich and other Black Country towns. This issue impinges heavily upon us also.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para40"></a>In the Stoke and Longton district, 3,100 offences were committed last year by 2,100 young offenders. Twenty-seven of these offenders were in the younger age groups and were responsible for about 20 per cent. of the offences. As regards the industrial, or in places <P>


<a name="column_225"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 225</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>post-industrial, West Midlands, I reiterate that the problem cannot be separated from other serious issues in the region, in particular youth unemployment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para41"></a>I have learnt in this House the discipline of not depending on purely sociological analyses of human ills. However, the fact remains that in some of our Black Country senior schools, 20 per cent. of school-leavers fail to find jobs although they try to do so. That figure can rise to 30 per cent. among young Asian and Afro-Caribbean school-leavers. If there is a prospect of unemployment, that causes disillusion and absenteeism during the school process. In one of our urban boroughs the local education authority reports nearly 11 per cent. of pupils being absent on any one half day. In one senior school the figure can rise to 15 per cent. on any one half day.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para42"></a>Nor can we forget the overall impact of what has been called post-industrial shock. Much of the community life of our region was bound up with a large industrial workforce in which sons followed fathers and grandfathers into the foundries, the collieries and the large-scale manufacturing industries. For many that kind of community "glue" has gone, denting pride, security and self-respect, although marvellous human qualities of humour, courage and resilience remain.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para43"></a>However, the intention of this debate is positive: it is to call attention to the importance of the initiatives. I wish to mention two that are known to me. The first is closely connected with what the noble Lord, Lord Gisborough, has said about the Cleveland police. I wish to praise the policy and the efforts made in our region by the Staffordshire police not only for their support of a police inspector who has become a nationally respected expert on getting children back to school; not only for the work, which has already been mentioned, of police schools liaison officers who are out every day delivering training packages to counter drug abuse; but also--this was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Gisborough--the setting up in our region of the Burslem Divisional Junior Consultation Panel for young people under 21. Police consultation panels exist but they are often for adults. This panel is made up of representatives from every school in that populous region of Stoke-on-Trent. It has gathered no fewer than 100,000 answers from young people aged 11 to 16 to questions about youth crime--the subject of this debate--and about how to improve the quality of life for young people in the region. That information is proving valuable and the consultation is fruitful.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para44"></a>Secondly--here I pick up what the noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, said--I wish to praise a number of people, such as school outreach workers, who work alongside school welfare officers in Wolverhampton and the Black Country. They are committed to helping disaffected young people to re-enter both education and community life by re-establishing relationships. It is unstable relationships which are close to the heart of this problem. I support the views of the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, the noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, and the noble Viscount, Lord Brentford; namely, that families and workers must sustain these relationships because it is in relationships that personal responsibility and choice are nourished.
<P>


<a name="column_226"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 226</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para45"></a>But here, finally, comes the crunch. In one of the key boroughs where such schemes exist in my diocese a 10 per cent. cut in the education budget is expected. As the noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, said, we need 4,000 pastoral workers of the kind I have mentioned throughout the country. When lottery funding or City Challenge funding comes to an end and school outreach projects find it hard to sustain the funding, how will those workers survive? Perhaps that question is being answered or not answered in another place this afternoon. I say to the Minister that it is too long to wait for the co-ordinating committee; we need these workers now.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-06_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Tenby: </B>   My Lords, the House is grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for initiating this important topic at this particular time and for kicking off with a thoughtful and compassionate speech. We have also had the added bonus of hearing two excellent maiden speeches.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para46"></a>This is a big subject and the allotted time is short so I propose to concentrate on only one aspect of youth crime prevention; namely, the desirability of speeding up the time between the committal of an offence and the sentence. In this context I look forward with some expectation--as I am sure many do within the legal system--to the Government's "fast track" proposals in their forthcoming crime and disorder Bill. I hope I shall not be accused of any partiality if I own to a certain frisson of anticipation about this year's round of criminal justice proposals, particularly on the youth front--an experience which has been sadly absent for me in recent years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para47"></a>Although I have been a magistrate for many years, and therefore declare an interest in these matters, I say with great regret that I have never sat on a juvenile panel. Nevertheless, it is a matter of some satisfaction and indeed pride to me that north Hampshire, my home Bench as it were, is one of the areas in which this speeding up process is being tested even now.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para48"></a>Facts about the present situation make pretty sombre reading. The average time between the committal of an offence and the eventual disposal is 128 days, but at worst can be as much as 170 days; that is, 24 weeks. We should just contemplate that. To take it to an extreme hypothesis, suppose that the offender commits only one offence per week during that period; by the time the original offence had come up for sentencing, 24 further matters would have to be taken into consideration. The main point, however, surely is this: the further the sentencing is from the commission of the crime, the greater the difficulty in making the offender face up to the implications of his or her behaviour. In some instances they even forget that they have been responsible for a particular offence. I know that is hard to believe but it is true.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para49"></a>Much time is also currently being lost, in the case of persistent offenders, in gathering up the various offences over what may be a period of some months, and often over a number of different court areas, into one sentencing parcel, if I may use that word. Admirable <P>


<a name="column_227"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 227</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>though this sentiment may be in sentencing terms, in the case of juveniles there is much to be said for dealing as rapidly as possible with only the case in hand so that the offender can be confronted with his or her anti-social behaviour when the event is still fresh in the mind and before the offender becomes irretrievably locked into a downward spiral of repeat offending. In this context the Audit Commission's recent invaluable report, which has already been referred to today, points out that only 17 per cent. of youth cases were sentenced on first hearing, the average requiring no fewer than four sittings of a court. So noble Lords will see what a mountain there is to climb.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para50"></a>A speeding up of the legal process is one arm of the fight against juvenile criminals but the other surely is the strengthening of effective means of dealing with the offenders themselves in order to ensure, so far as is possible, that they do not re-offend. Establishing multi-agency youth offender teams under the aegis of local authorities can provide the means for doing this. The creation of the Northamptonshire Diversion Unit, consisting of representatives of the police, the probation, social, health, youth and education services some three years ago, shows that such an initiative can produce results. For example, 76 per cent. of all compensation claims were paid against only 48 per cent. in an area without this innovative service. Most important of all perhaps, 76 per cent. of victims expressed themselves as either satisfied or very satisfied with these new arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para51"></a>The area of juvenile crime is a delicate one. A false move, an over-reaction, may result in an offender being lost to society for ever. There are 101 reasons why a young person may turn to crime: peer pressure; inadequate parenting; failure at school; lack of job opportunity; drug or alcohol abuse, and so on. But unlike adults, juvenile offending patterns can disappear almost overnight and for no discernible reason, we hope never to reappear. Accordingly, it is surely not too much to ask of ourselves as a civilised society that we use every endeavour, every scrap of our imagination and resolve, to deter young people from a life of crime; and by doing so we shall of course protect ourselves from the depredations of young people who account for some 40 per cent. of all indictable offences in this country today.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para52"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said, we have lost far too much valuable time in dealing with this problem already. Let us now set to with a will and as a matter of urgency to attempt to solve it.

The harmful effect of lead, of which we consume more than did our more primitive ancestors, is now generally acknowledged, although not enough notice is taken of it. Much has been written about the effects on behaviour of minerals, vitamins and other nutrients, both in general and for particular individuals, and to my mind their importance <P>


<a name="column_228"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 228</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is established. But policy statements by two of the professions most concerned, psychiatrists and psychologists, attach little or no importance to diet.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para53"></a>I must declare an interest as chairman of a charity, Natural Justice, which, with the University of Surrey, is running a double-blind trial on the effect of a fairly standard vitamin and mineral supplement on the behaviour of prisoners. The results are expected in a few months, and I shall be very disappointed if they are not positive. I am glad to say that the Home Office has promised a small contribution to that work. The Department of Health gives an annual grant to the Hyperactive Children's Support Group which has had successes with dietary changes, but in recent years that grant has been reduced. I hope that the new Minister will look at the work of this group and will decide whether the very hardworking mother and daughter team which runs it merits more support. Dare I hope that its gender base will commend it to the Government?
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para54"></a>Why do the orthodox dismiss the importance of diet on behaviour? It is probably because doctors tend to concentrate on the things which only they can do, and because of the complexity of the interactions between different nutrients. Why should more attention be paid to diet? It is because action on it is cheap, effective and, with proper precautions, harmless.

<A NAME="70702-06_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Henderson of Brompton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, went further than the noble Lord who cut his speech so dramatically from six minutes to five. We now have a little extra time to speak if we wish to--but that might be rather unfortunate.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para55"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for having raised the subject today. He is chairman of the Divert Trust which is the successor to the so-called IT Fund which the Government sponsored for five years on the initiative of Lord Ennals. He was before his time in taking that initiative. It is important that it should be followed up. As the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said, it is difficult to attract funds for this purpose unless the Government participate too. For that reason I ask for funding for the successor body, the Divert Trust, to be considered again by the Government perhaps for another &#163;500,000. At &#163;100,000 a year it seems chicken feed compared with demands that I have heard from others today. It would fund the body well into the next century and over the millennium.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para56"></a>Another small organisation related to the Divert Trust is the John Hunt Award Trust. It exists with pathetically small funds to reward new work aimed at diverting youngsters at risk and publicising that new work in local communities. Both organisations are well worth supporting.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para57"></a>Although the subject has been mentioned previously, I, too, wish to refer to the issue. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice recently called for,
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"measures to be taken to divert young people from crimes at the earliest opportunity". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para58"></a>I was one of those who was fortunate enough to hear the noble and learned Lord give that lecture. I strongly endorse what he said. The powerful support of the <P>


<a name="column_229"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 229</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Chief Justice indicates that the Ennals initiative should be followed into the next millennium. I hope that it will be.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para59"></a>Now is surely the time to help the existing organisations about which we have heard in the impressive contributions today. All over the country small groups operate, some started by the police in small communities and others which have prospered and grown bigger. But the local initiative is what matters. I refer again to the Divert Trust, a body which should be supported with funding.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para60"></a>I hope that what I shall say is not party political in any way. I am impressed by the Government's election manifesto. It contains seeds to do just what we have all been urging. The first element is to place a new responsibility on local authorities to develop statutory partnerships to help prevent crime. Local authorities will then be required to set targets for the reduction of crime and disorder in their area. I cannot think of a better way of extending the work of Lord Ennals and the current activities of the Divert Trust. The second element is to get 250,000 young people under the age of 25 off benefit and into work by using money from the windfall tax--which I suppose by now is common knowledge and not mere speculation. The third element is to get the unemployed from welfare to work. That may have as its primary purpose the reduction of the burden on the social services budget. But it will surely work as a powerful incentive towards the reduction of youth-related crime as work replaces idleness. I congratulate the Government on all those elements in their election manifesto.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para61"></a>I conclude by endorsing the Lord Chief Justice's call for the Advisory Council on the Penal System to be revived. I believe that the suggestion was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, in his speech today. I wish to echo the words of the Lord Chief Justice that the beginning of a new Parliament is the ideal moment for such an initiative.

<A NAME="70702-06_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, it is very good that it is an incoming Government who, through the voice of my noble friend, are answering the noble Lord, Lord Elton, today. It gives my noble friend an opportunity to outline how the Government intend to deliver that toughness on the causes of crime which, as my noble friend Lord Graham said, was the second part of that famous slogan of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister when he was Shadow Home Secretary.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para62"></a>Before focusing on just one of many possible initiatives--namely the role of outdoor adventure education--I want to echo the words of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Lichfield and re-emphasise the relationship between youth unemployment and crime and between alcohol and drug abuse and crime. All of those have increased over the past two decades--I suggest as side-effects of the basic philosophy that seeking profit and wealth for oneself is the best way to benefit the whole nation. Unfortunately, that policy has left many by the wayside. While many of us, even the majority, may have attained entry to the <P>


<a name="column_230"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 230</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>culture of contentment, others have been excluded from the party. Sadly, that is not confined to the United Kingdom. It is a worldwide phenomenon where monetarist capitalism prevails, particularly in its very raw state in those countries where state socialism has failed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para63"></a>My noble friend will probably point out that today's Budget will allow a significant first step to be taken in reducing unemployment among young people. Not to have even a small, useful role in society--noble Lords should realise that, since 2nd May, there is such a thing as society again--simply confirms the low self-esteem in which many school-leavers hold themselves. I use the term "school-leavers" in a double sense, since many who are at school are also school-leavers in the sense of truantism or exclusion. The noble Lord, Lord Elton, pointed out how crime is more common among school-aged children who are truanting or excluded. Drugs and crime provide a shield against the depressed, pessimistic outlook that many young people have today. Entry into the risky but exciting way of life of crime, as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, mentioned, is a way out of that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para64"></a>Unemployment, lack of occupation, is not the whole problem. Many influences play their part. Poverty and poor housing affect the mental health of parents, and thus the parental love, attention, stimulation and good example that they can offer. Those factors may result in failure at school and subsequent unemployment. Crime or drug abuse is more common in some areas with the same degree of deprivation. In their remarks noble Lords have ranged over many contributory factors.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para65"></a>There are things that can be done here and now, as well as attending to the underlying social problems that lead to crime. As a group, young people have a great capacity for challenging physical activities. That fearless energy has been, and still is, used by tribal and national groups to do battle with neighbouring opposed groups or to hunt for food. Participative sports also utilise this risk-taking energy. But the only opportunity to be involved in these sorts of exciting activities in many deprived communities is to become involved in the drugs or crime scene, where ingenuity and nimble footwork can outwit the enemy--which is us, the affluent society, and its protectors, the police.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para66"></a>However, that energy can be tapped and diverted into benign activities. National service--"Put them in the Army"--is yesterday's answer, besides which, it comes too late, missing the most receptive age group, from 12 to 18. A number of imaginative schemes are now in place which include outdoor activities in their programmes for youth at risk. The co-ordinating body for such activities is the Foundation for Outdoor Activity, whose patrons include the great mountaineers, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and Sir Chris Bonington, and whose director is Roger Putnam, former principal of the Outward Bound Mountain School at Eskdale. The 1991 DES report on physical education stated:

<A NAME = "70702-06_para68"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and Roger Putnam produced a report, In Search of Adventure, among whose pages is this statement:

<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para69"></a>I had intended to give examples of those sorts of activities but time is closing in. The Foundation for Outdoor Activity conducted a survey into the effects of outdoor adventure on young people at risk. It states:
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para70"></a>I see that I have run out of time.

<A NAME="70702-06_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for introducing this important debate. I support the noble Lord, Lord Rea, in his advocacy of outdoor projects for young people, with some of which I am involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para71"></a>Today, however, I want to address the Government's manifesto commitment to be
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para72"></a>I hope that, in replying, the noble Lord will tell us a little more about what the Government envisage as being the causes of crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para73"></a>I want to concentrate on just two of the most fundamental causes of youth crime today--young men with no hope of a job, and a society without shared values. I refer to young "men" without a job because, as I believe we all accept, after the age of 16 youth crime is mainly a problem of young men. In my experience that does not necessarily mean that girls are not involved in crime. However, they tend to switch either to prostitution, or to premature motherhood--which is perhaps not a crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para74"></a>There is a problem in relation to the role of men in our society today which needs to be examined in far more depth, for which there is not time this afternoon. I simply make the point that children, especially boys, need fathers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para75"></a>Why do young men turn to crime? Is it really so surprising, if you have no hope of a job, if you are bored, as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said, by unrestricted idleness--if you have nothing to do and nothing to spend? In our society today if you are a lavish consumer you are respected. To be poor is to be excluded. There are not many rich children involved in the kind of juvenile crime we are examining today. For a poor young man with no hope of a job, a career in <P>


<a name="column_232"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 232</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>burglary fulfils many of the roles of a job. It provides cash; it offers a respite from boredom; it is fulfilling; it offers good company; it is fun; you are a hell of a guy with your peer group; it is tax efficient. It is risky, but it is glamorous, and that perhaps makes up for the risk. When you are young, you do not, anyway, believe that you will be caught. Above all, there is a low threshold of entry, much lower than for any of the jobs that are available to many young men today.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para76"></a>So one of the first things we need to do if we want to reduce the rate of youth crime is to ensure that as many young men as possible have a viable and reasonably attractive alternative. We must reduce "unemployability". Employability depends on training and training depends on education. Success in both and in life depends on what is now fashionably called social and emotional literacy which, as I understand it, means building self-confidence--the ability and willingness to get on with others, to settle down, to learn and to work.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para77"></a>Those qualities begin to be learnt by a child from its earliest years. "A child's values are formed by the values of those around it as it grows up". They are normally learnt from parents who make a child feel secure and loved at home, stimulated and wanted, and they teach the child that there are boundaries to acceptable behaviour. Without those qualities, children, when they enter school, soon identify themselves as misfits and decide to rebel or to retreat into themselves. A lack of satisfactory early parenting and parental support is the most common cause of failure to thrive and to succeed at school and in life.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para78"></a>I welcome Jack Straw's paper on Parenting which was published before the election but which will, I assume, form the basis of the White Paper shortly to be published. He states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have to deal with the roots of offending". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para79"></a>One of those roots which he identifies is lack of appropriate parenting.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para80"></a>Nursery education for three and four year-olds will help but there is also an urgent need for more education, preparation and support for parents. Three essentials are: first, that all children (boys and girls, girls and boys) should be taught in school about the physical and emotional needs of young children and about the responsibilities of parenthood. They should have the opportunity to explore their own attitudes and expectations about becoming parents. "Parenting should always be a commitment not an accident".
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para81"></a>Secondly, education for parenthood should be available during the period between school and parenthood. Thirdly, there should be support for young inexperienced parents in the form of home visiting, family centres, mutual support groups and specialist services where necessary. As Jack Straw said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Some parents are desperate for help, others desperately need it".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para82"></a>The cost of those services would be minimal compared with the gigantic costs of youth crime. Again, Jack Straw said:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Good parenting is an investment in the future which society cannot afford to ignore". <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para83"></a>I now wish to turn briefly to the question of values. "A child's values are formed by the values of those around it as it grows up". For young offenders, I submit that crime is usually not a moral issue. Why should it be? They have grown up in a society which claims to believe in moral relativity. I have heard noble Lords in this House declare that we do not have to be guided by "outdated moral values". Of course, we must not be guided by outdated values, but we do not want to throw away the baby with the bath water. If moral relativity is all right for the rich, it is scarcely surprising that those who are less well off think it is all right for them too, provided they can get away with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para84"></a>Dr. Nicholas Tate of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, after very wide consultation, is working out for schools a matrix of shared values--values which are accepted by the majority of people in this country in all walks of life and which are essential for the survival of civilisation as we know it. When those shared values are finally published, I hope that we shall all forget moral relativity and focus on teaching our children--as a minimum--this set of shared values.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para85"></a>And let us not forget that the best way to teach children is by example.

<P>
<A NAME="70702-06_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the number of your Lordships speaking in the debate today helps to illustrate the concern felt throughout the country about youth crime. The other night I was talking to a magistrate from Keighley in Yorkshire who told me that people were desperate to find satisfactory solutions to cope with young people who came before the courts and were deeply addicted to drugs and involved with drug abuse. She told me that the services in Bradford were fragmented and not really geared to children. Her pleas for more action and preventive initiatives were urgent. Heroin is at a very low cost and that fact is worrying. Addicts are not injecting at the moment, which is good as regards HIV, but there is little deterrent. Such people are chasing the dragon.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para86"></a>On Monday night I watched the television programme "Panorama" on BBC1. If the Minister did not watch it, I ask him to do so on video. The programme was from Blyth in Northumberland where many young people had died after taking methadone mixed with other drugs. The health authority has a community methadone programme, but some of the methadone has been sold on the streets illegally so that other drugs can be bought. That has caused many deaths.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para87"></a>The Government are carrying out many reviews. I ask the Minister whether he will institute a review of drug addiction among young people and children, what the services are and whether methadone is safe. I feel that the mothers of the dead boys and girls would welcome such an investigation. The problem of drug abuse has become so huge that it needs everyone to come together with a network of prevention and care throughout the country, with not so much fragmentation. Drug abuse contributes considerably to youth crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para88"></a>Early experimentation with drugs and alcohol is more likely to lead to addiction and other health problems than if it is postponed until the late teens. Prevention of <P>


<a name="column_234"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 234</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>addiction must surely be the aim of any society which values its young people. As I said years ago and repeat today, I feel that life skills and health education should be part of the core curriculum for all children in all schools. What is the point of education if they are going to kill themselves and others?
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para89"></a>With my involvement with young offenders, and as a member of a board of visitors for many years, I have seen some very worthwhile initiatives. Some time ago, I helped with some holiday camps for very severely disabled patients from a hospital, using people from a young offenders' institution who volunteered. They camped in the Lake District and looked after the patients, feeding them, washing them and taking care of all their needs. They responded to the responsibility and challenge. They took them on boat trips, to the circus and even to the pubs. At one camp, a boy absconded on the last day of the camp. When he returned he was asked why he had not gone before. He said: "I did not want to let my patient down".
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para90"></a>I have seen young people on community service orders taking disabled people on shopping trips in Birmingham. In Liverpool there is a project called Green Bank run by disabled people. Young people on community service orders enjoy working there. They feel that they are helping, which they are. We need our young people to understand that they are needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para91"></a>Those projects work when there is correct assessment, experienced leadership and supervision. But for many young people who have turned to crime for many different reasons, working with disabled people can make some of them realise that there are other people with more problems than they have. They can build relationships and help each other to learn to respect each other as people.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para92"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for this debate but I wish to say to him that girls as well as boys need excitement and challenges in their lives. One in three young women aged from 15 to 25 admits committing an offence at some time. I feel that girls have been rather left out of this debate. At the moment I am chairing an inquiry into young girls in prison--a worrying situation. Some are only 15, but some have babies at that age.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para93"></a>There is a great deal to do. I hope that the Government, with great vigour, will tackle this problem with the many voluntary organisations.

<A NAME="70702-06_spnew12"></A><B> Viscount Brentford: </B>   My Lords, I certainly agree totally with what the noble Baroness has just said. It makes a great contribution to our debate. I should like to thank my noble friend Lord Elton for his most able and skilful introduction of this subject. I also congratulate the two maiden speakers. The real life experiences, so different in different ways, which both of them introduced also made a great contribution to our debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para94"></a>We are talking today about both the prevention of crime and the prevention of re-offending by young people. My noble friend Lord Elton pinpointed the <P>


<a name="column_235"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 235</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>difference between them. At the risk of re-emphasising what has been said, I must agree that this is a very important subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para95"></a>Generally, up to 90 per cent. of young people re-offend after they have been in prison. One noble Lord told us that there was an 88 per cent. rate of re-offending in, I believe he said, Gloucestershire. The amount and cost of youth crime are appalling. Figures have already been given to your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para96"></a>I am glad that there is to be a government review of the youth justice system and procedures. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in response to the call from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, for a reinvestigation of the effects of punishment, particularly as it relates to young offenders.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para97"></a>I should like to make a few comments on the factors which tend to turn young people to criminal activity. Many of them have already been mentioned. Let me first mention one which I have not heard before and that is the evil tendency of the human heart, because of the world in which we live. I believe that only God can change that. Those of us who call ourselves Christians have a responsibility emanating from the Church to help to change people's hearts and therefore their attitudes. I do not lay that as a burden on the Government for them to take up. It is for those of us who call ourselves Christians to bring about a change of attitude in human beings.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para98"></a>I turn to the importance of the family, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Lichfield, presumably exercising his prophetic gift, earlier in his speech foretold that I would do. I believe that the breakdown of the family is a major cause of young people getting into a chain of action which ends in crime, probably with homelessness and unemployment playing their part along the way. I hope that the present Government will continue to support marriage and the family, as did the previous government. I believe, as has already been said quite rightly by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that the cost of supporting positive institutions such as the family and preventing youth crime represents a very cheap way into achieving the aims that we all have. Many noble Lords have spoken about that and I shall not say any more on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para99"></a>I now refer to a subject which has already been touched on; namely, education and employment, both of which are very high on the Government's agenda. There is a necessity for moral teaching, again as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and a need for positive values, which I believe will play an important part in preventing youth crime. It is valuable to improve education, as the Government intend to do and as the previous government intended also. Education needs to continue to improve. It gives hope for employment. The whole range of those who are excluded from school or out of school and need occupation to keep them from crime has also been touched on.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para100"></a>Drugs are another problem that we need to face. Drug misuse is responsible for a significant minority of crime, as the noble Baroness rightly pointed out. About a fortnight ago, one of my friends was mugged on her <P>


<a name="column_236"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 236</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>way home by a young man wielding a knife. The police advised her that it was almost certainly a drug related crime. Drug treatment can be available at one-third the cost of imprisonment. Does the Minister have plans to extend drug treatment and also to encourage motivation in the young to receive it?
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para101"></a>I believe that violence shown in films and videos is also a cause of crime. Many good measures to prevent it have been mentioned, in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, who spoke about the YMCA. The Children's Society provides foster placements for teenagers who might otherwise face custody in an adult prison and helps to divert them from future offending. All those initiatives need encouragement. Judge Tumim asked for positive programmes to encourage prisoners to face up to offending. Efforts to build self-esteem and to rebuild interpersonal relationships are matters which have already been touched on. All those efforts will help to prevent youth crime.

He will probably not be surprised to hear me pursue a line of thought, already referred to briefly by the noble Earl, Lord Kitchener, which I have put forward on previous occasions and which a growing body of evidence persuades me should be kept in front of the public eye. It does not, of course, provide "the" answer to juvenile delinquency. What does, my Lords? But it does offer a route that deserves more exploration.

<A NAME = "70702-06_para102"></a>On Saturday I found myself behind a family at the counter of the village shop. The young boy pointed hopefully at the rack of chocolates and sweets, but the rough looking father said, "If you have that, you'll be on a high for a month. You're allergic to half the stuff there". And I remembered the headline that I had seen in one of the tabloids in your Lordships' Library just the other day:

Why should other things which we take by mouth not also have some effect on our mental as well as physical behaviour? Given that we are all biochemically individual and that many features of the modern western diet are recognised as unhealthy, is it surprising that a sub-set of the population react violently to what they eat?
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para105"></a>I have spoken before about the young man who was arrested not long ago, having for the fourteenth time taken and driven away a lorry between the hours of 10.30 p.m. and 3 a.m. His extraordinary pattern of eating came before the court. He had no food before teatime, absolutely no vegetables, and about 100 teaspoons of sugar a day. Given a probation order and a change of diet by the enterprising local probation service, his <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>behaviour altered beyond all recognition and he did not re-offend. The extra cost of that young man's treatment was &#163;4 a week.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para106"></a>In 1985, the Lancet reported a study from the Great Ormond Street Hospital which linked hyperactivity with children's diets. More recently, a group of juvenile offenders in Yorkshire were investigated in London for food intolerances. Having smashed up their minibus on the way, and the laboratory when they got there, all nine of them became reasonably docile on an altered diet with food supplements. They had caused damage amounting to over &#163;100,000; their investigation and treatment came to less than &#163;2,000.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para107"></a>Much of the evidence centres on junk diets and certain additives, which are particularly harmful at a period of peak growth, which, incidentally, equates with the age of peak offending. In formally conducted trials, a 45 per cent. reduction in anti-social behaviour was recorded among prisoners in Alabama who switched to a wholefood diet. A similar result in Los Angeles led to a city-wide ban on highly processed foods in juvenile institutions. More recent and rigorous research has confirmed those findings, although some institutions have found it hard to maintain the improvements--not because they tail off with time, but because of pressure from the food industry and unsympathetic professionals.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para108"></a>At a conference on this subject at the Royal Society of Medicine, which I attended last October as President of the Allergy Research Foundation, I was struck by two findings. Two-thirds of the major criminals in Britain and the USA appear to meet the criteria for hyperactivity in childhood, with all the implications for possible links with nutrition. And the cost to society--we have already heard about this--of a lifetime's delinquency is about &#163;1 million.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para109"></a>Much of this is not new to the Home Office. It does raise the age-old question, however, why what is common knowledge to many families, and people in village shops, takes quite so long to filter through to the so-called experts. I believe we are now past the point where we can plead scarcity of evidence or poorly conducted studies. Resistance to new ideas plays a part, undoubtedly fuelled by a certain alarm at the implications on the part of the food industry, the criminal justice system, and the medical profession. There is also a conceptual difficulty among many criminologists in accepting that a psycho-social problem need not always have psycho-social causes.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para110"></a>Put at its lowest, there is a potentially valuable hypothesis here to be tested. Perhaps I may ask the Minister, when he comes to reply, to answer two questions. While grateful to his department for having made some limited funding available on this front, I should like to know whether he has plans to fund further projects. Secondly, does he subscribe to the view which I understand holds sway within the Home Office that it is unethical, as part of a trial, to offer young offenders a diet which conforms to the best possible current guidelines for healthy eating, and which might conceivably even lead them to stop offending? In bureaucratic correctness, that seems to me the very height of absurdity.

<A NAME = "70702-06_para111"></a>I hope his answers will be favourable, since we have here a real chance (as I say, for a sub-set of the population) to get at some of the causes of disorder in a section of society, in a singularly cost-effective way. It could also provide a better platform for the success of the social measures of which other noble Lords have spoken.

<A NAME="70702-06_spnew14"></A><B> The Earl of Longford: </B>   My Lords, listening to the noble Earl, I could not help remembering a story told to me by the grandfather of the present Leader of the Opposition. As a young MP he approached the ancestor of the noble Earl--the Prime Minister--and said that he would like a few minutes to talk to him about co-partnership. Mr. Baldwin, as he then was, said, "My dear boy, I could talk to you about that for hours". When Lord Cranborne looked round Baldwin had vanished. I am afraid that is true of most of us. We could talk about this for hours but we have our six minutes--and I have been warned that I shall be given a warning after five, so I may leave out most of the important things I want to say.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para112"></a>One thing that I must say is how grateful we are to the noble Lord, Lord Elton. He is particularly well qualified to talk about these matters and speaks as a real Christian. I can only assure him that I can pay him a better compliment than any tribute I might think of. I have two guests here today; they are still with us. One is director of the New Horizon Youth Centre, which I myself had the honour of founding around 40 years ago. The other is now running a project for Camden borough which is relevant to this issue. The project is concerned with young people who are potential delinquents. They drop out of school and the project provides an alternative sort of education. They were both much struck by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Elton, and their comments are more valuable than anything I can say.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para113"></a>We have to compress our remarks. Even in these few minutes I must refer yet again to the overwhelming importance of early treatment, as stressed by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, and other speakers. I shall take just two examples of the many I can offer. I can think of one young man who was 15 when he killed a policeman in the course of an armed raid. His accomplice was afterwards hanged but he was too young to be executed. He was dyslexic, though the son of a bank manager and from a good family. When he was in prison he learnt to read and write--that is when I met him--and later he turned into a good citizen. If he had been taken in hand and looked after earlier that terrible murder would never have happened.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para114"></a>Another case which is more up to date--he does not mind me mentioning his name--concerns a young man called Bob Turney. He again was dyslexic. I do not say that all young delinquents are dyslexic but those two happened to be. He got into serious trouble early. He was regarded as stupid and felt that everybody treated him with a certain contempt. He was in prison off and on for 17 years. Today he is a qualified probation officer and has written a book, of which I had the honour to write the introduction.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para115"></a>Those are two examples where early treatment would perhaps have saved a terrible murder or half a life of crime. That is the most important contribution I want to make. I ought to say that I have had the pleasure--I hope it is a pleasure for others as well--of having won a place in the ballot, quite contrary to expectations. I shall therefore be introducing a Motion on probation a fortnight from now.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para116"></a>Another aspect of this matter arose when I was having dinner with a man who had been for 38 years a juvenile magistrate, and for most of that time as chairman. I am afraid he had rather a depressing message. He said that without substantially increasing funds, nothing much will happen. There it is. People who have been in the game all that time believe that we must put more resources into dealing with the problem. It cannot be solved on the cheap. I do not know what has been said in the Budget, but we cannot solve the problem on the cheap. I leave the matter there.

<P>
<A NAME="70702-06_spnew15"></A><B> The Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair: </B>   My Lords, the question of juvenile crime was debated in this House some four years ago. In that debate I emphasised that prevention was far cheaper than cure, and the noble Lord, Lord Elton, made that a key point in his opening speech. It is something we all think and others have said--"Catch 'em young".
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para117"></a>In the previous debate I spoke about Schools Outreach, which the noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, mentioned. I should like to say a little more about it. The charity is based in Birmingham. It makes a careful selection of young men and women and gives them rigorous training to act as what the Department of Education somewhat clumsily called, "the part of non-official adult friends of difficult schoolchildren with potential criminal tendencies".
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para118"></a>I am chairman of the steering committee that has dealt with the Schools Outreach workers in Slough for nearly 10 years. I have come to know the girls who work for the charity, and more dedicated and highly trained people one cannot imagine. They get to know the children and the children know that the outreach worker is not employed by the local authority or the school. They are offering an open door to children who may feel isolated.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para119"></a>The first thing the outreach worker aims to do is to improve the child's understanding of his or her feelings and relationships. I was given an example by one of the workers. A girl was being difficult at school and the outreach worker asked what was the matter. The girl said, "I go home and I suppose I am rather disruptive and my parents send me to bed without supper". "What do they do?", said the outreach worker, "Do they work?". "Yes, they go out to work", said the girl. The outreach worker said, "In that case, when they come home from work surely they want to relax and have a happy, pleasant time, perhaps with you". The girl thought about that. She went back and the next morning was all smiles. She said, "It worked". That seemed to <P>


<a name="column_240"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 240</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be such a simple explanation but it was achieved by the worker's insight into the child's unconscious need to find a solution.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para120"></a>The ethos of the outreach worker is brilliant and simple. The worker starts on a one-to-one basis and then gets a group together in co-operative friendship. They not only befriend the members of the group but the parents as well. The parents in their turn readily appreciate that here is no official visitor but someone bringing friendship and understanding from a private source. Outreach workers are trained to inspire positive attitudes in the whole family. As the noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, said, the number of exclusions in those Slough schools has fallen dramatically and the turnover of staff has fallen too. That is all due to two attractive young girls who have sorted out so many of the troublemakers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para121"></a>Schools Outreach is a charity like Crime Concern but, unfortunately, it does not have any great national fame. Furthermore, it cannot publish figures of how effective it has been because one cannot quantify crime that has not taken place.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para122"></a>We all know that the problem of young criminals is appalling. No one knows what to do. I make the analogy that if a man has an eruption of boils, like the prophet Job, the modern doctor does not treat each boil individually; he goes to the analytical chemist or whatever it might be to find out the root cause of the problem. That is what we have to do. By "we", I mean the whole of society.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para123"></a>I hope that all good people committed to the call of the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for attention to be given to the importance of youth crime prevention initiatives will take the initiative and combine to co-ordinate their work. Then we would go a long way to finding the solution to this wretched and so far unsolved social problem.

<A NAME="70702-06_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, in a debate like this there are certain duties to be performed. The first is to congratulate the maiden speakers. Both were very informed. To someone like myself who did not do very much before I came here in the way of public speaking, it seems a little of an affront to congratulate them but I nevertheless do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para124"></a>The debate is rather depressing in the fact that we have gone through some repetition. The noble Lord, Lord Elton, tangled with this problem directly and with information. The vast majority of noble Lords who have spoken subsequently have followed him. Youth crime has two causes: feelings of hopelessness and boredom. It predominantly affects the male. As the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, said, female crime is rising but, after the age of 14 or 15, female offenders tend to go into prostitution or become mothers. The only point one can make about that is that the two states are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, the number of young mothers who find themselves turning to prostitution to support their children is depressingly high.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para125"></a>Part of the problem of youth crime is that many youths feel that it does not matter what they do because they will not be caught. The reason they feel that is that <P>


<a name="column_241"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 241</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they cannot see an alternative. The average middle class child knows that if he goes to school, works hard, keeps his nose reasonably clean, does not offend anyone too much and follows the educational pattern, a pot of gold, or at least a cash dispenser card with something behind it, is at the end of it all. It is the process of education, with parental backing, on to employment and some form of financial reward. That carrot is dangled in front of huge parts of our society at various levels.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para126"></a>However, if you turn round to someone from an inner-city area who has no tradition in his family of education, no tradition of anything other than unskilled work within that family in a society which is rapidly shedding its unskilled workforce, who suddenly finds himself confronted by a consumer society in which one is expected to have considerable spending power, how can you wonder why such a person looks to crime? He has no great incentive to keep his nose clean. If he is lucky there is a life watching television as opposed to the option of going out at night. At the junior level, as some noble Lords have said, if you go out, crime is exciting. In a recent television programme I heard the police say that joyriders would drive up to the police station, rev up the engine, shout out the window and wait to be chased, because that was exciting. If you do not address this major problem of such people having no reason to acquiesce with regard to what society wants from them, they will never do so, and you will fill your prisons over and over again.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para127"></a>It has already been said that no matter how much effort one puts into catching criminals one will always have crime. I have in mind low level crime such as burglary. I say "low level", but I remember that when my own flat was broken into I could quite happily have killed the person who did it. But it is very difficult to catch the people who carry out that activity. Indeed, with the best will in the world, if they are on a spree, the police, even if they know exactly who they are, may take time to apprehend them. After a week or so they may be several offences on. It is very difficult to stop that. Furthermore, because of the legal process it takes time for young offenders to reach the level of severity where they are locked up. That will not change no matter how good the new fast-track approach is. There will still be a problem of backlog. You will always have this idea that they will be able to get away with it for a period of time.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para128"></a>If you take the ideas of boredom and hopelessness and the fact that there is nothing else for them, you are bound to have a level of crime. The problem of bravado also comes into this which often leads to crimes against the person. Such crimes tend to be committed by young men on other young men they know and tend to be assaults, which may be exaggerated by the fact that people are more often carrying offensive weapons in the form of knives. But such crimes have always gone on. We do not even know if in fact the number of such crimes is increasing dramatically as people are reporting them more. The same is true of other types of crime such as the abuse of children. However, we can make an inroad into solving the problem if society is prepared to bite the bullet and try to get people out of the feeling that there is nothing else for them.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para129"></a>One of the main difficulties in this area is that the problem is the responsibility of no one part of government. It is not the problem of the education service exclusively and it is not the problem of the Home Office or the social services exclusively. Every department has a part to play. During my time in opposition I have often gone to the wrong department to extract the right answer for a cause. One realises just how heavy the horizontal structure of government is. Departments do not talk to each other. I hope the Government will be able to give us some assurance that a higher level of communication will take place. What I am saying is not a direct jibe at the previous government. The problem is the way we have structured our government into departments. They are competing bodies for funding and prestige. They will always have trouble in talking to each other and they will do so only when they are forced to. That is a fact and I hope that there is a degree of agreement on it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para130"></a>Unless we are prepared to try to bring all these groups together we will never address the real problem. We must try to make sure that the education and social services departments work together. We should try to encourage people to believe that there is an alternative. If we are not going down the road of massive investment to create lots of jobs for the unskilled--I believe that those days are gone and it may well be that ultimately that created more problems than were solved--we have to try to make people more flexible in their approach to employment by giving them greater skills. They should be helped to become more geographically mobile. We have to reach the young people involved. It will not be easy.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para131"></a>I have worked in young offenders' institutions and tried to train young people in how to go about a job interview. The difficulty in reaching the 16 and 17 year-olds was incredible. They did not need to know because they knew already. They were real, hardened criminals. They were not successful because some of them were at the institutions for the second or third time.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para132"></a>Unless we pursue the educational idea--and I use that term in the broadest possible sense--that there is another way forward, unless the carrot is dangled and, to use the undoubtedly politically incorrect term again, we follow the traditional middle-class route forward, and unless that route is available for everyone and they are shown how that can be done--rhetoric is not enough--we will always have these problems. Ultimately, we have the ability to solve many of them, but whether we have the will is something that all of us must look to.

<A NAME="70702-06_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may start by warmly congratulating and thanking my noble friend Lord Elton, not simply for the debate today but for all the work that he has done. He has worked tirelessly for young people, not just with the Divert Trust, but when he was a Minister and in so many other ways.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para133"></a>I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Parkside, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester for excellent maiden speeches. We look forward to <P>


<a name="column_243"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 243</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hearing from them again. One of the joys of this kind of debate is the degree of consensus on all sides of the House. I certainly welcome that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para134"></a>Perhaps I may repeat a comment which I made in a previous debate and simply put the rising crime rate in context with the period since the end of the Second World War. It is of course true that there has been a rise in crime since 1979, but the rise in crime from the end of the Second World War until 1979 was far greater than the rise from 1979 to the present day. We are now happily on a downward trend and we hope that will continue.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para135"></a>The one thing that can be said with certainty about this subject is that there is no quick fix. Any attempt to lay the blame for the increase in youth crime throughout the post-war years at the door of any government ignores the many and complex factors which have had an impact on the lives of our young people. For example, there is the breakdown in family life resulting in considerable insecurity and too many children growing up without the security of a loving, nurturing home life. There is also the growth of television, video and films where young people are exposed to sex, violence and bad language at too young an age. In addition, there is a street-wiseness beyond their years and a fearlessness which is unnerving.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para136"></a>There were the years of progressive ideas in education when the rule book was discarded in favour of encouraging children to "Do their own thing", as it was called; competition was deemed to be bad; children's work was not marked objectively; and discipline was considered to be overly oppressive. Basics in education were ignored especially in reading, and there was a tendency to be non-judgmental about the behaviour of children, which left many of them very confused. There was a time when political correctness reigned and all too often self-indulgence on the part of those educationists who promoted this nonsense. The children who suffered most were those from the inner cities and more urban areas. Children who came from insecure homes suffered a double jeopardy. Learning at mother's knee was not for many of them and there was no framework within which children could grow and develop. The only anchor in their lives was school.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para137"></a>We live at a time when one in three children are born out of wedlock and too many children do not enjoy the stability of living with the same parents into young adulthood. Therefore, I join with many others who have spoken in this debate in agreeing that the causes of juvenile behaviour are varied and very complex.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para138"></a>However, much has been achieved. Education is more structured now. A national curriculum was introduced almost 10 years ago designed to address academic, physical, spiritual, social, mental and cultural education and with concentration on basic skills. There is assessment and testing to identify strengths and weaknesses in children's learning. There is also regular inspection, not simply to assess the quality of teaching and learning, but also to observe and report on the management and ethos of a school. There are expanding opportunities for routes into educational training. There are GCSEs, national vocational qualifications and <P>


<a name="column_244"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 244</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>general national vocational qualifications. There are vastly expanded further and higher education sectors with record participation. There is greater choice in types of schools in order to provide for a wider range of abilities and aptitudes.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para139"></a>A thriving voluntary sector has been encouraged. The "Make a Difference" initiative involved hundreds of organisations and thousands of volunteers, especially young people, actively making a difference in their own local communities. The impressive work of the Prince's Trust is only one such example.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para140"></a>As a Minister I was privileged to have been responsible for the voluntary sector within my portfolio and saw at first hand so many projects, especially in the field of improving local communities and crime prevention. I fondly remember a project at Applecross on the west coast of Scotland, funded by the Home Office and in co-operation--if I may say so to the noble Lord, Lord Addington--with the Ministry of Defence. One thing I did as a Minister was to talk across all departments in government. I found that there was a willingness in people to discuss across departments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para141"></a>At Applecross young people who had offended or who were at risk of offending, came together with young people of the same age from cadets, the youth service and potential leaders for a rigorous three to five weeks of outward bound activities with a very disciplined programme. When they returned home follow-up programmes were managed by Fairbridge, a voluntary organisation specialising in dealing with difficult young people. All the signs are that it is proving successful. I shall be very interested in the evaluation when it takes place.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para142"></a>There was the introduction of national standards for the Probation Service both to improve the management of the service and the quality and effectiveness of community service. I was also privileged to have been a sponsor Minister for Cleveland and Teesside for over five years. I absolutely agree with everything that my noble friend Lord Gisborough said. During that time the area underwent substantial economic and social regeneration. Again, I saw at first hand a whole community working in partnership with the private, public and voluntary sectors, including the churches and the schools. Everybody in the community was involved. Many of the programmes were designed to increase the involvement of young people and to divert them into healthy, law-abiding lifestyles and away from crime. The approach by many in the community and the work done by the Cleveland police force is exciting and the early signs of that work are promising.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para143"></a>In March this year, following the work of a ministerial group on juveniles, a consultation document was published. The group was established to examine ways of intervening effectively with young children at risk of offending in order to divert them from crime. That report catalogues many measures already in place and the millions of pounds committed across government to crime prevention. Examples include the Safer Cities programme, grants for educational support and training programmes on youth action schemes; the national lottery-funded programmes, support for Crime <P>


<a name="column_245"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Concern, which is an organisation carrying out youth crime surveys, parenting education, working with families, creating youth action groups and support for caution-plus schemes. We also produced a report to address delays in the criminal justice system.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para144"></a>The consultation document makes it clear that the prime responsibility for children and their behaviour must in the first place be that of the parents. I believe that it was right that the courts were given powers to involve parents in their children's court proceedings and in supervising their punishment. Parents can now be required to attend court and to pay their children's fines. They can be bound over to exercise control over their children and to ensure that their children comply with any community sentence. The document contained a new proposal which would extend those powers to include the introduction of a parental control order, but the aim always was to involve the parents in working with the children to find solutions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para145"></a>It is clear from all the evidence that early intervention is the key to prevention. Wrongdoing, disruptive behaviour and disaffection are all better nipped in the bud, preferably by parents. However, I wholly concur with the point so eloquently made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester on the importance of partnerships between parents, schools and many of the local agencies such as the police, the Probation Service, the social services and voluntary organisations. All can work together on crime prevention programmes. The previous government proposed the creation of local child crime teams which would maintain a register of local services and programmes, identify children at risk and refer them to the appropriate schemes for help. The intention was to run pilot schemes and to test and evaluate their effectiveness.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para146"></a>However, when all efforts to prevent offending fail, it is important to deal effectively with those who do offend. As has already been said, a small number of people are responsible for a very large proportion of juvenile crime. Those persistent offenders are at present the greatest challenge. That is why we proposed for the most persistent offenders the establishment of secure training centres to provide highly structured periods of up to two years, to include intensive education and training within a disciplined framework. I should be interested to know from the Minister whether those centres will come into operation and, if not, what the Government's plans are for dealing with the most persistent offenders.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para147"></a>Making allowances for wrongdoing does no service to young offenders. It only exacerbates the work of those seeking effective solutions to preventing crime. In our consultation document, we proposed a strategy which aimed to identify children at risk of offending at an early age and to refer them to programmes designed to help them to steer clear of crime. The strategy was based on research about the effectiveness of early intervention. It was to be delivered by local agencies working together in partnership in new local organisations which the Government envisaged would be known as child crime teams.

<P>
<A NAME="70702-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for initiating this debate. I have listened with very great care to everything that has been said. Without exception, this has been a wholly non-partisan debate and I echo entirely what the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, said a moment ago: in a civilised society this subject ought to be the object of cross-party discussion and agreement. I for one endorse the approach which the noble Baroness set out and am most grateful for it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para148"></a>We have heard two excellent maiden speeches which could be regarded as genuinely maiden speeches and one which was a quasi-maiden speech from my noble friend Lord Graham of Edmonton who was not able to assist your Lordships in the past because of the duties which he so well discharged as Opposition Chief Whip.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para149"></a>Perhaps I may make one small deviation from my speech to say that I noticed that our well respected friend the noble Viscount, Lord Tonypandy, was with us for a moment or two. I am sure that I echo your Lordships' views when I say--I hope that the noble Viscount will read this in Hansard tomorrow--how welcome it was to see him here if only for a short time.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para150"></a>I give the most solemn undertaking that I can that I shall give the most careful consideration to every syllable that has been uttered in this debate. There has not been a wasted sentence and there has been a very gratifying degree of consensus. This is not a party matter. Indeed, it would demean us all if it were and I turn my face resolutely away from trying to make this a party matter. I do not go into the history of crime since the last war because I do not think that that is our purpose this afternoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para151"></a>I echo what has been said that learning the difference between right and wrong when a child is the only fruitful start for a happy and successful life. Today's young offenders are self-evidently likely to be the adult criminals of tomorrow who will block up our prisons and penal systems. Too many young people are not being taught the lessons from which we perhaps all benefited in different times and in different social conditions. Indeed, as the noble Lord, Lord Addington, rightly pointed out, to one extent or another those conditions were privileged. I do not necessarily mean financial privilege; I mean the more important privilege of having a stable home with loving parents in whose hearts and minds was the resolution to set their child on the proper road. Many children these days do not have that; and I endorse entirely what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester said on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para152"></a>We are firmly committed to making young people aware of their personal and social responsibilities. Preventing them embarking on crime is a key part of our strategy, but it is not sufficient on its own. We <P>


<a name="column_247"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 247</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cannot simply concentrate all our efforts on preventing the first offence. Our strategy is twofold: first, we must dissuade young people from committing that first offence, which is capable of being exciting and which is, as has been said, seductive in that it may be the only point of interest in a rather arid life; and, secondly, we must seek to help those who have already offended to confront their behaviour and to change it. It is trite but nevertheless important that we bear in mind what the research shows. Indicators of likely criminal behaviour by young people include low parental supervision, persistent truanting and peer pressure exerted by those who are already criminals.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para153"></a>There was a clear measure of support for the Home Secretary's strategy as it is beginning to be developed and set out. I am grateful for that--but not on any party basis because I repeat that this issue is more important than that. As a number of noble Lords have said, the key areas of family life and school life cannot be overstressed. Too many parents will not accept responsibility for the children that they have brought into this world. We propose parental responsibility orders to ensure that parents face up to their responsibilities. However, what is just as important is that we recognise that many parents need guidance, support and possibly sympathy when they fail or fall down. A new child protection order will ensure that unsupervised young children are kept off the streets and, more importantly, out of trouble late at night.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-06_para154"></a>We are encouraging the work of the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority on values education. I know that these words sound like jargon, but I am happy to echo what the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, said because this is very important. I know that I shall be accused of using jargon and I do not care because I do believe that education in parenting skills is extremely important and should be a significant core of what we are doing. We shall be supporting local projects under the Truancy and Disaffected Pupils component of the Grants for Education Support and Training programme to the tune of &#163;17.5 million in this financial year. If only I were Father Christmas I should be happy and your Lordships would be overjoyed as well as surprised: your Lordships are so eloquent and I am so naive---

<A NAME="70702-07_spnew0"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   No!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>  --that I am tempted to say that &#163;100 million is a mere bagatelle and that &#163;25,000 is nothing. I cannot do that. We must direct our resources in the most productive way possible. We must attend to drug and alcohol abuse. It is a shock to know how prevalent hard drug use is among young people. Such drugs are readily available, and we deceive ourselves when we say that it will not be our child next.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para0"></a>I should like to deal with questions raised by the noble Baroness and the noble Viscount, Lord Brentford, about the "Panorama" programme on methadone. Some of your Lordships will be aware that last year the Department of Health published a report on the review of treatment services. It concluded that methadone <P>


<a name="column_248"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 248</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>programmes had a valuable role in some cases. We intend to set up a drugs tsar, if that is the right word. Doubtless I shall be in trouble tomorrow. This drugs chieftain--I bear in mind what happened to the last tsar, and I shall now be in even greater trouble tomorrow--will have as one of his or her duties an urgent review of our present strategy and will make recommendations. I can assure both the noble Baroness and the noble Viscount that that will include a review of treatment provision, including the provision of methadone.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para1"></a>This man or woman is to lead the fight against drugs and co-ordinate effective treatment programmes. A number of noble Lords, not least my noble friend Lord Graham of Edmonton, urged the necessity for cohesion and co-ordination. I agree entirely. I am happy to be able to state in this context that the Home Secretary will chair a ministerial group to deal with issues of this nature. They cannot be divided into individual departmental responsibilities. Welfare to work has already begun to be co-ordinated. As a matter of record, not speculation, the Chancellor in another place this afternoon announced that his Budget, if brought into law, would allocate &#163;3.5 billion over the life of this Parliament, including &#163;500 million from the reserve, to welfare to work projects. That means that we expect 250,000 young people to have the opportunity for skills training and work.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para2"></a>I firmly believe--it is a belief based on a reasonable practical experience--that what most people want as assistance to a decent life is security, order and the opportunity to work. There is virtually no one in our society who, if given a free and informed choice, would choose not to work. Work, apart from its moral component, gives structure to the day, dignity to the life and the ability that everyone wants to better himself or herself. This is not a party political point. If it takes even half that number to work, I believe that it will be an invaluable benefit to all who live in our country.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para3"></a>The earlier that young people offend, the worse their prospects. Therefore, we want to trigger intervention as early as possible in a potential offending career. I agree entirely with what has been said, not least by the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, who has had so much experience of these matters over many years, that delays in the criminal justice youth system have become a cancer. The system has become much more important than the offence, the offender or victim. There is no doubt that the system is being manipulated so that delay is at the centre of it all. I deliberately mix my metaphors when I state that curiously delay is the dynamo that controls the engine. We are determined that young offenders should be dealt with promptly, efficiently and effectively. It is much better for them, for the victims and for the state of our civil society.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para4"></a>We want partnerships. I am most gratified to have the support of the noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton, and that of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester on the approach that we wish to develop. We intend to place a responsibility on local authorities together with the police to develop statutory partnerships. Those partnerships will have as their declared aim the improvement of community safety and the prevention of crime. Your Lordships have given <P>


<a name="column_249"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 249</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>many examples to which I have listened with great interest. There are many examples of local people coming together and jointly tackling crime and disorder. The noble Lord, Lord Gisborough, provided a number of useful examples. But that is presently insufficient. They are isolated examples. In many areas the foundations to which the noble Lord referred have simply not been laid and it is too hit and miss.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para5"></a>Therefore, we propose to impose this duty on authorities and hope that they recognise it will be to the public benefit. I also hope that they will shoulder the burden willingly--for burden it will be. We want that responsibility to be the co-ordination of a framework that involves all those who have relevant input. That does not involve simply the police or the local authorities but the business community. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Elton. Although I am not aware of his specific example, I am aware of others. My noble friend Lord Judd spoke of voluntary organisations. One has in mind the Churches and other organisations that have been mentioned by noble Lords. Their work and purpose will be required to be complementary, mutually supportive and--this is a fundamental point--wholly focused on local problems. We believe that local initiatives and co-operation are the key to crime prevention and dealing with juvenile crime. Not all areas are the same, as a number of noble Lords have pointed out.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para6"></a>I hope that your Lordships agree that a certain amount of reflective thought has gone into these proposals which will be more fully set out in a White Paper to be published later this year. A crime and disorder Bill is intended to be introduced later this year. The courts will be given new powers, one of which will be a community safety order. That will be made on the application of the police and local authority and it will be addressed to a named individual. Many, many people who suffer from crime are themselves poor and disadvantaged. If one is poor one is more likely to be burgled. If one is poor and burgled it is much worse than if one is wealthy and insured. Although the distress may be the same, the well off can recover if they are insured. If one car is stolen another one may be available. A large section of our fellow citizens live on inner city estates, although we should not overlook rural crime and its problems. We find it difficult to understand or even contemplate the distress and fear that people suffer.  I refer to old people who live on their own and isolated single parents without their own transport and substantial financial resources. That should not be overlooked. Community safety orders will be available to be directed to those by way of prohibition who have put innocent people in distress or fear in what should be the sanctuary and sanctum of their homes.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para7"></a>Those named in the orders will be told what they cannot do and where they must not go. It will be based on the balance of probabilities which is the civil law test, because it will be a civil injunction rather than a criminal penalty. However, if there are breaches of such orders there will be firm penalties. We want consistency in sentencing of young offenders as well as adult offenders. We have promised in the manifesto that we shall invite the Court of Appeal to set down sentencing <P>


<a name="column_250"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 250</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>guidelines beyond the work that it has already done. We propose to extend the powers of the Attorney to appeal unduly lenient sentences.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para8"></a>We fund independent crime prevention organisations. Crime Concern receives &#163;750,000 a year towards its running costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para9"></a>I do not deal specifically, because I do not have the time in my allotted span of 20 minutes, with the many organisations which have given support, both moral and financial, to the sort of initiatives that were spoken of earlier. To deal with the remark of the noble Lord, Lord Elton, that I was somewhat startled when he said that those policies were coming too late, some of the activities which are supported relate to quite a young age. I took his rebuke in the gentle way in which it was put--Kickstart is for seven to 15 year-olds, which is pretty young; Crucial Crew is another one for nine to 11 year-olds; SPLASH activity programmes--entirely the point made by the noble Lord--are intended to keep young people out of trouble in the long school holidays when parents may be away; there is nothing to do; and the temptation to do something by way of taking and driving away or simple burglaries, becomes very, very powerful indeed. We have those schemes.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para10"></a>I have had to say, and I cannot repeat it with any more persuasive apology, because I cannot open my book of postal orders and donate them, that I hope your Lordships will take from me the Government's deeply felt commitment, in conjunction with many others from many other parts of the political spectrum, to attack this problem at its core to see whether we cannot be more successful in the future than all governments have been in the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para11"></a>Questions were asked about diet in prisons. The noble Earl was kind enough to forewarn me of the matter and so I have my reply reasonably composed and ready. There was a study by Dr. Jonathan Brostof from University College Hospital. It had some financial support from the Home Office. It was carried out on a sample of 100 juvenile offenders. It came to the conclusion that bad diet was not connected to delinquency. However, in answer to the noble Earl's second point about the ethical suitability of providing prisoners with different diets, there are two other studies at Aylesbury and Deerbolt young offender institutions. Deerbolt--this takes up the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Kitchener--showed nutritional deficiencies and/or high toxic metal levels in all those who were tested. The Aylesbury study is continuing to look at the question that the noble Earl raised as to whether nutritional supplements are likely to reduce violence and disciplinary incidents in young offender institutions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para12"></a>I can feel the eyes of the former Chief Whip boring into my back, because the one thing I have learned in your Lordships' House is that when the Clock says "19" it really means "20". I hope that I have been able to assure your Lordships of at least the following; first, we are genuinely grateful that your Lordships have had this opportunity to debate the issue--too short in fact if I think back to the time spent on the referendums Bill last night, which might perhaps have been shaved slightly so that we might have had more opportunities <P>


<a name="column_251"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 251</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to discuss these pressing questions. Secondly, we are determined--I believe that we have a good, fair wind of public support from all sections of the community; thirdly, we do not regard it as a party political interest. I repeat, to treat it as such is demeaning, and, ultimately, likely to be wholly non-productive. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Elton, once more. He has laboured a long time in this vineyard as we all know so well.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_time0"></A><H5>6.23 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for that wind up and indeed for all he has said. I often wonder whether it would not be better if Ministers spoke at the beginning of debates and gave their answers first, because one's debate would be so much more relevant. We have the White Paper coming, and we can make good the deficiency then.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para13"></a>I, too, am under constraint of time. At the beginning there were many issues, such as the final warning, which I wanted to raise but which I had to leave out, and we must leave that for a later time. If I were to thank every participant in the debate, as I would wish, and give them 20 seconds each, I would have to take seven minutes, which is longer than many of them have spoken. So I must thank them collectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para14"></a>However, I single out the noble Lord, Lord Evans, and congratulate him on his considerable success, and his emphasis on the need to prevent crime rather than to punish it, to make punishment unnecessary. I congratulate the right reverend Prelate not just on his attention to parenting--something I have supported since the recommendation of my report on discipline in schools in 1984--but on the priority he gives to alternatives to custody.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para15"></a>We have ranged through the dietary with the noble Earls, Lord Kitchener and Lord Baldwin of Bewdley, to the financial. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, about the gap between different departments. In my experience in government, where it lies with one department to apply a cost-saving solution and the savings from that solution lie with a different department, it does not get applied. If the Minister can do anything to get the savings from a reduction in juvenile offending reflected into the Home Office, which would save staggering amounts in the Prison Service, that is something his co-ordinating committee could well do.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para16"></a>I shall not detain your Lordships longer, except to thank the noble Earl, Lord Longford, not just for his kind remarks but for his emphasis on the necessity of early treatment--Kickstart is a good example of that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-07_para17"></a>This is a vast problem. One dimension of it is moral or religious. It depends upon a change of heart in the community, which can start in the schools and the churches. Another part of it is financial. There is, I repeat, a vast sleeping army ready to help the Minister and his government in aims which we all share if they can only be given--"kickstart" is a good word--a small amount of money each to start their little football team, jazz band, painting club, mountaineering expedition, white water rafting, debating society, graffiti-expunging <P>


<a name="column_252"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 252</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>crew, or whatever it may be. That should be done centrally. It is a large amount of money. The money at the moment is being spent far less profitably on punishment than it could on prevention. Leaving that thought in your Lordships' mind, I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.

<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, it is a great privilege for me to introduce this debate and, although I have to admit that I queried whether it was timely to hold a debate on defence issues so soon after the address on the gracious Speech, I trust that its wide scope will ensure that your Lordships can speak on any defence matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para1"></a>Before I go any further, I should like to thank the Minister for his most courteous letter of 19th June setting out the way forward for the recently announced Strategic Defence Review. I am most grateful to him for offering us the invitation to contribute to the review. Perhaps he will accept parts of this debate as a first contribution. However, I have to say at the outset that I am still of the opinion that the review is unnecessary, and I shall return to that again in a moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para2"></a>I welcome the statements about defence in the Labour Party manifesto; by Dr. Clark at his recent address to the Royal United Services Institution; in the statement in the gracious Speech itself; by the Lord Privy Seal in his reply to the gracious Speech; and by the Minister in his letter. The statement commits the Government to a strong defence of the UK by collective defence through NATO; active co-operation with our allies; strong conventional forces; and the maintenance of our nuclear deterrent. However, I have been unable to detect any recent statement in confirmation of the defence of our dependent territories, even though Dr. Clark is on record as saying:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The defence of Britain and her dependent territories will remain our fundamental task". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para3"></a>Perhaps the Minister will confirm that they are still part of our basic defence requirements.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para4"></a>I return to the defence review and why I believe that it is unnecessary. My main objection to yet another review is that in the past few years the Armed Forces have been subjected to far too many studies and reviews, two of which were major reviews resulting in dramatic and radical changes. There has been constant upheaval, with reorganisation of headquarters and garrisons, and the creation of many civilian agencies. New policies have produced new roles, and new commitments have been undertaken. The Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force have all been drastically reduced in numbers. One senior officer told me that his last three jobs, spread over the past six years, have involved him in consistent reorganisation.
<P>


<a name="column_253"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 253</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para5"></a>My Lords, are these new policies and new roles, which have been subjected to such careful and detailed scrutiny, now suddenly quite wrong? What has changed so recently in the world for them to be suddenly out of date? It is hard to believe that these recent reviews, taken in such depth by the Chiefs of Staff, senior civil servants and academics, can have assessed our defence policy and roles incorrectly such a short time ago. I was interested to note that the Lord Privy Seal recently referred to new strategic realities. However, an Answer to a Written Question of mine stated that those strategic realities are the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; aggressive nationalism; international terrorism and the impact of scientific and technological developments. There is nothing new here. I do not wish to make any further comments as the review is now under way; but any review of this nature saps at the morale of the Armed Forces. The Armed Services cannot afford to lose any more personnel and yet only a few days ago a senior officer with a bright future ahead of him decided to leave. The review may turn out to be the straw that broke the camel's back.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para6"></a>Is there any real need to change our defence policy and roles? Currently they are to deter any threats to and to defend the freedom and integrity of the United Kingdom, its dependent territories and our allies, including the provision of military support for the civil authority in countering terrorism. It is also to contribute to the promotion of the United Kingdom's wider security interests, including the protection and enhancement of freedom, democratic institutions and free world trade. In addition to those roles, I understand that it is the policy of the Government for the United Kingdom to retain its seat at the United Nations Security Council; to retain its influence at NATO; and to be a leading member of the Group of Seven, the Commonwealth and the European Union.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para7"></a>We will lose our seat on the Security Council not only if we do not continue to carry out our fair share of United Nations peacekeeping, peace support and peace enforcement operations, but also if we should reduce our commitments to maritime operations with their amphibious capability and very significant carrier borne air power providing endurance and poise in support of UN interests world wide. We will no longer have any influence at NATO if we withdraw the 1st Armoured Division from Germany as that would result in the loss of the Deputy Supreme Commander Allied Powers Europe post and the loss of the Commander of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps appointment, to which there are committed 10 different NATO countries.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para8"></a>I now wish to turn to high intensity operations which are conducted by all arms formations and battle groups. In the future, it is likely that all conflicts will lead to these types of operations and we shall require at immediate notice our own well-trained and highly skilled troops who can undertake these complex operations. It is a relatively simple task to carry out low intensity operations, providing that troops have been properly trained in high intensity warfare. It takes many years to acquire the necessary skills and high standards for this type of combat and without that capability battles will not be won in the future.
<P>


<a name="column_254"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 254</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para9"></a>I now come to the regimental system and why it is still so essential. There is one answer to this: it is the regimental system which provides the will to win in battle; that is why it is needed and will always be needed. It only now really exists in the regiments of the Household Cavalry, the Royal Armoured Corps and the infantry battalions, but here it is essential because these are the troops that get involved in close-quarter fighting. These troops are like the Scots Guards who had the will to destroy the enemy by bayonet.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para10"></a>The regimental system is a close-knit family from which stems loyalty; respect for each other through long years of friendship at regimental duty; and the feeling of never ever letting one another down. It is the individual commitment for the common benefit of the regiment and the possession of immense pride by all members of that very special family. It is those in-built qualities which lead fighting troops to make the ultimate self-sacrifice to ensure success in battle and defeat of the enemy. There is no substitute for victory in war: if you lose, the nation will be destroyed. These fighting troops are the guardians of our nation and must never be taken for granted. It is the regimental system, when times get tough in battle, which ensures the will to win and victory. No one, nor any government, should ever tamper with the regimental system. Whoever does so removes the will to win in battle and imperils the safety of the nation. Will the Minister give the House an assurance that the regimental system will not be changed?
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para11"></a>I move on now to the Army in Germany. It could be asked why we still need to station armoured forces in that country. It shows our purpose, determination and dedication to NATO by living with and closely integrating with our NATO allies. Conversely, any withdrawal of our armoured capability from the heart of NATO would make it easier for the United States of America to withdraw and thus threaten the entire cohesion of NATO, resulting in a weakened and very less effective organisation playing into the hands of our enemies. At the same time, we would lose the influential command appointments which I have already mentioned and, overall, the United Kingdom would have far less influence at NATO.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para12"></a>The 1st Armoured Division can be rapidly deployed or provide brigade level forces for NATO operations, such as Bosnia or world wide operations outside NATO's boundaries, which threaten its interests. Apart from the United States armoured divisions, it should be noted with some care and concern that the 1st Armoured Division is the only division manned by regular troops. It should also be noted and remembered that it is only the American divisions and our own Armoured Division that have any recent armoured warfare experience. When it comes to any operational deployment and facing up to a real enemy, it is invariably the British and the Americans who have to be committed. It would not be in the interests of Britain or NATO to rely solely on the other European armoured units, who have no battle experience and are manned by conscripts.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para13"></a>At this stage I believe that it is timely to mention the tank. It is still, and for future years will be, an essential weapon system on the battlefield conforming to current <P>


<a name="column_255"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 255</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>doctrine with its characteristics of fire power, manoeuvrability and durability. Almost no other battlefield weapon system has this blend of characteristics. The gun of the tank has pin-point accuracy, and the introduction of Challenger 2 next year will give the British Army the most modern and technologically developed tank in the world, and our armoured regiments greater capability than ever before.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para14"></a>On the battlefield the tank is as effective now as it was in convincing an enemy that he is defeated; and, in peace support operations, a tank is reassuring to those keeping the peace, yet deterring to those who would break it. We have reduced our tank fleet over the past few years by 57 per cent. from 699 tanks in 1990 to 304 in 1997. Twenty eight countries in the world possess more than 1,000 tanks each. The most cost-effective way to destroy tanks is by using other tanks. New tanks are still being made by other countries, including Russia, and the former Yugoslavia still has more tanks than we do. Our armoured regimental establishment of 38 tanks is tactically unsound and urgent consideration should be applied to increase the numbers of tanks in each regiment if they are to be more effective. No one should even contemplate or query the effectiveness of that superb weapon system providing the kill factor and battle-winning agent in modern warfare.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para15"></a>I should like to spend the last few minutes of my speech on how our Armed Forces can become more closely integrated into our society, as they have so much to offer with their high standards and principles. There is much ignorance among the general public about the armed services. That point is illustrated by a great number of new Members of Parliament who have little if any knowledge of our service men and women. Very regrettably, there are signs of the nation taking our Armed Forces for granted, which can only be detrimental to the country. I have already cited our soldiers, sailors and airmen as being the guardians of our country. I believe that a greater recognition and understanding should be made by the public.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para16"></a>I am well aware of the great respect and strong feelings that are held by the civilian elements in the Ministry of Defence towards all our service men and women. But there should be a definitive and wide-reaching lead and example made by the Government to show their high esteem and respect for our defence forces. They should publicise more frequently the current activities and roles of the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force and make greater attempts to integrate them more closely with the civilian community whenever possible. Their high standards and principles should be exposed to the general public with a view perhaps to influencing the civilian standards.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para17"></a>In many ways, the Territorial Army and all three reserve forces can help in that respect. Yesterday I was delighted to hear during an All-Party Defence Study Group visit to Catterick Garrison, that with great initiative careful thought has been given about how to integrate the civilian community with day-to-day garrison life. With even more initiative, planning permission has now been obtained for one of the large <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>supermarket chains to build a supermarket store at the centre of the garrison. Permission has been gained also to build a fitness and leisure centre nearby. That is highly commendable and should receive the greatest support from all quarters.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para18"></a>Finally, it is important that no aspects of European legislation are forced on our Armed Forces with the denigrating effect of lowering their high standards and reducing their effectiveness. I expect that those matters will receive attention within the Ministry of Defence. But perhaps the noble Lord who is to reply will comment or write to me on how he envisages the integration of our Armed Forces more closely into our society.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para19"></a>My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Craig of Radley: </B>   My Lords, I very much welcome the initiative of the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, in instigating this debate, which is so timely with the Strategic Defence Review work now being put in hand.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para20"></a>On that, perhaps I may say that I am totally opposed to recent suggestions made that now is the time to review the Royal Air Force's single service status and to split it between the Army and the Royal Navy. That idea is as old as the Royal Air Force itself. It surfaces every so often, usually at the time of a review.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para21"></a>If any of the supporting arguments was logical and compelling, then there might be a plausible case for examining such a proposition. But the Army and the Royal Navy have only limited air arms; they do not have air forces. On that sort of logic, one might as well advocate, because the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy have ground arms in the Royal Air Force Regiment and the Marines, that the Army should be split between the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy. I do not go so far--at least not yet.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para22"></a>Those who advocate the demise of the world's oldest and most famous independent air force do so from the most selective of arguments: for example, that missiles and satellites are now displacing manned aircraft; or that electronics can totally replace, not just enhance, the human element; or even, in a world of multi-communication, that it over-complicates matters dealing with three rather than two services.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para23"></a>But let us give a moment's thought to the contribution of manned Coalition aircraft to the brilliant success of the Gulf War, resulting in the mainland battle being fought and won in a mere 100 hours with minimum casualties against a numerically much larger enemy; or to the impact of the precision manned aircraft attacks in bringing the Serbians in Bosnia to the Dayton negotiating table, which ground forces could not have achieved; or to the peace-enforcing and humanitarian operations which have been mounted by manned aircraft in both theatres and elsewhere in Africa for many months and years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para24"></a>A moment's reflection on such examples surely puts paid to the idea that such diverse operations can all be done with unmanned vehicles. Duncan Sandys had that erroneous idea 40 years ago when he was Defence Secretary. Even today, when stand-off weapons and <P>


<a name="column_257"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 257</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>smart bombs are changing the way that air operations are conducted, the issue is not simply whether a man sits in a cockpit but whether he has the necessary grasp and understanding of the complexities and applications of air power.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para25"></a>Further questions arise. How can we best achieve, in all volunteer services, the commitment and motivation to achieve and sustain such consistent, high quality performances? It can be too readily overlooked by the armchair critics that it is the people involved in the air and on the ground, working as a team, who ensure the excellence we have all come to expect and admire. Air power is the product of that single-minded, professional determination. Does it not matter to those who would destroy the Royal Air Force that division of the air into land and sea regions would be restrictive to the successful operation of air power, which has to encompass both, and in time and space?
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para26"></a>It might be more plausible, should there be a study about the most cost-effective application of air power in that defence review, were it to concentrate on examining what the benefits would be if all the three services' air activity, their training, support and operation were under the overall direction of experts in the application and limits of air power--the Royal Air Force. But, even for this strategic review, that might be a bridge too far. I hope that the Minister will confirm the Government's commitment to a lasting future for all three services.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Trefgarne: </B>   My Lords, I too express my gratitude to my noble friend Lord Vivian for raising this important debate. It is timely for two reasons. First, it provides us with the opportunity to acknowledge the vital role of the Armed Forces, both at home and abroad; and to express our appreciation to those in the Armed Forces for the valuable and sterling work which they do. They continue to deserve our thanks.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para27"></a>This debate is also particular timely because of the Strategic Defence Review announced recently by the Government. I should like to concentrate on two very different matters this evening: one of a somewhat philosophic nature and the other immediate and urgent.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para28"></a>I turn first to the issue which has occupied a good many column inches in the newspaper recently; namely, the importance of air power and the role of the Royal Air Force, to which the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, has just referred. He speaks with a great deal more authority and experience than I do on those matters but I hope that I may add one or two useful points on the same theme.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para29"></a>As the noble and gallant Lord said, some have even questioned the need for a separate air force. But, however clearly foreign policy is defined and however closely defence policy is aligned with it, two major uncertainties will continue to influence defence provision. First, it is impossible to predict in advance the level of intensity and nature of any operation which may arise. Secondly, unless the crisis provokes a full NATO response, we have little idea as to who our military partners may be, whatever the scope or scale of the conflict. Of course we shall often be fighting <P>


<a name="column_258"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 258</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>alongside the United States but not necessarily always. Thus Britain's Armed Forces must be as versatile as possible. We cannot afford to invest in equipment which can be used in only one situation, especially when we cannot be certain that that situation will ever occur. Air power is inherently versatile and the impact of the IT revolution on sensors, navigation, precision delivery and communications has hugely enhanced the traditional characteristics of responsiveness, speed, reach and fire power.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para30"></a>There are three important reasons why air power brings such crucial strength in any joint services operation. First, it can shape an environment for the advantage of friendly forces, exactly as the allied air forces did for the Normandy landings in 1944, and incidentally, as the Luftwaffe singularly failed to do in 1940. Secondly, air power can provide traditional support for forces deployed at various levels of conflict intensity, including air cover, mobility, reconnaissance and fire power, all of which are particularly important when small numbers of friendly ground forces have been deployed. Thirdly, only air power can take independent action against targets far beyond the reach and capacity of surface forces. In recent times, precision munitions have transformed deep penetration operations from the old bludgeon of total war into a rapier which may be brandished, inserted or withdrawn under tight political control, with minimal casualties and collateral damage.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para31"></a>However, we must be careful. We can and do meet sophisticated weaponry at the lowest levels of intensity. Many countries already have small but well equipped air forces capable of inflicting heavy casualties on unprotected ground forces, and so all our Armed Forces must be able to depend upon air superiority.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para32"></a>It is inconceivable that the important tasks to which I have referred could be discharged by a branch of the Army or of the Royal Navy. I yield to no one in my admiration of the Fleet Air Arm and the Army Air Corp, but even taken together they could not remotely begin to fulfil all the vital roles of the Royal Air Force. Therefore, I hope we shall hear no more of these dangerous ideas, which serve only to encourage our potential enemies by casting doubt upon our determination.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para33"></a>I believe that I have a few moments left in which to speak. I wish to touch briefly on a quite different matter which greatly troubles me. I refer to the case of Guardsman Wright and Guardsman Fisher, both of the Scots Guards. Following an incident in Northern Ireland in September 1992, these two men were tried and convicted of the murder of a known IRA terrorist in circumstances which most of us would regard as no such thing. Naturally these are technical matters for legal experts but the sad fact is that the somewhat rough and ready arrangements which represent the legal processes in Northern Ireland have proved ill constituted for cases of this kind.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para34"></a>Wright and Fisher are not the first British soldiers to find themselves in this position. Not so long ago your Lordships expressed some disquiet over the case of Lance Corporal Clegg. I recall from my own experience <P>


<a name="column_259"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 259</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the case of Private Thain. That latter case, in which I was closely involved, ended when Private Thain was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords by the Northern Ireland Appeal Court. I must confess I find it impossible to dispel the suspicion that the interests of justice in these cases have sometimes been deflected by the needs of political expediency.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para35"></a>However, I return to the case of Guardsmen Wright and Fisher. These two soldiers have now served nearly five years--longer than any of the other cases of this kind--and in the view of many, including myself, it is high time that they were released on licence or on parole if more appropriate. I understand that this very day Mr. Justice Girvan has called for this matter to be expedited. I hope I may ask the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, when he replies to the debate to say when he expects the case of these soldiers to be next considered by the appropriate authorities. Further, is he satisfied that proper legal advice and support are available to these men, paid for if necessary from public funds? That was the case with Private Thain and ought to be the case with these two men. I look forward to the Minister's reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lyell: </B>   My Lords, I, too, am extremely grateful to my noble friend Lord Vivian for instituting this debate. Your Lordships have heard from two previous speakers about the regiment of the Scots Guards. Perhaps that is one reason that I speak so early in the batting order today because 40 years ago this week I graduated from being recruit Lyell to Guardsman Lyell with the valuable help of one Coldstream Guardsman, Sergeant Kiwi Clements, who was known to many of your Lordships and many of the staff. Those weeks at the Guards depot taught me to be a soldier before anything else.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para36"></a>My noble friend Lord Vivian mentioned the regimental system again and again. For me this started at the age of three when my father brought a company of Scots Guardsmen to our house in Scotland. They left for North Africa when I was three and sadly many of that company, including my father, did not come back. From 1942 onwards the Scots Guards have been part of my life. It is for that reason that I am particularly privileged to speak in the debate today.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para37"></a>Three weeks ago I was in the North American city of Seattle. Sadly I missed one of the high spots of my year, the Queen's Birthday Parade on Horse Guards Parade, not too far from here. I tuned in to the Komo television news in Seattle. The headlines concerned a bear that had escaped in one suburb and a bobcat that was loose in another. However, 20 seconds were devoted to Queen Elizabeth's birthday. It meant quite a bit to me to see the Colour of the Second Battalion the Scots Guards with a wreath trooped in front of the Queen in June. That may not mean an awful lot to your Lordships, but to members of the Brigade of Guards it does mean something. Why do the Scots Guards have that privilege? Fifteen years before many of those <P>


<a name="column_260"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 260</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>guardsmen were fighting and, let us not forget, winning at Tumbledown, if you can call sustaining eight fatalities and many injuries winning.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para38"></a>Ten days after that parade I attended a regimental dinner. There were many Scots Guards officers at the dinner. I believe that three of them were mentioned this evening by my noble friend Lord Vivian. They were particularly loyal and honest. They wondered about a word that is dear to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall; namely, overstretch. They wondered about their personal future commitment and about the men and women who serve in the British Army. Their qualities are improving year upon year but, for goodness sake, the demands that we, the Government and the country place on them increase year by year by year. At some stage can the Minister give some indication of the actual or estimated gap between tours of duty in Northern Ireland, let alone Bosnia? As the noble Lord will be aware, it is not merely a question of sending a battalion to Northern Ireland or Bosnia. Many of these battalions, certainly in the Brigade of Guards and other infantry regiments, are under-strength. Therefore one adds a company, but many of those companies are under-strength. Therefore one adds a platoon. One unit going to Northern Ireland or Bosnia comprises three separate regiments. Thank goodness for the regimental system, which breeds unbelievable and unique teamwork.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para39"></a>I was lucky to obtain a commission in the Scots Guards as a national serviceman. The soldiers of 1997, and I when I was a recruit guardsman, are totally different from the soldiers of 1957. The soldiers of 1997 are not Zulu or Masai warriors who fight for 20 or 30 years and then retire. They quite rightly need the home life that many of us demand. One battalion that will be familiar to your Lordships has spent three Christmases away from home in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and on an "emergency tour" of Northern Ireland. I hope that the Minister will be able to take a view on this matter, perhaps over five years or even longer. I hope that he will consider the existing demands on these soldiers. I hope that he will reject the siren voices on the peace process in Northern Ireland, and defending freedom in Bosnia, which may lead to a so-called peace dividend.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para40"></a>In this debate, as in every other debate, I remember Kipling's poem. We thank the Mister Atkins. But I add today: I do not know how they do it. The demands are increasing, and those people look to the Minister to adjust them.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bramall: </B>   My Lords, I add my gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, for initiating the debate at this crucial time in the affairs of the Armed Forces--Armed Forces which, I think most of the nation would agree, are a jewel in the national crown. Perhaps I may reiterate to the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, the congratulations and welcome that I offered him in your Lordships' House last month before his introduction. I recalled that for him it was coming home <P>


<a name="column_261"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 261</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to a department in which he had served with distinction 18 years ago at a time when I was Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para41"></a>I agree that the forces now need a longer-term sense of direction in defence planning which will take into account future challenges and opportunities; and I am delighted that the Government have decided to do this from the top downwards and not, as so invariably in the past, from the bottom upwards, with the Treasury firmly in the driving seat from the outset. And I keep my fingers crossed when I recognise this worthy aspiration.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para42"></a>But if the macro-baseline study is to be of any value, it must try to produce definitive views on, first, whether we intend to remain a member of the Security Council--that will make a considerable difference; secondly, whether, in trying to assess our weight on the international stage at which we should be appropriately punching--to use a popular phrase, no more no less--we should as well as other factors take into account the obligations, experience and expertise which this country has proudly acquired in its national and international development; and, lastly, whether any contribution, at whatever size, we decide to make to collective defence, in particular through NATO, and/or in active co-operation with allies, but perhaps particularly with our American friends as so often in the past, should be able to compete if the need arose in terms of command expertise, organisation and equipment in what I might describe as the "first division"; or at least able to compete, better still deter, opponents with first division equipment as occurred in the Gulf. If such war fighting capability is lost, it cannot be easily or quickly replaced as we should have learned from the 1920s and 1930s.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para43"></a>But be that as it may, only when those broad foreign policy issues and the need for the Armed Forces to support our foreign policy have been thoroughly examined, and where possible resolved, will it be possible to assess the force levels likely to be required, and to start matching those to the resources likely to be available. And when the moment comes to move from the framework baseline study to that second, more detailed stage, I hope that the noble Lord the Minister and his colleagues will not forget how much the established defence programme which the Government have inherited has been underfunded for the past four to five years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para44"></a>It was not primarily the structure and organisation arrived at under Options for Change and the Defence Costs Study which were to blame (although I suggest that the Army manpower ceiling was, under Treasury pressure, set 4,000 to 5,000 too low), but the continuing cost cutting and cash flow squeezes which went on concurrently between and in the aftermath of those exercises, and are still going on at this moment, which have made it impossible to implement the force levels agreed upon in an effective way. As some noble Lords have said, the result has been under-recruiting and undermanning by at least 5,000, if not a good deal more, and thus gross overstretch, in particular in the Army, which cannot be allowed to continue because of its adverse effect on the other two; and an inability to sustain even modest forces in the field for any length of time.
<P>


<a name="column_262"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 262</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para45"></a>I believe that there is now a consensus that the medical services have been seriously and dangerously affected. Indeed, there are few unit establishments in the Army which, even if fully manned, which they are not, would be viable in any operation worthy of the name without ad hoc reinforcements from other units, all exacerbating that overstretch problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para46"></a>There is a good deal of ground to be made up urgently, whatever the outcome of the review. There may also be some gaps in what otherwise is a good equipment programme--as good as I can remember. Notably there is the absence of any element of anti-missile defence, without which the deployment of troops overseas may under certain circumstances be greatly inhibited.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para47"></a>I am not saying that there are not areas where savings can be made--if decisions are taken at the top--notably in NATO's top heavy command structure, which is wholly inappropriate now that the cold war has ended; and the implementation costs of joint staff training might be looked at again. The review may find some commitments which could be shed. That is the proper course of action; in fact it is the only way to go about these things. But I believe that the errors made in the past in the fields of manning, medical services and sustainability generally may require some extra resources if whatever force levels are decided upon are to be operationally effective and sustainable over a realistic period. It would be nice to have assurance from the Minister that those weaknesses, many of them self-inflicted, are to be corrected as a matter of urgency.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para48"></a>Meanwhile I wish the review well. Finally, I endorse what has been said about air power. I remind noble Lords that the late great and gallant Lord Montgomery of Alamein introduced a tenth principle of war to go with the other nine: in any operation, first win the air battle.

<A NAME="70702-08_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, for this debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para49"></a>In the 1996 defence review we were told that defence spending would be down to 2.7 per cent. of GDP by 1998-99. If the defence review is, as we all fear, code for cuts, should we expect to go down to 1 per cent. by the millennium? If it is a real attempt to match resources to commitments, I welcome it, especially if it is honest and not a triple-hatting exercise. But I have to say that, of the 50 tasks grouped under the three defence roles, which were identical in both the 1993 and 1996 reviews, only one, Hong Kong, appears to be no longer a task (though in a potentially unstable area, the Far East, we shall presumably still be required to help maintain peace and stability, but now without the advantage of a base). Northern Ireland of course will not go away.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para50"></a>I greatly fear that any more cuts will leave us with a hollow shell consisting of 47 defence agencies, massive contractorisation commitments, budget holders with competing for quality awards, glossy management plans, all seeking PFIs, but no men and women to manage, whether front line or not. They will all have gone because they are weary of impossible tour <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>intervals, perpetual turbulence, absence of effective medical back-up for them and their families, overstretch combined with inadequate training time, and a general failure to remember that they are people who joined to serve.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para51"></a>To take only one of many threats to morale and incentives to take early retirement, I quote the Armed Services Pay Review Body in May 1996 which spoke of,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unprecedented low morale in the Defence Medical Services, to the extent that it is difficult to see how the MoD could meet its operational commitments",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para52"></a>and perceived a growing crisis over retention and morale in the services generally.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para53"></a>The last government have left--after many a struggle--reasonably hopeful prospects for equipment; and this Government are reassuringly committed to the Eurofighter and to Trident, and to facing the very real problems over maintenance and spares. I particularly welcome what the Minister said in that regard. The casualties have been morale and people and a growing perception that, as in the case of the Gulf War veterans, the MoD is sometimes, not economic with the truth, but even a stranger to it to the detriment of the interests of those it is there to represent.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para54"></a>I hope therefore that this review will make it the business of Ministers not only to identify the strategic needs of the country and to provide the resources to deliver them, but also to recognise the commitment of the country to its Armed Services, who are weary of seeing the MoD transforming itself into an inferior form of supermarket or a branch of McKinsey's--the notion of performance-related pay is part of that alien ethos; it was not proceeded with, I am glad to say--and seeing defence reviews couched in the language of the market. It is time that the forces were recognised not as an expensive liability but as a most valuable and irreplaceable asset, cheap at the price, without whose loyal and committed professionalism our strategic objectives cannot be achieved.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para55"></a>We must all be concerned to ensure that the country understands--for no one talked about it at the election--that the world is still a dangerous and unstable place, with new dangers such as nuclear proliferation, but with some familiar threats, too, which have not gone away. I shall not, since our recent debate covered that, elaborate on the new threat to NATO from within, except to urge the Government to recognise that Russia's aim, which the Founding Act has advanced, is to emasculate NATO from within. We are all much too anxious to turn NATO into just another political forum. It was founded to deter; and deterrence is still necessary. Russia has succeeded in ensuring that enlargement will be hobbled and it has virtually achieved a veto. It will continue to threaten the Baltic States, and will be contained only for so long as we retain both the power and the will to deter.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para56"></a>It is fashionable to treat Russia as a spent force in military terms. It is true that the Russians have unpaid troops, bribery and discontent; but they also have formidable and effective strategic missile troops, a navy <P>


<a name="column_264"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 264</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with new and sophisticated atomic submarines, and more coming off the stocks, some formidable new military aircraft, including the SU 37 and the prototype of a new assault helicopter. They are also developing a long-range bomber to be in service in 2005. They are co-operating with the Chinese in military technology, and have sold and are selling them SU 27K jet aircraft, which will now be made in China, submarines, anti-aircraft missile systems, Sovreneny class destroyers and naval helicopters. I have spoken before about the near monopoly that Russia enjoys in the sale of aircraft, naval vessels and military hardware to India. It is worth noting that Russia now hopes to sell fighter aircraft to Indonesia, just as it sold MiG 29s to Malaysia.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para57"></a>Perhaps the three most important developments in Russia in the context of our defence review are: first, Russia's arms exports were worth 3.1 billion dollars last year; secondly, the Russians are concentrating on a new and far more selective blueprint of reform designed to produce a compact modern force, concentrating on nuclear weapons, the navy and the missile fleet, and promoting the military-industrial complex (the very thing they were supposed to dismantle) because they expect a strong demand for new high-tech research and development; and thirdly, the new defence Minister, Sergeyev, who commanded the strategic missile force, will drive through this programme, backed by Kokoshin, the experienced deputy Minister, and Baturin, the Defence Council Secretary.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para58"></a>So Russia is far from being a spent force. She must be taken into account while she remains politically volatile, and certainly in the context of arms proliferation.

<A NAME="70702-08_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Allenby of Megiddo: </B>   My Lords, I, too, join with other noble Lords in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, for so ably introducing the debate today.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para59"></a>The importance of the Armed Forces in the United Kingdom has never been, and never will be, in any doubt whatsoever. They have been the backbone of our society for generations and an integral part of our way of life. We have always had a Royal Navy, an Army and, more recently, a Royal Air Force. I shall not join in the argument as to whether we retain the Royal Air Force. Over two world wars and several conflicts since, they have fought and laid down their lives on behalf of this country. They have served and continue to serve this country brilliantly.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para60"></a>If your Lordships read the Defence Estimates of the previous government issued in May last year, you may have noted a paragraph on page 4 under the objectives dealing with personnel. That in essence said that the objective was,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to recruit, train, motivate and retain service personnel and civilian personnel". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para61"></a>It went on to say,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"of the quality and in the numbers needed to deliver the required defence capability". <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para62"></a>All the most sophisticated weapons systems in the world are useless unless the manpower is in the right place at the right time and trained to do the job. For the short time available I should like to concentrate on a few remarks on Army recruiting, training and retention. After all, the Army needs by far the most men--I believe I am right in saying 1,500 last year and a further 1,500 this year, and an overall total for all the services of some 5,000. No doubt the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand there is a big black hole in the recruiting organisation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para63"></a>Recruiting over the past five years has seen constant change. Now I understand there are to be 39 Armed Forces careers offices throughout the country--an excellent move if a proper balance is achieved between the services.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para64"></a>For those elements of our Army which recruit on a territorial basis, there is a need for smaller, satellite recruiting offices, especially in remote areas. I do hope that these will not be swallowed up by the new Armed Forces careers offices. I hope also that the regimental recruiting teams and cadet training teams will not be lost in the interests of making savings.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para65"></a>Another welcome move is the reintroduction of the junior leaders' training establishment at Harrogate, albeit under a different title. That is a welcome move, as those who served in junior units will readily agree what a wonderful asset they were.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para66"></a>Sadly, recruiters and trainers seldom agree that the other is doing the job properly. But wastage is high--in the infantry I am told it has now risen to nearly 40 per cent. Sadly, it is caused by many of the problems that face our modern day society: unsuitability of the young to the disciplined way of life of our Armed Forces; lack of physical fitness because of the schools; loss of freedom and creature comforts of the home; and overstretch, about which we have heard a great deal.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para67"></a>I should like to mention one problem briefly; namely, delays in the training system. That is particularly so in the infantry, where it can take up to six months from the start of a man's training to the time he joins his unit. Surely that time could be cut.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para68"></a>Throughout our Armed Forces motivation and morale are generally high, particularly among those serving overseas and those with an active role to play. The service chiefs are clearly robust in relation to manpower problems. There are obviously concerns, and sometimes empty billets have to be accepted due to a lack of manpower.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para69"></a>I have just one question for the noble Lord the Minister. In the event of the current review identifying shortages either at unit or individual level, will the Government take urgent steps to remedy such shortages where fully justified?
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-08_para70"></a>We may not have the largest Armed Forces in the world, but, my goodness, we have the finest--they are well-equipped and well trained, and we are justly proud of them. They are vital to the security of our country and they deserve all the political and financial support that they need.

<P>
<A NAME="70702-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mottistone: </B>   My Lords, I, too, should like to thank my noble friend Lord Vivian for this debate. Under its title, for brevity, I propose to identify the matters that are of special importance for the Government to consider. I start with the importance of all three Armed Forces, especially when threats to peace are uncertain. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, might be interested to know that my father, as a junior Minister in the War Office under Sir Winston Churchill, was one of those who founded the RAF many years ago. Indeed, I believe he was the first president of the Air Board.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para0"></a>My next point is the importance of helping to keep the peace, both to quieten warring factions, as in Bosnia, and to keep open trade routes as the Armilla patrol did in the Persian Gulf. To that must be added the importance of naval forces to support land and land-based air forces where they are involved, as in Bosnia, or to conduct an operation like that of the Armilla patrol.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para1"></a>I turn now to the importance, already mentioned by other noble Lords, of constant exercising and training for all Armed Forces, both in order that they are ready for varying degrees of offensive action and to present a convincing deterrence to potential aggressors such as was not achieved before the Falklands campaign in 1982.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para2"></a>As well as the necessity for exercising and training, I add the importance of keeping Armed Forces equipped at a sufficiently up-to-date strength to deter possible aggressors at all times. I now add the importance of being ready to tackle unexpected aggressors as well as likely ones, especially when the world is expected to be largely peaceful. The 19th century has many examples of that. In addition, there is the importance of never forgetting that modern fighting equipment--whether it be ships, submarines, tanks or aeroplanes--can never be produced quickly if allowed to run down in numbers below what a prudent planner sees as necessary for unexpected eventualities. So far as the Navy goes, I believe that we have now reached the rock bottom that should ever be permitted, either in what we have or what we plan to have during the coming years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para3"></a>Finally, there is the importance of never forgetting that the Foreign Office tends to recommend the disposal of dependent territories, even when the inhabitants do not want it, and of never forgetting that the Treasury--and now, I see, chief constables--tends to recommend further defence economies, even when previous governments have just made more economies than many think are wise.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para4"></a>So I hope that when the Minister replies he will be able to reassure us on those points. I hope in particular that he will not be too much led astray, since in his letter he explained how the Foreign Office would be consulted first. There is a great deal to be said for consulting Foreign Office Ministers but not perhaps the Foreign Office itself. Its record as regards the services is, in my opinion, abysmal.

<P>
<A NAME="70702-09_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Effingham: </B>   My Lords, I too thank the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, for introducing this very important subject in your Lordships' Chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para5"></a>These are exciting times for the Royal Navy. The north Atlantic dominated our thinking during the Cold War, but over the last 10 years we have built a versatile and effective force structure to support and, if necessary, fight for British interests around the world. To achieve this we have embraced a demanding period of change, not least in shaping the Royal Navy to contribute to the requirements of joint warfare, under the control of the Permanent Joint Headquarters.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para6"></a>Today's Navy is a force of discrete and highly capable units that are effective when operating on their own, yet able at almost immediate notice to play a significant part in a large multinational task force anywhere in the world. This gives a great deal of flexibility when deciding how to respond to crises that may affect Britain's interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para7"></a>Our role is very much to contribute towards preserving a peaceful environment in which our foreign policy and trade can flourish. To do that, we must be able to deter aggression, which means that we must have and continue to develop forces which can be rapidly adapted to changing circumstances. With a powerful, well equipped navy, consisting of aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines, amphibious forces and the rest of the supporting ships, we have the essential elements in our armoury to contribute to Britain's joint operational capability.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para8"></a>We are always looking for new ways to make the Navy more effective in working with potential allies and other services. Nowhere is that process more apparent than in coastal regions where developing our links into land operations could prove decisive. So we strive to make our platforms ever more compatible with those of the other services, to enhance the overall utility of joint rapid deployment force assets.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para9"></a>The Royal Navy deploys task groups to the Asia Pacific region about every three or four years. The current 1997 deployment called "Ocean Wave", led by the aircraft carrier HMS "Illustrious", set out last January and will return next month. The group is made up of some 20 Royal Navy warships, submarines and support vessels, together with Royal Marines and elements from the Naval Air Squadron.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para10"></a>The aims of the deployment are: to demonstrate the United Kingdom's continuing commitment to the region; to test the Royal Navy's ability to deploy an operationally effective and self-sustaining force out of area for a prolonged period; to underline our continuing interest in promoting regional peace, stability and freedom of international trade; and to support co-operation and joint working between military forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para11"></a>"Ocean Wave" has been a great success, with particularly warm endorsement of the Royal Navy's presence from our diplomatic missions and British firms. An example was the assessment, after the task group's visit to the Philippines, that it was an <P>


<a name="column_268"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 268</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>outstanding demonstration of Britain's commitment to Asia, underlining the importance of the Armed Forces in underpinning our foreign policy interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para12"></a>We must ensure that Britain has the forces necessary to protect itself and its considerable investments abroad. We have responsibilities for the defence of our dependent territories and the protection of British citizens abroad. As a leading member of the world community, we have responsibilities to act together with partners, allies and friends, to ensure world stability and deal with the consequences of instability.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para13"></a>Thus in the future our forces may be called upon to perform a wide range of tasks that extend beyond the threat of super power confrontation. The inherent flexibility of the Royal Navy has enabled a relatively smooth transition from the Cold War to the emerging challenges to the interests of this country and world peace.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para14"></a>The Royal Navy possesses qualities that include mobility, flexibility, reach, versatility, endurance, lift and autonomy. In practice, those qualities mean that the Royal Navy can mount and sustain operations in any of the oceans of the world. Ships do not require permission to use the high seas. Task groups can be formed that match the requirement of the operation and they can carry or protect the strategic sea-lift that is vital to mount a largescale land operation. These groups can also provide their own defensive capability to be autonomous units, free of the requirement for host nation support.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para15"></a>In conclusion, I believe that maritime forces are thus inherently "joint"; that is, able to operate in the three environments of land, sea or air, and capable of mounting significant operations. When combined with the capabilities of the Army and the Royal Air Force, they form a vital element of our defence capability to meet the varied challenges that we face around the world.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, one of our great military successes has been our use of armour. I was therefore alarmed to hear rumours circulating at high levels in armoured regiments that the Government, maybe encouraged by the academic lobby, is attracted by the concept of role specialisation with Britain providing a "gendarmerie army" for peace-keeping operations while allies defend our high intensity interests. The fear is that we will give up our heavy armour component of the Rapid Reaction Corp and invest in mechanised infantry and helicopters. High intensity combat is expensive, so the biggest savings are to be found here.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para16"></a>But no government can hold its mandate by proposing that Britain eschew such a capability. It would be a dangerous reliance to expect allies to take the lion's share of the fighting on our behalf and meet the heaviest cost burden. The capacity to defend the United Kingdom--whether by force projection in Europe as part of the ARRC or within our own shores and possibly alone--comes from the political commitment which makes defence of the realm the first order of government business.
<P>


<a name="column_269"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 269</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para17"></a>Capabilities flow from commitments. The defence review will consider our commitments and whatever is deemed essential must be funded. Parties engaged in conflict should not deploy force as an instrument of policy at all if they are not capable of anything more than limited operations at the lower end of the spectrum.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para18"></a>High intensity combat on land cannot be fought without tanks, a fact which even the impoverished Russians accept. Tanks have a part to play across the full spectrum of war fighting. Peacekeeping operations in Bosnia only succeeded when tanks were deployed. British armour had a suppressing effect on the conflict, as it denied the enemy the freedom of movement required to keep the initiative, all without exposing British troops to too great a risk.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para19"></a>The proposal to abandon high intensity conflict makes sense only if it is possible to assume that all future conflict in which British land forces become engaged will be limited and of low intensity. There is no indication that that is true, either in Europe or globally, and it ignores the rapidity with which war can change from one condition to another. By giving up tanks we throw away the entire capability of contributing anything but flank and rear-area troops to our allies.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para20"></a>And at what cost, my Lords? We could not hold on to the leadership of the ARRC with such a trivial investment; and with the loss of command, we would lose whatever political influence is gained by having it--at least in the councils of the UN, NATO and the possibly re-born WEU.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para21"></a>It takes years of training to perfect the complex skills of armoured warfare, skills demonstrated in Desert Storm, where 70 per cent. of ground targets were destroyed by armoured forces in just 100 hours. With those skills would disappear the technical and industrial expertise which has culminated in the prize capability of being able to design and manufacture vehicles like Challenger 2 and Warrior. Our ground forces would be barely more than a third world, low-tech force fit only for policing duties--something of which the public would quickly tire. Recruiting would undoubtedly suffer, as would the morale of existing troops.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para22"></a>Our soldiers want to play with the big boys. As my noble friend Lord Vivian said, giving up our tanks would be a dangerous mistake.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_time2"></A><H5>7.33 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedgwood: </B>   My Lords, I join noble Lords in thanking my noble friend Lord Vivian for introducing this debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para23"></a>It has been mentioned time and again that the Army has been overstretched to ridiculous levels and now we understand that recruitment is 5,000 short of the current target. Like the noble Viscount, Lord Allenby, I believe it is urgent that recruitment is given some serious reconsideration and support.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para24"></a>Further, I believe that junior entry programmes should be part of the solution. Those programmes serve a number of purposes. They give young people a tremendous opportunity immediately on leaving school. Those who complete training are usually of a quality which, combined with the benefit of early training, <P>


<a name="column_270"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 270</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>means they are high achievers and an excellent investment. In the past, the ranks of non-commissioned officers have been well served by junior entrants. I do not have the percentages but a show of hands in any sergeants' mess will give conclusive evidence of this. Losing that investment will affect the quality of those important ranks.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para25"></a>In your Lordships' House last week, during the discipline Acts debate, my noble friend Lord Howe referred to the drug problem in the services. Soldiers, sailors and airmen will naturally reflect the society they come from and the nation's drug problems centre around youth. With a junior entry programme, the Army would have the opportunity to train recruits and bring them into military life before the problems start. It is not clear how soon training of juniors will start. Maybe the Minister could help to clarify that point during his speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para26"></a>There is a common misconception that overstretch is caused by an inability to fulfil our commitments. Despite the enormous reductions, our Armed Forces are capable of maintaining our formal commitments as determined by foreign policy, exemplified by Germany, Cyprus and the Falklands. Northern Ireland would fit into that category as well. But what happens when a regiment such as the Royal Scots, the regiment in which I was fortunate to serve, currently based in Colchester and re-training for its new role, is suddenly deployed for extra duties required because of the current concerns about the annual marches in Northern Ireland? Noble Lords will be more than familiar with my point: among many other negative consequences, vital training is disrupted and soldiers are withdrawn from specialised courses designed to educate them to higher levels of skill and ability. With recruitment at its required level, the manning margin, slim though it is, can take care of filling some gaps. But, with no flesh on the bone, regiments are required to borrow soldiers--a scheme known in Scotland as "rent-a-Jock". That, in turn, has its own domino effect, with negative results on all units.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para27"></a>The effects of overstretch come from additional operational demands such as in Northern Ireland, Bosnia or wherever the next bushfire erupts. Without the required intervals between tours, many wives--between 15 per cent. and 20 per cent. in infantry regiments--now decide not to follow their husbands. Their argument is that in modern society--they are a reflection of that society--they have children, jobs and mortgages; and, with the instability caused by overstretch, they might as well stay where they are. Discord and morale problems naturally result.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para28"></a>The Armed Forces Minister in another place, Dr. Reid, recently said about the impending Strategic Defence Review:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are concerned about getting the equation right". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para29"></a>Predicting future operational commitments that relate to defence and foreign policy is a difficult task, but there are vital elements to fit into the Minister's equation. One is definitely the military family.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para30"></a>Owing to successive reviews, young commissioned officers are becoming disillusioned by the lack of stability. As a result of those reviews, they are now concerned about capabilities to perform operational <P>


<a name="column_271"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 271</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tasks. Following Options for Change and the defence costs study, orders were carried out with characteristic responsibility, in the belief that our armed services could be smaller but better. Now, officers are faced with another review. Scepticism that the Government will give in to further Treasury demands is the result.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para31"></a>What can be made of the two current major commitments for our armed services? The situation in Northern Ireland does not warrant much hope for even limited withdrawal in the near future. The consequences of further withdrawal from Germany was well covered by my noble friend Lord Vivian. I would add only that without Germany our training facilities are not sufficient for certain vital "live firing" practices.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para32"></a>Given those commitments, the current numbers and the ability to carry out operational demands becoming increasingly limited, officers have reason to be concerned about their careers. With the review months away from completion, the Government need to provide assurance of their intent. Confirmation of signed contracts, such as for Apache and EH101, would go a long way to relieving concerns about future support. Without those kinds of assurances we are likely to lose our best young officers. Without them we cannot expect our future military leaders to be of the high calibre that we demand and have today. Any strategic defence review would reflect the needs of the nation. I believe that the people of this country value our armed services and expect them to be equipped, trained and, therefore, capable of carrying out "armed" operational commitments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para33"></a>The Armed Forces Minister in another place has stated that the review is:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"not a cost cutting exercise"; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para34"></a>and,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we will not be rushing to judgment". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para35"></a>For that, he can be applauded. But our military forces deserve the immediate support of the Government. I urge the Government to show determination in creating a more stable framework from which our armed services can operate effectively and to remove the notion that the Army, the Navy and the Air Force are an industry in decline.

<A NAME="70702-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, I must declare an interest in view of my work with the independent international security think tank--Safer World--and with other related organisations. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, whom I greatly respect, I believe the foreign policy led defence review is long overdue. The repeated piecemeal Treasury-led cuts under the previous government have seriously damaged service morale and left the services uncertain about their role and ability to sustain in depth the range of responsibilities still currently or potentially evidently expected of them. Overstretched is a reality. We, the politicians, can no longer dodge our responsibility for that and for the dangers it represents for our men and women in uniform.
<P>


<a name="column_272"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para36"></a>The relative predictability of Cold War days has been replaced by the unpredictability and volatile conflict across the world. Genocide is back in business. More than 90 per cent. of war-related casualties in current conflicts are civilian as compared with some 50 per cent. in the Second World War. Conflict is more often within states than between them. Some will ask what concern of ours are far off conflicts of that sort. Michael Portillo answered that question well as Secretary of State for Defence last autumn when speaking of the Great Lakes. He said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Because we are a civilised nation. We can see that people are about to die in their thousands and we are one of the few nations on earth that has the military capability to help at least some of them. We recognise our humanitarian obligations". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para37"></a>He continued,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We take pride in our permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council, but it carries with it clear duties". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para38"></a>As the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, properly and bluntly reminded us today, we have to be clear whether or not we want to be a world power. If we do, we have to measure up to that role. If we aspire to be a world power and accept the responsibility that that entails, of course we have to examine what international security requires of us in co-operation with others. The Armed Services remain a significant part of the response. But the need is for far more. It encompasses justice in global economic management and trade; fair access to the natural and mineral resources of the world, not least water and land; it includes population policy and the well-being of threatened ethnic groupings. And on top of that, acute environmental pressures have to be addressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para39"></a>It is in the midst of those challenges that the opportunistic ethnic entrepreneurs and religious extremists ply their evil trade. We must forestall them and that is one good illustration of why an integrated approach to overseas policy, including defence, is so important. Debt and insensitive structural adjustment policies, the downward spiral in world commodity prices and pressure on land have all been central to the origins of the crises in the Great Lakes region of Africa.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para40"></a>Economic and social policy, pre-emptive diplomacy, conflict resolution, peacemaking, peacekeeping, arms control, disarmament and firm accountability of the arms trade are all essential elements in security policy. Never again should our service personnel be faced with weapons supplied by irresponsible traders based here in Britain itself. Profits must never be allowed to take precedence over responsibility in the arms trade, which has too often fuelled the instability which in the end, directly or indirectly, involves us all.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para41"></a>That brings us to other major issues which the review will have to address. Among them are migration and terrorism; the relationship between NATO and the need for growing co-operation with Russia if nationalism there is not to be provoked; the relationship between NATO, the Western European Union and the European Union; the danger of proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and the future of our own nuclear deterrent within the context of the non-proliferation treaty. In that respect we look to my <P>


<a name="column_273"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 273</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble friend the Minister for specific assurance that we will not provocatively increase our nuclear arsenal as we deploy Trident.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para42"></a>Cynics already suggest that the review is just a cover for yet another Treasury-led cost-cutting exercise. To confound them the Government will have to ensure maximum consultation and involvement in the review; maximum dissemination of its findings and maximum debate before implementation. Understanding and ownership will be vital. The objective must surely be to achieve cross-party consensus and provide at last a convincing framework within which the services and the defence industries can plan confidently for the long-term future.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para43"></a>Before I conclude, there is one pressing matter on which it is important to have the Government's immediate reassurance. Last year the Office for Public Management produced a report which raised deep anxieties about the extent of racial prejudice, intolerance and harassment within the services. Such attitudes and behaviour in the services are clearly unacceptable. Indeed, there is a painful paradox when our services have an enviably outstanding record for peacekeeping across the world in the midst of ethnic tension. We should be able to hold our heads high as world leaders--one of only five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council--confident that our Armed Services in which we take so much pride epitomise the enlightenment, understanding and tolerance we advocate for the world as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para44"></a>We know that senior officers in all three services and many others at all levels are determined to root out all traces of racism. They deserve our full-hearted goodwill. Britain has become a multi-cultural, multi-racial society. We should be proud of that. We should strive to be a model of success to the world and the services should be in the vanguard of demonstrating that. I hope my noble friend the Minister will give us a categoric assurance that the Government will give unqualified support to the leadership and the others in the services who are determined to put right that sad blemish on our otherwise exemplary record.

<A NAME="70702-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Ironside: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, for wording the Motion in the way that he has, for we heard little about defence in the election campaign and have heard very little since. That point was mentioned by my noble friend Lady Park. Yet the health of the nation in defence is just as important as the health of the individual, education or social security about which we have heard so much.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para45"></a>The strategy review, which for so long the Labour Party has seen as one of the aces in its pack, may be the Government's way of addressing defence, but I wonder whether it will lead to better decision making and outcomes bearing in mind that the dialogue between the MoD and opinion formers in defence circles and elsewhere is extremely good already. I believe that we have reached the point where the management of defence is strong, where contractors perform well and where the accuracy and penetrating prowess of weapons <P>


<a name="column_274"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 274</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is as strong a deterrent as the weapons themselves. The stand-off feature now required has brought that about, so Tomahawk will be a powerful addition to the Royal Navy's "golfbag" of weapons.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para46"></a>The impact of competition policy and throwing the responsibility of meeting performance onto contractors now means that the defence industrial and commercial base is closer to being reckoned as part of the capability of the Armed Forces because so many services are now supplied in addition to hardware. Contracting out is now the norm rather than the exception and any attempts at contracting in again will be absurd. The fact that industry is now so involved in defence business adds to its ability to provide support in emergencies and the "surge" capability is there.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para47"></a>The loss of in-house capability to industry is again of frontline capability to our Armed Forces and fears of losing too much support capability to industry are overdone. Competition policy has driven costs down. Quality assurance has driven performance up and devolving risk onto the contractor has driven reliability up. We are at last obtaining far better value for money.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para48"></a>The importance of our Armed Forces is judged by how they perform their defence roles. But that depends as much on our investments in long-term projects as on the next type of frigate, fighter or main battle tank. I should like to draw attention to the importance of two of those. The first is the long-term investment in modernising the married quarters estate through the sale and leaseback deal, which breaks new ground in defence procurement, but through transactions which are well recognised in business circles. It is interesting to note that the Australian Government now have five years' experience of getting defence housing into shape and have sold the leasehold of their three major airports--Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. So we are not out of line in our approach to solving the problem, and parliamentary scrutiny has, I believe, helped the MoD to secure the best terms and conditions. Ensuring that the up-front money is not dependent on a spiral of pledges from downstream operators involved with property exchange in future years is a lesson we have learnt from the Australian Government. In other words, we have ensured that we get real money up front after the five-year exchange option was dropped by the bidders who won.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para49"></a>Secondly, the construction of the Clyde naval base is a long-term investment which is not just centred on Trident but which is linked to the strengthening of our underwater warfare capability as a whole. The new "Astute" class nuclear submarine will match the performance of new Russian submarines and they will not, I believe, need to be refuelled during their lifetime. That is a very big step forward indeed. Without this long-term investment in nuclear propulsion, deterrent design, supply and upkeep as well as nuclear submarine refit, our blue water capability would be incomplete and we would not have the ability to reach out, to react, to deter and to sustain an operation, however limited, away from our shores. Our rapid reaction forces are now being built around air mobility and amphibiosity. I hope that <P>


<a name="column_275"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>the Government will continue to invest in these long-term capabilities. My Lords, let us keep defence strong.

<P>
<A NAME="70702-09_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   My Lords, the forthcoming defence review will establish strategic objectives for the next decade; foreign policy imperatives will determine defence commitment world-wide. A welcome and sensible approach, my Lords, which will enable the review to reflect Britain's determination to stand up for what is right and just, to reward fair play and penalise miscreants, to carve an international role for the United Kingdom that is neither accessory nor minor but one worthy of our history, our values and convictions, and one which recognises fully the countless sacrifices made by our Armed Forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para50"></a>There is perhaps scope, in this far-reaching debate, to tell of the special relationship which Her Majesty's Armed Forces maintain with a small, English-speaking, democratic Commonwealth country in central America. Belize has entertained British troops in one guise or another since 1948; they evolved from a colonial force into a defence guarantee in 1981--defending independent Belize against a century-old territorial claim by neighbouring Guatemala. Harrier diplomacy, my Lords, dissuaded the more volatile elements in Guatemala from foolhardy military interventions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para51"></a>In 1993, Her Majesty's Government assured the Belize Government that the time was right for the British garrison to be withdrawn. Mr. Archie Hamilton, then Minister for the Armed Forces, said in another place:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the changes announced ... are in response to the greatly improved relations between Belize and Guatemala, and not Options for Change". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para52"></a>His Foreign Office colleague, Jeremy Hanley, insisted that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Guatemala had embraced democracy, found stability and recognised Belize", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para53"></a>and that the decision to withdraw,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"was not for financial reasons". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para54"></a>Indeed, the savings were said to be modest. The former chairman of the Defence Select Committee, Sir Nicholas Bonsor, was outspokenly critical:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Our presence in Belize has enormous value, way beyond the military element", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para55"></a>and,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The withdrawal is short-sighted". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para56"></a>Referring to Guatemala, he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"when a country is unstable, that must throw doubt on whether any assurances given by the regime of the moment can be relied upon even in the short and medium term". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para57"></a>A military coup rocked Guatemala shortly thereafter, defying British assessments, and announced that their recognition had been unconstitutional, premature and always without prejudice to their outstanding territorial claim. They advised the United Nations that the claim was reinstated to both land and sea areas "presently occupied by Belize". Now they insist that Britain is still a party to the dispute. Britain, however, is firm that <P>


<a name="column_276"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 276</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Belize inherited the problem at independence and must now negotiate as best she can. Yet, my Lords, a British training presence does not confer the same leverage as the Belize Defence Force which is outnumbered by the Guatemalan army by 50 to one.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para58"></a>There is an obvious case to be made for an expanded British presence in Belize. Belize's inherited predicament, her unstinting support for Britain at the UN and elsewhere, her unwavering commitment to democracy, individual freedoms and good governance and her unique multicultural diversity bridging Latin America and the Caribbean, all combine to make her a special friend with special needs. But we would be remiss, if not irresponsible, if we did not also consider the "returns on our investment".
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para59"></a>British forces preserve stability and peace in the region, bolster a wide British presence in Central America and assist with drugs interdiction. Britain would have easy access to a friendly, compact, accessible and low-cost training area of unparalleled quality. The facilities for jungle training, environmentally sound adventure training, live firing and low-flying sorties are unmatched elsewhere in the world. British Forces Belize have, in the course of their training, cleaned up offshore cays and helped to maintain and protect that fragile environment. Jungle training exercises deterred illegal logging in Belize's many conservation parks and protected important rain forest ecosystems.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para60"></a>An expanded British presence in Belize is of mutual benefit both in the short and the long term. Such an enhanced role combines foreign policy responsibilities with fundamental military needs and objectives. The strategic review will allocate spending to areas where our interests are best served. Our reduced Armed Forces, recognised as the standard bearers of effectiveness and efficiency, can usefully combine continued excellence and influence with practical application in an increased deployment to Belize indicative of this country's interests stretching beyond the European Union to all four corners of the world.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-09_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Clanwilliam: </B>   My Lords, our Armed Forces are the envy of the world in their disciplined and humanitarian approach to control of warring factions in peacetime, and particularly when the time arrives for full-scale deployment. Unfortunately, there is always a condition which falls between any of these categories, and it is then that our forces display their characteristic flexibility and resourcefulness; and for that they justly earn our debt of gratitude.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para61"></a>In his introduction to this important debate my noble friend Lord Vivian referred to the regimental system. I would prefer perhaps to refer to the decimation of our regimental system and the reduction in general of our Armed Forces to a very low level. There is a shortage of men in the Army which seriously affects their ability to deliver the full role that they are called upon to play. In the Royal Navy there is a similar shortage, but it is in the field of fully-trained ratings in electronics upon whom the main armament and weapons systems depend. <P>


<a name="column_277"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 277</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>These shortages are a fall-out from the Front Line First review which had the immediate effect of a typical over-reaction and which now needs to be corrected. I would ask the Minister whether the defence review will have something useful to contribute to that problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para62"></a>An example of it in the Royal Navy is the Recruiting and Training Agency which is having to learn to live with the Flagship initiative. That seems to be causing friction, especially with the decision to close existing RN training establishments and the appointment of civilians working alongside, and indeed superior to, Royal Navy officers and men. The problem can be summarised as a conflict at the interface between civilianised ex-service trainers in plain clothes and the disciplined uniformed rates. There is also the question of the acceptability by uniformed trainees of the civilian instructors. That may be thought of as perhaps a somewhat parochial point, but it is relevant to the shortage problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para63"></a>Be that as it may, the main deterrent of the United Kingdom is the Trident class boats, which was the subject of a Starred Question this afternoon. The fourth boat, HMS "Vengeance", will complete the full deployment of the flotilla, which will then provide a continuous and world-wide screen. It is to the Royal Navy that we can look with confidence to provide that protection. As my noble friend Lord Ironside has said, the addition of the A-class boats will confirm that world-wide protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para64"></a>No admiral has ever had enough frigates and now that the number of frigates is reduced to 33, we are at full stretch. While there was excellent deployment, as the noble Earl, Lord Effingham, pointed out, it is nevertheless true that the Navy has been left at full stretch. A level of 36 frigates is too low, especially when it is well established that the Russians are operating atomic powered nuclear submarines out of the White Sea in the Atlantic area. We have to be on our guard and we must be aware. For that we need the full force of the Royal Navy.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para65"></a>In the matter of the defence of the realm in general and its relationship to our allies, there is the problem of NATO on the one hand and the ambitions of some members of the WEU on the other to distance themselves from the enormous industrial and military strength of the United States. The association of the United States in our mutual defence is a vital element, especially in the light of its awesome power for retaliation and with the acknowledged superiority of its GPS supervision system from satellites and its ability to adjust the power factor of the satellites at its discretion. Therefore, the United States has total control of military operations conducted through satellites.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-09_para66"></a>Nevertheless, we have the Conference of the National Armaments Directors studying the problem of common and compatible weapons. We are fortunate that there is agreement with Germany over the Eurofighter; the Agusta helicopter with the Italians; the combined frigate with France and other nations, but all these are diverse colleagues. I see that my time is up. We must have commonality of systems.

<A NAME="70702-10_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Strange: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Vivian for initiating this debate on the Armed Forces and for his, as always, enjoyable and interesting speech. It is always a pleasure to me to take part in a defence debate, however often we have them, because there are so many knowledgeable and eloquent speeches to savour, although by the time I get round to saying anything, everything has already been said.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para0"></a>Anyone who watched the handover of Hong Kong on Monday's television could hardly have done so with dry eyes--not so much because of the end of a glorious chapter of the British Empire, although that too, of course; not so much because of uncertainty of the future of the Hong Kong people, although that too; but because of our pride in our armed services--the Black Watch lowering the British flag despite the rain, the aeroplanes flying overhead and "Britannia" sailing solemnly out into the distant oceans. We at home salute our Armed Forces and in this House particularly we battle for their interests and their welfare.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para1"></a>Yesterday I was lucky enough to go with the Defence Study Group to Catterick--a large military garrison initiated by Sir Robert Baden-Powell and begun in 1915. It is now the headquarters of the 19th Mechanised Brigade, with Challenger 1 tanks, Warriors and Saxon armoured vehicles. It also has an amazing, new bridge-building machine, which we saw in action. Some of them have just come back from Bosnia. Next month they are off again on unaccompanied tours to Bosnia and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para2"></a>One of the many interesting things we saw was their battle training school, much of which was carried on indoors with the use of the grown-up-equivalent of toy soldiers and computers. Approximately 38 groups of 100 people each can be accommodated here throughout the year. Although the battle itself is fought inside, with enormous saving to the environment, the antagonists walk beforehand through the surrounding terrain to assess where and how the battle will be fought. This they do with support and help from the local farming community over whose land they are walking. Recently, the local farmers have been writing to MoD to inform it that, if there is any ban on hunting in the future, the military will no longer be welcome on their land.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para3"></a>Another very interesting development, as my noble friend Lord Vivian has said, was the interaction of the military with the local community. The military are planning to build a new supermarket in the centre of their camp, which would also be available to all the local inhabitants. The nearest town, Richmond, has no suitable space available for building a new supermarket. There are also plans for the development of a restaurant, cinema, bowling alley and an all-weather sports gymnasium for the mutual benefit of military and civilians. This rapprochement between the military and the civilian environment seems to me to be the way forward for defence in the next century.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para4"></a>Unfortunately, it does not seem to be happening as much as they would like in the absolutely splendid Duchess of Kent Military Hospital, which is very <P>


<a name="column_279"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 279</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>anxious to have more civilian patients. Although called affectionately "The Military" by the locals, since the advent of the dread tentacles of the Defence Secondary Care Agency, it is now called the Duchess of Kent Hospital. It is still an absolutely splendid hospital with lovely doctors, nurses, wards and a very friendly atmosphere. It just would like more civilian patients. It seems to me that the Defence Secondary Care Agency is a monumental quango. It was founded in April 1996 and we were unlucky enough to observe its effects in both Haslar and Frimley hospitals, which we visited last year.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para5"></a>It reminds me very much of my uncle's horse, Poulet, who lived on a lovely farm in France. In the winter he ploughed his one field. In the spring he sowed clover and alfalfa in it. In the summer and autumn he harvested it and for the whole of the year he lived off the very good hay he had grown for himself.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para6"></a>Everyone who has spoken in this debate has spoken passionately in defence of our Armed Forces and the maintenance of their level at the moment at least. I hope that the noble Lord the Minister, whom I congratulate and welcome to his new appointment, will carry away in his heart what we have all said.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_time0"></A><H5>8.8 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, we have indeed been discussing whether and why we need the defence review. I start from a different perspective from many who have spoken in this debate. We need to justify the current level of money spent on our Armed Forces against a sceptical public. The reason why defence was not an issue in the election campaign was because most of the electors were not thought to be interested in it. If we wish to maintain a level of defence expenditure which is considerably above the current European average, we are going to have new justifications for that which we can explain to our younger generation are as important as those which our older generation remembers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para7"></a>I therefore welcome the defence review. We have had radical changes in our strategic environment in the past eight years. We have had the withdrawal of 1 million Soviet troops from central and eastern Europe; the collapse of the Warsaw Pact; the Partnership for Peace, in which British troops have become active, and within the next week the announcement of the first three, four or five candidates for the eastern enlargement of NATO.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para8"></a>The whole context of British defence policy has changed. That has been evident for some years. I remember during the 1992 election campaign taking the opportunity to talk to a number of senior Ministry of Defence officials about how they saw the context of British defence policy. One of them remarked that the puzzle was what British defence was now for. He said, "There is less of an evident threat to Britain now than at any time in the past 500 to 600 years".
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para9"></a>If there is no threat to Britain, we must ask what we need our Armed Forces for, for which tasks and in conjunction with which other countries? What foreign policy objectives should Britain's defence now serve? <P>


<a name="column_280"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 280</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>As the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, said, that requires us to ask what sort of a country we think we are and at which weight we wish to punch in the world. How much do we wish to spend in order to maintain a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council? Do we wish to get caught up in the argument over who has which NATO command and how many forces one wants to commit in order to maintain that? If the only argument for maintaining the First Armoured Division in Germany is so that we can maintain command of the Rapid Reaction Force, I submit that that is not a very strong argument. The French Government have got very badly hooked on the question of which NATO commands should be shared among which states. Indeed, their whole reintegration into NATO has now become caught up with the argument over the NATO southern command. That is not the sort of argument over which we should now be pursuing the question of what forces we need and for which tasks.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para10"></a>I can remember two previous major defence reviews. I can just remember the 1957 defence review which saw the ending of conscription and which made a radical change in our regimental system, taking away from most of our regiments their second battalion. I remember also the 1967 defence review, over which my late noble friend Lord Mayhew resigned from the then Labour Government--I very much miss his advice on defence matters. As a result of that review, economies were made and during the course of it, it was finally accepted that the British Government had been defending India for 20 years after Indian independence. We had continued to spend money on a task that was no longer worth while. We must ensure in this defence review that we do not continue to spend money on tasks which no longer exist. If the main function of our Navy is to keep open the transatlantic sea lanes to enable US reinforcements to reach central Europe against a Soviet threat which no longer exists, we must find another rationale for the balance of the Navy that we need.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para11"></a>We must ask ourselves the following questions: how far beyond Britain do we now wish or need to project force? As far as the Mediterranean? Further than the Mediterranean? On our own; or do we always assume that the Americans will provide us with the long-range airlift that will get us there? Are we really going to need aircraft carriers if we can expect to be able to use the airports of friendly powers in the Mediterranean in order to provide the air cover that we need?
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para12"></a>The question of defence equipment also raises a number of large issues. Do we really need a long-range fighter aircraft--a long-range strike craft to replace Tornado--or is the long-range role for which Tornado was designed not necessary in the post-cold war world? Are we sure that a tank designed for heavy fighting in the centre of Europe is what we need for the very different tasks that we now face in this post-cold war world? Incidentally, before anyone defends Challenger--the areas of Britain in which I have been politically active have made bits for Vickers to use in Challenger--I should point out that the United States is now making one tank when the Europeans are making <P>


<a name="column_281"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 281</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>three. The question of what happens to our defence procurement industry is a very important part of the defence review.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para13"></a>I should like to focus in my remaining few minutes on the question of personnel in the services. Evidently, there are changing demands on our military personnel who are also drawn from our changing society. We face a problem with overstretch, most particularly in the infantry and the medical services. Two questions need to be posed on that: first, how do we more usefully use our reserves; and, secondly, what do we need to do about our regimental system? I know from last year's defence review that there were nearly 700 reserve personnel in Bosnia at any one time last year, with a number of others serving in the Falklands and elsewhere. That is a heavy use of reservists. I am conscious that our medical reservists have been particularly heavily used. Perhaps the Minister can tell me to what extent we shall continue to do that--or even to expand on it--as we move towards a military environment in which we can never be quite sure how many forces we need to use and in how many different peace enforcement operations abroad.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para14"></a>I should like to question the Minister on the regimental system, given that the current situation with single battalion regiments going through a complex arms plot over a series of years is not the most effective use of manpower. The regimental system, as designed by Lord Haldane, was a multi-battalion regimental system, which enabled reservists from the same regiment to be added to those on the front line. We could save a great deal of manpower in our overstretched infantry if we moved back more self-consciously to a multi-battalion regimental system. That is not to go all the way towards a corps of infantry, but it seems to me that the defence review must now consider that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para15"></a>Given the changing structure of our society, we must also ask ourselves whether we can maintain a professional armed service in which the majority of those men are married and have families and yet are asked to serve abroad in repeated tasks for repeated three to six-month tours. We may have to move further towards having young, unmarried soldiers as the core of our active forces, with those who are married with family commitments being in reserve.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para16"></a>I echo the noble Lord, Lord Judd, in remarking, sadly, on how little our Armed Forces yet reflect the multicultural nature of our society. I noted the answer that was given to my noble friend Lord Harris of Greenwich last week and the information that in the six regiments of the Household Division there are currently five soldiers from our ethnic minorities. The good thing about our regimental system is that it gives a sense of belonging; the bad thing about it is that it sometimes leads to a more exclusive, clubbish atmosphere than one necessarily wants in a modern society.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para17"></a>We need a rethink and I welcome this defence review. We have to make changes to our Armed Forces to fit them for a changed technological and military environment and to changed demands. We are not entirely sure what those demands should be, which is <P>


<a name="column_282"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 282</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>why the foreign policy dimension of this defence review is important first, before we decide what forces we need for the tasks that we wish to fulfil.

<P>
<A NAME="70702-10_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I too should like to express my gratitude to my noble friend Lord Vivian for tabling this debate and for introducing it so ably. If he will allow me to say this at the risk of my being assailed from behind, I have always found my noble friend, whose professional experience we all recognise, to be a very wise head in defence matters. The House is lucky to have him. I naturally associate myself with all that he has said today.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para18"></a>My noble friend pointed out, as did other noble Lords, that this debate is taking place under what can only be seen as the shadow of the Government's strategic defence review. A lot of us feel that a review of this magnitude is unnecessary, is damaging to morale and is liable (if the Treasury were by any chance to intervene) to lead to an extremely damaging diminution of this country's military capability. I do not want to repeat the fears that I expressed in the debate on the gracious Speech a few weeks ago, but my fears still stand.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para19"></a>The key questions to be asked in this review, to summarise what a number of noble Lords have said, are these: does the UK wish to step back from its responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council? Is the UK's commitment to NATO any less relevant or important than before? Are our interests overseas any less relevant or important? Are the defence roles and mission types that we have defined for the forces in need of redefinition? I am clear that the answer to all four of those questions is: no. Nevertheless, the Government, as is their prerogative, have embarked on this extended review.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para20"></a>For our part, we wish to impress upon them our belief, so effectively pointed out by my noble friend Lord Trefgarne in his remarks on power projection--which was in different ways echoed by many noble Lords--that it is a grave error to remove any of the fundamental building blocks of our defence and war-fighting capability at a time when international tensions and sudden crises can spring up without warning to surprise us. The fine speech of the noble Earl, Lord Effingham, about the Royal Navy and joint operations deserves close study. It was worthy of his distinguished ancestor.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para21"></a>I referred to morale. If the services believe, as surely they must, that changes are in prospect for them, and if they are asked to be more efficient, as surely they will be, they must continue to feel valued and not just costed. They must believe that budgets and money are not the only measures of performance but that there is an underlying wish on the part of government to give them stability in return for their service and commitment. Change for any organisation is inevitable, and the services have always recognised this. I am sure that these arguments will not be lost on the Minister of all people. Indeed, the purported aim of the defence review is to make stability possible. But after so many recent changes, however necessary those may have been, the <P>


<a name="column_283"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 283</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>risk to long-term morale is obvious. We should never forget that in the end morale is the commodity that wins battles.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para22"></a>The second part of my comments relates to public perceptions. The title chosen by my noble friend for his Motion may appear to be a touch formulaic:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"To call attention to the importance of the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para23"></a>That title acts, as we have seen from this excellent debate, as a hook on which to hang a wide range of defence-related topics. But to call attention to the Armed Forces and the importance of their work is the essence of what needs to be done both inside and outside Parliament, because when in due course the Government come forward with proposals arising from the strategic defence review, it is important that everyone understands their significance for the defence of this country, for the NATO alliance and our place within it and for our wider interests overseas. My noble friends Lord Vivian and Lady Park made this point effectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para24"></a>The trouble is that I doubt whether there has been a time within living memory when the armed services have been so little seen or understood by the public at large. The reasons for this are obvious. It is 50 years since the country has been involved in a major war. The percentage of families with direct experience of the military is low. Ironically, the very circumstances that have led the forces for 28 years to play a prominent and vital role--those in Northern Ireland--have obliged them to adopt a much reduced public profile in mainland UK. For reasons of security one does not now see military uniforms on the streets, and that is regrettable.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para25"></a>Looking back over my time at the Ministry of Defence, I am conscious that a large proportion of the correspondence that crossed my desk involved in one way or another building bridges with the general public on the activities of the armed services. Undoubtedly, the issue most frequently complained of was low flying. When I arrived at the MoD I did not know what "Minister for Low Flying" meant. My staff told me that I would soon find out--and I did. No one pretends that low flying by fast jets is an environmentally friendly activity. It can be very unpleasant for those who experience it on the ground. But the public must understand how absolutely essential it is for the RAF to fly at low levels and for the air space over the country as a whole to be available to them. The United Kingdom is simply not big enough to allow numerous avoidance areas to be created other than over conurbations. We rely on the RAF to perform to the most exacting standards when it matters. We must allow them the scope, provided they do not utilise it more than is strictly necessary, to keep these skills sharpened.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para26"></a>All this underlines the importance of maintaining such simple initiatives as the forces' three presentation teams and encouraging responsible television documentaries such as the "Defence of the Realm" series broadcast last year. I hope very much that the Royal Tournament will not fall victim to budgetary cheeseparing, because that show is surely one of the best and most enjoyable ways of keeping the skills and professionalism of the three services in the public eye.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para27"></a>My noble friend who so ably chairs the all-party defence study group does much to promote knowledge of service issues in your Lordships' House and in the other place. But I was not surprised to hear him acknowledge the general ignorance of defence issues that exists in Parliament, particularly among MPs. One of my more pleasant responsibilities as a Minister was for the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme. It was an inspired idea on the part of Sir Neil Thorne and a wonderful way of bringing service life alive to Members of Parliament. With the extent of the new intake in the other place at the election, I believe that there is a case for expanding the numbers of scheme participants during the next few years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para28"></a>But let us not forget two important links that happily do exist between the services and the public: the reserve forces and the cadets. More than is now the case with the regular army, the TA maintains its regional, county-based ties. Today, 130,000 youngsters take part in the cadet movement. Upwards of 55,000 men and women from all walks of life honour a commitment to military training with the TA, some in very valuable specialist disciplines. Many thousands more serve with the RNR, the RMR and the RAF reserves. The Reserve Forces Act 1996 should give those reservists greater opportunity than before to go on active service alongside the regular forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para29"></a>A few years ago a great deal of thought was given to what the optimum size of the TA should be to meet today's needs. I believe that the current establishment of 59,000 is about right. Certainly it should not be any lower. If the Government are ever tempted to cut them I trust that they will remember that for the flexibility they give us and the centres of expertise that they embody the reserve forces are a relatively inexpensive insurance policy against the unexpected. I hope that the Minister will feel able to acknowledge their value when he comes to speak, despite the constraints under which he operates as a result of the ongoing review.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para30"></a>To judge the importance of the Armed Forces, look around the world at what they are doing for this country, from the Falklands to Bosnia, from the Caribbean to Iraq, to protect our interests and those of the civilised world. Look at the skill with which they do it. Look at the compliments paid to them by our friends and allies overseas, from the French President downwards. Those who look at these matters are in no doubt that the Armed Forces perform an essential role on behalf of us all--a role in which we as a country can take real pride.

<A NAME="70702-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, I have no difficulty whatever in joining all of your Lordships in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, for initiating this debate. As a very new recruit to your Lordships' House, if I ever had any doubt about the wisdom of leaving the other place and coming to this House it has been removed by being able to listen to the quality of debate that I have heard today. I say frankly and not with tongue in cheek that this evening I have learnt a very great deal from this wide-ranging debate. It has illuminated many of the questions that the Strategic Defence Review will have to consider.
<P>


<a name="column_285"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para31"></a>I recognise that not all noble Lords welcome the review. I also recognise that there is concern, some of it sceptical and some of it even cynical, that it will be Treasury led and just another excuse for cuts. The assurance I give is that it will be led by Foreign Office Ministers and not Foreign Office officials. The Treasury will of course probably try to get involved in it, but it is up to us, the Defence Ministers, to justify the present resources that the country devotes to its own defence. I hope that we will have little difficulty in doing so.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para32"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, for recognising that the Labour Government have made a commitment to strong defence. That is unambiguous. If any noble Lords doubt that, I recommend, in particular noble Lords opposite that they go back to their files of the Daily Telegraph and read the article that the then Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister, wrote on the subject of defence. I believe that they will be satisfied with the Prime Minister's attitude to the importance of proper defence of this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para33"></a>The noble Lord asked also about dependent territories. I can give him the unequivocal assurance that he wanted: of course it will remain our policy to be responsible for the defence of the dependent territories. I am in the habit of teasing my American friends on that subject by pointing out that even though we have just lost 95 per cent. of the population of what I still call the British Empire this week, the sun still does not set upon it if we take into account our islands in the Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the north and south Atlantic and the Caribbean. One's American friends are quite teased by that revelation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para34"></a>Many noble Lords have raised concerns about undermanning and over-stretch. It is no secret that that is a problem in all three services. I cannot invite noble Lords to be optimistic that those problems will be solved overnight. Recruitment is a problem; premature voluntary retirement is a problem; and retaining recruits is also a problem. In that last respect, noble Lords may be interested in an experiment that is being conducted by the Royal Navy in which, because it was so concerned by the proportion of recruits that it was losing during initial training (up to 25 per cent.), it has introduced an imaginative new scheme whereby it identifies at an early stage of the training process which recruits are likely to be slow learners, and which might need special handling because of their backgrounds. It has separated them into different streams for training, and it is finding the results encouraging. I hope that we may be able to expand such an approach to recruitment in the other services.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para35"></a>I recognise that there is some apprehension about the need for the review. I can assure your Lordships that it is supported by the chiefs of staff. It was at his own insistence, not that of the Secretary of State, that the Chief of Defence Staff sat next to the Secretary of State at the press conference when he announced the review. In case your Lordships are worried about the principles of these matters, I should point out that in the USA--I do not say that they do things better there--they are used to having quadrennial defence reviews, and no one becomes too agitated about them.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para36"></a>The main thing about the review that I hope everyone in the House and outside will recognise is that we want everyone to be heard. I have written to many noble Lords with a defence interest. If I have overlooked any, I apologise. I extend to all noble Lords an open invitation to write to me about the defence review. Several noble Lords have already done so. I am extremely grateful to them for the contributions that they have already made. They will receive a response in due course.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-10_para37"></a>Many questions have been asked about the regimental system. I cannot give unqualified guarantees that at the end of the review the regimental system will be the same as it is today because if one kept on giving guarantees that this would not be changed, that would not be changed, and something else was sacrosanct, there would be no point in having a review. I assure your Lordships that the Government recognise the value of the regimental system. I took seriously the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, in his thought-provoking speech, about the type of regimental system. Those will be matters which we shall of course be considering. I hope that the noble Lord will be contributing to the review. I do not know whether he is invited to one of the seminars.

<P>
<A NAME="70702-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, I am.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted to hear that, and I hope that he will be attending. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, asked whether Her Majesty's Government were contemplating the end of the RAF. I can give one unambiguous guarantee at this Dispatch Box tonight. Her Majesty's Government are not contemplating the end of the RAF. That does not mean that we may not see over the time horizon--the next 20 to 25 years--a considerable expansion in the use of pilotless vehicles, particularly for reconnaissance activities in the neighbourhood of the battlefield. But, as the noble and gallant Lord so wisely intimated, if we were to remove pilots from almost every cockpit, we would still need an air force and people who understood the flexibility and complexities of air power. That was a point echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para0"></a>I follow the noble Lord about the importance of the IT revolution which impinges not just on the air force but on the other services. In the time horizon--the next 20 to 25 years--it will be one of the fundamental changes in the nature of warfare at which we shall have to have a look.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para1"></a>The noble Lord asked about the Fisher and Wright case. The costs of the judicial review have been awarded against the NI Office. Guardsman Wright's legal costs were funded by the public purse through the legal aid system; Guardsman Fisher's costs will be met from public funds because the review awarded costs against the NI Office. I am sure that he will recognise that neither I nor the NI Office has had time to study the judgment. So I cannot answer his question as to when the next steps will be taken in that unhappy affair.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, is another who touched upon the gap between establishments and what is necessary, particularly in Northern Ireland and Bosnia, <P>


<a name="column_287"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 287</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and between turns in Northern Ireland and Bosnia. I cannot answer his specific question, but I can tell him that the average operational tour interval in 1996-97 for the Royal Armoured Corps was 25 months. I am afraid that it will suffer, as we projected, for 1997-98 with the operational tour interval coming down to 19 months. On the other hand, for the Royal Artillery, the average is likely to rise from 21 months to 36 months; for the infantry from 21 months to 23 months; and for the Royal Engineers from 12 months to 20 months. The Royal Armoured Corps will be suffering so much because it will be carrying out a higher than usual number of operational tours in the infantry role in Northern Ireland to compensate the Royal Artillery.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para3"></a>I turn now to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, whom I thank for his kind remarks at the beginning of his speech. If for nothing else, it is delightful to be in the House so that I can see his face again and to be able to rely on his ever-generous advice. I am delighted also that he gave a generous welcome to the review. I endorse what he said about how easy it is to lose a war-fighting capability and how difficult it is to replace it once it is lost. I can assure the House that that is something which is perfectly understood by all the defence department Ministers at this time. The noble Lord and other speakers drew attention to the fact that the medical services are particularly badly stretched. That is a matter which has our full attention and I hope that we shall be able to do something about it before too long.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para4"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Park, asked whether the review was another word for cuts. I can assure her that it is not the intention of defence Ministers that it should be so. If we can justify it, we have the assurance that we will be able to spend at least as much as the previous government were committed to spend for the next two years. The noble Baroness was kind enough to confirm what I said about the importance to me personally as the Defence Procurement Minister, of the maintainability of our forces. Unfortunately, it is not quite as simple as just ringing up a supplier and asking for a lot more spare parts; indeed, it is a very complicated matter, especially as much of the old equipment has been run on for much longer than had originally been expected would be its useful service life. Many spare parts are no longer being made, or perhaps more spare parts are needed than was originally anticipated. Sometimes it is necessary to open up a production line at exorbitant cost in order to get spare parts for particular pieces of equipment. Very difficult decisions have to be taken as regards the balance of resources.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para5"></a>However, I can assure the noble Baroness that this is a matter of prime importance in the area for which I am responsible. I also endorse what the noble Baroness and other speakers said about Russia being far from a spent force, at least so far as concerns certain of its special capabilities. I have in mind in particular the ballistic missile threat and the submarine forces threat.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para6"></a>I was grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Allenby, who made some useful suggestions about satellite recruiting offices in remote areas. I shall certainly bring those suggestions to the attention of my honourable friend the Minister for the Armed Forces. I hope that the noble <P>


<a name="column_288"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 288</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Viscount was reassured by what I said earlier about the way in which the Royal Navy is trying to tackle the problems of wastage in recruitment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para7"></a>I entirely agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, said about the need to deter aggressors. The noble Lord cited the case of the Falklands, but I should remind him that it is not just a question of whether or not you have the resources available; the importance of having accurate intelligence is vital in such matters. Indeed, although I am not criticising anyone, from time to time we have not always had the accurate intelligence that we might have had which could have told us what was going to happen with Saddam Hussein and with General Galtieri. That might have saved much anguish for us and for the people with whom we finally found ourselves in conflict. I quite agree with the noble Lord that ships, tanks and aircraft cannot be produced quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para8"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Effingham, referred to the Ocean Wave deployment. He may like to know that we had a carrier task group exercise with nuclear powered submarines and amphibious forces--indeed, the whole operation was initiated under our predecessors--which lasted some seven months. Altogether some 20 Royal Navy warships, submarines and support vessels were involved and we demonstrated all three of the Royal Navy's core capabilities. It was a busy programme of goodwill visits from the Mediterranean to New Zealand. Not only did we produce an extremely impressive display, but also I believe it is fair to say that we surprised some of our allies at the capability for force projection that we still retain in this country. We also comforted our friends and the whole deployment was extremely helpful with our defence sales efforts.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para9"></a>I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Astor, that we have no intention of going to a gendarmerie army in which there would be no tanks at all--although perhaps I should not say that and should say that that would not apply unless the defence review produces a result which I do not anticipate. On the question of tanks, I am drawn back to what the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, said. I quite understand the thrust of his remarks that the United States produces one tank while Europe produces three different tanks. When I was last at the Ministry of Defence, one of the things which irritated me more than anything else was the number of different people who were producing torpedoes in NATO and we were all buying them in only penny packets. However, when I returned to the Ministry of Defence, I have to say that the same story applies today. I believe that our torpedoes are much better now than possibly they were when I was last at the Ministry.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wedgwood, asked for confirmation that signed contracts would be honoured. I can assure him that that will be the case. Indeed, there is no question of our repudiating signed contracts in the procurement field; nor is it intended that there should be any moratorium on procurement. However, where we are at the early stages of major projects, they will receive more detailed scrutiny under the defence review than some which are further down the procurement path.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para11"></a>I must be careful now because I am running out of time. Clearly, I shall not be able to reply to all the points raised by noble Lords. I hope that I shall enjoy the indulgence of <P>


<a name="column_289"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 289</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the House if I say to noble Lords that I shall write to them about matters to which I have not been able to reply. However, I do not want to sit down this evening before confirming to my noble friend Lord Judd, and other speakers, that Her Majesty's Government will not tolerate racial prejudice and harassment in the Armed Forces. The Chiefs of Staff have our full support in such matters. Equally, we are most concerned to try to do more to integrate the Armed Forces into the community. Unfortunately I have to tell your Lordships, that, as I am briefed, the forces have not had the full support that they had hoped to receive from some of the agencies which are active in community relations in trying to explain to some of the minority groups in our society that a career in Her Majesty's Forces is a noble and worthwhile one. We hope that we can persuade them to take a more constructive view to help us along those lines.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para12"></a>In a few days' time, among the many hideous anniversaries that we have to go through from time to time, it will be the 80th anniversary of Passchendaele. I am sure that your Lordships will agree that the whole purpose of our having strong defence forces in this country is so that the younger generations, and those to come, will never again have to endure that sort of slaughter.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para13"></a>We are undertaking this review because we want to take defence out of the political firing line. I actually take comfort from the fact that defence was not a great issue in the last general election campaign, not merely because during the years when it was my party suffered very considerably due to its defence posture, with which I was never very comfortable, but because I believe that it is most important that the national consensus which I sense exists in the British public should also be extended to our national political life. That is one of the reasons why, in holding that review, we are inviting as many people as possible to contribute to it. We think that that will be the most effective way to provide our Armed Forces with the vision and direction which they must have if they are to remain successful into the next century. I wish to repeat my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, for this debate.

I thank him very much for what he has said to us this evening.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-11_para14"></a>With your Lordships' permission, I add my own tribute to a magnificent and well-trained Armed Forces. They serve us daily and frequently face danger with the utmost courage. They set a shining example to us all and are more than worthy of the respect of us all. We owe each and every one of them a vast debt of gratitude and the country is justly proud to have such professional and highly skilled Armed Forces.

<A NAME="70702-12_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Nathan </B>  rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they intend during the current Session to repeal or bring into force any and, if so, which of the provisions of the 69 Acts enacted up to 1992 specified in Bringing Acts of Parliament Into Force (Cm 3595); what is their policy on bringing into force Acts enacted since 1992; and whether they intend in future legislation to limit the time within which it will be brought into force.
<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this afternoon we have had two wide-ranging debates on matters of great interest and importance and it may seem that the subject of the Question which I am asking is of a somewhat technical character and of no particular importance. But I shall seek to show that that is not so and that in the context of our parliamentary system of government, issues of considerable importance arise.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para1"></a>At last, and for the first time, there is available to us a list of the provisions of those Acts which have neither been repealed nor brought into force. That list is limited to the period 1979 to 1992; that is a period of between five and 18 years ago. Therefore, we remain ignorant of the position in relation to Acts passed in the past five years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para2"></a>Years ago we were informed that a database was in preparation which would enable easy access to that information and there was some thought that that would be available in the spring of this year. I gather now that that will not be available for use by the public or by Parliament until 1999. I hope that the Minister will be able to inform your Lordships of the current position and prospects.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para3"></a>In the 12&#189; years from May 1979 to December 1992 (the period covered by the Command Paper) 810 Bills received Royal Assent. The paper lists 69 Acts out of the 810 which had not come into force in all their sections by March 1997. That constitutes 8.5 per cent. of the total number of Acts passed during the period. It is not a negligible percentage. It relates to the position five years after the latest date in the paper. Therefore, it should not be thought that that represents at any time the percentage of Acts which contain commencement provisions unlimited in time and which have not been exercised. It seems likely that a list produced now similar to that in the paper in respect of the period 1992 to 1997 would contain entries representing a higher percentage.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para4"></a>The Command Paper No. 3595 stems from a recommendation of your Lordships' Select Committee on Procedure of the House (set out in Hansard of 27th March 1996 at col. 1706) that the Government should lay before the House an annual report listing all the Acts and provisions within Acts which have been neither repealed nor brought into force, giving reasons for the delay in each case.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para5"></a>The problem arises because with increasing frequency Acts provide that a commencement order is required to bring a provision into force without limit of time in which it shall be exercised. Indeed, there is no <P>


<a name="column_291"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 291</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>obligation to exercise it at all. Those powers introduce an option for government to implement legislation which Parliament has enacted or to render that legislation of no effect. Commencement powers usually appear last in a Bill. When earlier clauses are under discussion, reference is rarely made to their application. It should be. Parliament enacts provisions in the belief that it has made effective laws but it is only an act of government that (in such cases) makes them so, if they choose.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para6"></a>The Select Committee on Delegated Powers was concerned that a mechanism be found to ensure that Acts passed by Parliament are brought into operation. There is reference to that at paragraph 38 of the 12th report. The list of Acts annexed to the paper represents wasted parliamentary time.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para7"></a>It has been said that government are answerable to Parliament for any failure in their responsibilities as respects the exercise or non-exercise of such powers. But Parliament does not in fact exercise control and might indeed have difficulty in doing so even if it had the knowledge that part or all of an Act was not in force. That is referred to at paragraph 11 of the 12th Report of the Delegated Powers Select Committee. In effect, Parliament abdicates its responsibility for ensuring implementation of legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para8"></a>The paper lists a number of reasons for incorporating commencement powers but there are, I submit, scarcely any instances justifying indefinite duration. None of those cited do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para9"></a>If, exceptionally, it were desired to omit a limit of time for exercise, Parliament should only accept that if it is satisfied that that is necessary for the most cogent reasons. Indeed there would be much advantage in the House being advised by the Select Committee on Delegated Powers in all such cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para10"></a>The paper refers to delays in implementation being required by supervening developments such as international conventions and unforeseen problems in implementation such as adverse changes in economic conditions. But that is a risk applicable to all legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para11"></a>In some cases the paper explains that certain provisions remain available to be brought into force but kept in reserve. There may be cases where it is desirable for government to have reserve powers; for example, where long and difficult negotiations are in view (as in Northern Ireland). But those are exceptional cases and should be explained as such and kept under review, perhaps annually.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para12"></a>I turn briefly to the command paper itself--which does not inspire confidence. It refers in the preamble to "Bills" listed in the annex, which are in fact Acts, and refers to Acts "approved" by Parliament. They are not "approved"; they are enacted. No doubt this was an unfortunate slip (though the word appears not once but twice) and indicates a measure of arrogance on the part of the author.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para13"></a>A brief review of the annexed list indicates certain categories. There are the cases where provisions have not been brought into force but,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there are no plans to do so at the present time although the need to do so is kept under review". <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para14"></a>Your Lordships will see that in a note on the Building Act 1984. That Act was passed 13 years ago. For how much longer will the possibility of implementing it remain? Is the public, is Parliament, aware that these provisions may suddenly spring into life having lain dormant all these years?
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para15"></a>There are instances where it appears that later legislation supersedes or conflicts with provisions of earlier Acts which have not been brought into force. It seems that the opportunity to repeal the provisions in the earlier Act by the later was either overlooked or ignored. There is constant reference to the possibility of repeal but the lack of opportunity to do so. Some system of repeal could surely be devised which would enable this clutter of useless law to be removed from the statute book.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para16"></a>There are cases where it appears that legislation has been enacted when it was known (or ought to have been known) that it was not needed or was impossible to implement. The Charities Act 1992, Part III, is a case in point. In July 1994 a deregulation report was published which under the heading of Part III refers to "The Problem". It states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is concern that the practical consequences of some aspects of the new legislation were insufficiently thought through", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para17"></a>and recommended further consultation. That was done. The response was published in January 1996 and proposed forming in September 1996 a working group for further consultations with a view to bringing Part III fully into force in June 1998. The working group has not yet been formed. I do not cast blame on the civil servants or others for the slippage in the time which I gather has been due to other severe pressures, but it is alarming to say the least. I speak of this at some length because it demonstrates the need for pre-legislative consultation and thorough consideration of legislation in draft before initiation of the formal legislative processes.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para18"></a>The relevance of this to the present discussion is that a means must be found to eliminate in all but the most exceptional instances the need for commencement powers exercisable without limit of time, for these sap confidence of the public in the parliamentary process and replace it in the public mind with control by the governing party. That indeed was in the mind of Mrs. Ann Taylor when she gave her address on reform of parliament on 14th May 1996 before becoming Lord President of the Council.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para19"></a>It is in this context that the establishment of a Select Committee in another place is highly relevant. Increased time spent in preparation of legislation would not only help to avoid bad legislation (of which there has been far too much) but enable the totality of the legislative package to be considered together. Indeed I hope it may consider abandonment of commencement powers of the type I have described except in the most exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para20"></a>I hope the Minister may be able to tell us about the thinking of Government on the various questions which arise. First, can he tell us the position about the database of legislation in force--when it will be running and available to Parliament, the public and indeed practitioners? Do the Government intend during the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>current Session to repeal or bring into force any, and if so which, of the provisions of the 69 Acts enacted up to 1992 specified in the Command Paper?
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-12_para21"></a>Do the Government intend to present to Parliament a similar command paper in respect of a period later than 1992, and if so what period and when? What is the Government's policy as regards future legislation as to incorporation of commencement powers and the limit of time within which they may be exercised?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not think I should address the House by saying "My Lords". I address the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, and the Deputy Speaker, the noble Lord, Lord Lyell. Those noble Lords deserve to be addressed individually rather than collectively. I am not sure that in my 14 years in this House I have ever experienced a situation where the Opposition Benches have been completely empty. Since the 18th century there has been official recognition of Her Majesty's loyal Opposition and I am not sure it is entirely proper that they should not take part in debates, particularly debates as important as this one which has been introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Nathan.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-13_para0"></a>All three of us must be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, for the work that he has done in this area. We must also be grateful for the work of the Select Committee on Procedure, and indeed for the work of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee which preceded that. It will be evident that there was a good reason for the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee to attack this problem when it did. The Criminal Justice Act 1988 included provision for the establishment of a criminal injuries compensation scheme which would have run in parallel to that of the law in other areas of personal injury compensation. That part of the Act was never brought into force and was never repealed. Subsequently the then Home Secretary tried to introduce a criminal injuries compensation scheme which departed radically from the provisions of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act without seeking legislative authority for it; in other words, that was done by Order in Council. He was struck down by the courts and as a result he was forced to introduce primary legislation in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Bill which consisted of a compromise between the provisions of the 1988 Act and his original scheme. That finally received parliamentary approval but it clearly caused justifiable concern to a large number of Members of Parliament in both Houses.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-13_para1"></a>No one can disagree that it is undesirable that there should be legislation on the statute book which is not implemented. That must be the starting point for our consideration of this issue. However, there are exceptions to every rule. For example, the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, has referred to the desirability of bringing legislation into force after a certain period of time. However, there are examples in the other direction. The Football Spectators Act 1989 would have required all football spectators to carry membership cards. The Hillsborough tragedy, which is now being investigated again at the instigation of the Home Secretary, led to the report from the subsequent Lord Chief Justice, Lord <P>


<a name="column_294"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 294</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Taylor of Gosforth, whose wise report made it clear that an identity card scheme was not appropriate. It would have been a great pity if that had been implemented before the report had been produced.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-13_para2"></a>A much more ancient example concerns the Easter Act 1928 which provides for Easter to be on the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April. That would have been between 9th and 15th April this year. But Section 2 of the 1928 Act states that regard should be had to any opinion officially expressed by any Church or other Christian body before an order is made. The Council of Churches in Britain and Ireland has said that it would not wish to move to a fixed date without worldwide agreement. Noble Lords who are members of Christian Churches will know that there is disagreement among them about when Easter should be. There has been no worldwide agreement; and as a result the Easter Act 1928 has never been implemented. I am not sure whether the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, suggests that it should now be repealed, but I understand that the Churches would not be pleased if that initiative were taken.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-13_para3"></a>However, these are extreme examples. There are perfectly good although mundane reasons on most occasions why an Act, or part of it, should not be implemented on a fixed date. Sometimes there is a need for public consultation. Sometimes there is a need for administrative machinery. Sometimes international developments such as the ratification of conventions are necessary before an Act can be implemented. Sometimes Acts require expenditure of money which simply is not available and that may delay implementation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-13_para4"></a>We have to accept that we should not take too purist a line. We should accept that unforeseen problems could arise. Sometimes Parliament, even in passing legislation, recognises that specific provisions may never be brought into force. The Representation of the People Act 1985 contains a commencement order for Schedule 1 which states that it can be implemented only if the Secretary of State is satisfied that it is necessary to do so in order to prevent serious abuse of the system of voting by post in Northern Ireland. I cannot say that the commencement order will never be required, but I think that we should all hope it will not be required. All that leads me to say, contrary to the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, that it would not be desirable to insist on fixed dates for implementation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-13_para5"></a>I do not believe that the problem is as serious as the noble Lord suggests. If we consider the command paper to which the noble Lord referred, we find that the record is not that bad. In most cases Acts contain only one or two unimplemented sections. Reading through them, I thought that most of them could be perfectly reasonably justified. That is not to say that nothing should be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-13_para6"></a>Perhaps I may respond to the noble Lord's specific points. He asked me about the statute law database. He is right to say that it was originally intended that it should be available to Parliament and the public by 1997. I am sorry to have to confirm that it will not now be available until 1999. That is the nature of information technology projects, I am afraid. This is not the only one to suffer delay in that way.
<P>


<a name="column_295"></a>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 295</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-13_para7"></a>The noble Lord asked me whether, if the legislation were delayed, there should be a similar command paper on unimplemented legislation. I am certainly prepared to give him the undertaking that if it were delayed beyond 1999, there would be a second command paper during the course of that year covering Acts not only up until 1992 but 31st December 1994. In other words, we would not only update but improve the coverage of the command paper. We could go beyond that, but after a while the database and the record of unimplemented legislation would become swamped by what I believe the noble Lord would recognise as trivial examples of those which should never be implemented closer than a year or two after enactment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-13_para8"></a>The noble Lord asked me about the repeal of the 69 Acts in the command paper. I can give him the assurance that instructions will go out to departments which are producing major and wide-ranging legislation in the course of this Session: that they should have regard to two points. First, where there is an opportunity to repeal unimplemented legislation they should take it; and, secondly, that they should take good care that in commencement procedures in the Bill before Parliament they should ensure that no measures are included which would give rise to the concerns expressed by the noble Lord. I am hopeful that we will not bring before Parliament legislation of that kind. However, it is up to Parliament in the end to protest when commencement orders are vague. I am sure that what is now called the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee will take good care to cover that point.
<P>

<B>2 Jul 1997 : Column 296</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-13_para9"></a>I think I have answered the point that the noble Lord raised about a similar command paper in the future by saying that we will do so if the slippage on the statute law database is any greater than it has been. I think I have also answered the point about our policy on future legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-13_para10"></a>It is Parliament's responsibility as well as that of the Government to see to it that our scrutiny covers those points. The President of the Council, Ann Taylor, in another place, has asked the Modernisation Committee there to consider whether Special Standing Committees could be used more effectively where they would have an effect in ensuring better scrutiny of legislation. Your Lordships have the provision for a Special Standing Committee procedure in this House. We have hardly ever used it. I hope that we shall use it more and that that will improve the quality of legislation. I hope it will reduce the number of cases when unimplemented legislation will arise.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702-13_para11"></a>To sum up, our strategy is twofold. We have to tidy up the existing law, and we have to ensure that new legislation is better informed than it has been in the past. I hope that the noble Lord will feel that it is the intention of this new Government to treat the matter seriously. Although we cannot accept his particular recommendation for a time limit, we are prepared, and keen, to attempt to secure that the volume of unimplemented legislation is reduced and continues to reduce.

<A NAME="70702w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions intends to commission later this year a project to prepare a practical handbook that draws together existing knowledge on tree roots and their interaction with soil, man-made structures and objects. In addition, a proposal is being formulated for a project to assess the effect of pruning on the water uptake of trees and the consequential abstraction of water from the soil.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702w02_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they possess any data on the effects of tree roots on buildings and their relationship with subsidence and, if so, whether they will publish it.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70702w02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   Information about the incidence of tree species implicated in subsidence damage was included in Tree Roots and Buildings published in 1981 by Dr. Cutler and Dr. Richardson. Their work was based on the Kew Tree Root Survey (1971-79). Much of the survey data on the tree root systems was obtained from investigations carried out during the assessment of alleged subsidence damage. The text was republished in 1989 to take account of additional information or data about the structure of root systems.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702w02_para0"></a>The National House Building Council and the then Department of Environment commissioned research between 1979-1985 and 1989-1994 to quantify the seasonal and long-term changes of soil drying and moisture deficit in the vicinity of trees on clay soils. The results of this work have been published in technical journals, and are to be published in the proceedings of the conference Arboricultural Practice: Present and Future, held in 1995.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702w02_para1"></a>The Building Research Establishment, through research commissioned by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, has over recent years investigated the effect of trees on ground movements and building foundations. Current work, funded up to 1998, is primarily concerned with the determination of ground movement prior to and following the removal of trees (a possible solution to subsidence damage known to be caused by trees) at locations close to and remote from trees. The results of this work, to date, have been published in conference papers, and in the journal of the Institution of Structural Engineers. BRE also established a database, under contract from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, to log subsidence damage and factors relevant to each case. The data have not been analysed for publication.
<P>

<A NAME = "70702w02_para2"></a>All this work has informed the development of various British Standards, and codes of practice--most notably NHBC Standards Chapter 4.2, which deals with the construction of foundations close to trees.

The effect is that a Sierra Leonean national who entered the United Kingdom previously and applies for asylum within three months of this declaration being made becomes eligible to claim social security benefits while his or her application is considered by the department. No decisions will be made on asylum applications made by Sierra Leonean nationals until the situation stabilises.
