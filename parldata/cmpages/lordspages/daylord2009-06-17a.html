This represents years two and three of the three-year settlement, providing a background of stability and continuity against which the police and all stakeholders can plan with much greater certainty and confidence. In addition to general grant, Surrey will receive approximately &#163;15.4 million from specific grants and capital provision for 2009-10<b>.</b></p>

Is he aware that funding for the Surrey police force has, uniquely in the United Kingdom, been capped by Her Majesty&#146;s Government at what is in fact below the level of last year; that Surrey faces some unique security threats, and that this capping sits ill with the threats to which I have referred?</p>

In the first context it is not used correctly, because last year Lincolnshire found itself in the same situation, so Surrey is not unique. I suspect that the noble Lord&#146;s second use of the word is not accurate either. While there are problems with Surrey&#151;the great M25 motorway goes through it&#151;there are also great motorways in the north of England, the west of England, and many other areas. The arguments about this can be seen by noble Lords if they take the time to read the proceedings of the 90-minute debate held in another place two days ago. They will see that the very adequate response given by the Minister in the other place answers the points raised by the noble Lord.</p>

Is it sensible that the Government are now forcing the Surrey police authority in addition to the 144 front-line personnel who have already been cancelled out this year to scrub around another 50 front-line officers? Is that fair to the public of Surrey?</p>

If the word &#147;unique&#148; is to be used, it is that Surrey uniquely is a police authority that twice in two years has gone beyond the cap, knowing in advance what was likely to happen this year. It is now the case, of course, that there are no central targets. Each police authority must manage its own affairs within the money raised locally and provided centrally. In that sense, Surrey is in the same situation as any other county. It has an excellent police force, as the noble Lord rightly said, but there again the number one police force happens to be that for the county of my birth, which is Lancashire.</p>

Will he make sure that the Government once again look at the funding of authorities around the periphery of London and do something about the quite unjust boundary between the police forces?</p>

While it is true, perhaps, that Surrey would raise the argument that it loses police officers to the Met&#151;the so-called doughnut effect&#151;that also applies to other counties that border on the Metropolitan Police area. All those other areas have met their requirements within their budget.</p>

Cutting police funding by the same 10 per cent as the rest of the Home Office could lose us 15,000 police officers, exactly the number of extra police officers delivered since this Government came to power in 1997. That means 30 officers off the beat in every constituency in England and 188 in Surrey.</p>

The greatest problem is resources. Is he aware that India has found 1 billion rupees, while Her Majesty&#146;s Government have spent &#163;650 million on infrastructure projects in Iraq?

Thankfully, we have a ceasefire in hostilities and we now need to build on a political solution using humanitarian aid not only from the United Kingdom but, as has been said, from India and other quarters, and to try to rebuild a community that understands the problems that it has been through and how to avoid them in the future.</p>

It is essential that the availability of credit is increased to support lending and economic activity, and that indeed is happening. It is happening particularly for larger companies, which are being supported by the capital markets through equity raising and bonds, but also for smaller businesses. The Government have done a considerable amount in this respect to encourage the process. The lending agreements that we have with Lloyds bank and Royal Bank of Scotland commit those institutions to lending an extra &#163;14 billion and &#163;25 billion this year. HSBC has committed to lend an extra &#163;15 billion, Barclays an extra &#163;11 billion and Northern Rock up to an extra &#163;5 billion.

If he looks at the evidence, he will see it suggests that there is considerable confidence in the gilt-edged market. I now have direct responsibility within the Treasury for the Debt Management Office, a very professional unit that continues to fund our needs and requirements in an entirely practical way which is not damaging to interest rates. Therefore, we are not squeezing out the availability of funds to business and to private sector borrowers.</p>

Is he aware that in many cases the banks require from existing small business customers much higher levels of security and higher fees which, given the economic situation, those small businesses are unable to find? These businesses are therefore not able to roll over their loans. Will the Minister speak to the banks, particularly those in public ownership, and ask them to address those problems as well as the global quantum to which they are committed to lend?</p>

The total cost of borrowing to businesses has been drawn down as a consequence of much lower interest rates and the positive effects of the Bank of England&#146;s quantitative easing programme. However, we have seen a widening of margins and increasingly demanding terms around collateral and covenants which significantly reflect the fact that banks are being more prudent now and moving away from the somewhat reckless terms they offered prior to the crisis. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, cannot have it both ways. We want bankers who are not only sensible and prudent but who recognise that they need to support their customers. I and the Government are absolutely committed to ensuring that that happens so that this economy can recover as quickly as possible.</p>

Whether the gilts and bonds that are acquired under quantitative easing are acquired from domestic owners or foreign owners matters little because if it is a foreign owner the funds have to be repatriated into sterling and are available to provide reserves to the banking system and support lending activity.</p>

It strikes me that we have a whole generation who have got used to the idea that they can borrow money willy-nilly but they do not have to repay it, and this is why we have got into such financial trouble.

But this week in another place the Government said that the loans offered under the scheme totalled only &#163;230 million and we do not know how much has actually been taken up.

I think that the reduction in demand for credit is consistent with lower economic activity&#151;that is what I would expect from my business background&#151;as businesses harbour their cash resources more carefully, cut back on investment and hold less stock in ratio to sales. So I think that there is a demand feature at work. The noble Baroness, Lady Newby, also asks about the EFG scheme.</p>

The EFG scheme has already extended &#163;445 million to eligible applications from over 4,000 firms that have been granted or are being processed and assessed; 2,855 businesses have been offered loans totalling &#163;271 million. That is real help now for British business to help us get out of this economic crisis that is affecting the globe.</p>

The Government launched their second consultation paper in April, outlining their proposals for how the judgment in Hirst (No. 2) might be implemented. The consultation closes 29 September 2009, after which date the Government will consider the next steps towards implementing the judgment in legislation.</p>

Is he aware that it is now two years and three months longer than the entire duration of World War II since this issue was raised in the High Court? In view of that time, it is hardly surprising that on Friday the Committee of Ministers in the Council of Europe expressed concern at the significant delay in implementing the judgment of the European Court; condemned the United Kingdom&#146;s delay in organising voting for prisoners; warned that there was now a pressing need for action to be taken; and called on the Government of the United Kingdom swiftly to set in measures that prisoners would be able to vote in the general election predicted for the next spring. In view of that, my question to Her Majesty&#146;s Government is simple: do they have any intention of speeding up the process to ensure that those prisoners whose crimes are not such as to warrant removal of the right to vote as part of their sentence may be able to vote in the next general election?</p>

The practical issues&#151;and there are some&#151;need to be thought through and decisions taken on what criteria should apply in order to make a fair decision on whether a prisoner should be able to vote. We are currently consulting on the enfranchisement of prisoners. We have set out in the consultation paper a number of questions on the practical aspects of implementation and a range of options for prisoners&#146; enfranchisement based on sentence length. As I have said, when the second consultation is concluded, we will consider the next steps towards implementing the judgment in legislation.</p>

This, unfortunately, is a gross exception, which creates a bad example to the rest of Europe. Could the Minister expand on the answer he gave on 20 April to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, when he said that there were serious practical difficulties to the prison authorities and courts? What I do not understand&#151;perhaps he can help the House&#151;is why Ireland and Cyprus gave postal voting, and South Africa and Canada managed to do the same. Why cannot the Government introduce a remedial order, and get the judgment complied with, as the Committee of Ministers are asking should happen by Christmas?</p>

Although of course the noble Lord is right that a remedial order would technically be available by virtue of the decision made by the European Court of Human Rights, any legislation would clearly have to deal with a number of complex issues. Those are issues of principle such as where the line should be drawn on partial prisoner enfranchisement, what length of sentence should serve as the cut-off point&#151;I mentioned that earlier&#151;and how to treat classes of prisoner not subject to ordinary periods of detention. This is a matter in which the public have considerable interest anyway. Primary legislation, which Parliament will have proper time to consider, debate and amend, is much the most appropriate vehicle for this issue.</p>

<a name="09061789000069"></a><b><a name="90617-0002.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="09061789000907"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> My Lords, perhaps I should make clear the rationale of the grouping of this amendment with others. Amendment 38 deals with the possibility of an effective cap on donations in general. Amendment 39, also in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Rennard, deals with contributions from trade union funds. Then there are two extremely important amendments in the name of my noble friend Lord Goodhart&#151;he enjoys the support of Members on all sides of the House&#151;for tax relief on small donations. The rationale for the grouping is simply to make sure that we are able to shift responsibility for funding our politics from a small number of big donors&#151;millionaires&#151;and try to encourage many small contributions, with tax relief, for those who make modest donations. I know from our debate in Grand Committee that there is widespread anxiety to make this shift.</p>

<a name="90617-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09061789000070"></a>The amendment precisely follows the recommendations of the Hayden Phillips discussions and agreement, to which I shall come back in a moment, but it is absolutely fundamental to all the proposals that have been endorsed by all parties and those from no party to try to take big money out of British politics. Wealthy individuals, organisations and companies should not be able to buy influence in the way that they have in recent years. The inequality of influence generated by massive donations runs entirely counter to the democratic principle and erodes public trust. All of us in your Lordships&#146; House and, indeed, Members of the other place must be very well aware of the decline in public trust in recent years.</p>

<a name="90617-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09061789000071"></a>Since I come from something of an ecclesiastical family, I am accustomed to producing or listening to a text. Therefore, I have a few texts to use this afternoon to show the widespread support for the approach represented by these amendments. In the first place, I know that there is widespread support for a reduction in the amount of expenditure by the parties. For example, Mr Gordon Brown asked Mr David Cameron at Prime Minister&#146;s Questions in December 2007 whether he would,</p>
<ul><a name="09061789000238"></a>&#147;support a national and local limit on expenditure&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 5/12/07; col. 816.]</ul>
<p><a name="09061789000210"></a>We will come back to that point. At a policy forum in west London on 2 December 2007 Mr Brown said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09061789000239"></a>&#147;the latest problems in party funding show why it is right not to delay, and it is now time to act ... we have learned just how easily trust in our politics can be eroded ... we must now complete the work of change&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09061789000211"></a>Then the right honourable Francis Maude, speaking on behalf of the Conservatives in the other place, said in an opposition-day debate instigated by the Conservative Party on 4 December 2007:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="09061789000240"></a>&#147;We have consistently argued for comprehensive reform that would deal finally with the perception that large donors have undue influence on political parties ... Dealing with that perception requires, above all, a cap on donations&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 4/12/07; col. 704.]</p>

<p><a name="09061789000212"></a>Everyone now agrees that a cap of &#163;50,000 would accomplish that. Finally, now that the noble Lord, Lord Bates, is in his place, I should say that he was in  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1069"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1069</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>very good company, not only in his party but in other parties, when he said in the debate on Monday in your Lordships&#146; House:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="09061789000241"></a>&#147;We on this side of the House look forward to the day when big money is genuinely taken out of politics&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/6/09; col. 913.]</p>

<p><a name="09061789000213"></a>The noble Lord, with his voice and his vote this afternoon, can start that process. The day he looks forward to could indeed be today.</p>

<a name="90617-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09061789000072"></a>It is extremely important that we build on the work of the Hayden Phillips discussions. All parties took a very active role over a long period under his distinguished chairmanship. It was quite clear from his work, which he set out in great detail in his publication of the draft proposals, that he very strongly supported views that had been previously expressed by the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee in the other place in 2006. However, in Grand Committee I am sad to say that the Minister did not seem to be totally persuaded either by the Hayden Phillips discussions or by the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee because, the Minister said, he felt that a cap on donations would so clearly result in a loss of income for the larger parties&#151;I hope that I am paraphrasing reasonably well&#151;that the issue of state funding had to be reopened. That is not the case.</p>

<a name="90617-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09061789000073"></a>First and foremost, there is excessive expenditure by some of the big parties at election time. I do not absolve even the Liberal Democrats of that; occasionally when they have had money they have used it. However, the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, who has extensive experience of the advertising industry&#151;I am delighted to see him in his place&#151;pointed out to the Grand Committee that there is huge wastage, particularly on advertising, by the political parties. It does not follow that by restricting large donations to the political parties they would somehow be so inhibited from effective campaigning that they could not do their proper job. It is also why we emphasise the need to link these restrictions on the big donors with the very important initiative taken by my noble friend Lord Goodhart and others on other Benches to try to encourage smaller donations with tax relief.</p>

<a name="90617-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09061789000074"></a>I emphasise that the experience in other countries&#151;notably, what Barack Obama did in the United States&#151;should encourage this approach in Britain. Barack Obama demonstrated that it was possible to raise very considerable sums of money in the height of the recession in the United States from individuals by way of the encouragement that was given in his campaign. Those who contributed then felt that they had a real connection with his campaign and a sense of ownership. It was not just a few individuals paying the bills; it was spread throughout the states. As a result, more than $750 million was raised. A record-breaking $150 million was raised in September at a time when the country was in recession. That is a very important example.</p>

<a name="90617-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09061789000075"></a>I remind the House of the specific recommendations of the Hayden Phillips team, which were the result of a cross-party agreement. They were:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09061789000242"></a>&#147;A1 There shall be a cap on donations and loans to all political parties that reach the threshold specified at A2.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="09061789000243"></a>A2 The cap shall apply to all parties registered in Great Britain with two or more elected representatives to Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the European Parliament. It shall apply to the party, its accounting units, and regulated donees.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1070"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1070</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09061789000244"></a>A3 The final level of the cap will be &#163;50,000&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09061789000214"></a>That was the specific proposal that the parties agreed to.</p>

<a name="90617-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09061789000076"></a>I do not propose to go through all of the rationale that has been advanced for this restriction because it is well documented. I do not know of any serious argument against it. The Phillips team also relied on the work of the Constitutional Affairs Committee in the other place. I briefly refer to its recommendation on page 55, paragraph 152, of its 2006 report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09061789000245"></a>&#147;The UK currently limits expenditure but does not limit donations, while in the U.S.A, donations are capped but spending is not. Both systems lead to significant problems. In Canada, both income and expenditure are comprehensively capped and regulated, and we were convinced by the strengths and benefits of this model&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09061789000215"></a>Even in the past few days there has been very strong support among the public, demonstrated in public opinion polls, for restrictions on the huge sums of money that are donated to the political parties and, indeed, on the way in which they spend them. In the Phillips proposals the following paragraph is very significant:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09061789000246"></a>&#147;Few would now dissent from the proposition that there should be a limit on how much any one donor may contribute to a party each year. Of the parties consulted by my Review, just one &#151; UKIP &#151; does not favour this approach&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09061789000216"></a>Everyone else supports this proposal. I hope that that will be evident from the speeches from other Benches this afternoon.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90617-0003.htm"/>


<a name="90617-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09061789000077"></a>I come now to the final point in the Phillips recommendations. The summary firmly said this:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="09061789000247"></a>&#147;I believe there is an emerging consensus that: the status quo, in which there are no caps on donations, is unsustainable and therefore donations to parties should be limited; and restrictions on donations should be buttressed by measures to prevent breaches of the new regulations&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09061789000217"></a>I agree wholeheartedly with that. I hope your Lordships&#146; House will as well.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09061789000078"></a>I turn briefly to Amendment 39, which concerns the treatment of contributions from trade union political funds. Here again, there was very considerable consensus and agreement in the Hayden Phillips talks. I draw attention to the first part of our amendment, which sets out very clearly the intention of our special treatment of the trade unions. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09061789000248"></a>&#147;The limit on donations established by&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09061789000218"></a>the section referring to the &#163;50,000 cap on donations,</p>
<ul><a name="09061789000305"></a>&#147;shall apply to all expenditure out of trade union political funds unless&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09061789000219"></a>I repeat: unless&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09061789000306"></a>&#147;all the conditions of this section have been fulfilled with regard to the expenditure in question&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09061789000220"></a>There follow very careful safeguards to ensure that the democratic will of members of trade unions is fulfilled but that, in those terms, the trade union has every right effectively to act as a collecting agent for a political party, or indeed for several political parties.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09061789000079"></a>The proposals that the Hayden Phillips team looked at&#151;again, I emphasise the cross-party agreement&#151;were very carefully thought through so that they would not penalise a trade union for taking a sensible active role in British politics but would ensure that everything   


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1071"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1071</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was as transparent and democratic as it could be. Again, I draw attention in the amendment to the final point made by the Hayden Phillips team:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09061789000249"></a>&#147;Due to the increased transparency and choice for trade union members the ten-year review ballot on the existence of the political fund is no longer necessary and should be removed&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09061789000221"></a>In other words, the quid pro quo, if I may put it like that, was that trade unions, by being more transparent and more careful in relation to their own members, and by giving them more transparency and democratic rights, would not have to suffer as much bureaucracy as they do at the moment.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09061789000080"></a>I hope that with that fairly brief canter around this issue&#151;because it has been discussed at considerable length in the other place, in the Hayden Phillips discussions and in Grand Committee&#151;noble Lords will recognise that there is a quid pro quo in this group. By restricting the millionaires and the very big donors to political parties but, under the terms of my noble friend&#146;s amendments, with a tax concession for small donations, we have a deliberate switch from the big boys to the general public, and that must be in the best interests of British democracy. I beg to move.</p>

Amendments 64 and 66 are in my name, and Amendment 65, which is an amendment to Amendment 64, is in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09061789000082"></a>These amendments have been grouped with Amendments 38 and 39, which, for reasons explained by my noble friend Lord Tyler, would impose a cap on large donations. However, these two sub-groups, if I may call them that, are not dependent on each other. Tax relief on small donations can be given whether or not there is a cap on large ones, and a cap on large donations can be imposed whether or not tax relief is given for small donations. However, there is an interaction between these two sub-groups because a cap on large donations is likely to reduce party funds and, if that happens, parties will have to do more fundraising from ordinary members and supporters, as in the outstanding example of the fundraising by President Barack Obama during his campaign last autumn. Tax relief on small donations will also help to achieve more fundraising from ordinary members.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09061789000083"></a>The idea of giving tax relief on small or moderate donations has had considerable support in the United Kingdom and has been adopted in a number of foreign countries. Tax relief on modest donations was recommended by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, of which I was then a member, in its report on party-political funding published in 1998. In that report, the committee proposed an upper limit for tax relief of &#163;500. I have kept to that figure in this amendment, in spite of the time that has passed. I am glad to say that two other members of that committee are present: the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, who was then a member and certainly, with me, was an active supporter of the proposal to allow tax relief, and the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, who was the chairman of the committee at that time.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1072"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1072</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90617-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09061789000084"></a>Giving tax relief on modest donations has many advantages. It is highly undesirable that all funds should come from the Government, as that greatly reduces the need to recruit members and discourages greater contact with voters. However, it is even worse if party funding comes mainly from a small number of rich donors making large donations. That is a travesty of democracy and enables rich donors to have far too much control over party policy. It is important to encourage parties by giving tax relief for small or moderate donations, including membership subscriptions. We recognise that giving to charities should be encouraged by tax relief to donors. We believe that tax relief could be extended to donations to political parties, as those donations are also very much in the public interest and deserve tax relief.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09061789000085"></a>Tax relief has been given on inheritance tax in this context since the Inheritance Tax Act 1984&#151;25 years ago&#151;which exempted donations by will for the political parties that won at least two seats at the previous general election or one seat and at least 150,000 votes in total. Relief from inheritance tax should surely be extended to income tax. The obvious method would be to use a version of the Gift Aid system.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09061789000086"></a>I suggest, first, that the eligibility of a party to claim benefit of tax relief should be the same as that now for inheritance tax; that is, two seats at the last general election or one seat and at least 150,000 votes. Secondly, tax relief should be limited to the first &#163;500 of donations made in any one tax year by any one donor. Thirdly, whereas a charity donor can rightly reclaim a higher rate of tax relief on the amount of Gift Aid donations, donors to political parties should not be able to do so, to avoid putting the relatively well-to-do donors in a better position. Fourthly, tax relief should be given only for gifts by individuals.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09061789000087"></a>All those conditions are set out in Amendment 64. They produce a simple and workable system, which in Grand Committee was supported by Members from all three parties. The Electoral Commission has said in its briefing for this Report stage:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="09061789000250"></a>&#147;In principle the Commission welcomes measures that incentivise public engagement in politics and help parties to campaign effectively. Proposals for fiscal incentives are for Parliament to consider in the light of other priorities&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09061789000222"></a>The &#147;other priorities&#148; are the rub now. I recognise that we are in a difficult tax situation. I was asked in Grand Committee for an estimate of the amount of money that would need to be returned by the Government every year under the scheme. It is impossible to tell, but my guess put an upper limit at &#163;5 million. Since the original version had cut off at &#163;1,000 rather than &#163;500 and, more importantly perhaps, since recent events must have decreased the willingness of members of the public to contribute to political parties, the present prospective upper limit is probably something less than &#163;4 million.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09061789000223"></a>I understand the problem, but if the Government are not willing to pay that small sum in the near future, I suggest two alternatives. The first would be to accept Amendments 64 and 66 but to withhold the commencement order for that new clause and schedule until the financial situation makes this easier. The other would be to accept Amendment 65 from the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, which is an  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1073"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1073</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>amendment to my Amendment 64 and would reduce the cut-off point from &#163;500 to &#163;15 a year. I do not in principle welcome Amendment 65, because it would produce too little money, but if the Government were prepared to accept it, but not to accept the unamended format of my Amendment 64, I would say that a quarter of a loaf is better than no bread. In those circumstances, although not in others, I would accept the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09061789000088"></a>Amendments 64 and 66 provide a simple system for the waiver of taxation on modest donations by individuals to recognise political parties. That is a good thing in its own right, and even more so if supplies of money to political parties are cut back by the capping of large donations. I invite your Lordships&#146; House to support Amendments 64 and 66.</p>

<a name="09061789000089"></a><b><a name="90617-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09061789000909"></a>Lord Neill of Bladen:</b> My Lords, I speak in support of Amendment 64. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, pointed out, I was chairman of the committee that recommended to Parliament that tax relief should be allowed on donations up to the sum of &#163;500. In reply to something that I said on Monday, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said that in nearly every case the Government of the day accepted the committee&#146;s recommendations. On Monday, there was one example when they did not do so; here is a second example where they did not accept the recommendation in the 2000 Act. Further thought should be given to it today. One proposal that is occasionally raised but is now impossible is that funding should come directly from the state to the political parties. As a saleable proposition to the general public, that is now impossible, although it was always very unattractive.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09061789000090"></a>The proposal in Amendment 64 is a way to encourage people to perform what is a useful function of supporting political parties with their money. It does not go very far and will not cost very much and is something which, in the present climate, ought to be welcomed.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09061789000091"></a>I say one final word. If the amendments are pressed to a Division, I hope that we will be able to find a way to divorce that proposal from the cap. That would be desirable. I see the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, nodding his head. Perhaps we could, when we get to that point, have a Division on the question of whether tax relief should be allowed on either the &#163;500 figure or the &#163;15 limit proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, and not have it confused with what is in principle a wholly different issue: the capping at &#163;50,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09061789000094"></a>I can never understand why there is such a fuss about having a cap. It seems to me that either we have parties funded by the state&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Neill, said, that is now, fortunately, impossible&#151;or we have them funded by people who support them. If people support their party, I cannot see why there should be limits on the amount by which they support it. It would therefore be a great mistake if we tried to cut down the support given, whether to the Labour Party or to the Conservative Party&#151;or even if the Liberals can find a bit here or there. It would be a pity to cut the limit, because all that means is that everyone has to go chasing around finding more money elsewhere or, alternatively, running into deficit.</p>

If you put state funding directly to the British people, as against a system that in part almost invites corruption, I know on which side the public would come down. The problem with the argument about state funding is that we have never really set out the reasons why those of us who support it so passionately do so. We believe that it is a far more honest way of funding political parties and that it avoids all the difficulties that we have had over not just this recent period but the last 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09061789000096"></a>My Amendment 65 is a probing amendment and I can assure my noble friends that I do not intend to push it to a vote. However, I would like to say this: Amendment 29 dovetails very neatly with this amendment. That is because the truth is, and we all know it, that political parties will be affected by what has happened over Amendment 29. Political parties will inevitably have to find different ways of raising revenue. The principle behind these amendments is that a covenanting tax-relief system would provide an alternative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09061789000097"></a>My problem with the amendments moved from the Liberal Democrat Benches is the cost. That was the concern that I expressed in Committee. If I remember rightly, the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, had, throughout the period of the Thatcher Administration, an important position in government&#151;certainly in the Treasury in the years when I was in the Commons. In Committee, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="09061789000251"></a>&#147;I will be arguing that every proposal for tax relief or for further state funding should be looked at extraordinarily carefully and be very well justified. Given the state of the public finances today, I would not put forward such a case ... I hope that, in more propitious times, we can address this again in preference to further state funding. It is the right way to proceed&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/5/09; col. GC 222.]</p>

<p><a name="09061789000098"></a>I agree with that sentiment. It is the way forward, but the problem is that we are in difficult financial conditions and I have great reservations about an amendment that would oblige the Treasury to stump up a substantial amount of cash.</p>

I imagine a system&#151;in the more propitious times to which the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, referred&#151;where, annually, either some inflationary measure is applied to it or the threshold is raised.

However, if the amendment were to be carried, it would be possible during Commons consideration of Lords amendments for the Government to introduce a more appropriate sum&#151;a sum that could be afforded. I simply wonder whether that might be in the mind of Ministers if they have to reject this amendment today. If it is rejected today, I can say to my noble friends that I will be lobbying fairly extensively over the next few days, prior to Third Reading, for perhaps some concession to be made by the Government. I hope that we do not simply say no out of hand and reject this for all time; I hope that we can perhaps see a little flexibility in the response from the Dispatch Box by my noble friend.</p>

No one disputes the need for realistic budgets, but the siren voices of advertising and marketing men should be firmly resisted. Nothing disconnects the electorate from the electoral process more than huge sums of money, hitherto camouflaged in some cases, being dispensed in this way, together with the unwillingness of politicians of every party to embrace the idea that the electors themselves should be asked to make very modest contributions to the electoral process.</p>

What I think we are really trying to do today is take advantage of the Bill, which gives us the opportunity to establish the principle. My one difficulty with his amendment is that he refers to &#163;15 as the limit in 2010-11. Frankly, no one will take it up at that level. The administration would be very high, and if it seemed not to work it might be regarded as a policy that was not worth while. That is my difficulty with the figure. However, if we agree on the principle in the House today, there is still an opportunity to try to get it into legislation and to work out the timetable for it.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09061789000106"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in his usual exemplary fashion, gave all the reasons for accepting this proposal, so I shall emphasise just two points. The first relates to party funding. In my earlier years in politics, very many people in our constituencies spent a great deal of time not only actively campaigning but actively raising funds for party political work. That was hugely to the benefit of the democratic process. So much came from these small donations and fundraising activities, and it was entirely healthy. It spread interest in the democratic process, and spread political engagement much more widely.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09061789000107"></a>Equally, it is unhealthy to be too reliant on large personal donations; on substantial corporate funding, although that is largely diminished now if not defunct altogether; trade union support; and, above all, on state funding, which requires no activity beyond winning votes to get it. The principle here is therefore highly desirable and is a way of re-encouraging small donations. The emphasis is on small donations, which cannot be abused by large donors getting tax relief for them. We recommended the limit of &#163;500 in 1998, so in principle I would be in favour of indexing beyond the &#163;500 limit. The point that has been made about President Obama&#146;s success in the American presidential elections is very clearly correct, too. This is an important way of encouraging wider participation in the political process.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09061789000108"></a>I shall put my second point, which goes much wider, very concisely. When I first entered public life and got involved in politics almost 50 years ago, and entered Parliament 35 years ago, it was a profession held in high regard. MPs were regarded with great respect in their constituencies and more widely, and it was a high aspiration to become an MP. Many in other careers entered Parliament half way through their active life because they felt that it was very worth while and were prepared to make sacrifices, including that of family life and financially, to do so. It is a matter of profound distress to me that parliamentary activity and the role of an MP are regarded in the way that they are today.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09061789000109"></a>I believe that nothing is more important than working for your constituents in the most important institution in the land. Above all, it is important to remember that Ministers are largely drawn from this pool. They make bigger and more profound decisions than others in leading positions in most walks of life. Yet those who aspire to these roles are being demeaned in public and, in my view, are seriously underpaid compared to those in leading positions in business, the professions and most other activities. My concern is not for the  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1077"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1077</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>good people in public life who are currently being so derided, but, above all, given the current environment, for the good people from other professions who would have a real role to play and could enter politics. That is one of the most serious things facing our nation. It will be easy enough perhaps to get people to stand, but it will be extremely difficult to get people of the quality we want in Parliament.</p>

<a name="90617-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09061789000110"></a>I believe that this proposal plays some small part in dealing with that problem. Charitable activities are regarded as worth while and therefore attract relief. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, there is an interesting analogy with inheritance tax where this concept is accepted; yet we are not prepared to extend it to income tax. Therefore, I also take the point made by, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, in Committee. Many charities are engaged almost in political activity for which they get tax relief, but those who are primarily involved in the activity and want to support it get no tax relief at all. Taking this principle today, if not the immediate implementation, sends a message of profound importance, which is why I so strongly support it.</p>

I should like to make one or two points on Amendment 39, and I speak as someone who has been a trade union official for most of my life. I understand the desire to ensure that there is proper democratic accountability for the use of funds and so on. However, there is already in place a fair amount of legislation designed to ensure just that. There are arrangements under which members can contract out of the obligation to pay the political levy at any time they wish to do so. The political funds are normally quite separate. The executive have to be accountable to the membership for their use of them. In my union and, I believe, in all unions, there is a section in the rule book which governs the way in which political funds are collected and administered. People can also complain to the registration officer.</p>

Suffice it to say that, for me, more supporters, more members and more donors in all political parties are good for our democracy because that achieves a broader base of support and involvement. Fewer, larger donors carry dangers for our democracy. I say &#147;carry&#148; dangers rather than necessarily have

The obvious question is the influence of wealthy donors on the policies of a party, and here I touch on the point made by my noble friend Lord Ferrers: it is not just whether they do or they do not have an influence, but whether there is a public suspicion that they might. Public suspicion is highly corrosive, because it carries the seeds of destruction of belief in the system and the way it operates. That is why the argument that the liberty of a person to give any amount to a party, which underlay his comments earlier, does not hold water in this sensitive area.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09061789000115"></a>This idea poses challenges for the two major parties. Historically, my party has benefited from large donors, although in recent years the Labour Party has largely caught up; whether that has been to its advantage is not for me to say. The Labour Party also benefits from the automatic nature of the political levy of the trades unions. I say to the noble Baroness that I am afraid there is too much anecdotal evidence of the way in which the donations are shuffled through without individual trades union members having a real say, and that knocks on the head the idea that the safeguards proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, are not required.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09061789000116"></a>I do not underestimate the challenges that these issues represent and the controversy that they will arouse, but surely, in the present circumstances, we need to face them. As has been said in the debate today, as was said on Monday, and as was said in Committee, there is a crisis of loss of faith in our democratic system. It is no good us wringing our hands and saying that it is all too difficult. That is the response of people who live inside the Westminster bubble, and I believe that our fellow citizens demand more of us today.</p>

I was finding my way through the crowd as he rose to move the amendment.

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09061789000118"></a>The series of amendments we are discussing fall into two principal areas. One is the argument about donations. We discussed this at length in Committee and it was quite widely recognised that there is an anomaly in party political contributions, which do contribute towards the democratic health of our country. Indeed, the point was just made that if one is concerned about the environment and chooses to make a donation to a political party, that money is not eligible for tax relief. If someone chooses to make a donation to Greenpeace or another organisation, it is. That is a clear anomaly which needs to be addressed at some stage, although I stress the point that it should be considered at some stage. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said that the cost of such a measure to the Exchequer would be around &#163;4 million. I have no way of knowing whether the figure should be higher or lower, but my sense of the public mood at this time suggests that it would be difficult to argue in favour of an additional &#163;4 million or &#163;5 million of public funding being made available for political parties. While certainly we on

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09061789000119"></a>Whether we should act on the suggestion in the probing amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, that it should be bumped into another fiscal year would depend on the circumstances at the time. However, in this case the position of these Benches&#151;certainly of the Front Bench&#151;is to support it in principle but to question the timing.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09061789000120"></a>This leads me to the wider issue of the donations cap. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, was generous in his citations of my remarks on the first day of Report when I referred to the importance of taking big money and the significant influence that it has out of politics. I take the points that have been presented with such clarity by my noble friend Lord Hodgson in this regard. However, whether we are talking about perceived or actual influence, it is how the public perceive the political process that is important.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09061789000121"></a>The Liberal Democrats, of course, have their own problems with major donors. Michael Brown, who donated &#163;2.5 million, has turned out to be a convicted fraudster and yet they refuse to repay that money. It is important in debates of this nature to recognise that this is a problem for party politics which needs to be sorted out. It is not only a problem for the two main political parties; it affects all political parties.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09061789000122"></a>This was touched upon by Sir Hayden Phillips in his first report, <I>Strengthening Democracy: Fair and Sustainable Funding of Political Parties&#151;The Review of the Funding of Political Parties&#151;March 2007</I>, which was in many ways the forerunner of the Hayden Phillips process. He set out a principle which is worth repeating at this stage. He said that his principle would be that nothing should be agreed until everything is agreed. It is an interesting point. He recognised the complexity of the number of different moving parts necessary to restore confidence in public life. Whether it refers to major donations or to some of the other issues touched on in another place concerning constitutional reform, there is something holistic about the need to tackle the whole issue in the round.</p>

However, good legislation has overarching principles that should be followed through in the process of getting everyone to the table in order to reach some agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09061789000126"></a>That leads me to a key point on the donations cap. There is a certain unstated element&#151;I shall say no more than that&#151;on which I hope the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, might comment. I should be grateful for some clarity lest I inadvertently cast some aspersion on the motives here. There is an implication of a donations cap, as envisaged by the Hayden Phillips review. To plug the gap, there would be an introduction of public funding. The noble Lord is shaking his head, so I will be happy to take that away. However, the White Paper, <I>Party Finance and Expenditure in the United Kingdom</I>, says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="09061789000252"></a>&#147;The public funding schemes he proposed&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09061789000224"></a>that is, Sir Hayden Phillips&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09061789000307"></a>&#147;based on a donations cap of &#163;50,000, would have an overall cost of around &#163;20-&#163;25m per year&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09061789000225"></a>Four million pounds here, &#163;20 million to &#163;25 million there&#151;we are beginning to build up to some significant sums of money. That comes on top of a concern that some people may be seeking tactical advantage, rather than a principled point of seeing a decline in income or a concern over future income streams, and hoping to replace it with public funding as a whole.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09061789000127"></a>When we talk about party funding, in many ways the arms race has been triggered by a dramatic increase in the amount of funding that is available to Members of Parliament in their constituencies&#151;the incumbency factor. When I was serving in the other place, the office cost allowance, as it was called then, was in the region of &#163;30,000. It was effectively enough to have an assistant, perhaps a part-time caseworker in the constituency, and then to pay for your printing, postage and telephones. Now that figure is up to &#163;90,000 just for staff, and there is an additional element, the incidental expenses provision, which is another &#163;21,000.</p>

Over the lifetime of a Parliament, that builds up to &#163;50,000 spent in a particular constituency on promoting the case of the incumbent Member. It is therefore not surprising that the non-governing party, the non-incumbent, would seek to raise funds to try to match the firepower that has been ranged against it in a democratic process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09061789000131"></a>The interparty talks were an important part of the process and all parties have engaged in them. The argument was that if we were going to have meaningful reform, all the political parties needed to get around the table, have their heads metaphorically banged together and sort this out, realising that there is a problem. The trade unions are perceived to have an influence on the Government. It causes concern from time to time when you see questions in debates about public sector funding cuts, and then you have a party

The fact that three out of every four pounds that the Labour Party receives is from the trade unions has a disproportionate influence on the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09061789000132"></a>I listened carefully to the expertise in the House regarding how trade union membership works. One of our principal disagreements about the proposed amendment on the donation cap, apart from the implications for public funding, is that it says that a member should be afforded an opportunity during the 12 months following the relevant expenditure to be exempted from contributing to the political fund of the union. Our party believes that it needs to go further. There ought to be an opportunity for an individual member to indicate whether they consent to having their fund given to a political party. In most cases such funding goes to the Labour Party, but I believe that the Liberal Democrats also get funding from UNISON. If this is a political levy, individual members of the union should have the right to express their preference regarding which political party it ought to go to. They should be able to do so by opting in to the political fund, rather than having it assumed and having to go through the process of contracting out.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09061789000133"></a>The last meeting of the inter-party talks on the funding of political parties, chaired by Sir Hayden Phillips, took place on 31 October 2007. It was suggested that these had somehow broken down and been brought to an undue end because of the Conservative Party&#146;s attitude to funding. That is not the case, as the minutes show. On the second of the three pages of the minutes of the final meeting held on 31 October 2007, Sir Hayden Phillips said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="09061789000253"></a>&#147;As far as trade union affiliation fees the Conservative Party argued that the changes on affiliation fees contained in the draft agreement would only take people to where they believed the situation was at the current time regarding individual choice. Their view was that individual trade unionists should be able to make clearly voluntary donations to any party of the individual&#146;s choice. They hoped the Labour Party would be willing to continue the Talks on the basis of further proposals which could be developed&#148;</p>

<p><a name="09061789000134"></a>on this point. He continued:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="09061789000254"></a>&#147;The Conservative Party saw no necessity for further controls on party spending, but would continue to discuss them as part of a package&#148;</p>

<p><a name="09061789000226"></a>of reforms. This is Sir Hayden&#146;s concluding point in the final meeting. It is worth getting on the record because the point of breakdown in the inter-party talks is something that has been discussed quite often. On page 3 of the minutes of the same meeting, Sir Hayden said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09061789000308"></a>&#147;if the other two parties were willing to accept the Conservatives&#146; proposals made in this meeting as the basis for further work, then it would be worthwhile asking the Secretariat to prepare further papers. Third, if there was no realistic prospect of an agreement at the present time on either basis, then the Talks should be suspended&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90617-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09061789000135"></a>That is the final entry in the minutes because talks were suspended. It shows that there was clearly a breakdown in the inter-party talks on this central issue. I return to that principle to say that a holistic

I do not think that the public have the stomach for the significant increases that would be the consequence of the amendment being agreed. On the public funding of political parties, the need is very much for the inter-party talks to be reconvened to reintroduce and put everything on the table, including the developments that occurred before that time.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09061789000136"></a>This is a wide-ranging group of amendments and I apologise for taking so long to speak to them. However, they are very significant in terms of people&#146;s future confidence in democracy. The amendment before us does not go nearly far enough; we need to go further. The cross-party talks need to be in place and there needs to be a holistic approach which embraces all these issues and recognises public attitudes and timing as regards current economic conditions.</p>

I hope that they will forgive me if I do not respond in detail to each point, but I shall touch on all the fundamental points that have been raised. However, there will be a couple of exceptions. I shall not respond to the very interesting speech of the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, about our political life apart from commenting on what he said about donations. I am sure that part of his speech will resonate in many quarters. I hope that that debate continues and reaches a proper conclusion in the interests of the health of our democracy. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Bates, will forgive me as I cannot possibly touch on all the detail of his speech as I am cognisant of our objective to complete Report stage today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09061789000138"></a>This group of amendments relates to the establishment of a cap on donations, treatment of contributions under that cap and a system of tax relief for donations. Amendment 38 would establish a cap of &#163;50,000 per year on the amount that an individual or organisation could donate to a registered political party. Contributions from trade union political funds would be subject to this cap unless they adhered to the conditions set out in Amendment 39. These conditions seek to create a clear link between the amount paid in individual contributions to a union&#146;s political fund, by way of affiliation fees, and the amount of any subsequent donation made by the union.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09061789000139"></a>The Bill is the result of a painstaking search for consensus between the parties. The Government&#146;s overriding priority throughout has been to ensure broad cross-party agreement to the changes that the Bill will make. It simply would not be acceptable to make far-reaching changes to legislation in this area without such agreement. The amendments before us today are identical to amendments that have already been debated both in Grand Committee and the other place. On each occasion they have failed to command support across the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09061789000140"></a>When Amendment 38 was put to a vote in the other place it did not receive support from either the Conservative Party or the Labour Party. When Amendments 38 and 39 were debated in Grand Committee, they again failed to find cross-party support. And, as we have heard in the debate today,  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1083"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1083</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the proposals contained in the amendments are simply not broadly supported in your Lordships&#146; House. I shall briefly set out again why they are not supported by the Government.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09061789000141"></a>The idea of a cap on donations is not a new one. Two recent major reports on party funding&#151;the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee report of 2006 and the Sir Hayden Phillips review of 2007&#151;both recommended that a cap should be instituted. The noble Lord may claim, as he did in Grand Committee and has again today, that his amendments &#147;absolutely follow&#148; what was put to the parties by Sir Hayden in the cross-party talks that followed the publication of his report. In fact, Sir Hayden proposed that a cap should be phased in gradually, beginning initially at a level of &#163;500,000 and reaching the level of &#163;50,000 only after a period of four years.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09061789000142"></a>The noble Lord must also be aware that both the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee and Sir Hayden were explicit that a donation cap could be introduced only alongside an increase in state funding. In considering the effects of the package of measures he proposed, Sir Hayden said they,</p>
<ul><a name="09061789000309"></a>&#147;would impose significant restrictions on the parties&#146; freedom to raise their own funds, and new obligations in terms of compliance and reporting. These measures are in the public interest, and it is fair and reasonable to use public funds to help offset their financial impact&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09061789000227"></a>Sir Hayden was also quite clear that his recommendations on party funding needed to be considered as a whole package. So if the noble Lord wishes to pray in aid Sir Hayden&#146;s review for his amendments, he must acknowledge that he is also arguing for an increase in the level of state funding of politics. The increase would be significant. The Government&#146;s White Paper, <I>Party </I><I>F</I><I>inance and </I><I>E</I><I>xpenditure in the United Kingdom</I>, calculated that a cap of &#163;50,000 would result in a reduction of income of &#163;5 million to &#163;6 million each year for the two largest parties.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09061789000143"></a>The Government&#146;s view on this matter is clear. We do not consider that an increase in the level of public funding, particularly of the magnitude that would be required to offset the imposition of a donation cap, is acceptable to either the political parties or the public. Public support for politicians and political parties could scarcely be lower than it is currently. It would defy all logic to test taxpayers&#146; patience even further by asking them to contribute more money to the parties. Noble Lords may argue that any increase in state funding should be made only as a result of reductions in government spending in other areas; however, we still think it highly unlikely that the public would support the general principle of an increase in the state funding of politics.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09061789000144"></a>Amendment 39 relates to how union contributions would be treated under the donation cap. It could not be agreed unless amendment 38 was accepted. The funding activities of trade unions are already very tightly regulated as a result of successive Acts passed during the 1980s and 1990s. In its 1998 report, the Committee on Standards in Public Life considered trade union political funds. It concluded:</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1084"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1084</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="09061789000255"></a>&#147;We have received no evidence to suggest that the legislation is not working satisfactorily, and no case has been made out for any reform. We do not propose any change in the law in this respect&#148;.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09061789000145"></a>The Government agree with that conclusion. However, the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and other noble Lords have today again raised concerns about the funding activities of unions. Perhaps I may put on the record, once again, the words of my right honourable friend the Minister of State in the debate on Second Reading in the other place. He noted that affiliated unions recently wrote to the Labour Party general secretary,</p>
<ul><a name="09061789000310"></a>&#147;to confirm that they will voluntarily provide more information to members about the collection and use of political funds and the individual member&#146;s right to opt out, and that the affiliates will introduce a common text for incorporation into membership materials, including application forms. In addition, the affiliates agreed that full affiliation of the levy-paying membership is the most transparent form of political membership, and moves will be made to that end&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/10/08; col. 120.]</ul>
<a name="90617-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09061789000146"></a>The Government consider that transparency in party finance is the key requirement. A cap on donations could increase the incentive to divert donations through other routes and could therefore have the ultimate effect of decreasing transparency. As I have set out, it would require a significant and unjustifiable increase in the state funding of politics. For those reasons, we are not minded to support its introduction and I hope the noble Lord will agree not to press the amendment.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09061789000147"></a>I turn now to Amendments 64 to 66. Amendments 64 and 66 would introduce a system of tax relief on donations to political parties. This would be along similar lines to the system of gift aid already in place for contributions to charities, albeit with certain key differences. They would perhaps be intended to compensate parties for the shortfall of income that might result from the imposition of the cap proposed in Amendment 38. The amount available to political parties under the system proposed in Amendment 64 would be capped at &#163;500 per donor per year and would be limited only to basic rate income tax. In order to qualify to receive relief, a political party would have to have at least two MPs elected to the House of Commons at the preceding general election. </p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09061789000148"></a>These amendments were considered in Grand Committee and were well supported by noble Lords from all three main parties, although I note that of the main parties&#146; Front Benches only the Liberal Democrats spoke in favour of the amendments. My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours spoke in favour of the amendments but suggested that the amount of relief available should, initially at least, be capped at &#163;15 per donor per year, with the Government able to increase that amount by order in subsequent years. This is formally proposed in Amendment 65.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09061789000149"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, set out, a system of tax relief for political donations was first recommended by the Committee on Standards in Public Life in its landmark 1998 report on the funding of political parties in the United Kingdom, often referred to as the Neill report after the committee&#146;s chairman at the time, the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen. The Government at the time accepted the vast majority of the Neill report&#146;s recommendations in  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1085"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1085</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Bill that went on to become the Political Parties,Elections and Referendums Act 2000. However, we did not accept the recommendation to introduce tax relief and continue to oppose its introduction now.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09061789000150"></a>The Neill report set out a number of arguments in favour of introducing tax relief, some of which were repeated in Grand Committee and again today. The chief argument of principle advanced in the report is that it is more democratic and in the public interest for political parties to be funded by a large number of small donations than a small number of large donations. The report considered that, by introducing tax relief, parties would be encouraged to make greater efforts to obtain smaller donations.</p>

<a name="90617-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09061789000151"></a>The Government entirely support the principle that it is preferable for parties to develop a broad base of support. However, that does not necessarily mean that the public purse should be employed to support that end. Parties are free to conduct their fundraising activities within the legislative framework. There are many steps that they could take to encourage a wider base of donors which would not require what effectively amounts to an increase in state funding of politics.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09061789000152"></a>Noble Lords may argue that there is a distinction to be made between state funding and what is proposed in the amendments, in that the money would not come directly from the state, as the allocation and amount of relief would depend on the choice made by individuals. That may be so, but the end result would still be an increase in the money diverted from public funds to support political parties. As I have already set out, at present, when politicians and political parties are held in particularly low esteem by the public, we do not consider that there is any public appetite for increasing the money paid out by the state to support political parties.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09061789000153"></a>We must also consider the cost of any such scheme. Under current legislation, donations below &#163;200 are not recorded, so it cannot be known how many donations would be affected by the measure and what it would cost. However, the Neill report recommended tax relief on donations of up to &#163;500 per year. In their response to that report, the Government estimated that the loss of revenue as a result would be some &#163;4 million to &#163;5 million per year. The Government do not consider that such an increase in the amount of state subsidy of politics is currently justified. Noble Lords may argue that, relative to total government spending, this would still be a small amount. The public perception, however, would be unlikely to take that argument into account, and would instead focus on the principle and the headline figure.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09061789000154"></a>My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours has proposed in Amendment 65 that the amount of relief available should be set at a very low level, such that the cost to the public purse is low but that the principle of tax relief on political donations would nevertheless be established in legislation. As I set out, the Government do not agree that any increase in state subsidy of politics is acceptable to the public in present circumstances. In any case, any system of tax relief would be expensive for both political parties and HMRC to administer.

The report said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="09061789000256"></a>&#147;The cost of obtaining the signature by donors of the necessary forms, and the cost of keeping the necessary records will impose an administrative burden on political parties which means that, below some level, it will become uneconomic to claim tax relief on a donation&#148;.</p>

He went on to say that there were any number of opportunities available to parties so to broaden their membership. For his position to remain reasonable in rejecting the amendments, can he say what kind of ideas the Government have in mind for broadening membership at this stage?</p>

Indeed, if the Government and my party had any particularly bright ideas, we would be keeping them to ourselves for as long as we could.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09061789000157"></a>If we set the level of relief as low as my noble friend suggests, the administrative burden involved could all but cancel out the benefit of the relief. There is a further concern with my noble friend&#146;s suggestion. Once the principle of relief is established in legislation, there would be little to stop future Governments increasing the sums involved, perhaps exponentially. It would be poor legislative practice to allow for such a possibility.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09061789000158"></a>Noble Lords might argue that state funding of politics already exists in the form of Short money, Cranborne money, policy development grants and free postage at elections; so the principle is already well established. However, that money is provided with a specific purpose or political activity in mind. By contrast, tax relief on donations would amount to a broad subsidy on a political party&#146;s general activity. The amendments do not propose any restriction on the purpose for which the relief income could be used. There is a risk that under the amendments a political party would receive income which could be spent for non-political purposes. This danger was acknowledged by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, when we first considered these matters in Grand Committee. The amendment before us does nothing to allay these fears, however.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09061789000159"></a>As has been noted, inheritance tax relief is currently provided on bequests to political parties. Noble Lords have argued that this suggests that the principle should be extended to income tax. I can only repeat what I said in Grand Committee. We are not in favour of extending this anomaly any further.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09061789000160"></a>If carried and enacted, these amendments could effectively place political parties on an equal footing with charities. The Government do not agree that the two should be regarded as analogous. Charities can and do undertake campaigning activities, but only in the context of supporting the delivery of their charitable purpose. Guidance for charities is quite clear on the matter. In order to be a charity, an organisation must  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1087"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1087</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be established only for charitable purposes that are for the public benefit. An organisation will not be charitable if its purposes are political. Campaigning activity can be legitimate but it must not be the continuing and sole activity of the charity. There is thus a clear difference between the campaigning activities of a charity and those of a political party. The provision of gift aid to charities does not imply that it should be provided to political parties. The Government do not support these amendments, and I hope that&#151;</p>

I am bound to say&#151;I ask him to comment&#151;that he appears to be endeavouring to support the view that political parties are unworthy objects of finance by members of the public. He seems to be prepared to accept a specious argument that because of some misbehaviour by a handful of politicians the whole basis of our democratic system&#151;which is political parties&#151;should be penalised. In fact, he seems to be kow-towing to the most prejudiced views about our democracy. If he does not recognise the absolutely essential part of political parties, not only in campaigning but in developing policy for Governments, he is failing to do the task for which the public are paying him.</p>

I am drawing a clear distinction. There is a more or less universal consensus in the United Kingdom that charities are special; that they should have a peculiar position in our tax regime; that their activities should be carefully regulated by an Act that was passed relatively recently, after extensive debate in both Houses, which in particular stuck on the point that a charity should not be solely for the purpose of campaigning. I draw a distinction between political parties and charities. That is widely done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09061789000163"></a>We are kidding ourselves if we think that the public out there are not at this moment asking themselves what political parties do and how they behave. Sadly&#151;I entirely take the point of it being sad&#151;the public do not hold political parties in the same regard and respect as they do the generality of charities. That is the basis on which I hope noble Lords will withdraw their amendments.</p>

It has been a most useful debate. I am very grateful for the support that has been expressed, not necessarily to the whole package that is represented in this group, but, in differing degrees, to important parts of the package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09061789000165"></a>The speeches from the Minister and from the Conservative Back Bench reminded me that, whenever I look at the patron saints in the Central Lobby up on those murals, I think that we should replace them all with a mural of St Augustine, who, Members of your Lordships&#146; House will recall, said, &#147;Lord, make me virtuous&#151;but not yet&#148;. Everybody who has opposed&#151;very few have opposed&#151;the proposals in the amendments seems to be in favour of them, but not yet.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09061789000166"></a>I am particularly struck by those who think that somehow or other it is perfectly appropriate for the dead to make contributions to political parties through the tax system, but somehow those of us who are alive are not able to do so. That is an extraordinary anomaly, to which my noble friend Lord Goodhart has referred. It is also ridiculous to suggest that those charities that make a virtue of their campaigning in political matters&#151;small &#147;p&#148;; they are not supporting political parties&#151;are given full tax concessions from all donations, and yet political parties are somehow thought to be second rate.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09061789000167"></a>I would resist absolutely the suggestions that somehow or other this is the thin end of the wedge for an increase in state funding. I must say in passing that the Conservative Party is of course the biggest recipient of state funding. The leader of the Conservative Party in the other place, in this place and a number of offices of the Conservative Party receive state funding in a way that no other group does, not even the government party. Let us not fool ourselves that somehow state funding is a problem.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09061789000168"></a>It is, however, absolutely true that this particular set of amendments is not linked to state funding, except in this respect. As my noble friend said, the estimate is that, if there was the tax concession regime that he postulates, something between &#163;3 million and &#163;4 million might be the annual cost. I remind your Lordships&#146; House that the current advertising budget of this Government is &#163;300 million a year. This small sum, this little concession, is something in the region of 1 per cent or possibly 1.5 per cent. A lot of that funding for advertising is very close to party political persuasion. It comes a long way away from simply advertising what the Government are doing. It very often advertises what the Government wish to do.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09061789000169"></a>There is a point about the trades unions. I entirely understand the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner. I must direct her attention, however, to what the Prime Minister&#151;not some Minister in some debate, but the Prime Minister&#151;said on 4 December 2007:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="09061789000257"></a>&#147;I have told the trades union movement that we have got to make the changes in the political levy so that it is more transparent as well&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09061789000228"></a>That is why the very careful safeguards set out in the review by Sir Hayden Phillips, which are endorsed in Amendment 39, are very appropriate.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09061789000170"></a>The Minister constantly&#151;at Second Reading, in Grand Committee and again this afternoon&#151;refers to the need for consensus. In Grand Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, quite rightly pooh-poohed the need for consensus. Consensus means that you move as slow as the slowest movers, which, in this respect, happen to be some of the most retrograde in the Conservative Party. In that regard, I very much appreciate the support this afternoon from the Conservative Back Benches. Here, I think that they are being realistic, and indeed the Cross-Benchers recognise that something has to be done. I am afraid that a major factor in the reduced respect that the public now have for parliamentary institutions&#151;the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, made a very passionate reference to this&#151;is that they think that big money buys influence. That thread went right through the cross-party agreement  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1089"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1089</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the talks convened by Sir Hayden Phillips, and I believe that it has been the background to all the contributions from all sides of the House this afternoon, with the disappointing exception of the Conservative Front Bench and the Minister.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09061789000171"></a>It is a ludicrous Aunt Sally to say that allowing a small tax concession in the form suggested by my noble friend, with widespread support across the House, would somehow cause even more concern and angst among the public. I do not believe that. In fact, it would give the public the opportunity to put their money where their mouth is&#151;in a small way, admittedly&#151;but it would not increase state funding hugely. If members of the Conservative Party are so anxious about state funding, let them give it up. That is an obvious way in which they can make a contribution to the Exchequer. At present, in the course of a Parliament the Conservative Party receives in the region of &#163;25 million to &#163;30 million of taxpayers&#146; money, most of which is not available to any other party.</p>

<a name="90617-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09061789000172"></a>We have had a very useful debate this afternoon and there has been widespread support for the changes that we would make. I remind your Lordships that it is a very simple quid pro quo&#151;a restriction on very large donations and, in return, the encouragement of small donations through the tax system. I believe that that is a very appropriate stand for your Lordships to take, and I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

In case the Minister feels that this is not a relevant or topical issue, perhaps I may refer to the fact that today UNISON, Britain&#146;s second largest union, has decided not to make any further contributions to the Labour Party for the time being. Therefore, constraint on expenditure by political parties may be more relevant than it was just a few hours ago. Perhaps I should also remind the Minister that, in the last three months recorded by the Electoral Commission, Labour managed to raise &#163;2.8 million but the Conservatives raised &#163;4 million. The Minister may like to comment on that discrepancy and think again about whether implementation of the agreements arrived at during the cross-party talks under the auspices of Sir Hayden Phillips may be more appropriate.</p>

<a name="90617-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09061789000175"></a>Amendments 67 to 73 would, in effect, all implement the concerns and proposals discussed at such length by the Hayden Phillips team. Although spending limits were debated in Grand Committee, the Minister will acknowledge that we have responded in these amendments to some of the criticisms made during that process. We have returned to the amendments proposed in the  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1096"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1096</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>other place, which more closely reflect the Hayden Phillips proposals. The amendments differ in only one respect: the spending limit that we suggest over a period is &#163;100 million, rather than the &#163;150 million in the Hayden Phillips discussions. That reflects some of the anxieties that have been expressed&#151;not least in the previous debate by the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, who spoke from professional experience of the marketing and advertising industry&#151;about how much wastage takes place. We believe that it would be reasonable to think of a more modest target, which would also meet some of the anxieties of the public.</p>

<a name="90617-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09061789000176"></a>I do not propose going through all the specifics of the Hayden Phillips proposals, which are directly reflected in the amendments before your Lordships&#146; House. However, I should like briefly to refer to the conclusions of that team, which I again remind the House reflected the anxieties, concerns and intentions of all three parties and for which, at the time, there was explicit support not only in the Hayden Phillips team but also in the House of Commons. Mr Maude, whose comments I referred to in the previous debate and will not repeat now, was absolutely explicit that the recommendations should be incorporated as soon as possible, while in exchanges during Prime Minister&#146;s Questions in December 2007 the Prime Minister and the leader of the Conservative Party also specifically endorsed the proposal that there should be limits on expenditure.</p>

<a name="90617-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09061789000177"></a>In his summary, Sir Hayden Phillips states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a><a name="09061789000302"></a>&#147;I believe there is general agreement that: expenditure on general election campaigns has progressively grown and should now be reduced in line with a new spending control regime to be agreed between the parties; and controls on expenditure by all third parties should be strengthened ... This chapter has described the options available to the parties in crafting new controls on spending. To reach a lasting agreement, there needs to be a focused discussion on four key issues: the period over which spending should be limited; the categories of spending which should be limited; the geographical scope of the limits on spending; and, in the light of the nature of an agreed scheme, the amount by which spending should be reduced. But it is clear to me that progress must be made on this point and that a new approach to curbing expenditure is necessary. A comprehensive agreement on party funding should, at a minimum, include within it measures to return to the overall rise in party spending to the trend line as it was before the spike in spending prior to the 2005 general election&#148;.</p>

<a name="90617-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09061789000178"></a>I turn now to a specific issue that again we have modified somewhat from the proposals we put to the Grand Committee; it relates to permissible expenditure. We are clear that at the moment there is a temptation for national parties effectively to interfere with constituency campaigns in a way that is contrary to all the intentions and legislation going right back to the 1883 Act. That temptation relates to specific approaches made to individual electors on behalf of a national campaign and seeks effectively to undermine what is going on in the individual constituency.</p>

<a name="90617-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09061789000179"></a>Many of us who took part in the Grand Committee proceedings have been candidates at various stages. I added up the number of occasions on which I have been a candidate for a county or general election and it is rather a large number, but on every occasion my agent was able to say to me&#151;others will have had this experience&#151;&#147;If you go over the expenditure limit that  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1097"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1097</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has been imposed on this constituency, you as the candidate or I as the agent will be in court&#148;. It was laid down absolutely and precisely that those who fought a constituency campaign should bear the full legal responsibility for all the money spent on promoting the candidature.</p>

<a name="90617-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09061789000180"></a>However, by means of mailshots directed at individuals&#151;let alone all the other material that can come from a national headquarters&#151;a principle that has been in place for more than a century has been effectively undermined. Therefore, we have included a specific requirement in these amendments that, where national expenditure takes place to promote, effectively, a candidate and his or her party within a constituency directly related to an individual elector&#146;s response, that should be taken into account in relation to the limits on expenditure at the local level. We understand that this is difficult where, for example, billboards are used; in Chester, for example, it might be said that billboards apply to the whole of Cheshire, because people go in and out of the city. However, where unsolicited mail is sent to an individual elector, that undermines what is happening at the local level and the responsibility of the candidate and his or her agent to look after very precisely what expenditure is made on behalf of that candidate. That is included in the eligible expenditure categories within this section.</p>

<a name="90617-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09061789000181"></a>I do not need to say much more at this point. There has been considerable discussion at all stages of the process through your Lordships&#146; House and some discussion in the other place, but I plead with the Minister to take this seriously. Indeed, perhaps on this occasion he might be permitted a little bit of a partisan approach, as it is his party that is suffering most from this attempt to get around the law on the way in which expenditure is advanced.</p>

<a name="90617-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09061789000182"></a>It has also been the experience in recent years that expenditure during the three weeks or so of the campaign is but part of the total campaign expenditure. That has been the cause of much concern and controversy, certainly in the analysis undertaken by Mr Peter Bradley, the former Member for the Wrekin, who was the unfortunate victim of a huge amount of money being spent in his constituency on behalf of his opponent before the dissolution of the last Parliament.</p>

<a name="90617-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09061789000183"></a>This is an important issue. There has been considerable agreement across the parties, with all three leaders agreeing that something needs to be done on this score. I hope that we will not have yet another example of the St Augustine syndrome: let us all be virtuous, but not yet. I beg to move.</p>

It was a significant donation from a foreign national, a fugitive from justice in the UK, which was made to the Liberal Democrats, who refuse to repay it. If the

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09061789000186"></a>My real point on spending preferences is that in a fair and democratic situation we need to have a level playing field. However, that level playing field&#151;I alluded to this in my previous comments&#151;has been distorted by the amount of public money that has been poured into constituencies. The office costs allowance, which I mentioned, and the communications allowance could amount to something in the region of &#163;100,000 per year, or &#163;500,000 during the lifetime of a Parliament. That money is put in by the incumbent and is in addition to all the benefits and opportunities that he or she has of writing letters and access to the press.</p>

Regardless of what one thinks about the &#163;10,000 a year communications allowance&#151;I would be in favour of scrapping it&#151;does he really believe that there is a proper comparison between the &#163;10,000 per year communications allowance that an MP receives and the much larger amounts of money with which the Conservative Party is swamping some constituencies?</p>

If the noble Lord is so passionate about limiting the amount of money that can fund campaigns, I think, having been around a few campaigns myself, not least by-election campaigns, that the Liberal Democrats could take the lead and show their virtue by imposing a restraint now on the amount of funds that they are going to put into the Norwich North by-election. They could do that if they really wanted to take the big money out of politics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09061789000193"></a>I was talking about the amount of money that is going into elections and the need for a spending cap. This is the point that my right honourable friend  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1099"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1099</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>David Cameron has made in his personal pledge: an incoming Conservative Government would abolish the communications allowance as a first step and a gesture in that direction. We would seek to reduce the cost of politics and the size of the House of Commons. He has put his finger on the national mood at the moment, which is not inclined to put one penny more towards the political process in these straitened times but wants to see the system managed much more efficiently. It is up to the political parties, through interparty dialogue, to come up with ways in which that can be achieved.</p>

<a name="90617-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09061789000194"></a>I would like to make a couple of other points about expenditure limits. There are many other forms of support that political parties receive from the public purse, a point that was raised in the Neill report and was touched on by Sir Hayden Phillips in his review, where he pointed out the value of freepost mailings of manifestos at election time and of political election broadcasts. Significant amounts of funding are there for the incumbent.</p>

<a name="90617-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09061789000195"></a>We are not saying that there is not a problem; big money&#151;I use the term again with no hesitation&#151;needs to be taken out of politics. &#147;Big money&#148; refers not only to trade unions and major wealthy individuals but to the public purse as well. Some steps have been taken and it is worth putting on the record some of the progress that has been made in relation to national limits. We have just experienced a European election that had a national limit on expenditure. That was a good exercise and a good discipline to impose.</p>

<a name="90617-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09061789000196"></a>The very Bill that we are talking about came forward with a limitation on pre-candidacy election expenses for certain general elections. It introduces a limit, which is a step in the right direction, as it acknowledges that we have to find ways of reducing the amount of funding that is going into constituencies. Section 18 talks about a system of limiting the amount of money expended, kicking in after the 55th month of a Parliament.</p>

<a name="90617-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09061789000197"></a>However, there is an important corollary to the point about the limitations on pre-election expenses under the Bill. I would be grateful if the Minister could put some additional remarks on the record about this. The understanding was that that would be matched by a limitation of the communications allowance used during that period by Members in the other place in their constituencies. It seems only right and fair that any limit that applied to donation income should be matched by a gesture from the incumbent Members in limiting the amount that is spent through the communications allowance. Various statements have been made claiming that such a statutory instrument or convention would be in place by the time the Bill received Royal Assent. It would be good to hear that this is still very much the Government&#146;s intention. I recognise the intention behind the amendments but, for the reasons that I have outlined, we do not want to support them at this stage.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09061789000199"></a>I will not go through the amendments one by one. The noble Lord did not do so either. We recognise the broad shape of the amendments from Grand Committee. We are grateful that some rectification has been made of some of the problems and deficiencies that were identified in the previous versions of these amendments, but we have some concerns. For example, Amendment 67 would impose a five-year limit on a party&#146;s spending but still fails to anticipate the problem of parties saving up the majority of their permitted spend until shortly before an election. In Amendment 68, we are concerned that smaller parties would face great difficulty in accurately calculating the level of their permitted spend, given that it cannot be known how many months will elapse between elections. These are small points, but I make them in case the noble Lord wants to deal with them.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09061789000200"></a>The transitional arrangements proposed in Amendment 70 appear to suggest that a party could spend 75 per cent of the permitted &#163;61 million between July 2009 and the next election. That is probably a drafting error, but prescribing any figure in the manner of the amendment would be risky, given that we cannot know exactly when the election will be. Amendment 72 would require registered political parties to report annually on their qualifying expenditure under the proposed new system of spending limits, although it defines expenditure as that found in Schedule 4A to the 1983 Act. However, that schedule lists the regulated matters for the candidate&#146;s spending limit, not the party&#146;s campaign spending limit. That list of regulated matters is to be found in Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09061789000201"></a>Amendment 71&#151;and here I come to more major issues&#151;would make two crucial changes to the list of regulated matters for candidates&#146; spending, as set out in Schedule 4A to the 1983 Act. First, it seeks to add spending on newsletters or similar publications, which is by the central party but relates to candidates. Secondly, it would add market research or canvassing activity to the list of regulated matters. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, raised concerns about the current list of regulated matters for the candidate and campaign spending limits in Grand Committee. Election spending is, of course, regulated by separate limits, according to whether it is by or on behalf of a party, or by or on behalf of a candidate. This is clearly an important distinction. The noble Lord&#146;s concern is that spending by a central party organisation, which might be specifically aimed to enhance the electoral prospects of an individual candidate, would not be recorded against that candidate&#146;s spending limit.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09061789000202"></a>So we understand the point and the noble Lord&#146;s concern, but we fear that the proposals would introduce further complexity into what is already a complex area of legislation. We are concerned that they could be

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09061789000203"></a>In the White Paper that preceded this Bill, the Government stated that they would assess whether there is clarity over which expenses count towards the party campaign and candidate spending limits. We stated that we would bring forward proposals to update the lists of regulated matters. However, such changes would be made via secondary legislation rather than in this Bill.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09061789000204"></a>The Government will consult fully with all the major political parties and the Electoral Commission before bringing forward proposals for change. Any proposals would then be subject to full scrutiny by both Houses. The concerns that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, raises and the changes that he proposes to make to Schedule 4A would best be addressed during the course of that consultation and those discussions. I understand that there is due to be a meeting of party administrators and officials from my department, the Ministry of Justice. This could be a productive issue to be considered at that meeting, which I believe is due to be held later this summer.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09061789000205"></a>This is a complex area of legislation and any proposal for change would have to be considered very carefully if we are to avoid the unintended consequences that are always a danger of introducing changes that have not been sufficiently considered. I can give no guarantee that it will be possible to address fully the noble Lord&#146;s concern, not least as his proposal would be a significant change and we have concerns about the practical effect of such a step. However, I reassure him that we intend to look at the lists of regulated matters, and to do so not on a solitary or party basis&#151;although he tempts me, I shall resist the temptation to be parti pris&#151;but on a consultative and co-operative basis.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09061789000206"></a>To return to the main thrust of the debate, which we are grateful to the noble Lord for raising, this group of amendments is based, in a broad sense, on the package of recommendations on spending put forward by Sir Hayden Phillips, although there are some key differences between Sir Hayden&#146;s suggested reforms and the amendments before us today. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, mentioned the key one. Sir Hayden proposed that the whole of term limit should be &#163;150 million, including a general election premium of &#163;20 million. Sir Hayden&#146;s proposals for the treatment of smaller parties also differed, and he did not propose introducing the new controls until after the next general election. These differences are significant. We are not considering the Hayden package of reforms with these amendments, but a revised version which has not come about as the result of cross-party talks and discussion.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09061789000207"></a>We have constantly stated that we broadly support the approach of comprehensive spending limits as proposed by Sir Hayden. However, we have also made it clear that there are concerns about how these could be made to operate effectively in practice. I talked about a meeting of officials and party administrators. Such a meeting has not yet been arranged but we will seek&#151;I give that promise from the Dispatch Box&#151;to arrange a meeting of the type I mentioned to take place this summer.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09061789000208"></a>We have also made the case&#151;I know that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, is not particularly happy with this&#151;that it is necessary to proceed in this area only on the basis of cross-party consensus. We do not think that we can introduce fundamental changes to the regulation of party funding unless all the main parties are signed up to the way forward. That requires detailed discussion between parties and scrutiny of any proposals for change. That is what the Sir Hayden Phillips talks sought to achieve. Alas, they failed to settle on proposals that all parties could support.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09061789000209"></a>We have always said that this Bill is not intended to be the last word on party funding issues. We hope that, in the long term, cross-party agreement can be achieved. We do not believe such agreement exists in your Lordships&#146; House today. For that reason, we do not believe that this Bill is the correct place to introduce such a system. I hope the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendments on the basis of what I have said in my reply. The noble Lord, Lord Bates, mentioned the restriction post-55 months. My right honourable friend Michael Wills said on Report in another place that CA would be restricted for the longer regulated period introduced in Clause 18. That is a matter for the House of Commons to agree, not for the Government.</p>

I am sorry that his colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, is not in the Chamber, because he was so effective in demolishing this argument that everything has to be agreed by total consensus across the parties. I wonder what the Minister&#146;s position would be if there was complete agreement between the Conservative and Labour Parties on an issue of this sort, but the Liberal Democrats did not agree. Would he still say that there was consensus, or would he say that the Liberal Democrats effectively had a veto on any agreement? The danger with the concept that we can do something in this field only when everybody is agreed is that we will not make any serious reforms to our political system at all. There will always be somebody who does not want to move. I have to say that we are usually rather more in advance when it comes to reform. However, this idea that consensus is essential, and therefore the slowest mover has a veto, is a dangerous new tendency in government. I do not see it in any other walk of life where government seeks to interfere or control.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="090617105000002"></a>I hope I am not putting words into the Minister&#146;s mouth, but I think that I can detect from what he is saying that the Government take very seriously the sort of anxieties and concerns that we have expressed. He did not say that he is seeking to reconstitute any cross-party discussions but I hope that it can be read into his words that he is not giving up on seeking to achieve some agreement, even if it is not complete, 100 per cent consensus. As he rightly says, his colleagues in the other place are increasingly anxious about the failure of the present regulations, particularly in terms of qualifying expenditure, to prevent interference on a scale that has never been experienced before. Not in the past 100 years has there been such considerable expenditure by national parties to encourage people to support local candidates within the constituency. He

He is right that we need in some form or other to go back to the issues in Schedule 4A, and it may not be our precise amendments that will be necessary.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="090617105000003"></a>I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, who is engaged this afternoon and has given her apologies to me and perhaps also to the Minster, shares our anxieties on this score. If the Minister is saying&#151;I think he is, and I hope he will intervene if I have it wrong&#151;that there may be other ways in which we can tighten and improve how these categories of expenditure are currently treated, then my colleagues and I very warmly welcome that. Frankly, however, it is not very helpful simply to say that there will be an urgent meeting some time in the summer. That does not communicate to me the sense of urgency that even this House would feel in giving priority to this important issue.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="090617105000004"></a>The Minister has been generous in saying that these are matters of concern to him and his colleagues in government. I hope it will be accepted that the issue is certainly of concern to members on different sides of the House. It did not sound as though even the noble Lord, Lord Bates, speaking on behalf of the Conservatives, is really totally satisfied with the lack of clarity. In the mean time, I take at face value precisely what the Minister has said. I hope we will see some progress, outwith the discussions on this Bill, before the Summer Recess. On those terms, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment 67.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="090617105000006"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to get rid of the edited version of the electoral register, though providing time to do so. In seeking to abolish the edited register, as I explained in Committee, I am in good company. Support for abolishing it comes from the Association of Electoral Administrators, the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner. The Thomas-Walport report last year on data sharing recommended that it be brought to an end, stating,</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1104"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="090617105000113"></a>&#147;we feel that selling the edited register is an unsatisfactory way for local authorities to treat personal information. It sends a particularly poor message to the public that personal information collected for something as vital as participation in the democratic process can be sold to &#145;anyone for any purpose&#146;. And there is a belief that the sale of the electoral register deters some people from registering at all. We are sympathetic to the strong arguments made by the Association of Electoral Administrators and the Electoral Commission that the primary purpose of the electoral register is for electoral purposes&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90617-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="090617105000007"></a>The arguments for abolishing the edited version rest on principle and practice. The principled argument is, to my mind, compelling. Heads of households are required, by law, each year to complete an electoral registration form in order for those in the household to be registered to vote. That is a fundamental part of our democratic process. Yet at the same time they have to decide whether they wish to have their name withdrawn from a register that is compiled for sale to any body that wishes to purchase it. People can exercise their option to opt out&#151;it is opt-out, rather than opt-in&#151;but why should they be required, by law, to make such a determination? It completely sullies the integrity of the electoral process. The electoral registration form should be solely for the purpose of compiling the electoral register. I thus have a principled objection to using the force of law to impose this burden on citizens.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="090617105000008"></a>The practical argument is that the present situation imposes a major and, to my mind, unnecessary burden on electoral registration officers. They are required to compile the information and then sell it. They make no profit in doing so&#151;rather the reverse. There is no benefit to the local authority. There is certainly no benefit to electoral registration officers; it has no relevance to their role. Compiling the edited version of the register imposes a major burden. It will become even more of a burden as electoral registration officers prepare for the move to individual registration. We should be facilitating that move, not maintaining a significant burden. On practical grounds, the case for getting rid of the edited register is thus greater than ever before.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="090617105000009"></a>What are the arguments against? In Grand Committee, the Minister focused solely on practical arguments. There was no engagement with the issue of principle. The argument related solely to the benefit for organisations that purchase the register. Abolishing the edited register may create problems for them. The Government plan to consult on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="090617105000010"></a>There are two, related responses to this. First, my amendment provides for the edited register to cease after the 2011 edition. There is thus time to prepare, and indeed to consult. The Government can utilise their proposed consultation on the best way to ensure a smooth transition. The principal objections to abolishing the edited register appear to come from debt collection agencies that use it to track down debtors who have moved. Given that 40 per cent of electors opt out of the register&#151;one suspects that those in debt may be among them&#151;that strikes me as an inefficient way of proceeding. Credit reference agencies already have access to the full register to check the names of people applying for credit. As the Credit Services Association points out, it is illogical that the Ministry of Justice supports the continued use of the full register by credit  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1105"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reference agencies to check the names and addresses of people applying for credit, so helping them to get into debt, but not for the process of recovering sums borrowed and helping people to get out of debt. I am not against agencies being able to utilise the full register for that purpose. As the Credit Services Association quite justifiably points out in its briefing:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a><a name="090617105000104"></a>&#147;Desired access to the electoral roll by the direct mailing and marketing industry should not be linked with the completely different requirements of the debt collection industry&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090617105000096"></a>I concur. I would be content for the agencies to have access to the full register and would support the Government in making the necessary adjustments for that purpose.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="090617105000011"></a>Secondly, as my noble friend Lord Bates observed in Committee, if there is demand for such a product by direct mailing and marketing bodies, market forces will take care of it. My amendment allows time for the market to operate. This is clearly something appropriate to the market and not to misusing statutory provisions for commercial purposes.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="090617105000012"></a>My basic point is straightforward. The process of employing the force of law to compile the electoral register should be confined to that task. Electoral registration officers should be allowed to get on with their tasks as electoral registration officers. They are not, or rather should not be, in the business of helping junk mail companies. Given that the costs of compiling the edited register are not wholly recovered, we are in effect subsidising commercial concerns. We are doing so through the use of statute, through the use of a provision that is fundamental to the democratic process. Requiring people to decide whether they wish to remove their name from the edited register is a misuse of that process. We should restore the integrity of our electoral registration process. We certainly should not use it to subsidise commercial concerns.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="090617105000013"></a>Other democracies manage to survive without such an edited register. Their economies do not appear to be undermined by the absence of such a register. We should get rid of it. It is in principle objectionable and it imposes an unnecessary burden. I beg to move.</p>

I have been astonished by the amount of paper that I have received on this amendment from the Finance and Leasing Association, the Credit Services Association, the Institute of Fundraising and the UK Cards Association opposing him&#151;I also received something from the Electoral Commission supporting him&#151;so I listened carefully to what he had to say.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="090617105000015"></a>My concerns are primarily threefold. First is the civil liberties argument. I am always concerned about information being collected for one purpose and then being passed on to be used for another, and my concerns have been increased by the examples given by my noble friend. The second is what I might describe as an ecological argument; that is to say, I suspect that what we are allowing here increases the volume of junk mail that travels through all our letterboxes. It is unnecessary, untidy and wasteful of our resources. The third is what I describe as the economic argument. I understand that the information is provided at cost, and I do not see why there should not be an economic

That does not happen at present; therefore, as my noble friend pointed out, this is a subsidising of the private sector by the state, which is inherently undesirable.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="090617105000016"></a>My civil liberties argument is the most critical. We should make every effort to ensure that information collected is used for the purposes for which it is collected, and not passed to somebody else for use in a completely different way. Although the Electoral Commission says that it has worries about the drafting of the amendment, it strongly supports it. And given that the Minister has so often in the past prayed in aid the Electoral Commission when rejecting our arguments, I hope that on this occasion he will see the logic of its position and ensure that my noble friend&#146;s amendment is accepted.</p>

By rising to speak, I give the government Front Bench an opportunity for information to arrive from the distant corners of the Chamber. I declare that I am a foot soldier in the army commanded by my noble friend Lord Norton.</p>

The principle was very clear and has been ably articulated by my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="090617105000019"></a>It covered two pieces of very persuasive evidence. The first was the intervention of the Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas, and Mark Walport, director of the medical charity the Wellcome Trust, who, in their report published in July, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a><a name="090617105000105"></a>&#147;The edited register is available for sale to anyone for any purpose. Its main clients are direct marketing companies and companies compiling directories&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090617105000097"></a>The point of this amendment is to make it clear that one must opt into the edited register and thus make it harder to sell information on to third parties.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="090617105000020"></a>In addition, the Local Government Association carried out a survey of electoral registration officers, 98 per cent of whom wanted a change in the law to abolish the edited register that councils have to sell to direct marketing companies, and 88 per cent of electoral registration officers believed that the current system deters people from voting. The survey also found that councils raise on average only a mere &#163;1,900 from this source.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="090617105000021"></a>Putting together all of those arguments that were so eloquently persuasive, I rose in Grand Committee and asked whether this was not an opportunity for a change. I should have realised that although taking on various groups is perhaps necessary in the course of public life, taking on direct marketing companies is a recipe for being inundated with e-mails, paper and representations. They certainly lived up to the reputation of their direct-marketing capabilities by making representations in between the Grand Committee and now.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1107"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90617-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="090617105000022"></a>I totally support the principal point of the more reasoned amendment put forward by my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth which delays implementation of the abolition. Direct mailing companies need to be aware and acknowledge that there is grave discomfort at the information being passed on for marketing purposes. They need to start thinking in the medium term about finding other sources from which to garner this information.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="090617105000023"></a>However, we keep coming back to timing, which is everything. At present, the representations that we have received from the organisations that would be most affected by this measure have led us to a deeper concern about the impact on jobs and businesses in this country. At times of recession, when many people are losing their homes and jobs, and many businesses are closing for many reasons, we should take almost a hippocratic oath, which is, &#147;First, do no harm&#148;. My hesitation is not about the principle of the amendment but that at a practical level we may actually harm an important part of the economy.</p>

<a name="90617-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="090617105000024"></a>Therefore, while we very much support the principle of the amendment and urge the industry to take notice of the remarks made in this House, and to look for alternatives, we would not be able to offer support from the Front Bench to my noble friend.</p>

I quote from the Grand Committee on 6 May. My noble friend said that,</p>
<ul><a name="090617105000114"></a>&#147;the purpose of the electoral register is democracy and the purpose of political parties is to promote their messages legitimately. It is not right that someone who registers to vote should then have to consider whether they should receive junk mail&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/5/09; col. GC263.]</ul>
<p><a name="090617105000098"></a>The register was never intended for that purpose and the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, has made a persuasive case for looking very seriously again at the whole purpose of the electoral register.</p>

It is right to point out that the Electoral Commission states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a><a name="090617105000106"></a>&#147;While we support the intention of Amendment 74 in the name of Lord Norton of Louth, which aims to end the compilation and publication of the edited version of the electoral register, we have strong concerns about the drafting of the amendment&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090617105000099"></a>I hope, therefore, that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, will accept that when the Electoral Commission is absolutely in favour of what the Government want, I quote it; but I also try to do so when it is not. To be fair, that is exactly the comment that the commission made on this issue.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="090617105000029"></a>This amendment introduces a new clause, whereby after December 2011, Section 9 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 in relation to the edited register will no longer have effect, thus preventing any use after that date of the provisions that allow for the compilation and publication of the edited version of the electoral register. EROs would no longer compile an edited version of the register for sale to anyone for any purpose. Historical versions of the edited register, including the final version published on 1 December each year, would still be available.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="090617105000030"></a>We have been reminded that in July 2008, Dr Mark Walport and Mr Richard Thomas published their report, the <I>Data Sharing Review</I>, which made a number of recommendations to the Government. In particular, recommendation 19 called for the edited version of the register to be abolished. We indicated that we would consult on this proposal and that remains our intention.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="090617105000031"></a>The Government clearly understand the concerns around the sale of personal details through the supply of the edited register. As my noble friend Lord Tunnicliffe stated in Grand Committee, before we can consider taking forward recommendation 19 there is a need to establish how removing the provisions would impact on the UK economy, businesses, charities and the general public. Indeed, noble Lords may be interested to hear that evidence to date indicates that a wide variety of organisations use the edited register and there could be an economic impact&#151;even a significant economic impact&#151;if it were no longer available for sale. For example, the direct-marketing industry has indicated that it would be hard hit if the edited register were abolished. It is worth pointing out that direct mail is worth &#163;8.6 billion to the UK economy and accounts for 182,000 jobs.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="090617105000032"></a>We must not neglect the very real potential impact on charities. They are of course suffering, as are businesses, in the current economic climate. Direct mail remains a significant form of direct marketing for charities. The Institute of Fundraising has told us that it relies on the edited register for this purpose. A piece of research was carried out by nfpSynergy in 2008. Based on the responses from more than 100 charities, the level of income generated from existing donors&#151;those acquired through direct mail&#151;sits at around an average of 27 per cent of the charities&#146; total income. Charities would face poorer quality direct marketing lists and lower response rates if the edited electoral register was no longer available for sale. If charities are unable to verify addresses accurately, there is more chance of mail being addressed wrongly, which could lead to a reduction in the inclination of potential donors to donate. We think other impacts need to be taken into account.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="090617105000033"></a>In the absence of the edited register, direct mailing organisations may rely on out-of-date information, thus increasing the risk of wrongly addressed correspondence. Direct marketing companies may start to rely on more intrusive methods of marketing, such as cold calling. The Royal Mail benefits substantially from income from advertising mail. Out of a &#163;7 billion  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1109"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a year turnover, &#163;1.7 billion represents delivering and advertising mail to the Royal Mail. This might be impacted. Those are powerful arguments, particularly in the economic times we are living in.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="090617105000034"></a>Having said all that, we accept that there are strong principled arguments in favour of abolishing the edited register. We are sympathetic to those who argue on principle, as does the noble Lord who moved the amendment, that data collected for electoral purposes should not be sold on for commercial purposes. We are also concerned that the existence of the edited register may put some people off registering to vote. That runs contrary to our programme of work to bolster registration ahead of the introduction of individual registration. It is something we wish to consider carefully.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="090617105000035"></a>While we have collected some evidence to date, a full consultation would allow us to go out to a wider audience, including businesses, charities and the public. We feel that this would enable us to build up a firmer evidence base and better understand the nature of the impact of abolishing the edited register. It is our intention to conduct a consultation before the Summer Recess in order to build a firmer evidence base about the advantages and disadvantages of the edited register and to consider the way forward on the basis of the responses received.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="090617105000036"></a>I should like to emphasise that an amendment to this Bill is not the only legislative mechanism, in our view, by which the provisions for the edited register may be removed. The edited register exists because of provision in secondary legislation, made under paragraph 10(1) of Schedule 2 to the Representation of the People Act 1983. There is no requirement that secondary legislation should include provision about an edited register. Accordingly, our argument is that it would be possible to remove the provision for the edited register by using existing powers to amend secondary legislation, if that was deemed appropriate.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="090617105000037"></a>Therefore, it would be open to the Government to use this mechanism to remove the edited register if, following consultation, it became evident that that was the best way forward. That would still leave the power to create the edited register again on the statute book. Nevertheless, it might achieve the benefits that noble Lords describe and would be a more flexible approach. This would allow us to have the benefit of fully considering the outcome of the consultation before taking further steps. Notwithstanding our sympathy for the arguments against the edited register, this should be the preferred approach and proper process for making this informed policy decision about changes to our system of electoral administration. I am not making any commitments on behalf of the Government, as I would not wish to pre-empt the outcome of any consultation. I mention this solely to emphasise that this Bill may not be the only mechanism by which the provisions relating to the edited register may be amended.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="090617105000038"></a>I hope that those who support the amendment might give careful consideration to the impact of accepting it. I repeat that, in principle, we understand the motivation behind the amendment, but we argue that it would not be appropriate to abolish the edited register via an amendment to this Bill before we had conducted a public consultation in full. The noble

In addition to the bodies I mentioned that support abolition, there was cross-party support for it in Grand Committee. I am very grateful for this afternoon&#146;s expression of support from my noble friends Lord Hodgson and Lord Brooke and the noble Lord, Lord Tyler.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="090617105000040"></a>I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s response. It came more towards meeting the point of principle this time rather than relying solely on the practical point. I have two concerns about what he said. He has repeated the point that the Government propose to consult. They have been proposing to consult for some time. The Government could have already had the consultation exercise and got the responses by now. There does not appear to be any great urgency on the part of the Government.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="090617105000041"></a>That brings me to the second point. The Minister has said, quite rightly, that one could get rid of edited registers through existing legislation; the provisions are there. He said that that is the more flexible approach. My concern is that it is flexibility in favour of doing nothing; that would be my worry. I feel that there is a need for something to be locked in to ensure that there is action. I think ultimately the issue of principle is paramount.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="090617105000042"></a>I will reflect on what the Minister has said. However, my greatest concern is, as my noble friend Lord Hodgson said, the concern expressed by the Electoral Commission in relation to drafting. I want to reflect on that. However, I will reflect on what the Minister has said and consider whether to return to the issue at Third Reading. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="090617105000046"></a>There are other misunderstandings, too.

Frankly, as those who have had the experience of standing as candidates will know, you do not have to put your name on the ballot paper for your address to be well known in your area by other means. If there was a security risk, no doubt the Government would come forward with some direct evidence from the police or the security services to that effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="090617105000047"></a>The Government very properly instituted a consultation process on this issue back in November, I think. We now have the response. Only two MPs&#151;on behalf of other MPs, I should say&#151;responded. The Electoral Commission supported the idea that there might be a change in the law. However, electoral administrators, returning officers, the Newspaper Society and, most important of all, the public have made it absolutely clear that they think that any reduction in transparency on this issue would be totally inappropriate and certainly out of favour at the present time. The only political party to make any sort of submission to the consultation process were the Liberal Democrats and we were clearly against withholding addresses in this way.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="090617105000048"></a>Of course, there was a vote in the other place. The Lord Chancellor and the Minister responsible for the Bill both voted against this change, which they felt was clearly inappropriate, without proper discussion and debate. The Minister said on a previous occasion that he intends there to be a free vote, rather than a whipped vote, on this proposal. I hope that that is still the case; no doubt he will be able to confirm that.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="090617105000049"></a>At the moment, increasing the secrecy that surrounds the political process will seem even more inappropriate than it was when we discussed these matters at Second Reading and in Grand Committee. Frankly, I believe that the public will think it pretty odd if that is introduced for the politicians who may stand for election to the other place&#151;but not, incidentally, in relation to some of the devolved Administrations. You would think that, if there were real pressure for this to happen, it might be in Northern Ireland, where there is a reasonable case for doing this. However, so far as I am aware, there is no such pressure and there is certainly nothing in this clause to cover anyone else at any other level in the political system. I think that the public would regard this as another attempt by the political classes to protect themselves from scrutiny when that scrutiny was thought to be perfectly appropriate for everyone else. I hope that the Minister will now be rather more responsive to that concern than he was able to be prior to the consultation period. I beg to move.</p>

I ask him to forgive me because we work together very well in a number of areas of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="090617105000051"></a>I did not move my amendment because I wanted to concentrate on the essence of the noble Lord&#146;s case. This is not about risk to Members of Parliament; the issue in this case is the risk to the families of Members of Parliament. In Committee, I drew attention to two occasions: the first was when a Member of Parliament was in Paris and an incident was about to take place; and the second was the incident that took place outside the home of the noble Lord, Lord King of Bridgwater, when the police were brought in and there were subsequent prosecutions. In the latter case, there was clearly a risk to the family.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="090617105000052"></a>I am worried by the fact that the case put by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, seems to be based on the proposition that, because we are in public life, our families have to take into account the fact that we may be placing them at risk. He was not quite as blunt as that, but that is the implication. I want to give an example. If a person anywhere in the world were to Google the names of every single Member of Parliament&#151;their names and addresses would be available on the internet following a general election campaign&#151;that person would have a database that could be used against each individual Member. They could dispatch from anywhere in the world envelopes containing biological material or other dangerous agents and send them to the homes of those Members of Parliament. The mail that we receive here is screened but we all know that that is not the position with mail that goes to our homes. We are advised at every stage in our political lives to be more diligent and careful with regard to our personal arrangements because of the dangers from terrorism and I cannot believe that a political party would argue that we should not have that in mind when taking decisions on this issue. We cannot place the families of Members of Parliament in that position.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="090617105000053"></a>The noble Lord has said that this material is already available. Of course it is. You could have gone to my former constituency in Workington and asked on the streets, &#147;Where does the Member of Parliament for Workington live?&#148;, and you would probably have been told the answer within a road or two. However, when you are in some obscure country in another part of the world, you do not have access to that kind of material. When I oppose the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, I am referring to a completely different kind of threat.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="090617105000054"></a>I am also concerned about the impact of international terrorism on how Members of Parliament conduct themselves in a public place&#151;particularly in the Chamber in Parliament, where their remarks might be heavily publicised. Even though they are protected by privilege, if Members of Parliament feel constrained in any way because of the possible danger to their families that might arise out of any statements that they make in Parliament, I believe that we have a responsibility to try to remove that possibility of constraint. We must

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="090617105000055"></a>I am afraid that the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, do not really address that. I am sorry to say that, because we have worked together well on this Bill. However, this is an area where we have a fundamental difference of opinion. As I said in Committee, my views on this matter stem basically from the noble Lord&#146;s lobby. I supported the principle of absolute transparency that he advocated until I had the conversation with my wife, to which I referred in Committee. She explained what happened in our family during the Iraqi debate in the 1990s, when I was quite involved with the Iraqi opposition.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="090617105000056"></a>Now is the time to change the nature of the debate in this area. I appeal to the noble Lord not to press his amendment to a vote today because I think that it sends out the wrong message. For all the goodness that lies in the libertarian values that he and his party colleagues hold, this is one area where I am afraid that too much transparency will place individual Members&#146; families at risk in a totally unacceptable way.</p>

<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="090617105000057"></a><b><a name="90617-0008.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="090617105000326"></a>Lord Monson:</b> My Lords, when I first read about this amendment in the press, it seemed to me a good one and well worthy of support were it to go to a Division. After all, Enoch Powell&#151;not exactly the most uncontroversial of political figures&#151;always insisted on having his name, private home address and telephone number published in the London telephone directory. Furthermore&#151;this is not so widely known&#151;while he was Member of Parliament for South Down, he always refused to carry a side-arm for personal protection against terrorist attacks, as he was legally entitled to do. Given his military background, he could have used the weapon to good effect in an emergency. However, he refused to do so because he felt that it would be insulting to his constituents, whether or not they were his supporters.</p>

<a name="90617-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="090617105000058"></a>It must be conceded that that was more than 30 years ago. Perhaps the British character has changed since then and, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has just reminded us, we now have a problem with international terrorism, which hardly existed at that time. So far as the British character goes, there are some who claim that we have become collectively&#151;not individually of course&#151;more emotionally incontinent and much less able, and certainly much less willing, to restrain our words or actions. The rather alarming scenes outside a magistrates&#146; court in Devon a few days ago, when a woman was charged with paedophile offences, was perhaps indicative of this. So, on further reflection, the argument seems to be much more finely balanced, and I am now not so sure that I can support the amendment.</p>

I remain sympathetic to it and run the risk of incurring the wrath of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. I accept that the arguments are finely balanced. I believe that the link between those who seek election and the electorate should be as close as possible. The publication of home addresses is part of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="090617105000060"></a>At the margin, as we heard in a powerful speech by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, there are potential security risks. Yes, it is possible that people will pack packets of anthrax in Pakistan and mail them to individual Members of Parliament, so there is a risk, but it is a risk at the margin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="090617105000061"></a>I am concerned about the other principle addressed by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, which is that this measure was slipped in without any of the people in the other place having seriously debated its pros and cons. I entirely accept the argument that it is not for us in this House to lay down the terms and conditions under which people stand for election to the other place, but it is important to provide an opportunity to air all the issues, particularly in the light of the difficulties that we are facing at the present time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="090617105000062"></a>The Division Lists at the end of the non-debate that took place were divided across parties; strong views were held in various parts and various parties. It will be important for us to give the other place a chance to debate the issue, to discuss the principles ab initio with tabula rasa. We would not wish to interfere in any way with that, but the debate should take place because it is such an important issue in our democratic system, particularly when that system is under strain. That is why I support the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

At Second Reading, I intervened on the speech of my noble friend Lord Hodgson and asked whether he was including security considerations. It would not be right for me to tell your Lordships&#146; House what my noble friend said to me after the debate was over, but because this debate will be a quarry for any subsequent debate that may occur in the House of Commons, I will add one other consideration as someone who has been under threat. I agree that it is easy to find out where someone lives but, if he or she lives in a block of flats, for example, we are placing at risk all the people who live in that block of flats and not simply ourselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="090617105000065"></a>I will make one brief point on a technicality: the question whether the other place had an opportunity to consider this measure. That is at the heart of our position. There was a vote in the other place. The result was that 235 Members voted in its favour and 176 voted against it. That was a matter of a free vote on the part of the government party and the Conservatives. It was, sadly, the subject of a three-line Whip on the part of the Liberal Democrats. None the less, the Whip was voted against by several of their Members. The argument presented is that the matter was not discussed, but Members of the other place had seen the amendment in the name of my honourable friend Julian Lewis. The debate had continued; most people had an opinion on it and they expressed it in the most

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="090617105000066"></a>Our position is that, if that view was taken in the other place and it was the settled view of that House, it would be wrong for us in this place to seek to overturn that from a procedural point of view, not to mention the qualitative and security arguments that have been presented so forcefully in this debate from many sides. Members on our Benches would have a free vote again in any Division, but I hope that we will allow the House of Commons to determine the terms on which they stand for election and respect that.</p>

The clause was inserted into the Bill following an amendment that was tabled by the honourable Member for New Forest East, Dr Lewis, and accepted by the other place at Report following a free vote. The clause provides that, at a parliamentary election, candidates&#146; full home addresses will no longer appear on the nomination paper but will instead be supplied to the returning officer on a separate home address form. A home address form enables candidates to choose whether their full home addresses will be included on the electoral documents available to the public. That is the statement of persons nominated on the ballot paper. Should a candidate prefer that their full home address not be made public, these documents will instead identify the constituency in which the candidate has an address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="090617105000068"></a>The Government issued a consultation paper on 26 November 2008. From the 65 responses to the consultation, it was clear that there are strongly held views for and against changing the legislation. Broadly speaking, a majority of politicians who responded and the Electoral Commission favoured change, while administrators, returning officers and the majority of responses from the public did not. Those in favour argued that the candidate and their families faced more ordinary risks to their safety and security, which warranted the need for their home addresses to be removed from the public domain. By contrast, those against the idea argued that the interest of accountability and free expression of democracy would not be served by allowing candidates to make it more difficult for the public to find out information about them.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="090617105000069"></a>As a result of the responses to the consultation and the importance of the issue, we took the view that the matter would be for the other place and not for the Government to decide on&#151;hence there was a free vote on the issue. That allowed those who were elected to make a decision on their behaviour during elections and on the information that should be made available to the public. I reiterate that the Government take no position on the merits of Clause 21 and that the inclusion of the clause in the Bill is not government policy. The Government will therefore allow a free vote on Amendment 76.</p>

Ever since the Ballot Act 1872, the electorate have had the right to know where their candidates live. I suggest to your Lordships&#146; House that we should take seriously any reduction in that transparency&#151;hence my anxiety, which I am disappointed that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, does not share, that the other place should debate the issue. That was the issue on which he and I agreed on Monday and we were successful with that amendment. That place should take a decision of this importance after careful discussion. If the Minister really believes that taking an amendment out of its grouping&#151;no one expected it to come&#151;and then putting it to a vote without any debate and without its even being moved is a proper way to discuss such an issue, I am disappointed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="090617105000072"></a>The logic of the submission of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, is that every representative in every devolved Assembly should be given the same protection. I have listened especially to the experience of those Members of your Lordships&#146; House who know about Northern Ireland. Why should Members of the House of Commons be protected in a way that Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly are not? If the Government want to make some real changes, I suggest that they remove the provision from the Bill and look at the whole issue again, so that there can be proper consideration, rather than have it forced through as it has been so far.</p>

Yet, on a whim, some seem to want to remove the transparency that has been in place for some 137 years. This is an issue that should be debated, discussed and decided in the other place. Therefore, I beg leave to test the opinion of the House.</p>

He was here earlier; unfortunately, the timing has coincided with a very important occasion to commemorate the foundation of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, of which he was a founder member. Not many people can still say that. He is very sorry not to be here to move the amendment on the Marshalled List in his name and mine.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="090617105000075"></a>This is a particular issue that has arisen recently, and I hope the Government are going to be able to give us some guidance on how to deal with it. The description of candidates on a ballot paper has, on two specific occasions recently, been used not to inform the electorate of the status of the candidate, but effectively to put propaganda on the ballot paper.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="090617105000076"></a>The first example was in Scotland, where certain candidates put &#147;Alex Salmond for First Minister&#148; on the ballot paper as their description&#151;which was clearly completely outwith the intentions of the regulations, but was permitted. Similarly, and more recently, the BNP put on the ballot paper against candidates not a description of the party, but a slogan: &#147;Protecting British Jobs&#148;. In both cases, there will, I think, be widespread recognition around the House that this is a deliberate distortion of the intention of the ballot paper, which is intended to be entirely factual&#151;nothing to do with propaganda or slogans. My noble friend Lord Steel has, with the assistance of the authorities of the House, produced a way in which this problem can be dealt with; that is incorporated in Amendment 76A.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="090617105000078"></a>However, there is a very serious point here, and it was addressed in the Gould report on the Scottish elections of 2007. It was quite clear in that election that there was real confusion in Scotland as a result of the way in which the ballot paper had, in my view and the view of my noble friend, been misused. It may be that the Minister this evening may not be able to accept the amendment in its present form, despite the assistance of the authorities of the House. But I hope the Minister will accept that there is a real problem here, and something needs to be done. I beg to move.</p>

In the past, all the parties have been guilty of using the description in this way. In my view, it is quite wrong and I hope that ways will be found to stop it.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="090617105000080"></a>I have in front of me a copy of the ballot paper for the elections to the European Parliament in the north-west region, which has one or two interesting examples on it of exactly what we are complaining about&#151;putting political slogans and other irrelevant information on ballot papers. The British National Party, as my noble friend has already said, says in its subsidiary description, &#147;British National Party: Protecting British Jobs&#148;. That is clearly a slogan. The Christian Party says it is &#147;proclaiming Christ&#146;s Lordship&#148;. That may or may not be a slogan, but it seems to me that if the Christian Party wishes to stand, then what it is about should be part of its campaigning and not on the ballot paper.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="090617105000081"></a>The Conservative Party and the Labour Party are crystal pure on this issue, and have nothing further, and the Liberal Democrats, for reasons I do not quite understand, say, &#147;Liberal Democrats: liberal democrat&#148;. I do not think &#147;Liberal Democrat&#148; is a slogan, but why &#147;Liberal Democrats&#148; appears followed by &#147;Liberal Democrat&#148;, I do not understand. Nevertheless, I think we are above reproach there.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="090617105000082"></a>Then we have the English Democrats Party, which says, &#147;English Democrats: Putting England First&#148;. That is clearly a slogan. We have something called the Jury Team, which I do not understand at all, that says, &#147;Democracy, Accountability, Transparency&#148;. That might be an ideological statement, but it is not something that should be on the ballot paper. The Socialist Labour Party says, &#147;Leader&#151;Arthur Scargill&#148;. People will have their views as to whether he should be on the ballot paper; it did not do them much good. The Green Party says, &#147;Green Party: Say No To Racism&#148;. That is clearly a slogan, and while one does not doubt that the Green Party is anti-racist, it ought not to be on the ballot paper. So it seems to me that this is prevalent: people are using it to promote a political message. It is still going on and it ought to be stopped.</p>

The reality is that we were in Committee prior to the last round of elections. It seems to me that this is an escalating level of abuse: if we allow it to develop in one particular area, then someone else will say, &#147;Well, if they can do it, we can do it&#148;, and more and more candidates are going to adopt this approach in the future. We learn from this last election, which, as I said, took place after we were in Committee. I would have thought that the noble Lord, Lord Steel, as a former Presiding Officer in the Scottish Parliament, would have had particular experience of this, as I presume that candidates in Scotland have made representations to him that have led to him tabling this amendment.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="090617105000084"></a>Irrespective of what is in the Minister&#146;s brief, which may well have been written prior to these most recent elections and the experience of candidates in various parts of the country of being confronted with a ballot paper riddled with slogans&#151;many areas had a very long ballot paper of some 15 to 18 inches long: the longest one I have ever seen in my life&#151;I would have thought that my noble friend might want to indicate a little flexibility during the course of his response. At the least he might indicate that the Government are now considering these issues so that in the future we may consider further legislation in this area.</p>

Like the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, I do not like the growth in the use of slogans on the ballot paper. As he said, since Committee we have seen them used a great deal in the European elections. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, took us through the ballot paper for the north-west&#151;the one on which I would have put my cross&#151;and speculated whether the expression &#147;liberal democrat&#148; could be seen as a slogan. As someone who came from the old Liberal Party and often feels that there is not much liberalism left among the Liberal Democrats, perhaps he is right that it is a slogan&#151;but then, looking at some of the other slogans, I imagine the poor berated Prime Minister might have rather resented the fact that the BNP took to paraphrasing his line &#147;British jobs for British people&#148; by adding its slogan &#147;Protecting British jobs&#148;. It might have been preferable if we did not have such slogans on the ballot paper, and I will be interested to hear what the Government have to say in response to the noble Lord, Lord Tyler.</p>

The description would have to be authorised by the Electoral Commission.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="090617105000087"></a>The regulation of party descriptions has evolved considerably over the past decade. The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 provided for the compulsory registration of political parties. The Electoral Commission&#146;s 2003 report, <I>Standing for Election in the   


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1121"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>United Kingdom</I>, included the recommendation that parties should be given the option to register descriptions, and that candidates be limited to using their registered party name or a registered description on the ballot paper. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 introduced this measure for UK elections. However, independent candidates may use only the description &#147;independent&#148;.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="090617105000088"></a>I recognise the concerns that have been expressed by politicians on all sides and by a number of electors who have questioned whether the descriptions used on the ballot paper at the recent European elections were appropriate, even if they were within the law. In addition, there has been a debate for some time about whether the existing arrangements are fair to independent candidates. However, I am concerned that the proposal set out in this amendment goes too far in the other direction.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="090617105000089"></a>Within the current framework, smaller or local parties have the opportunity to register a party name that capitalises on contentious local issues, and larger and national parties have argued that this puts them at a disadvantage. Party descriptions address this disadvantage by allowing national parties the opportunity to reflect local circumstances on a ballot paper. For example, parties commonly use one description when contesting UK parliamentary elections and another for elections to the devolved Administrations. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would provide that independents would be the only candidates able to use a description of any kind. I question whether this arrangement goes too far in allowing independent candidates to make an appeal that would be denied to political parties.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="090617105000090"></a>In addition, while I recognise the noble Lord&#146;s intentions, I should make it clear that the amendment is defective since it envisages that candidates are registered with a political party. This registration is the route by which the amendment defines candidates who are compelled to use only the registered party name as a description. While political parties must register with the Electoral Commission, there is no requirement that candidates must register with political parties before they may stand on that party&#146;s behalf at an election; nor is there any requirement for any candidate to be a member of the party on whose behalf they are a candidate.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="090617105000091"></a>Another difficulty with the proposed measure is the burden that it would place on the Electoral Commission. In considering this issue in 2003, the commission concluded that it would be impractical for it to,</p>
<ul><a name="090617105000115"></a>&#147;attempt to regulate all independent candidates&#146; descriptions in the tight timescales allowed by election timetables&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090617105000100"></a>For this reason, I understand that the Electoral Commission does not support the noble Lord&#146;s amendment and is of the view that the existing position is satisfactory.</p>

<a name="90617-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="090617105000092"></a>These matters are of course kept under review, and since this issue concerns the way in which those standing for election communicate with the electorate, it must be right that any change should be made in discussion with all those who have a stake in the electoral process. Therefore, I urge the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="090617105000094"></a>There is a serious issue here. I understand what the Minister says about the Electoral Commission&#146;s work, and it was clear from the Gould commission that what it recommended was not intended to be the last word on this subject; as I anticipated, there would be further discussion about the ballot paper design. I hope that I can read from what the Minister has just said that the continuing review to which he referred is ongoing: that it has not stopped and will not cease simply because there is a problem at the moment. I also understand that the Electoral Commission will review what happened in this respect in the recent European parliamentary elections. I hope that I have got that right. The Minister may like to intervene if I have got it wrong, but I hope the fact that he is not intervening suggests that that is exactly what will happen.</p>

Noble Lords will be aware that by-elections to fill vacancies are generally undesirable in elections where the single transferable vote form of proportional representation is used because this has the potential to distort the careful balance of seats that will have been secured by the election. Last year, the Government consulted publicly in Northern Ireland on possible changes to the current system, and there was substantial support for introducing the method set out in Clause 23 of replacing MEPs from political parties from both sides of the community.</p>

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="090617108000004"></a>In other areas of electoral law, where a nominating officer has a specific role we have sought to ensure that that role is undertaken jointly by nominating officers in cases in which a candidate stands on behalf of more than one party. For example, under the European parliamentary elections rules for Northern Ireland, a person may not be validly nominated to stand for election using more than one party&#146;s description unless the nominating officer of each party concerned authorises this. In line with this approach, I believe that when an MEP who stood on behalf of more than one party vacates his or her seat, the nominating officers of each of the parties on whose behalf the MEP stood should jointly nominate a replacement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="090617108000005"></a>These amendments would provide valuable clarification of how the proposed new method for filling vacant European parliamentary seats in Northern Ireland would work for MEPs who have stood on behalf of more than one political party.

They might have been in agreement at the previous election but then, as the noble Lord pointed out, lost the MEP two or three years later. The noble Lord does not think that there should be a by-election under STV, because that does not work on these occasions. That is another good reason for staying well clear of STV.

But I decided that it would have been invidious to identify specifically in legislation my concern, and therefore I did not take up the advice.</p>

I appreciate that it may seem a little impertinent, or at any rate discourteous, to intervene for the first time in the debates on this Bill at this late stage. The subject of these amendments is a discrete matter and I declare an interest in that I was asked to put forward these amendments by the Greater London Authority. I was a member of the London Assembly, which was a part of the Greater London Authority, for eight years until just over a year ago. I am also a joint president of London Councils.</p>

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="090617108000012"></a>The GLA has been in discussion with officials about this matter, and I am extremely grateful for their assistance. Both what I have to say and the amendments will be very familiar to those officials. Amendment 79 allows the proper officer of the Greater London Authority&#151;that is, the Greater London Returning Officer&#151;to be appointed by the Secretary of State as regional returning officer at a European election in any region in England and Wales. In practice, it is likely that the GLRO would be appointed only as regional returning officer for London, but there could be circumstances in which the GLRO may be appointed to a neighbouring region or, if there are boundary changes&#151;if anyone is brave enough to address that&#151;to a region which includes London and an area outside London. The GLRO will not be appointed automatically as regional returning officer. It will be open to him or her, alongside acting returning officers for parliamentary elections, to put himself forward for designation as the regional returning officer by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="090617108000013"></a>Amendment 80 provides for the GLA to place the services of its employees at the disposal of the GLRO. If he is appointed as regional returning officer, this would apply only if the GLRO is appointed as regional returning officer for the London region. To speak off script for a moment, I should like to place on record my admiration for the work done by those who have  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1125"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been running GLA elections for some years now. I should explain that the funding that the GLRO would receive under Section 6(6) of the 2002 Act if he were appointed would be calculated on the same basis as that for regional returning officers in other regions and that for the RRO appointed for London at the June 2009 European elections. In other words, the GLRO will not be treated any different from other regional returning officers.</p>

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="090617108000014"></a>A couple of days ago I saw briefing from the Electoral Commission which I understand supports this amendment. The commission says that the experience that the GLRO gains in carrying out the role may mean that he or she is best placed to ensure the efficient running of the European parliamentary elections in the London region and that he or she should therefore be appointed in the way that the amendment provides. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="090617108000015"></a><b><a name="90617-0010.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="090617108000055"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My Lords, this amendment seeks to provide that the Greater London returning officer should be eligible for appointment as a regional returning officer for European parliamentary elections. The Government see merits in the proposed change and I am pleased that parliamentary counsel and Ministry of Justice officials have been able to assist the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, in the drafting of the amendment. The GLRO is the chief executive of the Greater London Authority. The GLRO leads an experienced elections team which has previously run successful GLA Assembly and London mayoral elections.</p>

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="090617108000016"></a>At European parliamentary elections, regional returning officers are appointed to each UK electoral region and they are responsible for the conduct of the election in their region. Under Section 6 of the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002, in England and Wales the RRO is to be a person who is an acting returning officer for parliamentary elections and is designated as an RRO by an order of the Secretary of State. The GLRO is not able to be appointed as an RRO under these provisions as he is not an acting returning officer for parliamentary elections. These amendments change that position by amending the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002 to allow the GLRO to be designated as an RRO. It also provides that if the GLRO is appointed as RRO for London, he may call on the assistance of employees of the GLA to help him carry out his duties as RRO in addition to the London boroughs in the London region.</p>

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="090617108000017"></a>There is no reason to doubt that the European elections in June 2009 were effectively administered in London under the existing statutory framework. However, the GLRO has experience of running London-wide elections and the proposed change would widen the scope of suitable persons who may be considered as the RRO for the London region in future European elections and make it easier to recruit for the post. The Government are therefore content to accept the amendment.</p>

I was poisoned by organophosphate sheep dip in 1989. In fact, it is almost exactly 20 years since I was doused while helping to dip our sheep. Prior to that, I had been chronically exposed to a variety of OPs in common use on farms and in homes. At the time we were led to believe that OPs were safe if used as instructed. It was not until 1991, after a long process of elimination and observation after further exposures, that the cause of my illness became clear to me and to my GP. Contrary to received belief, the signs and symptoms of poisoning were not temporary and, for me, the effects are still evident today. I am extremely fortunate in that I have supportive medical practitioners whose main objective in life is not to poison me further.</p>

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="090617108000020"></a>Sheep dipping once or twice yearly in the UK was compulsory from 1975 to 1992 as part of the regime to control sheep scab. OPs replaced organochlorines from the early 1980s after the latter were found to persist in the environment. It was in 1992 that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, then Paul Tyler MP, and I independently started to ask questions about the safety of using OPs as veterinary medicines and as both agricultural and domestic pesticides. Indeed, I almost said, &#147;Welcome to the &#145;Mar and Tyler Show&#146;&#148; because we have been together on this for so long, but perhaps I should say the &#145;Mar, Tyler and Rooker Show&#146; because the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has also been involved for a long time. In 1992, the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and I first met John Gummer, then the Minister of Agriculture, to ask him to apply a moratorium on OP sheep dips. By this time it was becoming clear that OPs were affecting a significant number of individuals who were using them or were inadvertently exposed to them. At first, the Government assured us that these products were safe and that they presented no risk to human  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1127"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>health. Since then there has been progress and their acute effects are readily acknowledged. Many OPs have been removed from the market, while stringent instructions now apply to those that are still in use. But there is still no recognition of their chronic central and autonomic nervous system effects.</p>

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="090617108000021"></a>Following close on the heels of the sheep farmers and other agricultural workers were some Gulf War veterans who reported very similar adverse health effects following medication with pyridostigmine bromide, a carbamate closely related to OPs, and exposure to OP nerve gas and pesticide sprays. Despite the fact that the US Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses recently concluded that some 25 per cent of Gulf War veterans&#151;25 per cent of more than 6,000 people&#151;are suffering the effects of OP poisoning, the British Government persist in their denial that these same exposures have had any effect on our troops. More recently, airline pilots and crew have reported ill effects following exposure to cabin air contaminated by leaking engine oil that produces very toxic OPs when heated.</p>

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="090617108000022"></a>In all these groups, scientific research has shown consistently that there may be a relationship between long-term, low-level exposure to organophosphates and the development of neurobehavioural problems. The first study of sheep farmers was in 1991, and the latest was published this year. As there have been very few reports of adverse reactions to OP sheep dips in recent years, it is fairly safe to assume that the problems are persistent. It is interesting that Dr Sarah Mackenzie Ross, who conducted the DEFRA-funded research entitled &#147;Neuropsychological and Psychiatric Functioning in Sheep Farmers Exposed to Organophosphate Pesticides&#148;, had to eliminate 60 per cent of possible subjects, all of whom were sheep farmers exposed to OPs, because they had other conditions. Among those eliminated were people with a history of acute exposure; those with a neurological condition such as Parkinson&#146;s disease or multiple sclerosis; heart conditions and lung disease, all of which are associated with possible toxic causation. This means that those in whom she did find neuropsychiatric problems were likely to have been those who had the lowest exposure to OPs.</p>

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="090617108000023"></a>When the Labour Party came into Government in 1997, Ministers from all the departments involved agreed that an interdepartmental group of high-level officials should be formed to report to Ministers on the continuing public debate over whether OPs damage human health. This was the Official Group on Organophosphates, also known as the Carden Committee, although I understand that Mr Carden has since retired. The group reported in 1998 and a number of its recommendations, including a research programme, were implemented, for which I am grateful. I understand that the group has met occasionally since then, the last time being 26 June 2007. As the minutes of its meetings are not published, we have no means of knowing the detail of their discussions.</p>

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="090617108000024"></a>What is clear is that the science has moved on considerably since 1998. The Carden report gives at paragraph 2.2 a simple explanation of the manner in which inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase function, stating that:</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1128"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_93"></a><a name="090617108000040"></a>&#147;In the case of most OPs and all medicinal and pesticidal anticholinesterase OP products the effect is either reversible or recoverable&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090617108000029"></a>It also reminds us that some non-OPs are anticholinesterases and that they have similar toxicity to anticholinesterase OPs, to which I shall come later. There appears to be a genetic susceptibility to OP poisoning. It is recognised that cytochrome P450 enzymes, Paraoxonase-1 and butyrylcholinesterase play important parts in the detoxification of anticholinesterases. It has also been recognised for some time that there are flaws in the traditional methods of assessing exposure to OPs by measuring metabolites for specific OPs in the urine or measuring levels of red blood cell acetylcholinesterase. The scientific paper <I>Identification and Characterisation of Biomarkers of Organophosphorus (OP) Exposure in Humans</I> by Kim et al,<I></I>2009, details,</p>
<ul><a name="090617108000042"></a>&#147;the development of rapid protocols for extraction of the target biomarker protein from a sample, digesting the enzyme and identifying the OP modified peptide by mass spectrometry&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090617108000030"></a>The authors go on to state:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_94"></a><a name="090617108000041"></a>&#147;We feel these methods are optimal for filling the void of diagnosing and treating long-term exposures to several ubiquitous OPs&#148;.</p>

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="090617108000025"></a>In the UK, the Government have funded a few neuropsychological function studies and epidemiological studies of shepherds exposed to OPs. None of these has gone into the detail of the US research on sick Gulf veterans. The US neurocognitive studies found similar significantly poorer performance results on veterans who had been exposed to anticholinesterase chemicals to those conducted in the UK on shepherds. Six out of seven projects that evaluated brain structure and function using highly specialised equipment found significant differences between veterans with Gulf War illnesses and healthy controls, although they qualify their results by stating that additional research is needed. I could go on, and those interested in the detail will find it in the US RAC report of last November. In view of the fact that providing scientific proof has been a virtual impossibility for those who are suffering the effects of OPs, may I ask the Minister how many of the most recent developments have been accepted in the UK?</p>

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="090617108000026"></a>I cannot express adequately the effect that the somewhat apathetic attitude of those who are responsible for ensuring our health and safety over the past 20 years has had. By failing to study individuals who report symptoms after more than a minute exposure to OPs in the initial stages and by failing to conduct longitudinal studies, they may well have exposed many sick people to at least a poor quality of life or at worst an early death. My own experience has taught me that there is an almost total lack of understanding of the life-threatening heart and lung function damage and of the effects of administering drugs that act on the acetylcholine system. The Health and Safety Executive&#146;s leaflet MS17, <I>Medical aspects of work-related exposures to organophosphates</I>, warns of the effects of repeated absorption of small doses of OPs. However, I can find no warning to the medical profession of the effects of administering any of a wide range of drugs that may have a similar action. First-line drugs for bladder incontinence, asthmatic symptoms and

<a name="90617-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="090617108000027"></a>Is the Minister able to say how much research has been conducted into the effects that drugs which act on the acetylcholine system have on patients who have reported illness following exposure to organophosphate pesticides? If he knows of none, does he agree that this is an important consideration for a large number of agricultural workers, Gulf War veterans and aircrew? Should this not be an urgent consideration?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="090617108000028"></a>I have made a brief outline of some of the reasons why I believe that the Official Group on Organophosphates should reconvene.

I also ask that on this occasion it produces a report on the lines of its 1998 report.</p>

Basically, the simple answer to her question should be yes. I am not going to go into all the background details because I am not as up-to-date as I was when I was one of the Ministers responsible in 1997-99 and then again from 2006-08 in one department, but the fact that this issue goes across departments is the central point that I wish to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="090617112000002"></a>As the noble Countess has said, there has been progress. The lack of exposure today is a result of the work that has been done by the industry, pushed by our officials in the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, in producing better containers from which people could not by accident, irrespective of negligence, be contaminated. There is no question that this was a serious issue in the past. However, this means that no new people from farming are coming into the system for the doctors and the scientists to look at. As I say, the problem transcends that, but there has been stagnation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="090617112000003"></a>When we considered this problem in MAFF from very early on in 1997 and 1998, I had discussions with the then Minister, Jack Cunningham, who, with his background as a chemist, took it very seriously. We picked up from other departments that there were issues across government in regard to chemicals. Richard Carden&#151;who, as the noble Countess said, has retired&#151;would take some pleasure in seeing the Carden Committee reconvened. He was a first-class civil servant, in my experience, at MAFF and he chaired a large Whitehall committee which covered many more departments than one would imagine. Obviously, as I moved around Whitehall I did not keep up to date over the years. I regret that the committee&#146;s deliberations have not been made public and I can see no good reason for that.</p>

This problem should be the first thing on Professor Bennington&#146;s desk and he should look at it to see what the current situation is. There are grounds for considering it.

That is the point that I want to make.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="090617112000005"></a>In a way, the Carden Committee and what was put together could overcome and answer some of these issues. They go across Whitehall departments. I do not want the Government to be in the dock over them but a pattern has emerged over a period&#151;there may be others of which I am unaware&#151;that there is a reluctance to investigate. Why? &#147;Oh, because there are no new cases; because of the issue of compensation; because the science is not quite clear&#148;. Given what has happened in the United States in the first 100 days, if these matters were put to President Obama I can envisage some executive action coming forth. Not by overdoing the science or taking the scientists&#146; view, but by giving the issue a push, a spurt, to ensure that we can put it to bed.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="090617112000006"></a>There is plenty of evidence&#151;I do not think complete solutions will ever be found&#151;from those who have been injured, if I can put it that way, in the farming industry, from those with Gulf War syndrome and from the issue of the fuel used in aircraft to ensure that the doubts about the use of organophosphates remain. These are matters worthy of investigation. In the way that it does, Whitehall did some joined-up thinking on this. There was genuine joined-up working in the way in which the Carden Committee was put together and worked. I pay tribute to that and I have no problem with it.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="090617112000007"></a>I was on the receiving end over a 10-year period of delegations which included the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, and the noble Countess, Lady Mar. I said to officials on one occasion&#151;I think it was in 2006 or early 2007&#151;after the noble colleagues had left, &#147;One day I will be a Back-Bencher and she is my model&#148;. That is true. The noble Countess has shown great tenaciousness in pushing this issue&#151;it is not a vested interest, although she has been affected in many ways&#151;getting to grips with it and not accepting no for an answer. In this case, Whitehall and the Government reached out.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="090617112000008"></a>I do not know whether it is time to call for Carden, who is well away into retirement&#151;I shall not mention what part of the country he is in but I had a nice letter from him when I left government, so I know he keeps a watch on what is going on&#151;but I hope the lawyers will not make the final decision; it is important that it is made on the grounds of science and health. The Government have a public responsibility and a duty of care in all these issues. In allowing products onto the market, however they are used, the Government have a duty of care. It may be that people will say, &#147;We have solved all the problems&#148; but, nevertheless, there are too many unanswered questions. It is probably time, given the Whitehall committee structure, genuinely to say to the noble Countess tonight that the answer to her question should be yes.</p>

We have over many years worked together on this issue and I congratulate the noble Countess, in particular, on her extraordinary mastery of the facts. My only concern about her case is that she sometimes thinks OP has affected her brain power. However, there is no evidence of that in the way in which she contributes to the debates of your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="090617112000010"></a>I should put on record that the right honourable Michael Meacher, who has also been a Minister in the department principally responsible for this issue, has been a doughty campaigner, as has the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, in seeking justice for those who suffer from OP poisoning.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="090617112000011"></a>As has already been mentioned, since 1992 and through to 2005 I convened an all-party parliamentary group containing Members of your Lordships&#146; House and Members of the other place, from all parties and from all parts of the country, to deal with this issue.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="090617112000012"></a>The problem originally arose with sheep farmers&#151;in my case sheep farmers in the south-west, who I represented&#151;and every improvement in the controls placed on the use of OPs and every time more protective measures were placed on their use and on the people who were going to use them was, effectively, an admission that the previous arrangements were inadequate. Of course, the previous arrangements were forced upon sheep farmers by government decree. It was not like thalidomide, where people voluntarily took on a particular form of treatment and then there were difficulties. Sheep farmers had to use OPs&#151;twice a year, under the original arrangements. The Government, as well as those responsible for manufacture, had not just a moral but a legal responsibility for the use of organophosphates.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="090617112000013"></a>As has been said, and this is a good moment to make this point again, there is a responsibility for joined-up government. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker&#151;at the instigation, I would like to think, of others outside&#151;took up that challenge and made sure that it happened, and the Carden Committee was the effective vehicle for that purpose. It was not down to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or, as it became, Defra. It was not down to the Ministry of Defence, in the case of the 1991-92 Gulf War&#151;I should perhaps declare a non-pecuniary interest as a member of the Royal British Legion Gulf War Group. It was not down to the Department for Transport, in the case of the BAe146 aircraft that has proved to be most controversial in this case, where the bleeding into the cabin of some of the OP lubricants in the engine seems to have caused huge problems and considerable risk. Not a single one of those departments can carry the can for the difficulties that have occurred, because every one of them had some responsibility. Hence the significance of the interdepartmental committee to which the noble Countess&#146;s Question refers&#151;that was our hope for joined-up government. Now it has not sat for some 24 months, so what is going on? Is there any joined-up government at all now?</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="090617112000014"></a>The Carden Committee should be reconstituted because there are urgent questions now across government.  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1132"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>In the case of the Ministry of Defence, there has been, as the noble Countess said, an inaccurate response to the research that has been undertaken in the United States, a point that I shall come back to. It is urgent to look at the implications for the British troops who were there serving on our behalf, and who suffered as a result of their service in the Gulf.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="090617112000015"></a>In the case of Defra there is an urgent responsibility to ensure that proper funding is put into the remaining research proposals, particularly those that are under the auspices of Dr Sarah Mackenzie Ross, who is the principal researcher in this field. As the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, implies, every day there are people who should be analysed for this purpose but who may no longer be with us.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="090617112000016"></a>Then there is the issue of transport. It was not just the BAe146, although the problem seemed to occur particularly on that aircraft; there are wider issues there. As yet, thank goodness, there has not been a disaster, but there could easily have been one if the impact of these chemicals&#151;which, after all, started their life as part of the Nazis&#146; war effort&#151;had continued to be sprayed around aircraft cabins and cockpits in aerosol form. The potential for disaster is considerable.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="090617112000017"></a>My bitter and, I fear, rather cynical experience, after 17 or 18 years of campaigning on this issue, is that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, seems to be right: there is a built-in systemic lethargy that means that eventually, if you string out the research programme long enough, which is what the manufacturers of these products want to do, either the OP products can be replaced by something else so that there is no longer a commercial problem for the manufacturers; compensation can be avoided because you continually block liability claims; or, frankly, the victims die. Understandably, it is that lethargy, stringing out the process, that the victims feel is going on in Whitehall. It would be a tragedy if the considerable efforts made by the noble Lord and others in Whitehall&#151;Michael Meacher being another&#151;to try to create a genuine link-up and real joined-up government came to a full stop, simply because Mr Richard Carden had retired.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="090617112000018"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to give us a cast-iron assurance that the committee will be reconstituted and will give practical expression to the determination of the Government to get to the bottom of this problem. Again, I underline the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker: imagine if this were in the United States under the present President. In fact, we do not have to imagine; a new imperative has been put behind the research programme into OPs by President Obama. Let us therefore take something from across the Atlantic that we can put to good use in this country. Let us have some joined-up government here. I warmly support the noble Countess.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="090617112000019"></a>I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has rejoined the human race by coming off the government Front Bench and is now able to use his persuasive powers on his colleagues. I hope that we will have evidence in a minute that he is as persuasive as he ever was in the Government.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="090617112000021"></a>I thank the noble Countess, Lady Mar, for initiating this short debate as part of a campaign that has been going on since long before I came to this House. With the noble Countess, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and my noble friend Lord Tyler, I feel as though I am among some of the political giants as far as this issue is concerned. My interest in OPs, particularly sheep dips, came about a bit less than 10 years ago when Chris Davies MEP took me up a track on the Saddleworth moors to see Mrs Brenda Sutcliffe, an equally doughty campaigner on OPs in a rather different way, bashing away on what was then her manual typewriter. She is still there and still campaigning, and long may she do so as long as this issue needs resolving.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="090617112000022"></a>I shall refer to the most recent piece of research on OPs and sheep dips, which comes from Dr Sarah Mackenzie Ross of University College London on behalf of Defra&#146;s project VM02302 on which, over the past six or seven years, the department has spent nearly &#163;500,000. The project was mooted earlier; it started in August 2004 and ended in 2008, last year. The purpose of the study was to determine whether low-level exposure to organophosphates caused disabling neurological or psychiatric disease in a small sub-group of exposed persons. The significance of this project is that it is concentrated on low-level exposure over a period of time rather than on a higher level and the more acute problems presented by most of the people who have come forward as victims of OPs.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="090617112000023"></a>The participants in the study&#151;there were originally 160 but there ended up being 132&#151;are working farmers and farmers who retired on the grounds of ill health and who have a history of exposure to sheep dip. They were compared with a control group, a comparison group, of rural police workers, in an attempt to find similar people in the community who had not been particularly exposed to organophosphate pesticides. That group began as 80 but ended up as 79. The participants were recruited from the south-west and the north of England. My understanding is that the study has been completed&#151;certainly the executive summary has been published&#151;and that we are waiting for the full report to be peer-reviewed. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that. It is with Defra and we are waiting to see what Defra is going to do about it.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="090617112000024"></a>The results of this study of low-level exposure were that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95"></a><a name="090617112000127"></a>&#147;A range of emotional, physical and cognitive problems were identified in agricultural workers with a history of low level exposure to OPs. In terms of cognitive function, general intellectual ability, reasoning, visio-spatial and verbal ability were relatively well preserved, but agricultural workers obtained lower scores on tests of response speed, working, verbal and visual memory, mental flexibility and fine motor control, than non-exposed controls&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090617112000122"></a>The report also compared these results with the general population and found a similar difference. The report says that,</p>
<ul><a name="090617112000159"></a>&#147;a number of significant correlations were observed between duration of exposure and verbal and visual memory, verbal ability, strategy making and fine motor control. Although weak, they were in the expected direction, consistent with findings from the group analyses and consistent with study hypotheses.&#148;</ul>



<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1134"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="090617112000025"></a>I am not sure that I understand these words, but I think they mean that there was a correlation and the findings were significant. The recommendation is that follow-up studies should be carried out to determine whether symptoms persist over time, improve or worsen, and to look into recommended treatment protocols for individuals who report chronic ill health following exposure to OPs. This is one reason why the official committee should be reconvened. It is suggested that there is a need for prospective treatment trials. That is from Dr Mackenzie Ross.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="090617112000026"></a>Defra has responded. I have looked at the Defra website and failed to find it, but that may be because I am not very good at negotiating websites, or it may not be there. I read in the <I>Western Morning News</I> that a Defra spokesman said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_96"></a><a name="090617112000128"></a>&#147;The results of this report do not definitively demonstrate that organophosphates cause chronic ill-health, but suggest that a relationship may exist&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="090617112000027"></a>I think that is what Dr Mackenzie Ross is saying&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_97"></a><a name="090617112000129"></a>&#147;It is not possible to draw conclusions on the basis of one report without considering a wider context of published data on OPs and human health&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090617112000123"></a>That seems to be a fairly weak response from Defra, of the kind that previous speakers have suggested has been forthcoming over the years. It seems to me, again, to be a reason why the committee should be reconvened and should meet to consider these matters. Defra continues to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="090617112000130"></a>&#147;our advice to farmers remains to take all necessary protections including protective clothing and to follow instructions supplied&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090617112000028"></a>That is all very well for people who are around now but it does not really tackle the problem of people who were exposed in the past. I read in my exciting weekly reading, the <I>Farmers Guardian</I>, a quote from Dr Mackenzie Ross herself:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_98"></a><a name="090617112000131"></a>&#147;The worry is that there might be a slow cumulative effect on people. We have got no idea how many people out there are suffering ... There was this idea that low exposure is OK but this research would suggest otherwise. We think it is more dangerous than previously thought&#148;.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="090617112000029"></a>There follows the same quote from Defra, suggesting that it would rather not do very much.</p>

<p><a name="090617112000030"></a>This latest report is important, partly because it confirms that people have been suffering from OPs, but particularly because it looks at the people who have been subjected to low-level exposure, as opposed to those who have been made particularly poorly by a high level of exposure. This is clearly new evidence and clearly a new report. I ask the Minister, first, what will Defra do with this report? What is its response to it, other than trying to tell the papers that everything is really okay? Secondly, in particular, is it not sensible to put it to a reconvened official committee?</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="090617112000032"></a>I can speak only on the use of OPs in agriculture, but I know that concerns can and do stretch into other areas, which have been widely explored in this evening&#146;s debate. However, I can speak with some authority, since not only are OPs used and recommended as a vital sheep dip, they have in the past been used to dip bulbs prior to commercial planting. In the 1960s I personally sterilised bulbs using the nematicide Phagol, which was withdrawn around the middle of that decade. By good fortune, no one&#151;as far as I know&#151;suffered any ill-effects from its use in this way, although a MAFF employee at Kirton EHS died from mercury poisoning, which was part and parcel of a similar operation. Later, in the 1980s, Nemaphos was widely used for similar purposes here and in Holland on tulip bulbs. It, too, was withdrawn. Again, no ill-effects were reported, but environmental considerations and ground water contamination led to its ceasing to be available.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="090617112000033"></a>The work of the noble Countess in battling on this issue is well known, but we need to be careful not to draw the wrong conclusions from this particular issue. I am sure that the Minister will confirm that the Government remain concerned at the change in the definition of pesticides from risk-based to hazard-based. This, regrettably, has been introduced as a European directive, with regulations to follow. This will cut off many vital products. This is particularly true for horticultural growers, of whom I am one. Their permitted use is dependent on off-label approval&#151;testing that manufacturers are not necessarily prepared to pay for. I cannot emphasise strongly enough the role that can be played by horticulture in reviving the productive capacity of the sector.</p>

<a name="90617-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="090617112000034"></a>I may have strayed beyond the strict definition of this debate, but it is important that the principle that we apply to organophosphates is the same: decisions should be based on the science. There is a further point to be deduced from the general to the particular. Any use of chemicals requires the proper respect of the user. At all times operators need to be disciplined in following correct procedures and ensuring their own safety. The most common way for humans to come into contact with OPs, as has been explained in this debate, is through sheep dipping. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, explained fully how this policy came into effect. The Government&#146;s policy towards its uses takes into account factors including the environmental effects and effect on human health of organophosphates. It is good to see the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, in his place and contributing to this debate. We have all missed him, but welcome him back and are pleased that he is participating in his usual robust fashion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="090617112000035"></a>Concern about the use of organophosphates led to the commissioning of the interdepartmental group on organophosphates, known as the Carden Committee. It drew representatives from several government departments, including the Department of Health and the Ministry of Defence, as well as representatives from the veterinary field, health and safety, the Food Standards Agency and the Office for Science and

It has not met since June 2007, which was two years ago. As the noble Countess said, many questions remain unanswered. I can think of several. Has any assessment been made of the effectiveness of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2000&#151;or COSHH in short&#151;when it comes to risk assessments prior to sheep dipping? What further work has been undertaken on finding alternatives to using organophosphate-based products in farming?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="090617112000036"></a>Further to these questions, I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me on two others. How many of the &#147;pour ons&#148; now used in sheep treatment for ecto parasites contain organophosphates? Are the Government satisfied that spreading of waste dip on agricultural ground presents no residual hazard? If ever an issue could benefit from transparency, it is this one. That is why I trust that the Minister will be able to give a positive answer to the noble Countess&#146;s Question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="090617112000038"></a>A number of speakers suggested that the Government have been tardy in responding to these issues out of an unwillingness to commit resources, or from anxiety about compensation that may be payable. Those are unfair charges. The issue is straightforward, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, emphasised; namely, that we must make progress on the basis of the scientific evidence. As I understand it, the problem is that we do not have a secure enough scientific base to know exactly what to do. That is not to say that we are not aware of studies such as the one to which the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, referred. After all, that was commissioned by Defra. I am sorry that the noble Lord did not find the response on the website; I shall give it now. The researcher, Dr Sarah Mackenzie Ross, found that the results suggested there may be a relationship between long-term, low level exposure to OPs and the development of neural behavioural problems. This is an important piece of research but we have commissioned two other research reports as a result of COT&#146;s work in 1999 and we await their publication. We cannot publish them yet because they have not been subjected to peer review and proper scientific vetting and analysis. All these reports, and our response to them, will be produced in the very near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="090617112000039"></a>That brings me to the question: what has happened to the Carden Committee? As the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, indicated, it has changed its name as Mr Richard Carden is now retired. Therefore, the committee reverts to its original title, the Official Group on Organophosphates, which produces the appalling initials OGOP, which I

It would take me more time than is available to me in this debate to list all the contributors to the committee but representation on it is an example of joined-up government. There is not a single government department relevant to this issue that is not actively represented on the committee and forms part of its composition. The only thing that is missing from there is any direct reference to lawyers. Given that it was suggested that they might be the very contributors to delay, I should hope that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, will feel reassured by that omission. Not that I am saying that no lawyers are ever present with a government committee of this kind; I am merely indicating that the legal contribution is not important. What is important is the scientific support and the contribution of the government departments that all have an interest in this area; for example, the Health and Safety Executive, the Food Standards Agency, the Health Protection Agency, the Department of Health, my own department and others. I merely summarise the contributors. I would be happy to publish a list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="090617112000040"></a>When will the committee meet again? It will meet shortly. Noble Lords are right to say that we have not made sufficient progress in the past couple of years to justify the committee meeting. I noted the criticisms made by noble Lords that they were not aware of what the committee did at its 2007 meeting. In 2007, the committee did some very important work. It looked at an Australian review of diazinon. The Australians seemed to have made progress with regard to sheep dips. However, when we examined the progress that they had made we found that it fell short of being a conclusive position that we could adopt. It was clear that where the Australians had tackled issues with regard to sheep dips and offered advice on the basis of their experience, they had not conducted the supervision of sheep dipping in quite the way that we do in the United Kingdom and we could not translate their results directly to our own experience. This conclusion was reached on the basis of very clear analysis of the Australian activity.</p>

<a name="90617-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="090617112000041"></a>Since then, the committee has reviewed the research projects to see whether sufficient progress is being made to bring the group together. I heard that what this country needs in this area is a bit of a zip behind it such as President Obama has produced in the United States. I am at one with the House in thinking that most things good in America at present result from the election of President Obama and the work that he does. He certainly has insisted that additional work is done with regard to Gulf War veterans. That work will produce results in February 2010 because you cannot speed up such work. When that United States research and the other pieces of research I mentioned that we have commissioned, and which have received scientific validation, are completed, our committee will meet and address these issues further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="090617112000042"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, asked about the timescale in the most trenchant terms and asked whether it constituted an exercise in procrastination. That is not the case. This is an exercise in dealing with what we all recognise is a very difficult issue on the basis of making progress and of having a committee which is

I express my concern about that and I am therefore not at all surprised at the anxiety that she expresses on behalf of others who may have come into contact with the problem.

When that issue was presented to me five years ago, I was shocked by the representations that were made. I did my very best to discover the nature of what we knew about this issue, how much had been substantiated and how dangerous it was to passengers and to cabin crew and pilots. My voice would be but a bleat in the wilderness compared to that of BALPA and airline pilots across the world if an aircraft as popular as the HS146 was capable of producing a persistent and threatening illness. HS146 is not grounded on that basis; crews do not refuse to fly the aircraft. I know that there are anxieties about the issue, which needs full investigation. I am not saying that there are grounds for complacency, far from it; the last impression that I want to give from this debate is any suggestion of complacency.</p>

Work on the biological control of the sheep scab mite has been stopped, because it was shown to have no effect when it was used on sheep. Although in the laboratory encouraging progress was made, when it was applied in the field, I am afraid the results were negative. Alternative treatments to sheep scab are available but are not effective against the same range of external parasites as OP sheep dips. That is why we continue with that position.</p>

We put forward similar amendments in Committee, as a way of probing; it will only be a further bit of probing this evening. As I am sure the Minister will remember, the amendments are designed to make sure that all postal votes are checked. Given the amount of fraud in the system, it seems only sensible that that should happen wherever possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="090617112000056"></a>When I moved the similar amendment in Grand Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said in response:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_103"></a><a name="090617112000136"></a>&#147;We agree in principle that all postal votes should be checked, and will wish to require 100 per cent to be checked when it is practicable to do so. A key factor in determining when it will be appropriate to move to 100 per cent checking is when there is deemed to be sufficient capacity within postal voting software systems to support 100 per cent checking&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/5/09; col. GC 435.]</p>

<p><a name="090617112000124"></a>He went on to talk about the then forthcoming elections for the European Parliament on 4 June. As his noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours mentioned earlier, we have had the European elections between Committee and Report. Therefore, while I appreciate that on 17 June it is relatively few days since those elections, it might be useful if the Minister were able to say a little about what the Government learnt from them. I do not mean from a political point of view, as I imagine that they have been feeling fairly sore about them ever since, with a mere 15 per cent of the vote. That is the lowest percentage of the vote that the Labour Party has had in modern history, if we take modern history back to 1919; I see my noble friend Lord Bates nodding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="090617112000057"></a>Even in those couple of weeks, the Government might have learnt something about the need for checking, so I wonder whether the Minister can say what level of checking there was in the different regions. He said that we required at least 20 per cent at the moment; I imagine therefore that 20 per cent were checked, and I look forward to confirmation of that. Can he say  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1141"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whether, in any of those areas, any of the returning officers felt it necessary to go beyond that 20 per cent because they began to think that there might be some fraud? That should be known at this relatively early stage. The same would be true of the local elections, which took place on the same day but were counted a couple of days earlier. Postal voting fraud seems more likely to happen in local elections; obviously, a smaller number of votes can make a big difference. In European elections it would be quite difficult, particularly with the d&#146;Hondt system of counting the votes, for it to make much of a difference in the long run.</p>

<a name="90617-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="090617112000058"></a>As I understand it, county council votes would have been counted on a ward-by-ward basis, which might have indicated to individual returning officers that it might have been better to have checked more than 20 per cent in certain wards. I think that the European votes were counted on a local government basis&#151;roughly in constituencies, sometimes a bit bigger, sometimes a bit smaller. Again, I would be interested to know whether there were any areas where the returning officers felt it necessary to make such checks.</p>

<a name="90617-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="090617112000059"></a>I hope that that is sufficient and that the Minister can give us some idea of what happened, and whether that indicates that there is a need to pursue these amendments at a later stage. I beg to move.</p>

Under amendments made to the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 following the introduction of the 2006 Act, we specified that at elections returning officers were required to check at least 20 per cent of returned postal votes. That is the minimum requirement, but they have a discretion to check 100 per cent if they wish to do so. If the returning officer considers that there is a real risk of fraud, he may specify from the outset that all postal voting statements will be checked. The current statutory provisions also provide the returning officer with the flexibility to begin with 20 per cent checking but to increase that level at later postal vote-opening sessions if any evidence of fraud emerges.</p>

<a name="90617-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="090617112000061"></a>I repeat what I said in Grand Committee: we agree in principle with the desire for 100 per cent of postal votes to be checked and we will make that a statutory requirement once it is safe and appropriate to do so. The regulations for the recent European parliamentary elections followed the provisions for parliamentary and local elections, and therefore required that at least 20 per cent of returned postal votes were checked. However, at the request of the regional returning officers, we made funding available to local returning officers to cover the costs for administrators in checking all returned postal votes.</p>

<a name="90617-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="090617112000062"></a>While we have been supportive of the 100 per cent checking of all returned postal votes, we continue to believe that it would be premature to mandate 100 per cent checking in law at this stage given, as I said in Grand Committee, that we cannot be certain that the necessary software systems are in place to deliver 100 per cent checking across all regions in Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="090617112000063"></a>In order to establish when it will be appropriate to move to mandatory checking of postal votes, it is imperative that we work with the Electoral Commission, electoral administrators and software suppliers to carefully review how the 100 per cent checking of postal votes worked in practice at the European parliamentary elections. For that reason, we do not consider it appropriate today to accept the amendment. It is possible to make the change to mandatory 100 per cent checking of postal votes through amendments to the existing secondary legislation. I want to reassure the noble Lord and other noble Lords that there will be no need to rely on there being a suitable Bill before Parliament for this change to be made. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

However, he did not deal with my principal question, which was whether the Government have learnt any lessons, other than the obvious political lessons, from those elections. Were there any areas where a returning officer at a local or a wider level felt it necessary to make a 100 per cent check? The noble Lord must know the answer, because it obviously happened either on 5 June, when the local election votes were counted, or on Sunday 7 June, when the national votes were counted. The noble Lord&#146;s colleague has returned with some advice; perhaps the Minister can intervene with an answer.</p>

<a name="090617112000067"></a><b><a name="90617-0012.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="090617112000187"></a>Lord Bates:</b> My Lords, the amendment stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Henley. It deals with service registration and would add a new clause to strengthen provision for members of the armed services to be on the electoral register. It might be helpful for the House and for Members who were not present when this matter was discussed in Grand Committee if I offered a few sentences of background before coming to the point that we are concerned about.</p>

<a name="90617-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="090617112000068"></a>Before 2001, service personnel were registered on the electoral register through the Ministry of Defence. This was changed to relieve the administrative burden on the Ministry of Defence and apply a greater focus to local authorities, which were then enabled to remove from the register those who were no longer resident. This period was marked by poor administration, but all service personnel were registered during that time.</p>

<a name="90617-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="090617112000069"></a>The 2001 changes resulted in a number of service personnel not being included in the electoral register and, given the rolling register&#146;s four-week qualification period and a three-week election campaign, many service personnel were disfranchised in the 2005 general election. The number of service voters in Great Britain on 16 February 2001 was 175,475; the figure for 4 December 2006 was 21,000&#151;a reduction of 150,000. That is clearly a cause for concern, particularly given that our Armed Forces are involved in at least two military engagements. They are putting their lives at risk for this country and we certainly feel that they ought to have a say about the policy and the Government who are responsible for dispatching them into those engagements.</p>

<a name="90617-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="090617112000070"></a>Under the terms of the Representation of the People Act 2000, the time limit on the validity of the service declaration for service registration was changed by the Secretary of State from every year to every three years, designed to coincide with the three-year postings which have diminished currency in the current period. Service personnel&#151;and their husbands, wives or civil partners&#151;are currently able to register as an ordinary voter or a service voter. Those based overseas can also register as overseas voters.</p>

<a name="90617-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="090617112000071"></a>Service voters are registered at a fixed address in the United Kingdom, even if they move around. Therefore, if used for those who are moving more frequently, or for those who are likely to be deployed overseas frequently or at short notice, this has a significant impact. That is not to suggest that the Electoral Commission or, indeed, the Government have not been alert to the problems or not taken steps. The Electoral Commission launched an initiative last October specifically aimed at trying to get Armed Forces members to register. There was an attempt to have all 4,000 units hold an electoral registration day in November where attention would be drawn to the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="090617112000072"></a>I come to the principal evidence causing our concern. A survey carried out by Defence Analytical Services and Advice, published in July 2008, surveyed 8,719 service personnel across the three services. It found that only 69 per cent of personnel were registered to vote. Only 62 per cent of Army respondents reported   


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1144"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that they were registered. Some 84 per cent of officers were registers but only 66 per cent of the other ranks. Only 43 per cent of overseas personnel were registered to vote, and 31 per cent of personnel who were not registered to vote said that they did not receive an electoral registration form. Of the units, 70 per cent had still not held a service electoral registration day informing personnel about how to register to vote. That evidence, coupled with the massive fall-off in Armed Forces members registering to vote, was the cause of our concern.</p>

<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="090617112000073"></a><b><a name="90617-0013.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="090617112000188"></a>Lord Bach:</b> My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord will not mind giving way. We were very impressed by what he had to say about this in Grand Committee, and he is making the same points tonight. As he says, the Ministry of Defence is making real efforts to ensure that more service personnel are registered. I should point out that the figures, which have come down so much, do not take account of the number of people in the services who have put their own names on the register at their home addresses, as they are entitled to do. The noble Lord is right to say that there has been a decline, but not by that amount.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="090617112000074"></a>I will listen very carefully to what the noble Lord said both last time and tonight. He knows that the existing regime allows the period to be varied by up to five years by order, instead of the three years at which it stands at the moment. In respect of members of the Armed Forces and their spouses or civil partners, if the view is reached on consideration of the evidence that a longer or shorter period would be beneficial, we think that it would be important to retain that flexibility. We think that to allow it for ever, as the amendment provides, would automatically make the register inaccurate. Therefore, in response to his comments and his concerns about lower registration rates, we intend to extend the service declaration period from three years to five years. An increase to five years offers the additional benefit of being the same period as the one in which postal voters must provide new identifiers. Indeed, the service voters&#146; registration form, as issued by the Electoral Commission, includes a postal vote application.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="090617112000075"></a>I am sorry to interrupt him. I do so in order to tell him that we are prepared to make that concession because of his advocacy this evening. I hope that may assist him in continuing with his arguments.</p>

<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="090617112000076"></a><b><a name="90617-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="090617112000189"></a>Lord Bates:</b> My Lords, I am happy to take such interventions at any time. It is a very welcome intervention and I thank the Minister. He is always extremely courteous and thoughtful and he pays attention to the debates. It is very encouraging that he is making that proposal.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="090617112000077"></a>The proposal to have no time limit is essentially an attempt to return to the state that existed before 2001. I recognise that changes have come into place and I recognise the importance of having an up-to-date and accurate electoral register. The Minister&#146;s offer of an increase from three years to five will therefore be widely welcomed not only by service personnel but by their families. It is one way of ensuring that their voices are heard in future elections. I am very grateful for that reassurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="090617112000078"></a>Perhaps I may push my luck just a fraction further by mentioning that 70 per cent of units have still not held a service electoral registration day informing personnel how to register to vote. I am sure that service personnel will appreciate that they have to go through this exercise only once every five years as a result of the Minister&#146;s welcome concession. However, perhaps I may press him a little further and ask whether he can encourage his colleagues in the Ministry of Defence to make representations&#151;indeed, it would seem appropriate for the Ministry of Defence to issue an order&#151;regarding an electoral registration day so that people know about the changes that have been made and know also that their engagement in the democratic process is of the highest concern to Members on all sides of this House. I am happy to give way at this point or, if other people want to contribute to the debate, perhaps I should sit down and allow that to happen.</p>

<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="090617112000079"></a><b><a name="90617-0013.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="090617112000190"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> My Lords, the Minister will recall that in Grand Committee we, too, were concerned about this issue, and we very much welcome the concession that he has made this evening. I cannot remember whether it was him or his colleague but in Grand Committee the Minister who spoke was pretty adamant that he wanted to stick with the three-year period. Therefore, I am glad that on this issue at least the opposition parties seem to have moved the Minister a little.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="090617112000080"></a>I want to make a couple of additional points. First, I understand that since 2005, which is after all four years ago, the Electoral Commission has been working with the Ministry of Defence on this issue because it, too, has been very concerned about the under-registration of members of the Armed Forces. Can the Minister say how that initiative is progressing, and can he give us an undertaking that, if further recommendations come forward as a result of that exercise, there will be a method by which he can, if necessary, move further without the need for legislation?</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="090617112000081"></a>Secondly, if the discrepancy is anything like the one to which the noble Lord, Lord Bates, referred, then is the Minister serious? After all, in recent years we have been asking young men and women to fight on behalf of the nation in the most appallingly difficult circumstances. Following deployment, the very least that they should expect is every possible assistance to enable them to use their civic right to vote. I cannot think of any situation more frustrating than for a young service man or woman coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan not being able to vote on the big issues affecting the nation today. I am sure that the Minister accepts and supports that view. Therefore, if the Electoral Commission and the MoD feel that further improvements can be made, I hope that there will be ways in which that can be achieved outwith this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="st_170"></a>
<a name="090617112000082"></a><b><a name="90617-0013.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="090617112000191"></a>Lord Craig of Radley:</b> My Lords, I am obviously very interested in this subject. I should like to be quite clear that it is the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence to bring to the attention of all service personnel the current situation, whatever it may be, in relation to voting. At the moment, it seems that one talks about the Ministry of Defence doing this or that, but I should like it to be clearly laid out that it is an MoD responsibility.</p>

I should have praised, or at least mentioned, the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and his colleagues, who also pushed for a change in our line on this. We were always persuaded that there was a problem, even though the numbers have gone up recently, and we always knew that more had to be done. However, as I said, their joint advocacy moved us to believe that we could alter the rules by statutory instrument as soon as practicable in order to change the time limit from three to five years.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="090617112000084"></a>As I understand it, getting members of the Armed Forces on to the register is a joint obligation on the Ministry of Defence and my department, the Ministry of Justice, which has responsibility for elections in general terms. That is the answer to the noble and gallant Lord.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="090617112000085"></a>The question of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, links with the question of the noble Lord, Lord Bates, asking what more we can do. On the information gained from the survey last year, we have redoubled efforts through the annual information campaign to encourage members of the Armed Forces and their families to register to vote and to update their registration details when they move. The campaign will continue to highlight the options for service personnel and their families to register as an ordinary elector or as a service voter; a choice that they can exercise depending on their circumstance.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="090617112000086"></a>Officials at my department will support that work and place particular focus on establishing how the MoD&#146;s joint personnel administration system can help to promote service registration. As noble Lords will be aware, the Electoral Administration Act 2006 placed a duty on the MoD to maintain a record of a service person&#146;s electoral registration record on a voluntary basis. The use of the system is still in its infancy, but responses from service personnel themselves in the 2008 survey suggest that they could be better employed to aid registration. It is clear that more work needs to be done to identify new ways of encouraging service personnel to register. My officials will meet with MoD officials to discuss the matters in more detail, and I am happy to write to noble Lords on the outcome of that meeting so that they will be kept informed about how progress is continuing. I hope that in the light of the offer that I have made to the noble Lord, Lord Bates, he will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

The Minister&#146;s response was clearly that responsibility is shared between the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Defence, in which case responsibility clearly needs to lead to action. It is not acceptable that there is such a large fall-off involved. More needs to happen to realise the aspiration put forward by the Electoral Commission about electoral registration awareness days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="090617112000088"></a>There is a special electoral registration form for armed services personnel which is readily available on the internet. However, there is no substitute for having

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="090617112000091"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, as I am going to refer to some of the local information on Pendle about which the noble Lord, Lord Bates, was asking, I should declare an interest in that I was the Liberal Democrat agent for most of the county council candidates in the recent elections and attended counts on both Friday morning and Sunday evening. The matter raised by the amendment was one I referred to briefly in Committee on a different amendment, but I have now brought it back following the experience in the recent elections as there is a serious problem that needs to be tackled. I am moving the amendment in the hope that it is helpful.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="090617112000092"></a>The amendment requires the returning officer to do two things. First, the returning officer must keep a separate list of those postal votes that have been returned, or where envelopes have been returned but where the votes have not been counted owing to a failure of the personal identifier system. In other words, the personal identifiers are absent, incomplete, or do not match the information that the council holds on file as a result of the application for a postal vote. I should say that I am particularly grateful to Gillian Hartley, who is the Pendle Council elections officer, for helping me to understand how the system works and what happens, and for providing me with the information that I shall offer a little later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="090617112000093"></a>Secondly, the amendment requires the returning officer to write individually to each of the electors whose votes have not been counted because of a mismatch in or absence of the personal identifiers. At

At the moment, two lists are produced after the election, which are available to candidates and political parties under the approved conditions.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="090617112000094"></a>The first is the marked register, which shows the people who have turned up at polling stations and been given a ballot paper&#151;and, presumably voted. The second is the postal voters list, which provides a list of those postal votes which have been returned at that election. The postal voters list includes all the envelopes that have been returned, because the list is compiled from information on the envelopes before they are opened and before the votes are opened, so it includes those which are not subsequently counted. The provision of that list, which did not happen before the passing of the Electoral Administration Act 2006, was partly a result of discussion that took place in your Lordships' House on previous legislation, when it became clear that that list was required. Before then, the only list required was of the postal votes issued, not those returned.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="090617112000095"></a>The current system is that if you send a postal vote back, the envelope is returned, received and opened. Inside that envelope, there should be a smaller envelope, sealed up, that includes the ballot paper and the piece of paper that contains the personal identifier. When those personal identifiers are checked&#151;I have to say that Pendle, like most of the councils in the north-west, did a 100 per cent check of postal votes and the returning officer decided to do it last year in view of the controversy over previous postal votes in Pendle&#151;the sheet of personal identifiers comes in, it is fed into the machine that checks them and that computer-type machine checks whether the information about date of birth and signature match the information that the council holds on its records. If the machine thinks that they match, it goes through. If the machine thinks that they do not match, or it is not sure, it is spewed out and on the screen, on the monitor, is displayed the information that the council holds on its records. That is then compared visually and manually by counting staff with the paper that has come in, and they decide whether, yes, they match sufficiently or no, they do not. That is how it actually works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="090617112000096"></a>We discussed this in Grand Committee, I brought evidence from two county councils by-elections this spring in Nelson, which is part of Pendle, in one of which the number of rejected votes, because of a mismatch or absence of identifiers, was more than 5 per cent of the total, and in the other, which was a substantially Asian ward, more than 10 per cent. This year, in the six county divisions within Pendle, which make up Pendle and the area that counted for the European elections, 485 returned envelopes were rejected&#151;in other words, the ballot paper was not looked at and not counted&#151;for failure to provide a matching identifier. In some cases, the identifiers were absent; in some cases, only one of them was there; in most cases, they did not match. This was approximately 4.5 per cent of the total, on a return of postal votes of about 70 per cent.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_118"></a><a name="090617112000151"></a>&#147;The Commission has since July 2007 recommended that the Government should enable Returning Officers and Electoral Registration Officers to access and use data that identifies electors whose postal votes were rejected due to a mismatch of identifiers. This information should be used by the Electoral Registration Officer to write to all electors whose postal votes were rejected due to a mismatch of identifiers, inviting them to provide fresh identifiers. The Returning Officer should also write to any elector where they believe that their postal ballot was used in error by someone other than the elector, advising of the correct process and the possible penalties for malpractice&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090617112000125"></a>Whether these figures show that people are simply making a mess of the system, or whether they show that, in some cases at least, there are attempts at voting fraud which have not succeeded because the postal vote identifier system is working, there is a problem. If one in 20 or one in 10, or something of that order&#151;450 votes across the borough&#151;are being sent in by people expecting them to be counted, and they are not being counted because the personal identifiers are absent or not matching, there is something wrong.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="090617112000099"></a>It seems to me that this is information to which candidates and political parties should have access after the election, because it is fairly obvious that, in some cases, there may be prima facie evidence of fraud. One of the reasons why candidates and political parties are allowed access to the marked register and the list of postal votes returned is precisely so that they can be investigated, and if people want to challenge an election or ask the police or the returning officer to get involved, they can do so. This seems to be a piece of information that also ought to be available, but at the very least, the electors concerned should be written to, because otherwise there may well be a lot of people who are sending back their votes in good faith, who are making the same mistake time after time. It may be that they have two signatures, and they are just using the wrong one&#151;they are using their personal signature and not their cheque-book signature or whichever way around it is&#151;and votes are being lost. There is, therefore, a problem here arising from the system of personal identifiers that was very properly introduced in order to make postal voting a bit more secure. There is a problem and it needs to be addressed.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="090617112000100"></a>My final point is that I am told by Mrs. Hartley that the information on the proportions and numbers of these votes which have been rejected for these reasons are part of the information that is being sent off, she says, to Plymouth. I assume it is the elections centre at the University of Plymouth that is collecting information, as she says, on behalf of the Government. So there ought to be a lot of this information gathered in fairly soon from around the country. It is a serious problem and one that needs to be addressed. This amendment is an attempt to do that. I beg to move.</p>

We obviously have some sympathy with the amendment in that it is designed to help deal with postal voting fraud, which I stress was an important  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1150"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issue in an earlier amendment. We have just three caveats that I shall point out before the Minister responds.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="090617112000104"></a>First, I worry that the amendment could place an excessive burden on the returning officer, and I am interested to know whether the noble Lord has carried out any assessment of the resource implications of the returning officer writing what might be a rather large number of letters, particularly in an area such as Pendle in which, as the noble Lord told us, some 400 or 500 postal votes were held not to be valid.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="090617112000105"></a>Secondly, if the returning officer had to write to each elector setting out why their vote has not been counted, as set out in proposed new sub-paragraph (3) in proposed new subsection (2) in the amendment, and if there was the possibility of a criminal prosecution of this matter later, I worry that anything that the returning officer might say might prejudice the chances of a fair trial. I would need legal advice as to whether that is the case, but no doubt the Minister will respond to that point in due course.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="090617112000106"></a>My third point relates to privacy. Proposed new sub-paragraph (2) in proposed new subsection (2) in the amendment tells us that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_119"></a><a name="090617112000152"></a>&#147;The list of postal votes returned but not counted&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="090617112000126"></a>would be kept and would count as &#147;a relevant election document&#148;. As a relevant election document under Section 42 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006, it would be available for inspection by the public. The noble Lord set out his reasons for that, but presumably&#151;again, I welcome comments on this&#151;it could have a detrimental impact on privacy of the ballot. People should not be able to see a list of those who have spoilt their ballot paper, intentionally or otherwise, so there are dangers in going down this route. Although I have expressed a degree of sympathy for the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, I think that there are one or two problems with it.</p>

<p><a name="st_175"></a>
<a name="090617112000107"></a><b><a name="90617-0013.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="090617112000196"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My Lords, the amendment would require a returning officer to keep information on postal votes that have been rejected because the postal-vote identifiers have not been completed, are incomplete, or do not match the records held on the postal-vote application form. The second part of the amendment would require a returning officer to write to all electors whose postal vote was rejected notifying them of the circumstances in which it was rejected.</p>

<a name="90617-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="090617112000108"></a>I think Members on all sides of the House are concerned to secure every possible improvement that we can to the postal voting system, and the amendment clearly has very good intentions, seeking as it does to ensure that votes cast may be counted and that the integrity of the system is strengthened. These are aims that the Government of course support, but while we may agree on the general intention, I have some concern about the policy prescription set out by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. I am not convinced that compelling a returning officer to write to all electors who have had their postal vote ballot rejected due to a mismatch of identifiers is the correct course of action. In some cases, this may well have the effect simply of alerting would-be fraudsters to the failure of their attempt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="090617112000109"></a>My inclination would be to grant the returning officer discretion so that, when there has clearly been a simple error such as entering the wrong date on the postal vote application or statement, the returning officer might write; but where the returning officer suspects fraud, he or she might consider that notifying the police to investigate is the correct course of action. This judgment should be made in conjunction with administrators and the Association of Chief Police Officers, rather than leaping to a decision that may hinder rather than help attempts to tackle fraud. At this late stage in the passage of the Bill, I do not consider there to be the time available for us to work through the issues so that we can be confident about making a change of this nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="090617112000110"></a>Another matter for further consideration is the question of those electors who do not respond to the letter issued by the returning officer. It may well be desirable for additional follow-up action to take place in this instance in order that the ERO might establish beyond doubt the identity of the individuals residing at that address with a view to ensuring the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the electoral register. However, this is properly a role for the electoral registration officer. Clarifying the powers for returning officers and electoral registration officers to share data for these purposes is another area which would need careful consideration. Rightly, there are clear provisions in law concerned with the safe disposal and secrecy of election documents. It would be all too easy to implement a change in the legislation which sought to provide access to election records for one purpose, but which inadvertently compromised the safety and secrecy of the information that those records contained.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="090617112000111"></a>On the provisions for dealing with election documents, I should also make it clear that the amendment put forward by the noble Lord is defective. It provides that the proposed list should be regarded as a relevant election document for the purpose of Section 42 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006. However, this section provides for access to election documents in relation to elections other than parliamentary elections. Corresponding provision in respect of parliamentary elections is made in rules 55 to 57 of the parliamentary elections rules.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="090617112000112"></a>I am sorry that I cannot give the noble Lord, Lord Henley, any answers, but his questions make the point that the Government would make. It is not straightforward. We would need to understand the size of the burden, the implications for a successful criminal prosecution and the implications for the whole area of privacy.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="090617112000113"></a>To summarise, we agree that there is merit in the intention behind the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, but we are concerned that the right measures are put in place and we would wish to consult more widely before bringing forward proposals. I note from its briefing that the Electoral Commission supports the intention of the noble Lord. However, I understand that it shares our concerns about moving to legislation without due consideration of the issues at hand. The Government will therefore undertake to consider this issue with the

On this basis, I would ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I agree with a great deal of what the Minister has said, particularly about the potential tension between, on the one hand, when a returning officer or an electoral registration officer writes to people to say, &#147;Sorry you have made a mistake. You ought to know this because you are losing your vote&#148;&#151;accidentally, presumably&#151;and, on other hand, when they think that it might be evidence of fraud. I thought about that issue before writing this amendment, but I came to the view that it would be best to put down a simple amendment in order to raise the issue and in the hope of getting the response that the Minister has given. I am very grateful for that and for his promise. I was getting quite excited until he used the word &#147;stakeholder&#148;, then I lost interest.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="090617112000115"></a>In response to the noble Lord, Lord Bates, I do not think that there will be a huge administrative burden. There will be a little extra administrative burden because when someone applies for a postal vote&#151;at general elections a lot come in at the last minute&#151;the returning officers write to people to check that they want it and that it is okay. Election offices are full of computers which are for ever churning out letters and envelopes. They do that all the time&#151;perhaps they do it too much. Nevertheless, it is not a huge question. On the privacy and secrecy of documents, it is important that lists of everyone who has voted and everyone who has returned a postal vote envelope are produced, just like those that are produced at the moment.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="090617112000116"></a>The noble Lord referred to spoiled ballots. We are not talking about spoiled ballot papers, but those that have not even been looked at. I agree that a spoiled ballot paper should never be divulged because that is the way someone has voted, but here we are talking about ballot papers that have not been looked at or counted, so no one knows if they have been spoiled because they are still in their envelopes, having never been opened.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="090617112000117"></a>The Government said that they would work through these issues. Instead of waiting for the next election before introducing legislation, I wonder whether it might be possible to deal with this through secondary legislation by introducing statutory instruments to amend the election rules. I would ask the Government to look at that once they have carried out the consultation. However, I am very encouraged by what the Government have said and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The name of my party, UKIP, which came last alphabetically on ballot papers, was folded over at the back of a large number of them. The result was that many hundreds of voters blocked our call centre saying that they could not find UKIP on the ballot paper and either asking what to do or telling us that they had voted for another party. I appreciate that a number of noble Lords may feel that this could not have happened to a nicer party, but it is worth recording that Mr Nick Griffin of the BNP won his seat from us in the north-west by only 1,300 votes.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="090617112000119"></a>The problem appears to have been at its worst in the south-east, where I understand that we may have been denied another seat. It is certainly true that we received a great many complaints from voters in East Sussex, especially Bexhill; from West Sussex, especially around Worthing; from Hampshire, especially in Farnborough; and from Surrey, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, especially in Aylesbury. Such inquiries as we have been able to make indicate two main causes: machine folding, perhaps before the ink was dry, by printers supplying local returning officers, and the manual folding of ballot papers by polling clerks. This latter practice is encouraged by the Electoral Commission in its guide to polling station staff. Machine folding by printers appears to have been a major problem in Yorkshire, while manually folded papers caused serious problems in the eastern region and the West Midlands.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="090617112000120"></a>Following a complaint from our party leader, Mr Nigel Farage, the commission did issue guidance on 4 June that all ballot papers should be handed out unfolded, but this followed only very late in the day, sometimes as late as 9 pm, and does not appear to have been generally followed at all in the north-west. As things stand at the moment, the onus appears to be on UKIP to discover exactly what happened and where, and if it can muster sufficient evidence, to mount a petition to the commission for a re-run. This is a prohibitively expensive task and one, I submit, that should not fall to the affected party but to the commission. I would have hoped that, at the very least, the commission would find out how many ballot papers with UKIP over the back were machine folded and where they were distributed, and how many were folded at polling stations. I would have thought that the commission should also employ a good independent psephologist, if it does not have one in-house, and publish an objective report drawing on all these inputs. If anything like this happens in the future, surely the commission should sort it out, not the damaged party. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s view on these questions.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="090617112000121"></a>I also wonder whether the commission should be empowered to oversee and direct regional and local returning officers on the printing, distribution and handling of ballot papers, especially when the list of candidates is as long as it was in many areas on 4 June. I understand that the commission does not think that

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="0906185000002"></a>One of the consequences of the ever expanding list of parties seeking election under our proportional representation system for European elections is that the ballot paper is ever lengthening. An interesting point has been raised as to whether someone needs to think&#151;forgive the pun&#151;outside the box on this and consider whether the shape of the current ballot paper is the right one. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment, which I assume is a probing amendment, might not be able to answer the point. If a burden is placed on people to ensure that papers are not folded, it might lead to disputes in polling stations. If a paper were folded there could be a discussion about whether it was done by one of the polling clerks or by the elector. I can foresee many such disputes.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="0906185000003"></a>The noble Lord raises a valid point. If he cannot find satisfaction on this issue, he might consider changing his party&#146;s name so that it appears further up the ballot paper. However, I do not wish to be guilty of giving too much assistance to him.</p>

<a name="0906185000004"></a><b><a name="90617-0014.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0906185000166"></a>Lord Bach:</b> My Lords, the amendment seeks to ensure that all ballot papers are handed out in polling stations with the paper flat in order to prevent the problem of folded papers potentially hiding the names of candidates from the sight of electors. The amendment would require the Electoral Commission to monitor whether that was done and to report on it, and to assess any adverse impacts if and when it was not done.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="0906185000005"></a>Clarity for the elector and a level playing field for the parties are of course important factors, and I fully understand why the noble Lord has brought forward his amendment. It cannot be right that the nature of the production of a ballot paper, or any other element of the administration of an election, should adversely impact on how electors vote or on the results for a party or candidate. In this instance, I understand that the production of the ballot papers with machine folds had caused the bottoms of the papers in some areas of two regions&#151;Yorkshire and the Humber and the South-East&#151;to be bent upwards. It is reported to have potentially obscured the names of one or a number of candidates so that they were not apparent to electors as they marked their votes. There are, however, large versions of the ballot paper posted up in all polling stations to assist voters in making their choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="0906185000006"></a>As I understand it from officials, action was taken to address the issue on 4 June, once the concerns of the noble Lord and his party were raised in the morning. Indeed, I had the pleasure of speaking to the noble Lord that morning in the environs of this Chamber. This included the local returning officers in relevant areas being asked to ensure that ballot papers were

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="0906185000007"></a>The ballot papers for the elections were very long due to a significant number of candidates standing. For ease of transport and handling, I am told, they were folded to fit into cardboard boxes. That in itself is not a problem; rather, as the Government understand it, it is the position and nature of the folds that may have caused an issue in this instance. In fact, the Electoral Commission&#146;s guidance, as contained in the handbook that it produces for polling station staff, actively suggests that the practice of folding the completed ballot paper before it is put in the ballot box in the polling station is maintained to ensure the secrecy of the vote. So perhaps we should pause before moving to legislate in the manner proposed by the noble Lord. However, I suspect that this is a probing amendment and, if I may, I will treat it as such. I am therefore not going to criticise its wording because that would just be to waste time.</p>

It is right that we await the outcome of that report and consider the most appropriate way forward in the light of evidence. Pending receipt of that report and consideration of its conclusions, however, we think that the issue is best addressed for the moment by identifying best practice and issuing clear revised guidance on the production, supply and handling of ballot papers.

I accept that greater secrecy is achieved by folded ballot papers, and I am also aware that there were large versions of the ballot paper in the polling booths. That did not stop hundreds of people ringing in and saying that they did not understand how to vote for UKIP. It is true, as I think I mentioned in my remarks, that the Electoral Commission issued instructions, and I am most grateful to the Minister for his interest on the day in question. It is also true, though, that those instructions did not appear until very late in the day. I hope that before Third Reading I will be able to get a better idea of what the commission proposes to do in this case. In the mean time, though, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="0906185000012"></a><b><a name="90617-0014.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0906185000169"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My Lords, I am moving these amendments today as they are necessary to the successful implementation of the co-ordinated online record of electors, or CORE, scheme. The amendments are essential to ensure that there is authority to create a new non-departmental public body to fulfil the role of the CORE keeper. Until November 2008 it was intended that the Electoral Commission would fulfil this role, and the Electoral Administration Act 2006 makes provision for that. Following the recommendations from the Committee on Standards in Public Life, however, the commission is seeking to refocus its functions and concentrate on enhancing its regulatory role. The Government agree with the commission that this is the right thing to do.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="0906185000013"></a>Furthermore, the Government have now brought forward our proposals for the introduction of a scheme of individual registration. It is quite likely that we will require a central point through which electors&#146; personal identifiers, such as national insurance numbers, may be validated with the relevant authority, and CORE may provide that service. Such a role does not currently fit with the Electoral Commission&#146;s redefined regulatory role, but it is important that the public body taking on this role is demonstrably independent from government. In bringing these amendments forward, therefore, we will ensure that the CORE scheme can be delivered without delay, and that the necessary infrastructure can be developed to facilitate the introduction of individual registration.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="0906185000014"></a>The new clause that is brought in by Amendment 85 inserts new Section 3A into the 2006 Act to enable the Secretary of State, by order, to establish a new non-departmental public body in the form of a corporation sole with a view to its being designated by a CORE scheme as the CORE keeper.</p>

<a name="90617-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="0906185000015"></a>This type of body is considered appropriate for three reasons. First, it would comprise a single office-holder, meaning that there is an identifiable decision-maker  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1158"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for accountability purposes. This is regarded as important because the CORE keeper&#146;s functions under the 2006 Act will include the receiving and processing of electoral registration information from EROs. Secondly, it would achieve the right balance between daily operational independence and accountability to Parliament via the Secretary of State, who would appoint the office-holder. Finally, a single identifiable decision-maker is similar in concept to an electoral registration officer, and is therefore a model that is established and well understood within the electoral administration field.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90617-0015.htm"/>


<a name="90617-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="0906185000016"></a>Taking a power to create the corporation sole in secondary legislation is designed to provide an appropriate degree of flexibility so that the precise detail of the structure and operation of the body, and the timing of its creation, can be developed consistently with the CORE scheme order. The amendment provides for necessary matters of detail concerning the creation of the corporation sole to be addressed in the order, and makes provision for a number of matters that would be consequential on the establishment of the corporation sole. In particular, it amends Section 1(10) of the 2006 Act expressly to provide that a person designated as the CORE keeper under the CORE scheme must be a corporation sole established under the new power, or some other public authority. This preserves the ability for another public authority to take on the role of CORE keeper if that is considered appropriate in the future. It also provides for an order establishing the new corporation sole to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and provides that, before the order can be made, the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner must be consulted. These requirements are designed to ensure that the order will be subject to a high degree of scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="0906185000017"></a>Moving on to the other amendments, Amendment 86 is intended to provide additional protections around access to the electoral register from the CORE keeper. The effect of current provisions in the 2006 Act is that the regulations governing the supply of the electoral register by EROs will also apply to the CORE keeper, subject to any modifications that the Secretary of State considers appropriate. This means that bodies entitled to receive copies of the electoral registers and related information from EROs will be entitled to receive the same information from the CORE keeper, subject to the same restrictions on access and use. This does not expand the range of bodies with access to the registers, but the creation of the CORE scheme would enable the registers to be accessed from a single source on a national scale. In light of this, specific arrangements may be required where information is supplied by the CORE keeper to ensure that the provision of data is appropriate. Accordingly, Amendment 86 supplements the Secretary of State&#146;s existing power to modify the application of the regulations by enabling additional or different conditions to be imposed on the supply of material by the CORE keeper.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="0906185000018"></a>Amendment 87 relates to Section 3 of the Juries Act 1974, which currently requires EROs to supply copies of the register for the purpose of jury summoning. Once the CORE system is operational, it may be more efficient and convenient for the registers to be supplied on a national scale by the CORE keeper, rather than  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1159"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by each individual ERO. Accordingly, this amendment takes a power to amend Section 3 of the Juries Act to provide for this, but it would not allow anyone who is not already entitled to access the register from EROs to do so from the CORE keeper.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="0906185000019"></a>Finally, Amendment 88 extends the Secretary of State&#146;s existing powers in relation to the CORE scheme order so that the order can authorise information sharing between the CORE keeper and the Electoral Commission. As I have already detailed, the original intention was for the Electoral Commission to be the CORE keeper. However, now that this is not to be the case, it is important that the CORE keeper is able to furnish the commission with information that is relevant to its functions. It is envisaged that the power may be exercised to enable the CORE keeper to provide the Electoral Commission with statistical reports, for example, regarding registration patterns or the number of notifications made by the CORE keeper to EROs about circumstances that may be indicative of absent voter fraud or other improprieties. The power may also be used to enable the CORE keeper to inform the commission where an ERO has failed to report back to the CORE keeper on steps taken to investigate potential instances of fraud or other improprieties, as may be required in the CORE scheme order. I beg to move.</p>

Many of these, with the exception of Amendments 90, 91, 92, 99, 100, 101, 114 and 117, are minor technical changes that tidy up the way that these clauses are intended to work and I do not propose to say anything about them. There are also a small number of more significant changes that I will describe shortly. I do not think that I need to go into detail at this hour about the importance of the shift to individual registration, which as a principle I know has the support of all the main parties in the House. It marks a significant point in the evolution of our electoral registration processes in Great Britain.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="0906185000021"></a>I wish to mention briefly five changes. The first concerns Amendment 90, which amends Clause 27(2)(d) to broaden the purposes for which EROs can check information provided from the national insurance number (NINO) database during the voluntary phase of individual registration. The purpose of this amendment is to give EROs more flexibility in using data from the NINO database, while also ensuring that data are used only for appropriate purposes relating to checking a person&#146;s entitlement to vote.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="0906185000022"></a>Amendment 91 provides for the disclosure of information by the CORE keeper to a registration officer for the purposes of registration. Amendment 101 introduces a requirement for registration officers to provide assistance to the Electoral Commission for the purpose of compiling their reports, and thus is very close to what the Official Opposition are looking for in their Amendment 96. In practice this is likely to cover the provision of information that the commission is likely to require. The Electoral Commission specifically asked if we might include this requirement in our legislation.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="0906185000023"></a>Amendments 99 and 100 make a number of amendments to the steps the Secretary of State needs to take in the event that there is not a positive endorsement of the shift to individual registration in 2014 by either the Electoral Commission or Parliament. If noble Lords require more detail on those amendments, I shall be happy to give them that information. Those are the government amendments in short. I shall now sit down as I know that there are opposition amendments in this group. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="0906185000025"></a>As regards Amendments 96 and 97, in light of what the noble Lord said about achieving most of what we were trying to do in those amendments, and in view of

As regards Amendment 98, I make it clear again, as we did in Committee, that we still find it odd that the Government are trying to insist that nothing can go ahead before 2014, whatever happens. That is why we strongly support the amendment in the name of the noble Lords, Lord Tyler and Lord Rennard, myself and my noble friend Lord Bates. That amendment makes it clear that if the commission believes that an appropriate assessment has been made, as provided by subsection (4)(a), a recommendation can then be made that the process should go ahead. Most of us, being rather cynical, suspect that there are political motives behind this and that we are not allowed, if things are ready, to move ahead of the date 2014, if that is possible. It might be that the Government have been conservative, and it might not be possible to get things moving by 2014, but it might be that we are easily ready for that date. When the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, comes to move his Amendment 98, which we are supporting, we will certainly give it our backing. I do not know what the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, intends to do with it at this late hour on a Wednesday evening. If he feels it is inappropriate to divide what I imagine is a fairly empty House at this hour, he might consider coming back to it at Report stage. Certainly, as this is happening at a late hour, we would reserve the right to consider that if it was necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="0906185000027"></a>The integrity of the register is incredibly important and we welcome the moves that the Government are making towards personal identifiers. I think I am right in saying that the Electoral Commission made its recommendations as long ago as 2003. It is a very long time ago; we ought to have made more progress by now. As the noble Lord, Lord Henley, said, the purpose of Amendment 98, standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Rennard and supported by the noble Lords, Lord Henley and Lord Bates, is to try to build back into the Bill a little more flexibility.

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="0906185000028"></a>In Grand Committee, the argument that the Minister gave was that if we were to move more quickly it might conflict with the run-up to the general election. He is obviously greatly better informed that I am, because who knows when the election after next is likely to be? We might indeed find ourselves with a very short Parliament. I was the victim of the very short Parliament in 1974&#151;in and out within eight months. Who knows? I therefore do not regard that argument as being conclusive, unless of course the Government are going to move towards fixed-term Parliaments as part of their package of reform proposals that are due any moment now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="0906185000029"></a>We simply thought that it was sensible to ask the Electoral Commission not to be boxed into a corner of automatically doing nothing until 2014 and that if there was a possibility of moving further and faster, we should do so.

We are not precluding the possibility of waiting until 2014; we are simply saying that if we can move further, faster and earlier we should so.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="0906185000030"></a>I shall listen with interest to what the Minister says on this subject in a moment. I assume that he is going to address that particular point, and then we will have to think very carefully whether it is appropriate to pursue this any further at this late hour, or whether it is more sensible to look at it again, in the light of the Minister&#146;s response, in time for Third Reading.</p>

<a name="0906185000031"></a><b><a name="90617-0015.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0906185000175"></a>Lord Bach:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords. Amendment 98 is an important amendment. It provides the Electoral Commission with a discretion to make an assessment before 2014 of whether the registration objectives would be helped or hindered by a move towards the compulsory collection of personal identifiers. In tandem, it also provides the commission with the ability to make a recommendation before that date on whether the provision of identifiers should be made compulsory. Our proposal is well known.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="0906185000032"></a>Of course, I am aware that some noble Lords believe that we should be moving more quickly towards a system of individual registration. As I argued in Grand Committee, a phased approach is the only way to ensure that this very radical change is made effectively. We should not rush it. The specific timetable we have set out delivers on this phased approach. It has been developed with great care, with due regard to the magnitude of the change and the risks involved. What this timetable allows is, first, sufficient time for the public to acclimatise itself to the change; secondly, time for each and every one of the 400-plus electoral registration officers to adapt to the new system and to ensure that all are working to the level of the best; thirdly, time to investigate and test which public sector databases will be of most assistance to registration officers in targeting people not included on the register; and, finally, time to design the infrastructure for the validation of national insurance numbers, which will underpin the new system. Importantly, the proposed timetable will also allow us to minimise disruption to elections by avoiding, so far as is possible, national and sub-national elections, such as the 2014 elections to the European Parliament.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="0906185000033"></a>In developing that timetable, we have paid careful attention to the Northern Ireland experience when implementing individual registration. That is an important point in my argument. The registration rate fell significantly in Northern Ireland when individual registration was introduced. There is an ongoing debate about why that happened, and at least some of the decrease in the numbers registered in Northern Ireland in 2002 was due to the removal of the carry-forward, but the Electoral Commission&#146;s analysis tells us that the impact of that change was keenly felt among particular groups. It states that individual registration,</p>
<ul><a name="0906185000162"></a>&#147;tended to have an adverse impact on disadvantaged, marginalised and hard-to-reach groups. Young people and students, people with learning disabilities and other forms of disability, and those living in areas of high social deprivation were less likely to be registered and encountered specific problems with the new registration process&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1163"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column 1163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0906185000064"></a>It goes on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_149"></a><a name="0906185000089"></a>&#147;While these findings relate directly to Northern Ireland, they are not unique and reflect the wider picture across the UK. They present a major challenge to all those concerned with widening participation in electoral and democratic processes&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0906185000065"></a>That comment is important.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="0906185000034"></a>We all agree that making the shift towards individual registration is right but, in doing so, we have to ensure that we do not disfranchise large numbers of people who may find the new system more onerous. That becomes especially important when you consider that already an estimated 3 million individuals are not registered to vote. We must do all we can to ensure that that figure does not increase. By taking time to prepare both the system and the public for the change, to analyse registration performance and to develop a better understanding of the issues impacting on registration rates, we mitigate the risk of that outcome. Now more than ever, we need to ensure that we do not take steps that risk discouraging individuals from engaging in our democracy. A more effective and secure registration system is more likely to be achieved by building in time, to ensure to that the factors that I have mentioned can be fully taken into account in a realistic timeframe. That is what our proposal is designed to achieve.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="0906185000035"></a>The work that I have described would be vital to the success or otherwise of the shift to compulsory individual registration. The Electoral Commission&#146;s reports will provide invaluable evidence about registration rates, the performance of EROs and the operation of the system, which will inform our understanding of its preparedness for the change. Without that information, we cannot have a full understanding of whether the system is ready for the shift. We must protect the space for the Electoral Commission to undertake proper and robust analysis during the voluntary phase. It is only on the basis of that evidence that we can be confident that the system can withstand the change.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="0906185000036"></a>If the idea is that a pre-2014 recommendation should be permissible and brought before Parliament if made in favour of individual registration, we would resist that. Furthermore, the existing proposed timetable is a fair balance between the role of the Electoral Commission and that of Parliament. It is right that Parliament should set the agenda for moving towards a compulsory phase, taking into account the recommendations of the commission. A decision as historic as this should be made only after a thorough and informed parliamentary debate.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="0906185000037"></a>The purpose of a phased approach to implementation is to ensure that we take the necessary time to bolster, adapt and improve the current system for registration, in readiness for the major shift in process. Any attempts to introduce individual registration at a faster rate might risk damaging the integrity of the system and, worse still, the public&#146;s confidence in it. If that were to happen in the run-up to a general election, the consequences could be dire.</p>

<a name="90617-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="0906185000038"></a>That is the Government&#146;s argument as to why the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, should not be moved.</p>

I spoke on this issue in our long debate on IVR in Grand Committee. At that point, I said that I did not think that fraud at the ballot box in the form of personation was that serious a problem. I have since been advised that it is, in fact, a growing problem, mainly in local elections, because personation is quite difficult to do in large numbers. However, in houses of multiple occupancy and similar establishments it is often easy for people to pick up a number of different polling cards and use them to vote in the names of other people.</p>

<a name="90617-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="0906185000040"></a>When he responded in Committee, the Minister did not consider this to be a serious problem and did not seem to think that merely providing some proof of identity would necessarily deal with it, because one would have to decide what type of proof of identity would have to be produced. In the previous group of amendments, the noble Lord prayed in aid Northern Ireland legislation. We have taken our amendment from legislation in Northern Ireland whereby voters have to have personal identifiers, but we have left out the bit that specifies the document that would have to be produced by the individual when they turned up at the polling station. We have left it for the Secretary of State to designate that by order.</p>

<a name="90617-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="0906185000041"></a>Most of us normally carry some form of identification that would be enough to stamp out most fraud of this sort&#151;a driving licence or even a credit card. If people were required to take credit cards, which obviously do not have photo ID on them, it would complicate the whole matter and would make it that much harder for them to commit fraud on a large scale, which must be our issue of concern.</p>

They are so used to it that they do not think that this matter should be controversial. Frankly, at this time of night we are not going to have a substantial debate, but we may well wish to return to this issue at Third Reading. I hope that the Minister will give some thought to what could be done, because there is a genuine concern that if we are to move in this direction we need to ensure that it works as effectively as it does in Northern Ireland.</p>

The purpose is to strengthen the security of the voting process at polling stations. Of course, voting at polling stations has traditionally been conducted without the need for any personal identification to be produced.</p>

<a name="90617-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="0906185000045"></a>However, as we have been told, it is an offence to attempt to vote in place of another elector. That is personation. The Electoral Commission has provided guidance for  returning officers on the actions that polling station staff should take if they suspect that a person requesting a ballot paper is not who they claim to be. It has encouraged returning officers to supply copies of this guidance to all presiding officers.  The commission and the Association of Chief Police Officers have also worked together to produce guidance for police officers on how they should respond to any incidents of personation at polling stations.</p>

<a name="90617-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="0906185000046"></a>Any proposal to require voters in polling stations in Great Britain to produce ID as envisaged under the amendment would need very careful consideration. Though the amendment provides for a wide range of documents that may be produced as evidence of identity at polling stations, the Government remain of the view that requiring identification might present considerable barriers to voting at elections for some individuals. I note from the Electoral Commission&#146;s briefing note that it is also of this view, stating:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_188"></a><a name="0906185000128"></a>&#147;While we would welcome such consultation, we believe that the benefits of moving to a system of ID in polling stations would need to be carefully considered before deciding on whether legislation should be introduced, so as to examine the risk that it could disenfranchise some electors&#148;.</p>

<a name="90617-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="0906185000047"></a>The requirement to produce evidence of identity would be a significant change; we must ensure that any approach is aligned with other reforms to the registration and electoral processes that are a part of this Bill. It would be premature at this stage to introduce identifiers in order to vote before we have had the chance to scrutinise the feasibility and any subsequent effectiveness of moving to a system that requires identifiers to be produced in order to register to vote.</p>

<a name="90617-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0906185000048"></a>It is perhaps worth mentioning the recent information published on 1 May by ACPO and the Electoral Commission, which allows us for the first time to examine the extent and nature of allegations of electoral malpractice. From the information published, it is evident that there were 13 alleged cases of personation at the 2008 elections, with no further action being taken in at least six of these cases. While any instance of personation is unacceptable, these figures must be

<a name="90617-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="0906185000049"></a>Our view is that, while not rejecting this out of hand, the available evidence does not justify the potential barriers to voting that the measure proposed by noble Lords might well put in place. This Government are prepared to take forward significant reform of the electoral system as, I hope, the introduction of individual registration clearly demonstrates. The approach we have taken to ensure that we strengthen the integrity of the system on a step-by-step basis, in the light of available evidence, in a way that does not disfranchise those electors who are entitled to cast their vote, is the right one. We do not think this amendment fits in with that. The great worry is that people will turn up at the polling station without any identification and then be turned away. That is the problem that we need to overcome. That is what I have to say on the matter on behalf of the Government tonight. I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I am minded to consider what to do about it in due course. At three minutes past 10, I will spare the noble Lord a Division on this matter, because I suspect that the response that we might get might not be representative of the feelings of the House.</p>

<a name="90617-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="0906185000051"></a>I think that there is a problem here. I have certainly been advised that there is one. I do not think that it would be a problem for people to bring some form of identification. Most people have some form of identification of one sort or another on them most of the time. We suspect the Government want ultimately to make that compulsory by bringing in ID cards. The noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, denies this and shakes his head. However, we know that ID cards are on the way. At least, the Government seem to think that they are on the way; I am not sure that they will ever happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0906185000052"></a>I will not go any further. The response was unsatisfactory. I will consider what we shall do with this matter. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09061788000003"></a><b><a name="90617-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09061788000109"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Lord Young of Norwood Green):</b> The draft statutory instruments which we are debating this afternoon are an important part of our implementation of the Companies Act 2006. The Act reformed and clarified company law in many areas and brought company legislation together in one place. The Act makes it easier to set up businesses, gives investors greater information and confidence, and promotes shareholder engagement and effective dialogue between business and investors.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000004"></a>The Act has been implemented in stages and these statutory instruments relate to provisions which are due to come into force in October 2009. This staged approach gave companies time to prepare, allowed us to coincide changes with parallel EU requirements and allowed Companies House to update its systems to support the new measures.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000005"></a>The first debate concerns two statutory instruments relating to the Registrar of Companies. The basic functions of the registrar are set out in Part 35 of the Companies Act 2006. This largely replaces the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 1985, but it provides new powers and duties for the registrar which will help Companies House maintain the register as a useful and accurate source of information for users. The  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC272"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column GC272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>draft Registrar of Companies and Applications for Striking off Regulations supplement Parts 31 and 35 of the Act by making more detailed provision in four areas: rectification of the register, annotation of the register, language requirements and an application by a company to have its name struck off the register.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000006"></a>The registrar does not currently have any statutory powers to remove information from the register, although the registrar will remove material if a court order authorises it. It was recognised on both sides of this House during the passage of the Bill that more needs to be done to address the filing of inaccurate, forged or fraudulent information on the register. The Companies Act 2006 introduces two new statutory procedures requiring the registrar to rectify the register&#151;that is, to remove material from the register under court order or under a new administrative procedure on application to the registrar. The new administrative procedure has been introduced to permit certain information to be removed from the register without a court order. It is, we believe, an important step towards a more accurate register, although I should make it clear that it is not a panacea, and that matters requiring adjudication of competing claims should be left to the courts.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000007"></a>Under the draft regulations, it will be possible for an applicant to seek removal of company officers&#146; details from the register. Companies House will follow the procedure set out in the regulations and, if no objection is received, the material will be removed. It will also be possible for companies to seek removal of material relating to changes to a company&#146;s registered office address. We believe that the way in which the provisions of the 2006 Act are framed in relation to a company&#146;s registered office and the grounds for rectification effectively precludes the possibility of an applicant, other than a company, making an application in respect of a registered office address and prevents the administrative procedure being used at all in respect of a registered office address provided on incorporation of the company.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000008"></a>An earlier draft of the regulations was withdrawn in the light of fresh evidence that some companies were purportedly appointing directors without the consent or knowledge of the persons concerned. The earlier draft addressed this issue where there was a change of directors in an established company, but the revised regulations address it also where directors are purportedly appointed when a company is first set up.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000073"></a>We are very conscious that the provisions of the Act and the draft regulations do not provide a full answer to issues relating to the accuracy of the register, particularly where the company has provided fraudulent information. We will consider these matters further and if solutions can be identified, we are minded to consult on possible changes to the law in this area, including to the 2006 Act in due course.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000009"></a>The second area where the draft regulations make more detailed provision is annotation of the register. They authorise the registrar to annotate the register where he believes that any material is misleading or confusing.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000010"></a>The Act contains rules about the language in which documents can be drawn up and delivered to the registrar under company and insolvency legislation.  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC273"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column GC273</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The basic rule is that they must be drawn up and delivered in English. This does not apply to Welsh companies, which can deliver documents in Welsh so long as they are accompanied by an English translation. The draft regulations relax this exception further, prescribing documents relating to certain Welsh companies that can be delivered to the registrar in Welsh without a certified translation into English. The draft regulations also add further documents to the list of documents in the 2006 Act that can be delivered to the registrar in a language other than English, provided that they are accompanied by a certified translation into English. They also provide the characters and symbols that are permitted in names and addresses.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000011"></a>Finally, the draft Registrar of Companies Regulations require an application by a company to have its name struck off the register to contain a declaration that there are no circumstances as set out in Sections 1004 and 1005 that prevent the application being made.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000012"></a>It is important to Companies House and very helpful to business to have a coherent and consistent registration system for all types of business which are required to send material to Companies House. It  has therefore always been our intention to apply provisions of Part 35, relating to the Registrar of Companies, to forms of business association other than companies. Some provisions already apply generally to companies and other bodies, but others, such as certain provisions relating to electronic delivery, must be applied to other bodies to provide a coherent system. It would be possible to do this by making consequential amendments to each individual area of law, but we believe that the legislation will be clearer and simpler if we amend Part 35 to achieve this. The draft Companies Act 2006 (Part 35) (Consequential Amendments, Transitional Provisions and Savings) Order will give effect to this.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000013"></a>I should make it clear that the amendments made by the draft order are relatively modest in their  impact, being concerned essentially with procedural and administrative matters. The draft order does not seek to extend all the provisions of Part 35 and does not seek, for example, to extend the provisions about correcting or removing material on the register.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000014"></a>These instruments will make an important contribution to our efforts to make the register a useful and accurate source of information for users. I commend them to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09061788000015"></a><b><a name="90617-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09061788000110"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the order and the regulations. I welcome him to his new department. The SIs are not particularly controversial, so I shall not detain your Lordships long, but perhaps I may ask a couple of quick and rather more general questions of the Minister.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000016"></a>The order is an amendment to Part 5 of the Companies Act 2006. If it has taken the ever-growing Department for Business, with all the resources at its disposal, until 2009 to work its way through the complexity and conclude that there is a need for it, one has to ask what hope there is for the small businessman trying to go through the entire pile of regulation and work out whether and how each item of it affects him.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC274"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column GC274</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000017"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum to the order says, under &#147;Matters of special interest to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments&#148;, that,</p>
<ul><a name="09061788000083"></a>&#147;the Order amends Part 35 itself&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09061788000074"></a>that is, part 35 of the Companies Act&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09061788000084"></a>&#147;instead of making amendments to various pieces of legislation which contain functions of the registrar in relation to bodies other than companies&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09061788000075"></a>Is it easier for the layman if it is done that way rather than by amending the various pieces of legislation? If so, it would be helpful to understand why in a little more detail. I do not ask that with any formed opinion; I would just like to know, because it is important that steps should be taken to ensure that legislation and regulation are accessible and understandable to those being regulated.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000018"></a>With that in mind, my final question is rather more general. What steps are being taken to codify the huge volume of extant legislation and regulation so that a layman stands a chance?</p>

<p><a name="09061788000019"></a><b><a name="90617-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09061788000111"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> Clearly, these regulations are appropriate and relatively straightforward, although I take the point that the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, makes about the complexity of statutory instruments under this legislation. I have two points to make. First, I very much welcome the confirmation that the Minister gave that this area will be kept continually under review. I have some scepticism about whether the appetite of Parliament, under any party, for another Companies Act will be met in the foreseeable future, after living through the last one. As the Minister said, anecdotally there is beginning to be a bit of an increase in fraudulent formation of companies, with directors&#146; names being used who were never directors and never actually signed the consent form&#151;somebody else forged their signature. Recognising that that is a problem, I welcome the undertaking that the Minister has given that this will be kept under review.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000020"></a>My second point is on a slightly more difficult question. I am always amused by the report that we, rightly, receive on consultation outcomes, when the phrase is used,</p>
<ul><a name="09061788000085"></a>&#147;the proposed approach was generally supported&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09061788000076"></a>I would always like to know what objections people had who did not generally support the proposed regulations. Clearly, we will not have a statement in this document, because it has already been written, but it would be helpful if the Minister could give some indication about the objections, because they are not stated and they are not obvious to me. If anyone is sitting behind him who can summarise it for him, I would be grateful.</p>

<p><a name="09061788000021"></a><b><a name="90617-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09061788000112"></a>Lord Lyell:</b> I wonder whether I might impudently ask the Minister one or two gentle queries on the order before us today. First, I declare a very minor interest. I look around the Committee today to find the Minister, my noble friend and perhaps one or two other noble Lords who have ground through the years to become chartered accountants. Indeed, I am reminded of the musical, &#147;Evita&#148;, when the young lady says, &#147;Somebody called me something unmentionable&#148; and an old man says, &#147;Yes, madam, they still call me an  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC275"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column GC275</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>admiral, although I left the sea many years ago&#148;. With regard to the accountancy profession, that is very much up my street.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000022"></a>The Minister referred at least twice to language. I beg him not to trouble himself today, but I hope that he can answer this impudent question in writing. The Minister referred twice to the language requirements, which are mentioned right at the bottom, in paragraph 4, Section 1059A(4), Sections 1102 to 1105 and 1107(18). I think that he mentioned Welsh. I had the opportunity to serve in Northern Ireland. I do not think that any cantankerous people would wish to have financial documents in Irish&#151;or I doubt it. Do the language requirements cover other languages? I think particularly of oriental languages such as Japanese or Chinese, let alone Vietnamese. I understand that the Minister served in Vietnam. I was curious about that; perhaps he could reassure me that there should be no problem here. He referred to Welsh, which should be the only one.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000023"></a>On page 4, paragraph 13 refers to Section 1109(1) and,</p>
<ul><a name="09061788000086"></a>&#147;voluntary transliteration of name or address into Roman characters&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09061788000077"></a>Is there a problem there? I am curious as to quite what that refers to. I am not necessarily aware of that section in the Companies Act. Could the Minister reassure me that there is no problem there? If he cannot today, perhaps he could write to me as I would not wish at any time to delay the Committee.</p>
<h5><a name="09061788000090"></a>4 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09061788000024"></a><b><a name="90617-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09061788000113"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> The starting point is that Part 35 contains a mixture of provisions that apply generally and provisions that have either more limited application or that contain references to companies but which are essentially intended to apply generally. I hope that I will reassure the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, that it takes relatively little to amend some of the provisions so as to generalise them or make it clear that they apply generally. That is more efficient than amending other legislation simply by writing in the provisions we want to apply with very little adaptation.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000025"></a>Our approach leaves Part 35 as the foundation of the law about the register&#146;s function and material sent to the register. Other legislation will build on that foundation by applying the less straightforward provisions, including those which require greater adaptation to fit particular cases. An example of that is provided by limited liability partnerships. We intend to apply most of Part 35 to limited liability partnerships. The amendment made by the draft order will provide the foundation for that.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000026"></a>I am not sure that that actually deals with the noble Lord&#146;s point. Unless I misunderstood it, the point was whether it would make it easier for lay people to deal with this issue. I am looking at my officials to see whether they will say yea or nay. In the mean time, I will deal with a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall about the proposed approach being generally supported. He asked what objections anybody had. We received relatively few written responses, but both the department and Companies House discussed them in detail with our leading stakeholders. We are not aware of any areas where our approach is not supported, other than those relating to rectification, which we have already said we will keep under review. So we have nothing up our sleeves on that one.</p>

They set out a simplified regime for registration of information at Companies House of companies incorporated overseas that operate their business in the United Kingdom through an establishment. We are talking not about UK incorporated subsidiaries of overseas companies, rather about overseas companies that are conducting their business through a local representative or have a small, permanently active base in the UK, such as a  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC277"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column GC277</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>representative office, warehouse or shop. The regime concerns only obligations to file specified information in the UK at Companies House. The internal governance of companies incorporated outside the UK is for the law of the country of their incorporation.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000031"></a>In order to best protect UK creditors and the needs of law enforcement agencies, a regime has been prepared that continues to meet the EU requirements of the 11th directive for branches of overseas companies and also includes companies operating a place of business in the UK. The draft regulations include a revised accounting regime for overseas companies that is transparent, straightforward and up to date. Overseas companies will primarily file accounts prepared under the parent law of the country where the company is incorporated. However, where that is not applicable, accounts are to be prepared and disclosed in a manner compatible with the requirements for UK companies as set out in the Companies Act 2006. The regulations do not cover the law on the execution of contracts or the requirement to register the use of their assets in the UK to secure loans. These will be covered by a separate statutory instrument that will be made by negative resolution after these regulations have been made.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000032"></a>In line with the approach in the Companies Act 2006, the draft regulations apply to the United Kingdom rather than, as at present, to Great Britain only. This considerably simplifies the position for overseas companies that conduct business in both Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain by allowing them to register their presence in the UK once and therefore avoid the burden of duplicate filing. These draft regulations meet the concerns raised during the consultation process. They provide a single regulatory regime for the filing obligations of overseas companies operating in the UK. I commend this instrument to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09061788000033"></a><b><a name="90617-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09061788000117"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I cannot see anything in the regulations to object to per se. Indeed, if my reading is correct, according to the Explanatory Memorandum, the majority of respondents to the consultation exercise agreed with what is being done here, although in line with the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, in the previous debate, it would be interesting to know how big the minority was and what its major concerns were.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000034"></a>My only question is on the regulatory impact assessment. I explained before in this Committee my scepticism of the figures put on costs and, in particular, the claimed benefits of certain regulations in RIAs. In the case of these regulations, the net benefit claimed is no less than &#163;43,360,000. I have followed the calculations, which are based on a sweeping assumption that half the 7,847 overseas companies will be in a position to provide parent company accounts and the other half will not. A further assumption is made about the average costs for each of those categories of company. The whole of the annual saving so calculated is then, I think, subjected to a net present value calculation, which itself makes assumptions&#151;for example, about the cost of capital&#151;which must be, to put it mildly, fairly subjective in the current market. I do not disagree that it is helpful to have a regulatory impact assessment, but I wonder what value there is in a claim of benefit

I wonder whether the Government have, in a wider context, given thought to improving the techniques followed for arriving at a cost-benefit analysis, or at least to giving an indication of the subjectivity.</p>

<p><a name="09061788000035"></a><b><a name="90617-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09061788000118"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> My Lords, I join the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, in agreeing that the regulations are appropriate. Clearly, it makes enormous sense to simplify the procedure for registration of an overseas company, so that the company no longer has to take legal and accounting advice about the form of registration it requires. That lifts the regulatory and cost burden on overseas companies establishing places of business in the UK, which is welcome.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000036"></a>I have only one technical question, on which I would welcome the Minister&#146;s view. Clearly, what became known as Section 700 accounts were criticised by the company law review committee, and it is appropriate to move away from that. My question concerns the simplification of accounts procedures for non-European Union countries. They are straightforward in the EU because companies formed there comply with the accounting rules that have emerged by a series of directives, so it is clear what they will say. In the Government&#146;s view, will the liberalisation&#151;that may be the wrong noun, so let us say alteration&#151;of the rules and the replacement of the Section 700 accounts make it marginally harder for creditors and people dealing with those companies to find out exactly what is happening or will it improve their position?</p>

<p><a name="09061788000037"></a><b><a name="90617-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09061788000119"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> My Lords, the first question was a minority view, so to speak, as I understood the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley. Responses to each of the consultations on a simplified single regime for overseas companies consistently supported the approach. Almost all respondents supported the regime as set out in the draft regulations set out in December 2007, which was based on the concept of an overseas company with a UK establishment. Key stakeholders have continued to be involved in the finalisation of the draft regulations and have continued to support the concept of a single regime. It seems to be pretty well supported.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90617-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000038"></a>Impact assessment can be justified by the savings. The net saving of &#163;4.9 million is measured in terms of new overseas companies registering a UK establishment under the new regime. It is rather difficult to quantify one of the main benefits of the regime, which is that these companies no longer have to decide whether their establishment in the UK is a place of business or a branch. This element of choice and the time and effort required will vary from company to company.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000039"></a>The PwC assessment of costs to business of UK regulation did not include an assessment of this choice. We believe that the simplification of the regime is a major customer benefit, and it is unfortunate that this saving cannot be counted. Instead, we have been able to quantify the benefit to companies of following the new simplified accounting regime and avoiding the existing Section 700 accounts requirements. PwC assessed the cost of preparation of such accounts to be just under &#163;885 per company.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC279"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column GC279</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000040"></a>Many overseas companies will now be in a position to avoid this cost by filing accounts already prepared under the parent law of their country of incorporation. We have taken an indicative view that half the overseas companies that could benefit from this change will do so. It is difficult to be more accurate, given the range of countries involved, and the saving could be higher. Those companies unable to rely on parent law and still required to prepare accounts will find the new arrangements more straightforward, and we have estimated an average reduced cost of half that for Section 700 accounts assessed by PwC. We based the saving on the number of active overseas companies registered at Companies House that are non-EU companies with a UK branch or overseas companies with a place of business. EU companies with a UK branch are not subject to Section 700 accounts, so we have not counted them in the saving calculation.</p>
<h5><a name="09061788000093"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000041"></a>For some existing overseas companies, there will be negligible increased cost. The regulations include transitional provisions that allow existing companies sufficient time to provide a set of accounts where they have not already been provided. Other information to be provided as part of the transition is negligible. We have allowed companies six months from 1 October 2009 to comply with a simple return to the registrar. Respondents to the December 2007 consultation did not challenge the figures used, nor did they offer any alternative approach. On the contrary, the majority supported the approach taken.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000042"></a>In response to the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, accounting by non-EU companies has been modernised, not liberalised. It will be easier for creditors because the resulting accounts will follow more modern accounting standards&#151;so I am assured. I think that we have dealt with all the questions raised.</p>

Limited liability partnerships were introduced by the Limited Liability Partnerships  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC280"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column GC280</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Act 2000. The main early users of the limited liability partnership form were major accountancy and law firms, and now all sizes and types of businesses are using it.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000044"></a>The LLP Act is a relatively short Act that sets out the basic structure of the LLP and provides a power to fill it out as appropriate by applying to LLPs selected provisions of company law. The LLP Regulations 2001 applied major parts of the Companies Act 1985, with appropriate modifications, to LLPs along with bits of financial services and insolvency law.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000045"></a>As the Companies Act 1985 has been comprehensively replaced by the Companies Act 2006, we need to update the regulations that apply company law provisions to LLPs. Last year, your Lordships debated the Limited Liability Partnerships (Accounts and Audit) Regulations, which applied to LLPs rules on accounts and audit corresponding to those under the Companies Act 2006. These take effect for financial years beginning on or after 1 October 2008. The current regulations complete that work by applying to LLPs the other relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006, with modifications as necessary. They apply to the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000046"></a>If any noble Lord is familiar with the 2001 LLP regulations, he or she will have noticed that the current regulations are much longer. This is because the earlier regulations simply listed the section numbers of provisions in the Companies Acts that were to be applied with a list of textual modifications. The current regulations take the approach of writing out the provisions so that the regulations can be read as a stand-alone document without looking at the Companies Act. This approach received strong support when we consulted, particularly from practitioners in the field.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000047"></a>Much of the update has simply meant applying to LLPs the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 that correspond to the provisions of the 1985 Act that were applied to LLPs. As set out in the Explanatory Memorandum, some of the new provisions of the 2006 Act are applied to LLPs, but others are not. Broadly, these decisions maintain the approach of applying to LLPs the rules that regulate a company's dealings with third parties and, in particular, the filing and transparency requirements, but not rules on the internal workings of companies.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000048"></a>There is also a small number of changes that are not directly related to the Companies Act 2006. They include providing a new right for a member of an LLP, if he is the sole remaining member, to apply to have the LLP dissolved. In summary, these regulations will keep the law on LLPs up to date and consistent with current company law. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09061788000049"></a><b><a name="90617-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09061788000122"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. The Explanatory Memorandum says that this instrument and the application of the accounts and audit provisions of the 2006 Act to LLPs will be,</p>
<ul><a name="09061788000087"></a>&#147;reviewed, from 2011, as part of the Companies Act 2006 evaluation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09061788000080"></a>I notice that the other Explanatory Memorandums for the orders that we are discussing today all say something similar. What does &#147;from 2011&#148; mean? It sounds like, &#147;not before 2011&#148;, which is rather worrying. Does it mean, on the other hand, &#147;in 2011&#148;? If not, when will we know the outcome of the review?</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000050"></a>Other noble Lords may have received a communication regarding these regulations from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, an institute of which, I should disclose, I am a member. While most of its concerns with earlier drafts appear to have been allayed, it raised the following points. Perhaps the Minister could address them.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000051"></a>The first concerns Regulation 18, which would apply Sections 162 to 165 of the 2006 Act, which concern the registry of directors&#146; names to LLPs with modifications. That will require an LLP to keep available for inspection a register of members containing certain particulars, including a service address for each individual member and whether a member is a designated member. In practice, the institute notes that most LLPs currently maintain a list of all members at their principal place of business and do not object to the requirement being imposed. However, particularly given that failure to comply will be an offence, it feels&#151;and I can see the point&#151;that it is important that the Minister&#146;s department provides LLPs with adequate information about that new requirement to ensure compliance as from 1 October.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000052"></a>The institute also notes that the department has postponed the decision on whether to apply the overseas company disclosure regime to LLPs. It understands that it would be undesirable to hold up the application of the remainder of the Act to LLPs while the difficult question of overseas LLPs is considered, but it would like to know when the issue will be tackled, as there is now a discrepancy between the treatment of overseas companies, as against overseas LLPs.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000053"></a>Lastly, as a drafting point, the institute draws attention to the fact that in Regulation 51 applying Section 1007(1) and 1007(5)(a), reference is made to an application being made by an LLP. It says that that should refer  to an application being made on behalf of an LLP.  I should be interested to hear whether the Minister can respond to those points.</p>

<p><a name="09061788000054"></a><b><a name="90617-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09061788000123"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> I make one point in support of the regulations, which is to congratulate whoever in the Government or the department was responsible for producing them in this format. Before the Minister&#146;s time, when we ground our way through the Companies Bill in the august Chamber, we argued from these Benches that it was important that the Company Law Reform Bill became a consolidating Act, for the reasons that the Minister gave&#151;that it was important that people could read legislation in a digestible form, rather than having to leap from one section and one Act to the other, the only benefit of which being to increase the profits of Butterworths. I welcome this approach and hope that the Government will continue to follow it when we have further legislation in this area.</p>

<p><a name="09061788000055"></a><b><a name="90617-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09061788000124"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, for that comment. The Acts have been implemented in stages, which will need to be reflected in our evaluation. We will begin to evaluate some provisions commenced in 2007 next year, but we will wait until 2011 to evaluate most provisions commenced in October 2009.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000056"></a>The regulations for LLPs come into effect on 1 October 2009, in line with the implementation date for the remaining provisions of the Companies Act 2006 for  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC282"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column GC282</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>companies. We will take steps to ensure that LLPs know about these changes, particularly the new register of members, given the importance of the situation in which they find themselves. Companies House will send a mailshot to all LLPs telling them about the changes. It will highlight the new requirement to keep a register of members available for inspection, and it will mention that a failure to do so will be an offence. Guidance and specimen forms will be available on the Companies House website from 1 July. We will look at the drafting point raised by the ICAEW to see whether it needs amendment. No consensus has emerged about how or whether to change the way in which we regulate overseas LLPs. The regulations before us therefore continue the approach in the existing regulations.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000057"></a>I believe that I have dealt with all the questions.  I am grateful to noble Lords for their contributions to this debate. The regulations represent the last step towards the application of the Companies Act 2006 to limited liability partnerships. They ensure that the regulations under which LLPs form and operate are in step with modern company law. In summary, by applying the remaining provisions of the Companies Act 2006 to LLPs, as set out in the regulations, where necessary and appropriate, we make essential changes to align the requirements for LLPs with those for companies. This will ensure that LLPs enjoy some of the same benefits and savings as companies, and remain an attractive and distinctive corporate vehicle for business, with different characteristics from companies and other types of partnerships. I commend these regulations to the Committee.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000059"></a>The regulations before the Committee today amend the Companies Act 2006 to make provision for the filing of separate corporate governance statements at Companies House. They also implement the directive&#146;s requirement for an auditor&#146;s report on any separate corporate governance statement. Rules made last year by the Financial Services Authority implemented the requirement for a corporate governance statement and set out what it should contain. As permitted under the  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC283"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column GC283</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>directive, the FSA rules give companies the option to prepare a separate corporate governance statement rather than including it in a specific section of the directors&#146; report. The auditor is required by these regulations to check that information in a separate corporate governance statement on internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process and share capital is consistent with the audited financial statements. That is the same check that would be required to be carried out by the auditor if the information formed part of the directors&#146; report.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000060"></a>We do not believe that these regulations should add to the costs of audit because the test for consistency should not be onerous, and in a number of companies, the audited financial statements may not contain information on internal control and risk management systems.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000061"></a>The regulations also contain some technical accounting amendments. If the noble Lord wishes, I can give a brief description of each of the accounting amendments that remain in Part 3 of the regulations.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000062"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, a version of this instrument was laid before Parliament earlier this year and then withdrawn. That earlier version contained  an amendment to Section 413 of the Companies Act 2006 concerning disclosure of loans to directors of banking companies. We have decided to re-lay the draft regulations without that amendment. We want to consider further what form the amendment should take and to conduct a public consultation. I commend these regulations to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09061788000063"></a><b><a name="90617-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09061788000127"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister once again for introducing these regulations. I do not think that they are particularly controversial so I will not detain your Lordships long. As the name includes the word &#147;audit&#148; I suppose I should disclose once again my membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales although I have not been a practitioner since at least the early 1980s.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000064"></a>When these regulations were being debated on Monday in another place, I notice that the Liberal Democrat spokesman asked the Minister several technical questions, which he did not fully answer. Perhaps I can leave it to the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, to pursue these matters if he wishes to do so. On these Benches, we are strong supporters of transparency. Transparency is particular important with company accounts. Although relatively modest in their ambitions, we are supportive of the impetus behind these regulations. When they were debated in another place my honourable friend Oliver Heald asked the Minister why these provisions had taken so long to promulgate. He asked if it was because the Financial Services Authority had taken a very long time to create the rules. The Minister there undertook to make inquiries of the FSA, and it would be helpful to know if there is an answer yet.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC284"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column GC284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whether the Minister will state the accounting impact of the fairly technical changes to realise losses; and, secondly he asked about the transfer and value of pensions. I do not expect the Minister to answer because I understand that the Minister in another place gave an undertaking to write to my colleague with an answer to that, which no doubt we will see in due course. I do not propose to delay the Committee any further; I am happy to support this regulation.</p>

I had a look through the corporate governance statements. My noble friend told us when he last carried out work in the audit profession; I go back at least 15 to 20 years before that.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000067"></a>Will the Minister clarify something for me, though not necessarily today? On page 3 under &#147;Part 15 definition of &#145;corporate governance statement&#146;&#148;, the noble Lord will find paragraph 6 and &#147;Auditor&#146;s report on separate corporate governance statement&#148;. That is not necessarily his duties, but in Regulation 6 he will find Section 497 of the Companies Act 2006, which, I am afraid, is not part of my bedtime reading. I am fascinated by the auditor&#146;s report on the auditable part of directors&#146; remuneration, but I am somewhat suspicious. I wonder what aspects of the report and the directors&#146; remuneration would not be auditable, to put it politely. Perhaps the noble Lord could reassure me&#151;not today, but in writing, because I do not want to delay the Committee any further. I am very grateful for his words of reassurance throughout.</p>

<p><a name="09061788000068"></a><b><a name="90617-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09061788000130"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> I say to the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, that with regard to the implementation by the FSA of rules of directive 2006/46, requirements on corporate governance statement, the Government consulted on the implementation of the directive in March 2007. One of the questions asked was whether the requirement for a corporate governance statement should be implemented by rules made by the FSA or should it be prescribed as part of the Companies Act.</p>

<a name="90617-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09061788000069"></a>The consultation period closed on 1 June 2007. Consultees preferred a continuation of the existing regime for corporate governance statements. The Government therefore decided with the agreement of the FSA that the requirement for a corporate governance statement should be implemented by FSA rules. The FSA needed to consult on its rules, which encompass not only the corporate governance statement but also requirements for audit committees in the Audit Directive 2006/43/EC. The FSA&#146;s consultation document was published in December 2007; the consultation period closed on 20 March 2008. Due to that need to consult and the length of the consultation period, the FSA was not able to make the rules by the common commencement date of 6 April 2008. They were made, however, within the deadline for implementation of the directive.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09061794000003"></a><b><a name="90617-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09061794000029"></a>The Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Ed Miliband) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09061794000004"></a>I am today publishing a consultation on coal and carbon capture and storage entitled <I>A Framework for the Development of Clean Coal</I>.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09061794000005"></a>In April, the Budget announced financing for up to four CCS demonstration projects in the UK and, the following day, I outlined proposals for a new regulatory regime for new coal-fired power stations. Following the statutory strategic environmental assessment, this consultation document sets out the Government&#146;s proposals in more detail.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09061794000006"></a>The aims of our proposals are to drive the decarbonisation of our energy supply, to safeguard our energy security and to get the best deal for consumers and businesses. The conditions on new coal proposed in this document are the most environmentally ambitious of any country in the world, requiring the demonstration of CCS on a substantial proportion of any new power station and the 100 per cent retrofit of CCS when it is proven.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09061794000007"></a>The document also sets out for consultation the process for funding and taking forward the demonstration projects which will enable us to maintain coal as part of our energy mix, supporting diversity and therefore security of supply.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09061794000008"></a>By acting early, we will ensure that jobs will also be created as Britain develops the expertise in what could be a major new industry, with CCS projects offering the potential to form the hubs for clusters of low-carbon industries.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09061794000009"></a>By driving the development of CCS in this country, we are also, as a country, playing an essential role in tackling climate change. Coal is already widely used in developed and developing countries and its use is expected to grow further: 70 to 80 per cent of the predicted growth in emissions in the coming decades will come from developing countries unless we find a route to low-carbon growth</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09061794000010"></a>Copies of the consultation have been placed in the Library and it is available from <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk">www.decc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="09061794000011"></a><b><a name="90617-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09061794000030"></a>The Minister for Communications, Technology and Broadcasting (Lord Carter of Barnes):</b> Further to the Written Statement concerning the positions that HMG intended to take at the Telecommunications Council, held on 11 June 2009, I am pleased to be able to report back on the main conclusions and topics of discussion.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS70"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column WS70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09061794000012"></a>The Telecommunications Council took place on 11 June 2009 under the chair of the Czech presidency. Andy Lebrecht, the deputy permanent representative in Brussels, represented the United Kingdom. Much of the discussion was taken up by two main items, an informal and off-the-agenda discourse on the review of the EU regulatory framework from electronic communications networks and services and a formal table-round on European network and information security policy.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09061794000013"></a>On the review after an introduction by the presidency (in which it regretted that it had been unable to preside over a final agreement), Commissioner Reding suggested that, while she understood the concerns of member states over the introduction of Amendment 138 (the clause that would make any internet disconnection subject to judicial review), she was more worried about a delay in the adoption of the framework that would occur if the council decided on a conciliation process. In response, the vast majority of member states said that they could not accept the EP amendment, some noting that it potentially interfered with national competencies. The UK noted that the amendment was unacceptable both in legal and policy terms, noting how it could constrain future decisions of the Government. In terms of a future conciliation process, the vast majority of member states (including the UK) indicated their wish to see discussion limited to Amendment 138 with other (agreed) issues not being reopened. Most member states were also happy to leave the question as to whether council should reject the whole package or just the better regulation directive, which contains Amendment 138, to the presidency.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09061794000014"></a>The presidency concluded that, while a majority of member states wanted the framework adopted quickly, there was a strong majority that rejected Amendment 138 and so the next step would be conciliation.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09061794000015"></a>On the formal discussion on European network and information security policy, Commissioner Reding introduced the Commission&#146;s communication by noting that a breakdown in the critical telecoms infrastructure in the next five years was more likely now as a result of security flaws. She asked member states to take the threat seriously and to reflect on the role that the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) may need to take. She noted the Commission&#146;s intention to publish proposals concerning the reform of the ENISA mandate by April 2010.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09061794000016"></a>Following this, during a wide-ranging exchange of views, the majority of member states endorsed the need for a pan-EU (or even global) approach to information security and for enhanced co-operation between member states. All that spoke, with the exception of the UK and Hungary, also called for ENISA&#146;s term and remit to be automatically extended. The UK, while also welcoming the Commission&#146;s approach, noted that a future role for ENISA should be discussed within the context of an overall policy discussion on information and security and critical infrastructure protection.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09061794000017"></a>The council then moved on to three items under any other business, the first of which was on &#147;Internet of Things&#151;An Action Plan for Europe&#151;Information from the Commission&#148;, where the Commission noted  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS71"></a><b>17 Jun 2009 : Column WS71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that it would shortly be issuing a communication on the matter; a report from the presidency on the ministerial conference entitled Safer Internet for Children (Prague, 20 April 2009), where the Commissioner thanked the presidency for an important conference; and &#147;Internet Governance: The Next Steps&#148;, where, Commissioner Reding noted the imminent publication of a communication addressing, among other issues, the future of ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).</p>

<a name="09061794000024"></a><b><a name="90617-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="09061794000033"></a>The Minister for Trade and Investment (Lord Davies of Abersoch):</b> With my right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, I am pleased to inform the House that in these difficult times for the global economy, the UK is maintaining its status as a world-class business destination.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09061794000025"></a>UK Trade and Investment has announced today, in its launch of <I>UK Inward Investment Results 2008-09</I>, that there were 1,744 direct investments in the UK by foreign-owned companies between 1 April 2008 and 31 March 2009, as reported by UK Trade and Investment and its partner agencies in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the English regional development agencies. This is an increase of 11 per cent on the year before and confirms that international business has continued to select the UK as the preferred investment location in Europe, second only globally to the United States  of America. Through this foreign direct investment, 78,540 new and safeguarded jobs have been delivered to the UK.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09061794000026"></a>At a time of global economic downturn, inward investment is a long-term decision for any company seeking to grow internationally. In the current climate, more investors are seeking to locate in the UK than anywhere else in Europe, helping to underpin the long-term economic prospects of the UK&#146;s business environment. The number of new projects has increased by 26 per cent from 653 in 2007-08 to 827 in 2008-09 and there were 460 expansions by existing investors, up by 5 per cent from 436 the previous year. In line with reduced global market liquidity, the number of acquisitions, joint ventures and mergers taking place is down 6 per cent from 484 in 2007-08 to 457 in 2008-09.</p>

<a name="90617-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09061794000027"></a>Companies are seeking to invest internationally earlier in their life cycles than at any time previously to fund their growth. The UK has positioned itself as a springboard for global growth for companies seeking to grow both in the UK and internationally from a UK base. UK Trade and Investment is the government organisation leading support for such companies in the international business environment.</p>
