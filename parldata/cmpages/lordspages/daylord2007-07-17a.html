<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What are the policy implications of the government research on restorative justice published on 19 June.</p>

<a name="07071759000024"></a><b><a name="70717-0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07071759000646"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> My Lords, the report examined victim and offender satisfaction with restorative justice. It shows general victim satisfaction and supports the Government's strategy of encouraging the use of adult restorative justice as a service to victims. A further report, on the impact on reoffending and cost-effectiveness, is expected later this year.</p>

I strongly agree that we need to develop policy on the basis of sound evidence and we look forward to the second report. Does he agree that there is already significant evidence of the motivational power of restorative justice for offenders and that there is already compelling evidence that victims are helped by and need it? Would it not therefore be sensible already to develop policy further, which is essential for the whole criminal justice system, at least for victims?</p>

The Government have already encouraged local criminal justice boards to develop restorative justice processes. However, the research project consists of four pieces of work; the final piece of work, as I have already mentioned, concerns cost-effectiveness and outcomes. It is important for the Government to await that before taking further action.</p>

It bears out the expectation that restorative justice is effective in reducing reoffending, particularly in serious crime, violence and burglary. When that is confirmed, as we hope it will be, later this year, will he pay attention to their suggestion of having a restorative justice board to foster the spreading of this cost-effective and welcome development across the country?</p>

I think that it is fair to say that it was a fairly small-scale study; none the less, we are looking at it with very great interest. I assure the noble Lord that, in conjunction with research that my department has commissioned, we will certainly look at his suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="07071759000030"></a><b><a name="70717-0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07071759000652"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, I can certainly send a very long definition to the noble Baroness. Essentially, it is an opportunity for victims to explain the impact of the crime to the offender and for the offender to acknowledge the harm caused; it also provides the chance to ask questions. It is not to be seen as a soft option. The research that has just been published shows, for instance, that where direct conferencing has taken place between the offender and the victim, more than half of victims said that the process provided a sense of closure and 90 per cent of victims in conferencing said that offenders had apologised; there is no question about that. Just under four-fifths of offenders thought that it would lessen the likelihood of reoffending. I would not claim that it is a perfect approach but the figures are none the less pretty encouraging.</p>

<a name="07071759000031"></a><b><a name="70717-0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07071759000653"></a>Baroness Linklater of Butterstone:</b> My Lords, is the Minister aware that only two places in the country use that provision of the 2003 Act to make restorative justice a requirement of a community sentence? They are the Thames Valley and the Liverpool Community Justice Centre. Given the Government&#146;s commitment to developing community sentences as an alternative to custody, which we heartily endorse, and the powerful benefits that restorative justice delivers to victims, to offenders and, therefore, to the country as a whole, what specific plans do the Government have to encourage and to develop a much more widespread take up of that provision?</p>

<a name="07071759000032"></a><b><a name="70717-0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07071759000654"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness is quite right to draw attention to the potential of community sentencing. Certainly, restorative justice can be a part of that process. My understanding is that 13 of the 42 local criminal justice boards report some adult restorative justice delivery. Of course, more can be done. The Government&#146;s approach has been to encourage those boards to invest and to develop those services. We shall come back to this issue in the light of the fourth research study, which, as I have said, we hope will become available towards the end of the year.</p>

Is it not, therefore, a matter of regret that the restorative justice policy team at the Home Office has now been virtually disbanded?</p>

It is not so much about what teams we have, but whether we have sufficient support within the ministry to ensure that programmes can be developed. I believe we have that. We are looking at the research with a great deal of interest. As I said, it shows considerable promise; none the less, it will be very important to see the outcome of the study on cost-effectiveness. When that comes out, the Government will make further decisions. In the light of those

In view of that, what measures does the Minister propose to prevent the exploitation of the restorative justice system?</p>

The cases are risk assessed and we shall look at the matter in the light of the research that has been published. The research shows that the face-to-face meetings can be a particular challenge for offenders; nor are they easy for the victims. That is why the risk assessment is done so carefully. I can assure the noble Lord that the last thing I, or my department, would wish is for this to be some kind of soft option, ensuring that an offender is somehow treated more leniently by the courts. It has to be seen as part of a rigorous approach to dealing with justice and helping victims. That is the context in which we shall take it forward.</p>

Since that time, only 2.8 per cent recidivism has been recorded and there was very high victim satisfaction. I mention that because there are, in effect, two forms of restorative justice in play: one is conditional cautioning and the other is diversionary restorative justice. The reason for mentioning Chard&#151;</p>

The reason for mentioning this is that such disposals by the police do not register as sanctioned disposals.

There were no sites available for options within Newham. A site has been identified which is close to those which the families currently occupy. It is not ideal, and the families do not want to move. That is the case with Travellers&#146; families, many businesses and the allotment holders whom we discussed the other week. All of them are somewhat disadvantaged by the necessary compulsory purchase of the site. Of course, such a large site was bound to occasion some difficulties, but they are marginal.</p>

Furthermore, if you are going to have a big celebration, admit you are having a celebration, and do not try to get in some private money for some form of publicity dressing.</p>

The incoming Labour Administration in 1997 inherited a project which was substantially underway. In retrospect, we all regret the huge losses made on the Dome, but we should recognise that the location of the Dome was an intelligent choice of site for the regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula, and future generations will at least benefit from the sacrifices that we made in terms of public expenditure at that time.</p>

In fact, would it not have been more appropriate for observers to be there during the current run-up to Sunday's election, considering that there has been widespread intimidation and obstruction of pro-Kurdish parties and individual candidates? Only yesterday, as my noble friend will have heard, a Turkish but pro-Kurdish independent candidate was shot dead in Istanbul. Does she agree with the statement by the International Strategic Research Organisation, which is an independent Turkish think tank based in Ankara, that,</p>
<ul><a name="07071759000275"></a>&#147;the more that Kurds have rights, the more that the PKK will lose support&#148;?</ul>

Of course we were deeply concerned to learn about the murder of the independent candidate standing in Istanbul, but we are pleased that the Turkish authorities are actively investigating the murder and have apparently already detained three suspects. We are confident that the authorities will investigate that fully. On the quotation cited by my noble friend, we fully agree that the more that the Kurds are allowed and enabled to participate in the democratic process in Turkey, the less that the PKK will be able to be pre-eminent in the Kurdish areas.</p>

<a name="70717-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07071759000111"></a>The Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill returns to us from another place once more. The Bill now hangs in the balance. Your Lordships first sent it to the other place to consider the extension of the new offence to deaths in custody at the end of February. At that point, the other place was content to accept a number of significant changes to the Bill proposed in your Lordships&#146; House, and on the question of deaths in custody, the Government sought to make substantial, positive progress. Measures were proposed to improve the investigation of deaths in custody by putting the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman on to a statutory footing. That commitment is now in a Bill introduced in the other place. The Government also offered to consider how the Forum for Preventing Deaths in Custody could be strengthened. That goes directly to the issue of seeking to reduce the occurrence of these tragic events in the first place.</p>

<a name="70717-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07071759000112"></a>Since bringing forward these proposals, the Bill has been sent to your Lordships&#146; House four times. On the three previous occasions, your Lordships indicated dissatisfaction with the movement offered in the other place and asked the Government to reconsider their position. We have done that. I am grateful, as I have indicated on every other occasion on which we have discussed the Bill, for the time that the noble Lords, Lord Hunt of Wirral, Lord Ramsbotham, Lord Lee and Lord Dholakia, have taken to discuss with me the important issues in the Bill. Again, I pay tribute to them for their time.</p>

<a name="70717-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07071759000113"></a>As noble Lords will recall, debate in your Lordships&#146; House was postponed a fortnight ago for further discussions and consideration. A new Administration and new Ministers recognised that very strong concerns  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_137"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>had been expressed during the passage of the Bill, and that it was right for the Government to allow a further pause. Ultimately, however, they reached the same view: that the Government had quite properly paved the way for the Bill to extend to custody in the future, but that to go further at this stage would not be right.</p>

<a name="70717-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07071759000114"></a>The Bill now has two further days before proceedings in the other place must be completed. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, pointed out previously, that period can be extended. However, we must look at the possibility of doing so against the experience of the Bill&#146;s passage between your Lordships&#146; House and the other place to date. For nearly two months, the Bill has passed between the two. The Government have put a solid compromise on the table. I recognise that this does not deliver all that the amendments adopted by your Lordships would deliver. It is a compromise, and I recognise it as such. That compromise has not yet proved acceptable. In practical terms, there appears to be little to be gained by extending the time available for the offence, simply to prolong the passage of the Bill between this House and the other place. I consider the compromise to be a good one and one on which this House should accept the passing of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70717-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07071759000115"></a>For the Government&#146;s part, the concession that we have offered takes the offence further than we have considered is its appropriate ambit. The compromise opens the door to the offence applying to custody. Recognising the principle of extending the offence, and providing a means of doing so, is a very large movement. On the other hand, the compromise asks that, although the principle of the offence applying to custody is accepted, the power to extend must rest in the hands of the Government. That is entirely appropriate.</p>

<a name="70717-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07071759000116"></a>The further amendments proposed today provide for a specific timetable. It is already clear that the other place is not content to accept amendments that put custody directly in the Bill. Noble Lords must consider how very unlikely it would be, therefore, that in those circumstances, it would agree to the more advanced proposition that puts custody in the Bill and sets a specific timetable for implementation.</p>

<a name="70717-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07071759000117"></a>I want to bring your Lordships&#146; attention a difference between the amendment in lieu that we are considering today and that which we considered last week. The power to extend the offence applies slightly more widely than to those strictly in custody or detention, and includes people on specified premises. This is to ensure that the order-making power is sufficiently wide to cover, for example, local authority secure accommodation, where residents are not necessarily in custody. It might also be desirable to cover certain other circumstances, which are not custodial, such as approved probation premises.</p>

<a name="70717-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07071759000118"></a>The drafting of this aspect of the power has been improved by showing that it is now clearly targeted. I have nothing further to say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07071759000121"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am conscious that this is the fifth time that I have tabled an amendment that is concerned with trying to ensure that custody, and those held in custody, are subject to the same purposes of the Bill as victims of gross management failure, for which private companies are to be held responsible. I am conscious, too, that many noble Lords feel that the Government have gone as far as they can in giving way on the principle, and their other concessions over investigation and prevention of deaths in custody. These are enormously welcome in themselves, given the current situation in our prisons. However, they are not strictly relevant to the purpose of the Bill. Pressing for a date could therefore be felt to be somewhat ungracious, but we owe a duty to the victims, whose cause the Government so support. That duty requires us to press, as far as we can, for this one last phase.</p>

<a name="70717-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07071759000122"></a>I am conscious that time is running out; only two days before the rolling-out procedure are available to the Government. Once again, I am enormously grateful for the willingness of the Ministry of Justice, mentioned already by the Leader of the House. I had a very frank and friendly meeting last night with the Secretary of State, Jack Straw. It showed a new, fresh approach to these matters since the Ministry of Justice took them over. This is entirely to be welcomed, given the complexity, relevance and urgency of these issues. He explained to me that he had only been in his current post for two weeks and was not responsible for the earlier passage of the Bill. I then reminded him that we had had discussions about Prison Service management, particularly in the context of suicides, when he was Home Secretary. I explained that in now formally proposing a date some time ahead, I was allowing time for what the Minister, Maria Eagle, had said in the other place were significant changes to the management of the duty of care that would be required.</p>

<a name="70717-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07071759000123"></a>Personally, and from experience, I do not believe that any changes to managerial responsibilities are required, only to the way in which those responsibilities are exercised. As I have said previously, it is inexcusable that there should be deficiencies in the duty of care that those currently responsible for running our prisons owe to those committed to their care by the courts. Those responsibilities apply whatever the problems imposed by overcrowding or lack of resources. They are incumbent on all managers at all times wherever  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_139"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they are. I also repeated to the Secretary of State that the last thing that any of those of us who voted against my amendments wanted was to kill the Bill, which was why I was now suggesting a staged rather than a simultaneous implementation of the Bill to the private sector and custody to satisfy all parties.</p>

<a name="70717-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07071759000124"></a>From these Benches it is easy for me to say that in making one last effort to obtain acceptance of the need for a more definite commitment than the word &#147;may&#148; to the application of the Bill to the managers of those held in custody, I am not playing party politics. I say that because I was intrigued to read in the latest debate in the other place that, with the exception of the Minister, not a single Member spoke against the amendment.</p>

<a name="70717-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07071759000125"></a>Let me quote Mr Andrew Dismore, chairman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, in particular. He said that if the Prison Service is against the introduction of the Bill, it is the wrong position for them to adopt. He continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="07071759000269"></a>&#147;A well run Prison Service has nothing to fear. The Bill is not about prosecuting people, but about acting as a deterrent to make sure that things are run properly in the first place ... It is not about individual liability but management liability &#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/7/07; col. 1569.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071759000242"></a>He went on to say that he did not find the Government&#146;s arguments persuasive and that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="07071759000270"></a>&#147;The Government may win the vote, but I do not think that they have won the debate&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/7/07; col. 1570.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="70717-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07071759000126"></a>Mr David Winnick asked the Minister whether she was,</p>
<ul><a name="07071759000276"></a>&#147;aware that some Labour MPs, including me, are very unhappy ... that the Government will give no indication whatever of a time when the Prison Service will be included&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/7/07; col. 1562.]</ul>
<p><a name="07071759000243"></a>The Minister did not answer the direct question of the Shadow Attorney-General, Mr Dominic Grieve, as to whether the problem about agreeing a finite date for implementation lay with the Prison Service, the police, some other organisation or the bureaucrats in the departments. I found that interesting because in an earlier debate in the other place, Mr John Denham said that a date would help the Prison Service because it would have a clear timetable for putting in order whatever was needed to be put in order.</p>

<a name="70717-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07071759000127"></a>When we debated this issue last week, because of time I deliberately did not mention the police, although I realise that their views must have influenced the new Home Secretary in her reported reaction to the Bill. Fortunately, my noble friend Lord Dear is well aware of what these are and I will leave him to explain them to the House.</p>

<a name="70717-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07071759000128"></a>I suspect that like many Members of the House I have been inundated with messages from those who are understandably very concerned about the outcome of our debate on this welcome and important Bill. I have made it clear to all of them that in pursuing my amendments as far as I am constitutionally allowed, I am doing so in the interests of victims of gross management failure for which the Government are ultimately responsible, trying to ensure that they are not treated any differently from the victims of a similar failure of private sector management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07071759000129"></a>The Government appear to have something of a blind spot over disciplining those guilty of management failure while responsible for people held in the custody of the state.

I shall be brief because I have to go to the Grand Committee shortly for three orders. I simply want to inform the House about the lunch earlier today arranged by the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, at which the first question put was about the corporate manslaughter Bill. It was obvious from those who spoke at that meeting, particularly those from the Prison Officers&#146; Association, that they saw no objection to implementing this aspect of legislation, and the sooner, the better. That came from the Prison Officers&#146; Association. That now leaves only the police, and I look forward to reading tomorrow what the noble Lord, Lord Dear, has to say on this matter. I have spoken to a number of senior police officers and their reaction was more or less the same as that of the Prison Officers&#146; Association. I therefore support the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, will confirm&#151;and this rather surprised me&#151;they said that this was the first meeting they had ever had with parliamentarians. That is astonishing considering they are in the front line of all these problems. They are very open-minded about the Bill&#146;s provisions and the extension to prisons, as the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, has said, but that is in the Bill with the order-making power so let us not talk at cross purposes. They said&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, may confirm this&#151;that they needed to judge the extension to prisons in the light of the manifold problems they have to face, not least the radicalisation of some classes of prisoners, which has been debated in this House, and the lack of work and educational facilities. The balance of all these problems is a factor for consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07071759000133"></a>If we want to change the culture of prisons&#151;and that is prima facie what this Bill is in part about&#151;it is obviously not just a question of adopting a clause or not. It is a hugely more complicated matter. The Government have themselves made the point that the talks which need to take place and be a precondition for triggering the order are not yet taking place. I would like to put the emphasis on those talks.</p>

The responsibility they have for the day-to-day handling of many difficult problems is not just a question for the prison governors&#151;and we may hear from a former prison governor&#151;but there is the significant matter of the morale and involvement of the Prison Service if that culture is to change. I hope that my noble friend will be able to say that full and, I trust, positive consideration can be given to the request that the Prison Officers&#146; Association should be involved in any talks&#151;not hypothetical talks but talks which we will be assured will take place in the not-too-distant future, sooner rather than later. But defining our terms is not for today; in the light of all those considerations, putting a date in the Bill is not the right way to proceed.</p>

It just happens to be a fact of life that we were largely talking about something different. How the relationships between prison governors, prison staff and prisoners should be handled in this context is rather different from the manslaughter liabilities of an employer when someone falls off the top of a building. It is much more complicated. I abstained last time, and I gave my reasons. The trio or perhaps now the quartet of ping-pong sessions back and forth has been quite productive, because it has shed light on some of these issues. Given that, rather than making this a yes or no proposition, I say that this is now a matter of interpretation and a consideration of how we move on from here.</p>

However, the discussion I had with the Prison Officers Association is one I would like him to respond to. How are these people to become involved? The genie is now out of the bottle and there is no going back. The Bill is quite radical, and, wearing my TUC hat, I must say that there can be no question of this Bill falling. In the light of the conversations that have taken place, I consider that the Bill should pass, not least because rejection now would somehow not be proportionate to all the considerations that have already taken place. The process is now going forward and I hope that my Labour colleagues who like me abstained last time or voted against will now vote on the basis that I have outlined&#151;for the recommendation made by the Leader of the House.</p>

But we are here, and certainly that requires attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07071759000139"></a>We are now presented with a situation which has to be dealt with. The Government say, &#147;Oh, give it to a Minister&#148;. We have had enough government by Ministers. This is a matter for Parliament, and I shall support the noble Lord.</p>

Like him and others, I am acutely aware of the constitutional importance and significance of the game of ping-pong that we play, and the ramifications of what might happen if we return this Bill to another place once again.</p>

<a name="70717-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07071759000141"></a>Not to have this clause in the Bill would indicate a lack of care and concern for those who are in a place where they are almost more vulnerable than in any other place within our constitution, and in a place where duty of care is absolutely paramount. As I have asked before, and ask again, what message would be sent within this country, within the organisation and outside, and within our borders if we do not include this matter? In particular, what message would it send to those countries which we seek to influence at a particularly sensitive time in the world&#146;s history when we are trying to demonstrate that the western democracies of this world have more to offer than they do? I wonder how they would see this exclusion.</p>

<a name="70717-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07071759000142"></a>As a young student reading law at university, and later as a young police officer beginning to grapple with the requirements of that job, it was emphasised to me that arrest and detention of a citizen is absolutely fundamental within the constitutional framework. We are talking about people detained in prisons and in police cells, although more are detained in prisons. I have said before and say again in preamble that a prime test in any civilised country is how you deal with those who are locked up by the state. We should keep that at the forefront of our minds. We know that it is rare in this country for things to go wrong, but things can and do go wrong, and when they do one must ask what recourse those people or their relatives have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07071759000143"></a>We believe that police objections have borne on the Home Office&#146;s decision. From memory, I think that was mentioned about three months ago during our debate. The Association of Chief Police Officers provided me with a letter which it sent to the Home Office. It is undated but I understand that it was sent very shortly before 11 May this year on behalf of ACPO. It is a short letter. If you take away the heading and the spare space on the back of the second page, it would come to exactly&#151;I have measured it&#151;one side of close-typed A4. That is the weight and the length of the police response on this matter. It pains me to say that it is a poorly constructed letter. It is more a statement of position than anything else. It comprises seven paragraphs, four of which state the obvious. I refer to statements such as one that says that the police have to,</p>

<p><a name="07071759000244"></a>It goes on to say that they have to take,</p>
<ul><a name="07071759000278"></a>&#147;critical decisions whilst under extreme pressure&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071759000245"></a>We know that. The letter states that they are responsible for,</p>
<ul><a name="07071759000279"></a>&#147;those who pass through police custody&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071759000246"></a>who,</p>
<ul><a name="07071759000280"></a>&#147;are amongst society&#146;s most volatile and vulnerable, often after they have been failed by agencies better equipped to provide appropriate care and support&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071759000247"></a>It goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="07071759000271"></a>&#147;It is quite right that the police should be held to account&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071759000248"></a>I suspect that we would quarrel with none of that. The letter concludes with the rather strange three lines:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="07071759000272"></a>&#147;Extending the provisions of the Corporate Manslaughter Bill would only serve to impose an unnecessary additional level of scrutiny and, in practice, could serve to foster a &#145;risk averse&#146; approach to operational policing&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70717-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07071759000144"></a>Only one paragraph in this very short letter could reasonably be called an argument and that, as I said, is more a statement of a position. The police case appears to be that they are trying to distinguish their position vis- -vis custody from the position vis- -vis operational policing. Noble Lords may remember that, under Clauses 4 and 5, operational policing and indeed operations by the Armed Forces, which are very similar in some respects, are specifically excluded from the Bill. I spoke in support of that, as did other noble Lords, and it is not now a matter of dispute or debate. However, the police are concerned about the point at which operational policing ends and custody begins. That is what appears to be inserted in one short paragraph of the letter. My own guess&#151;not tritely&#151;is that custody could begin when the cell door shuts or slightly before, when the charge is accepted. I would be happy to leave that to judicial decision. Your Lordships might wish to insert such a description into the Bill, even at a late stage, but I do not think it needs to go in.</p>

<a name="70717-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="07071759000145"></a>On reflection and after a long history with the Home Office, I am confused&#151;others may well be too&#151;how on so many times the Home Office has rejected well argued, heavily argued and lengthily argued submissions by the police on a range of issues, but it is prepared to stand its ground on this one, which I have already sadly described as a poorly argued paper. I can understand where the police are coming from. They must have fears on that division between operational and custody. I understand the position, but I regret that I do not support the ACPO line. I support everything that has been said&#151;although I will not repeat it&#151;by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, most of which applies to prisons, but some of which can also apply to those in police cells. I urge your Lordships&#146; support for the Motion.</p>

There is no hard evidence that this would be the result. It would be easier for the Prison Service to avoid corporate manslaughter charges being laid for gross negligence where the death is self-inflicted&#151;by a prisoner in a cell on their own, but being regularly checked. It only takes a few minutes for someone to take their own life. With a death in a shared cell, the Prison Service might find it more difficult to resist charges being laid&#151;even where the decision not to leave a recently arrived prisoner in a cell on their own was taken for the best of motives, such as being of help to the prisoner concerned in the light of their state when they arrived at the prison. It is thus possible&#151;possible, not certain&#151;that we would put the Prison Service in a position where it decides to play safe from its point of view, but minimising the risk of corporate manslaughter charges could increase, not decrease, the number of self-inflicted deaths.</p>

<a name="70717-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07071759000148"></a>The desire to hold those who are grossly negligent to account for a death is understandable and right. However, I suggest that we do not start fixing dates until we have evidence&#151;which we do not have at the moment&#151;that the consequence of so doing in the Prison Service will not be to change the operational culture in such a way that it increases, not decreases, the number of self-inflicted deaths.</p>

First, if she accepts that it is perfectly open to her to table a Motion to extend the carryover date, would she stop waving around the paper tiger of the Bill lapsing, when it is entirely in her hands to prevent it doing so? Secondly, does she accept that, if no date is inserted, it is perfectly open to the Government never to bring forward an order putting into effect the clause relating to manslaughter and custody? Even if the Government bring forward some form of order, they could do so containing any form of exceptions, restrictions or limitations that they like that rendered the duty virtually irrelevant. The House would have no choice but to either reject the order in its entirety or pass it with all those exclusions and limitations. If she accepts that, does she not accept that it is necessary for her, the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and others to get together and devise something&#151;if she does not like the amendment&#151;that means that, within a reasonable time, the Government must bring this clause into effect, subject only to any genuine restrictions that they really need to impose?</p>

As Minister for the Prison Service for three years, it was clear to me that the Prison Service was responsible for the lives of the people who were entirely in its control.

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07071761000005"></a>The amendment rests absolutely on the solid rock of principle. It is a question of absolute principle, which has been articulated by so many Members of the House. There can be no higher trusteeship than that which rests on the shoulders of an authority that is responsible for persons in custody. That trusteeship is of so high a level that I cannot describe it in any terms other than absolute.</p>

<a name="70717-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07071761000006"></a>The next question then is whether, in those circumstances, a distinction should be drawn between the position of governmental authority or governmental agency and that of an employer in the area of responsibility as defined by the Bill. It should not be; it must not be. The message that would be broadcast by such a decision would be that, somehow or another, powerful interests are able to have their own way and that in some way or another the life of a prisoner is not as valuable in the eyes of the community as that of persons who are not prisoners, or that some exemption should be made for the absolution of government that has never been properly proven or established. For those reasons, I wholeheartedly support the amendment.</p>

Similarly, if this Bill fails&#151;we all want it to succeed&#151;then once again it is primarily the responsibility of Government, not of those who support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. As has been said by a number of noble Lords, virtually no support for the Government&#146;s position has been expressed in speeches made in both Houses&#151;with one or two exceptions, such as the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Rosser. The Cross-Bench Peers, the Conservative Peers, the Liberal Democrat Peers and many Labour politicians are clearly in favour of including deaths in custody in the Bill. Outside bodies such as Liberty and Justice are in favour and today we have had support from the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, with his experience of prisons, the noble Lord, Lord Dear, with his great experience of the police force, and my noble friend Lord Dholakia, who spoke of his recent conversations with the Prison Officers&#146; Association. Virtually everyone is lined up on one side, so what is holding the Government back?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07071761000009"></a>The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham&#151;specifying the date of 1 January 2009&#151;is a most reasonable compromise that balances humanity with managerial concerns.

That a duty of care is owed to those in custody is not in doubt. The families of those who die in custody are owed the same recourse to justice as the families of those who die in any other avoidable tragedy. As the noble Baroness the Leader of the House will know, I have always been a very strong supporter of this Bill. It is necessary mainly because of its deterrent effect. We all hope that none of these incidents will ever happen. But it is necessary to have the sanctions in place to ensure that.</p>

<a name="70717-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07071761000011"></a>The Government appeared to concede the point of principle. For a time, we seemed to be debating not if, but when&#151;that has happened before in this place. Now it seems, following the most recent debate in the other place, that our optimism was misplaced. After the debate, a Member on the Labour Back Benches said, &#147;They call it ping-pong. After that speech, it was more pong than ping&#148;. He was referring to the speech of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice, who was quibbling over whether it would be necessary at all to introduce deaths in custody into the Bill. The noble Baroness the Leader of the House says that the Government have conceded the point of principle. But what was being argued in the other place was, &#147;Let us put the principle to one side; we do not think it will ever be necessary to introduce deaths in custody into this Bill&#148;. As the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, reminded us, Chris Mullin pointed out from the Labour Back Benches that it will never happen unless it happens now. There is no better time to set out a timetable. Andrew Dismore, as the noble Lord reminded us, said that naming the day is more

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07071761000012"></a>The events of today therefore do not relate to some great constitutional question of the law, with this House pitting itself against the party of government. The party of government is clearly divided on the issue. Most of the speeches have been in favour of what the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, is seeking to do. The date in the amendment, as the noble Lord, Lord Lee, reminded us, has been mooted in debate many times. It would be interesting if the Minister indicated whether 1 January 2009 was an acceptable date or whether the Government wish for another date, which may be further away or nearer. In the absence of any expressed preference from the Government it is surely a right and reasonable date. Most importantly, it will allow those institutions to embrace fully the opportunity to prove that their standards match and exceed those set by law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07071761000013"></a>In conclusion, the noble Baroness warned us that the Bill could fall. It can fall only if the Government fail to move the necessary Motion. I give an undertaking to the House that I believe so strongly in the Bill&#151;I have taken advice&#151;that if the Government allow the Bill to fall this week, I will next week introduce an identical Bill, although I understand that I will have to call it the No. 2 Bill. I will devote my best endeavours to steering it through all the twists and turns of the parliamentary process so that it becomes law as quickly as possible. I give that undertaking in the hope that it may persuade the Leader of the House to concede this very important case.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall were at the same lunch today, although it felt like a rather different lunch when I listened to what was being said.

I have no doubt that this issue will be part of its agenda. It was not previously part of its agenda; as noble Lords who participated throughout the entirety of this Bill know, it was not the Government&#146;s initial intention to have this issue in the Bill. Therefore, the Government were not in discussion with it during the 10 years since we committed to put this in the Bill. As it is now in the Bill&#151;through an order-making power&#151;those discussions will take place. I hope that answers the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lee.</p>

However, I would worry if the noble Lord felt that it was on the basis of a single sheet of A4 that my right honourable friends the Home Secretary and the Minister of Justice made their decisions. However much the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, would prefer not to have government by Ministers, none the less, we have a responsibility to consult those who will be affected by legislation and to ensure that we take into account their views in a series of ways, not merely by correspondence but also, as is more likely, by ongoing discussion. Then, as Ministers, we have to reach a conclusion on the basis of the information and evidence presented and we have to behave responsibly on the back of that. That is what my right honourable friends have done. They will have considered properly and correctly not only the representations from the organisations mentioned today, but also those from other organisations, other colleagues, officials, legal advisers and so on.

It will be for another place to decide; it is not in my hands at all. I am not seeking to wave a paper tiger. Noble Lords are right: it is possible to extend, but the difficulty in considering extension is that it is in order to achieve something. I have to make it clear to noble Lords on all sides of the House that I can see no further movement. The Government have compromised; they have listened; they have identified the issues that are of concern to noble Lords; and I do not see anything else that will be done.</p>

<a name="70717-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07071761000020"></a>Extending time for this important piece of legislation would be in order to achieve something&#151;that is the point I was trying to make. I am not waving paper tigers or making threats, but I am simply saying that the purpose is to achieve something. I do not wish to give the impression that, if another place chose to extend it, that would be because the Government wished to move or change their view.</p>

<a name="70717-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07071761000021"></a>We have debated this matter extremely well. Noble Lords have asked the Government to think again and they have thought again. Noble Lords asked the Government to think again especially in the light of  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_149"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the fact that there were to be new Ministers and a new Administration within a Labour Government who might have different views and who might wish to look at advice differently with fresh eyes. My right honourable friends have done exactly what noble Lords asked them to do. They have looked again; they have consulted again; they have thought about it again; they have talked to each other again; and as my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Justice did, they have talked to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. There is no question but that the Government have done what this House has every right to expect them to do.</p>

<a name="70717-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07071761000022"></a>One further point is the way in which legislation is conducted, certainly by me. I smiled as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, picked up on what the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, said, implying that unless it is in the Bill it will never happen. That may have happened in the noble Lord&#146;s Government; but it is not happening in my Government. We make commitments that we believe are important and that we wish to see through, but we make commitments in the spirit of understanding. We have to do them properly; we have to do them in a considered manner; and, where this Bill makes very radical, new changes, we have to take them into account and ensure that they are done properly and effectively in the area of public policy. That is what we have sought to do.</p>

Indeed, when the House last considered the Bill, we tackled the issue about which noble Lords have been worried&#151; the ability to exclude huge parts of the services&#151;with our amendment preventing the exclusion of aspects within a category. The Government have taken an order-making power that would allow us to include custody within the corporate manslaughter Bill. As I have indicated throughout, we will do so after considering the impact of the Bill as it stands and after conducting further investigation with the stakeholders. I have no doubt that noble Lords and those in another place will ensure that the Government regularly report back on that and are held to account on that commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07071759000176"></a>My final point is on the conduct of legislation and I shall be quite personal in what I say. This is not about pushing me to a point where we give in and do

As noble Lords will know, my ambition is never to get to the point where we are pinging anything back three or four times, because that is not the best way of approaching legislation. My ambition is always to resolve everything that can be resolved long before we reach that stage. Noble Lords may feel that it is a matter of having one last heave or push or trying one final time, but that is not the position.</p>

<a name="70717-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07071759000177"></a>We have a timing difficulty regarding the 48 hours but may be able to resolve it with the caveat I gave. But it is time to put the Bill on the statute book as it stands. The Government have done what is right and proper and what the House has reason to expect them to do. The Government have done their job. That is what this House is for, and we have done it. There is nothing further to do. As I hope noble Lords will recognise, bringing the Bill back again will add nothing to our deliberations&#151;or, indeed, to the House&#151;but will only create further delay for all those who are waiting for the Bill to be put on to the statute book. I say that with absolute and utter respect for everyone who has been passionately committed to the Bill. Your Lordships have achieved a great piece of legislation which is better because of your Lordships. Now, however, it is time to put it on to the statute book.</p>

All noble Lords respect her and the case that she represents, and the Government have clearly put their case. However, the comments of noble Lords have yet again demonstrated the wisdom, humanity and experience that exist on all sides of this House.</p>

<a name="70717-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07071759000179"></a>People will look at what this House has been doing and read all the evidence, including that quoted in another place&#151;and all the evidence is there&#151;and ask, &#147;When? When are you going to do this?&#148;. I do not think that people will understand why we have not gone as far as our duty requires of us by insisting on a firm date and a commitment to which people can relate. A date has been referred to in connection with the Prison Service, for example, in order to help it work out what it needs to do and by when, and the same applies to government. That applies also to the discussions mentioned by my noble friend Lord Bledisloe. I know that the noble Lords, Lord Hunt, Lord Lee, Lord Dholakia, and others would be only too happy to take part in such discussions. So much the better if the Prison Officers&#146; Association, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, were included. I welcome wider discussion because many people are involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07071759000180"></a>Yet again, the issues could not have been stated more clearly. My noble friend Lord Dear spoke about the police and my noble friend Lord Elystan-Morgan made a most moving contribution about the duties of this House. I am ashamed to say that the only contribution that I found myself disagreeing with was, yet again, that of the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, who has totally misunderstood the purpose of what we are doing. We are not seeking to reduce deaths in custody; we are seeking to improve the management of custody so that

That is not the same thing at all. As for talks on the culture, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, my conversation last night with the Secretary of State went back to discussions about management that took place eight years ago. In those years a number of people have died unnecessarily in the care of the state.</p>

However, I was comforted by the words of the Secretary of State last night.

<a name="07071759000188"></a><b><a name="70717-0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071759000740"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 1 to 33. I am most grateful to noble Lords for permitting me to deal with this large group of amendments together. As a very late entrant into your Lordships&#146; debate on the Bill, I also pay tribute to the constructive way in which discussions have taken place throughout its passage.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07071759000189"></a>The new clauses in Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 and the associated Amendments Nos. 11, 15, 18, 19 and 21 to 30 deal with a single topic: the arrangements for appointing those who have served in judicial office on a salaried basis to do so on a fee-paid basis. The amendments extend and improve the provisions that were already in the Bill in Clauses 53 and 54 and Schedule 11. These provisions, as drafted, dealt with fee-paid appointments in two categories of office: deputy district judges and deputy and temporary additional masters and registrars of the current Supreme Court.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07071759000190"></a>The former Lord Chancellor, my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton, discussed these provisions with the Lord Chief Justice and it was agreed that it would be better if they were amended and extended. First, they agreed that conversion of salaried to part-time service is more appropriately treated as a new appointment, rather than as a deployment. Under the concordat, appointment is a matter for the Lord Chancellor, so these amendments in Clause 54 and Schedule 11 now confer the relevant appointment powers on the Lord Chancellor, rather than the Lord Chief Justice. They further enable him to make such appointments without requiring a Judicial Appointments Commission selection procedure, which would be disproportionate in such circumstances. It is also essential that the relevant senior judge agree that the potential appointee is up to the job, so the new provisions also require the Lord Chancellor to obtain the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice. There are also consequential amendments in Schedule 11 and Clause 54, resulting from the substantive changes in each one.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07071759000191"></a>The other significant change introduced by these amendments is to apply such provisions to all the judicial offices at the level of circuit judge and below in the ordinary courts and to all tribunal appointments made by the Lord Chancellor. The concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice is required for appointments in the courts and that of the Senior President of Tribunals in relation to tribunal appointments. The substantive provisions are in the new clause in Amendment No. 1, adding two new sections to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07071759000192"></a>The remaining amendments are technical or simply consequential on these substantive new provisions. Amendment No. 2 inserts a new clause that simply rectifies a lacuna in a section of the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993. The 1993 Act prescribes a normal compulsory retirement age for judicial office holders, which is generally 70, but further provision is made for service to be extended beyond that point in the public interest. Such flexibility is clearly in the interests of justice, in exceptional cases&#151;if, for instance, there is particular difficulty in finding a replacement  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_155"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the office holder in question or if he or she has specialist knowledge and expertise that it is thought desirable to retain.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07071759000193"></a>Schedule 4 to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 modified the 1993 Act, reassigning the power for the extension of service of judicial office holders under this provision. In so doing, it catered for the exercise of the power in relation to judicial office holders respectively exercising jurisdiction exclusively in England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. There is a lacuna here because this did not cater, strictly speaking, for those who exercise cross-border jurisdiction&#151;that is to say, those whose jurisdiction extends beyond England and Wales to either Scotland or Northern Ireland, or both. This situation normally arises only in relation to tribunal office holders.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07071759000194"></a>The new clause serves to deal with the problem. It adds further provision to Section 26 of the 1993 Act, providing for the power for the extension of service in such circumstances to be exercisable by the Senior President of Tribunals, in relation to tribunals, subject to the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor, with a default provision for the Lord Chief Justice to exercise the responsibility&#151;again with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor&#151;in any other case. Amendment No. 16 is a consequential drafting amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07071759000195"></a>Amendment No. 12 inserts a new clause setting out amendments to the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act 1951. The current position, whereby the Judge Advocate General appoints judge advocates from a pool of 12 judicial office holders or lawyers to an individual court martial, will change once the new Armed Forces Act comes into force. Once that Act is implemented, apart from the Judge Advocate General and High Court judges, only persons appointed under Section 30 of the 1951 Act may sit as judge advocates on courts martial. Appointments under Section 30 of the 1951 Act require JAC selection. This causes a serious problem. A JAC selection would mean asking members of the existing pool to submit themselves again for selection to continue sitting as judge advocates&#151;a role that they have had for several years. It is unlikely that they would be prepared to do this. The loss of such experienced judicial office holders would have a significant impact on the running of the courts martial system. It would also be difficult to fit a JAC selection for judge advocates into the very full JAC programme before the Armed Forces Act is implemented in 2009. We have discussed the issue with the Ministry of Defence and the Office of the Judge Advocate General, and consider that the only option is to amend the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and the 1951 Act. Accordingly, Amendment No. 12 does this.</p>

As noble Lords will know, in practice the policy of all the successive Lord Chancellors has been to seek and appoint a candidate to this post from among the judges of the High Court. This policy has brought, and continues to bring, significant advantages of independence, expertise and prestige to the commission. It has helped to make the commission the internationally well regarded law reform body that it is today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07071759000197"></a>In amending the Law Commissions Act 1965 so that the Lord Chancellor can appoint only a senior judge as chairman of the Law Commission, Amendment No. 13 will embed in the 1965 Act the policy and practice of the past 42 years. The change is necessary because the Commissioner for Public Appointments&#146; code of practice on ministerial appointments to public bodies requires that an appointment should be open to all those qualified to be appointed to it. In the case of the chairmanship of the Law Commission, the appointment would therefore have to be open to judges, barristers, solicitors and legal academics. That might deter applications from judges and could deny to the Law Commission the very important benefits that flow from the appointment of a senior judge as chairman. The new clause inserted by Amendment No. 13 therefore restricts the pool of potential candidates for the chairmanship to judges of the High Court and judges of the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07071759000198"></a>Amendment No. 14 makes a minor correction in a cross-reference to the Bill being inserted into the County Courts Act 1984. It updates a reference to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act from 2006 to 2007 and was tabled by the Conservatives in Committee in the other place. Although we considered this change to be unnecessary, as all such references would be updated automatically when the Act is printed, we accepted the amendment none the less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07071759000199"></a>Amendments Nos. 31 and 32 are needed as a result of changes to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 made by the Income Tax Act 2007, which received Royal Assent on 20 March. Paragraph 87 of Schedule 13 to the Bill consequentially amended paragraph 6(5) of Schedule 16 to the 1988 Act, but this no longer works because of changes made to that Act by the 2007 Act. Amendments Nos. 31 and 32 correct this. Finally, Amendment No. 20 removes the privilege amendment inserted by your Lordships&#146; House to ensure the maintenance by the Commons of control over public funds.</p>

I am pleased to open the debate on the Finance Bill and, in particular, to address the key issues raised by the report of the Economic Affairs Committee on the Finance Bill 2007. As in previous years, this debate is the Government&#146;s platform for responding to the report of the Finance Bill sub-committee on certain provisions of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07071759000207"></a>The Bill delivers real change, giving the UK a stronger and more competitive economy, and helping to shape a better and simpler tax system. The Bill sets out the first steps in a major package of reforms to the business tax system. This is, of course, an area identified by the Economic Affairs Committee as one where tax simplification should reduce costs and help promote economic growth. I intend to set out briefly why this is a simplifying package, and why it will promote growth by enhancing international competitiveness, encouraging investment and promoting innovation.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07071759000208"></a>The 2007 Budget announced a cut in the main rate of corporation tax, to bring the cost of capital down and to make the United Kingdom more attractive to investors. We have simplified and modernised the capital allowance systems, to reduce administrative burdens and tax distortions, and to promote more efficient investment. There are a number of aspects to this. In terms of simplification, from 2008 expenditure on most plant and machinery will be handled in one of only two pools: 10 per cent and 20 per cent. We will phase out the industrial buildings allowances and agricultural buildings allowances. They had their place in helping the country to rebuild after 1945, but they seem somewhat anachronistic in this day and age and they have a distorting effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07071759000209"></a>For small companies the rate of corporation tax will increase, but I remind the House that this is a small profit rate of corporation tax, with a quarter of large tax-paying companies paying tax at the small companies rate. Of the 4.2 million small businesses,

I give way to the noble Lord.</p>

How is it a simplification measure to increase the corporation tax paid by incorporated companies from 20 to 22 per cent, while in the same Budget reducing the rate of income tax from 22 per cent to 20 per cent, thus creating a mirror image of the position existing at the moment whereby companies, incorporated or unincorporated, pay tax at 22 per cent? Will not this change add to the burden on some companies and make it more complicated?</p>

<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="07071759000211"></a><b><a name="70717-0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07071759000746"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, my point about the simplification related to the broader range of business taxation. The noble Lord will accept that we are talking about a relatively small group of companies. I accept his point that the increase throws an extra burden on them. He also will recognise that we have a clear rationale for the basis on which we hope to encourage investment and that in general terms we have produced an internationally competitive corporation tax rate. I think that his party&#151;in fact, the noble Lord may have had quite a strong part in this with his zealous and diligent work behind the scenes lobbying for a reduction in corporation tax&#151;will see the merits in us having done so.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07071759000212"></a>The Government have set out their rationale for refocusing incentives away from the small companies rate and on to businesses which really invest. Our prime concern is to ensure that investment takes place. The noble Lord and the House will recognise that it will reduce the differential between incorporated and unincorporated businesses. It will reduce the incidence of people incorporated for tax rather than commercial reasons and will make the system fairer. Although the noble Lord may quibble with me about the administrative dimension on this, the Government&#146;s priority that we should be concerned that people should incorporate for commercial reasons rather than for tax is an advantage and reflects a strategic position. It is clear that tax should not drive the decision on incorporation. There are other good reasons why people might want to incorporate, but we maintain that tax should not be a driver. At the same time, small and medium-sized enterprises face very real challenges, which is why we have refocused tax incentives by bringing in a new &#163;50,000 annual investment allowance targeted at helping all businesses to invest and grow and have increased the R&amp;D tax credits for small and medium enterprises.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07071759000213"></a>Let me turn now to the important subject of managed service companies, which was identified by your Lordships&#146; committee. A regrettably large number of people have chosen to incorporate for the wrong reasons. As things stood, the vast majority of people operating through an MSC were getting an unfair advantage over other workers and compliant businesses playing by the rules. This Bill therefore contains provisions to tackle managed service companies and to stop those using such schemes from undercutting compliant workers and businesses.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07071759000214"></a>The committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, described the Government&#146;s measures as a &#147;sticking plaster&#148;, suggesting that the underlying  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_159"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>structural issues need to be tackled. I understand the importance of that point and the noble Lord in a short while will deploy his arguments, which the Government of course will take very seriously. Let me be clear: this legislation addresses the very specific issue of mass marketed schemes being used to disguise employment. Perhaps I may put it this way: it tackles a significant and growing compliance issue, not a structural problem. The company is being used to disguise the employer/employee relationship which exists.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07071759000215"></a>It certainly is true that managed service companies make up a particularly tricky area to legislate for. In all fairness, the committee recognised how challenging the issue was and it is important that we should get it right. We consulted widely on this issue and are grateful to all who participated. Almost everyone we consulted agreed that the existing rules are not being applied by managed service companies and therefore that some action was necessary. We are grateful for the evidence that we are on the right track.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07071759000216"></a>More importantly, we are grateful to those whom we consulted for providing us with practical, up-to-date insights into what we needed to do to deliver effective legislation. This Government have been willing to listen and to respond to what interested parties have told us about this issue in order to ensure that the legislation is accurately targeted to achieve objectives which I think others share with us. This collaborative approach is also reflected in the guidance that HMRC has recently published. I should like to thank your Lordships&#146; committee for welcoming HMRC&#146;s efforts to consult business about these and other important issues.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07071759000217"></a>Any kind of tax avoidance creates uncertainty and distorts the tax system. In making the system fairer, we are creating commercial certainty for companies that pay their fair share and we are removing unfair competitive advantages. There will always be people who want to challenge the tax system and seek to avoid paying their fair share but ordinary, honest taxpayers deserve a tax system that is clear and easy to comply with. It is the Government&#146;s responsibility to protect compliant taxpayers both by making it as easy as possible for them to pay and by coming down hard on those who do not. We believe that we have a good record of achievement here. The Economic Affairs Committee noted that all its private sector witnesses were content with the progress of Revenue and Customs towards the implementation of its delivery plan for the recommendations in the Varney review on how the needs of large business could be satisfied in the administration of the tax system.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07071759000218"></a>Let me now turn to the review of powers, deterrents and safeguards. Setting up Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs out of the merger of the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise has already helped to strengthen our system of tax administration. The merger made it possible to deliver more consistency and to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. But merging two departments with two such distinct histories brings challenges as well as benefits. We must modernise the framework of law and practice that underpins our tax administration if  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_160"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we are to realise those benefits. HMRC&#146;s review of powers, deterrents and safeguards was set up to respond to this challenge. The review seeks to provide modern tools for the department and corresponding safeguards for taxpayers.</p>

<a name="70717-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07071759000219"></a>As announced in the 2007 Budget, HMRC has delivered more than &#163;300 million a year in savings on administrative burdens, which I know will be welcome to the whole House and in particular to members of the committee. The powers review demonstrates once again the value of consultation. Through the review&#146;s consultative committee, HMRC has been able to draw on the considerable talents and experience of business representatives, QCs, tax lawyers and accountants. This has formed one part of a widespread consultation process and has helped to produce a package that is effective and balanced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07071759000220"></a>I should like to take the opportunity to speak briefly on the subject of online filing, on which the committee also commented. I have already made it clear that the Government are committed to reducing regulation and business costs and delivering a more efficient tax administration. I strongly believe that good e-government can and will play a key role in making this happen. In this I agree with my noble friend Lord Carter of Coles who found in his independent review:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="07071759000273"></a>&#147;Online services have the potential to offer significant benefits to businesses, citizens and government. For the customer, online services can provide greater certainty, integral validation and help faster completion of the filing task and faster repayments&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071759000249"></a>I doubt whether anyone would disagree with my noble friend when he added:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="07071759000274"></a>&#147;However, to maximise the benefits, the services need to be customer focused, designed to meet the needs of the users, and they need of course to be reliable&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071759000250"></a>There is room for some measured confidence here. We have had two successful self-assessment filing deadlines, 31 January this year and 31 January last year, when the service withstood huge volumes and worked solidly. However, we cannot afford to be complacent.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07071759000221"></a>Finally, let me put all these matters into context. As an economy, we are currently experiencing the longest combined period of sustained productivity and employment growth since records began. Today we have record levels of employment, low inflation, and the second highest GDP in the G7 as opposed to the lowest when we came into office. We also have unrivalled growth. Perhaps the best way of expressing the scale of the achievement is this: even in the hugely unlikely event that the UK economy were to stop growing tomorrow&#151;I want to emphasise to the House that it will not&#151;it would be at least nine years before any other major economy would be likely to overtake our record. This Bill and this Budget build on that record of achievement and strengthen it. The Bill will help our nation to continue to prosper in a rapidly changing and increasingly globalised world. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

It is the fifth annual report in what is already a well established series that confirms the role of this House in the parliamentary scrutiny of Finance Bills. In the past, critics of the Government have sometimes wrongly questioned this role. As I have explained in previous years, the House is entitled to debate supply Bills and to refer them to Select Committees for consideration and has been exercising with restraint those rights going back many years. Within that remit, the sub-committee on the Finance Bill offers taxpayers and advisers a forum to express their concerns, which our reports convey, together with our own views and recommendations, in order to inform the debate in Parliament. We do this in a pretty short time in order to publish our report before the Report stage in the House of Commons, which is the last opportunity to amend these Bills, and I think that that is appreciated by those who take part.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07071759000224"></a>I thank my fellow members of the sub-committee for the knowledge and wisdom that they have brought to bear, for their non-partisan approach and for their speedy and intensive work. Looking across the Chamber, I see at least two who fit the bill fully and who have been in place for many years doing exactly that. I am also grateful to the witnesses, professional and official, whose input is essential to our report. This is an opportunity for experts to make a real contribution to our legislation before it is finally passed into law. I thank our long-serving specialist adviser, Leonard Beighton, and his new colleague, Trevor Evans, for their invaluable contribution, as well as the Clerk and the secretary-administrator of our committee.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07071759000225"></a>With limited time and resources, the committee cannot sensibly look at the whole of the Finance Bill; it has to focus. This year it chose four topics: the business tax reform package; managed service companies; powers, deterrents and safeguards; and mandatory electronic filing and payment. First, however, I shall make two general points. There can be tensions over the desire for fairness without opening up the scope for avoidance, but this can be done if it is well researched and consulted on widely. That is important because we are deeply concerned in the committee with simplification. The present tax system is highly complex and simplification is essential. We saw only a very modest step this year, and the committee recommends a more determined and consistent approach to simplification over several years. Indeed, the Minister rather indicated that that is the way the Government see it as well.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07071759000226"></a>Consultation is another of the committee&#146;s major concerns, especially after last year&#146;s shambles over IHT and trusts. The committee welcomes the increasing consultation on technical, legislative and administrative matters; indeed, consultation has continued apace even since we reported. But it can be more difficult where there are sectoral changes with winners and losers, as this year with the changes to capital allowances and, in particular, the phased withdrawal of the industrial and buildings allowances. The concerns expressed to  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_162"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>us and echoed in the debates in the House of Commons show that, none the less, ways need to be found of building on the present consultative process and of consulting on policy issues. Lessons should be learnt from the progress on consultation and followed through in the simplification of personal taxation next year.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07071759000227"></a>The business tax reform package comprises rate changes, capital allowance changes and increases in research and development tax credits. There were also two administrative changes. The package was said to have three main objectives: to enhance the international competitiveness of UK business; to encourage growth through investment and innovation; and to ensure fairness.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07071759000228"></a>First, the setting up by the CBI of a task force to consider whether the tax system is fit for purpose is itself evidence of concerns about the decline in our tax competitiveness. The committee considers the reduction in the headline rate of corporation tax helpful, but other countries are also reducing theirs. The extent of the burden as a whole is also important and we recognise that there is very little change here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07071759000229"></a>Administrative measures are also important. As the Minister indicated, the committee welcomes the progress that HMRC has made on the Varney review of links with large businesses. HMRC told the committee that it regarded the recommendations as absolutely fundamental and it was confident that, despite the pressure on its skills and resources, it would deliver. Other countries provide greater certainty in their tax laws, so here again the recent consultative document on clearance procedures and advance rulings is particularly welcome. The committee recommends that this should have a high priority.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07071759000230"></a>The committee also recommends that HMRC should press ahead vigorously with its programme of reductions in administrative burdens. Small companies, not just large ones, also need certainty and simplicity. They should be able to take decisions on commercial, and not tax, grounds. Frequent changes in the rate of corporation tax have not helped. The phased changes in the rate now proposed along with the simplification of personal taxation will narrow, but not close, the difference between tax on unincorporated and incorporated businesses. The changes being made or foreshadowed this year have caused a lot of concern. The committee recommends a review of the issue as a whole in consultation with the small business sector. The aim should be to reduce complexity and distortions caused by tax and to provide greater clarity and consistency. The committee also recommends that, despite the pressure on its resources, HMRC should have regard to the needs of small businesses and their advisers. I think that HMRC will know exactly what I am saying.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07071759000231"></a>The second aim of the business tax reform package is growth through investment and innovation. The committee is doubtful whether the package will do much to encourage growth. Its overall impact is broadly revenue neutral. The annual investment allowance to come in next year is intended to provide some incentive, but we await the details. During the consultation on it, its impact across various types of businesses will need to be considered. Otherwise the changes in capital  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_163"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>allowances are broadly designed to recognise economic depreciation and to remove any investment incentive. The R&amp;D tax credits are being enhanced and the administration improved. It is too early to assess their effectiveness. The committee feels that, against the impact of the package as a whole, this year&#146;s changes might not make a very positive impact overall. The third aim of the package is fairness. No one disagrees with that, but it is an elusive concept. There is a need to balance it with simplicity.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07071759000232"></a>The Minister was kind enough to refer to the managed service companies. The Finance Bill 2007 is the latest round in attempts to prevent employment income from being dressed up in a different form, producing less tax and national insurance. HMRC considered this legislation necessary because it had found applying the existing IR35 legislation impractical. The Minister rightly spotted that the committee report considered much of this legislation to be in the nature of a sticking plaster, addressing a perceived wound in the short term but not tackling the underlying cause. To address the underlying cause, the committee recommended that the Government review the taxation of employees and small businesses operating in varying forms with a view to making structural changes to reduce the differences in tax outcomes and national insurance contributions payable whether an individual is self-employed, employed or operating through a company. Only when these differences are markedly reduced will the incentive to dress up employment income in a different form, and the need for this type of legislation, be reduced. The review proposed by the committee would need to overlap with the review of small businesses that I mentioned and should generally help to meet our recommendation on simplification.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07071759000233"></a>Notwithstanding the firm recommendations on how to tackle this issue in the medium term, the committee was persuaded that the revenue lost from dressing up employment income had to be addressed in the short term. However, the committee was not as sure as the Treasury or HMRC that the new legislation would be effective. The committee therefore considered close scrutiny necessary, with a fallback plan involving the allocation of greater resources to applying the IR35 legislation should that be necessary.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07071759000234"></a>The committee was also troubled by the number of concerns about the breadth and imprecision of the legislation in two areas: the targeting provision that defines an MSC, which is central to appropriate operation of the legislation; and the debt-transfer provisions, which allow a tax debt of an MSC to be transferred to third parties when the MSC does not pay. The debates at the Report stage in the House of Commons showed that there remained widespread concerns in the private sector about the breadth of the legislation, which the Government have failed to calm down. As foreshadowed by the committee&#146;s report, we are now thrown back on to guidance to provide clarity on issues of concern. We know how unsatisfactory it is for legislation to be drafted widely and then cut down in guidance. Guidance can be altered, is generally of little assistance when a case comes before the courts and is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07071759000235"></a>A review of powers, deterrents and safeguards was announced in December 2004, on Second Reading of the Bill to provide the statutory framework for combining the Inland Revenue with Customs and Excise. The first results of the review are in this legislation, introducing new criminal investigation powers for the new department and new civil penalties for errors in tax returns. The committee was concerned that the new powers and penalties were being introduced before the safeguards. However, during our deliberations, the Government published a consultation document on safeguards&#151;had they not done so, our report would have been expressed in considerably more forceful terms than it was. We strongly urge the adoption of appropriate safeguards, as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07071759000236"></a>There was much concern about the balance between what is in primary legislation and what is in supporting guidance, and we would like to see as much as possible in primary legislation. Making a practical suggestion, the committee felt that a way should be found of keeping current and easily accessible a record of the assurances that are given in Parliament or elsewhere in respect of the application of these important powers and penalties, because they are an important factor in the interpretation of the law, which needs to be understood.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07071759000237"></a>The committee was reassured by the evidence of HMRC on how it intends to exercise the criminal investigation powers. The committee considers it very important that the assurances being given at the present time are adhered to in practice. Serious consideration should be given to providing an annual report to Parliament setting out the way in which the powers have been exercised in the previous year and how the assurances that have been given have been adhered to.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07071759000238"></a>On the penalties for errors in tax returns, the committee felt that, if the new regime is to influence behaviour and encourage better compliance, there needs to be a common understanding of what type of behaviour falls into which degree of culpability. The committee was concerned that some of our witnesses felt that there was a lack of clarity on this aspect and recommended that particular thought and effort go into the drafting of the guidance on this. Again, we have guidance to back up legislation. It was a disappointment that no amendments were proposed on Report in the House of Commons to address the issue. The review of powers and deterrents continues and HMRC issued a further consultation document on the developing programme of work in respect of payments and debt.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07071759000239"></a>The last issue that we discussed was online filing and electronic payment. The committee fully endorses the drive that HMRC is making to encourage online filing. There are significant benefits to be won by the department and by taxpayers, but we believe that this should be done by better marketing, by ensuring the reliability and robustness of the systems and by making the changes more attractive to those who are IT-illiterate. We recommend that online filing should not be mandatory for smaller businesses and employers. The proposals to make it compulsory for corporation tax, VAT, PAYE and NIC returns should  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_165"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be dropped. There may come a time when compulsion is possible, but it is not yet. As for electronic payment, we agree that there should be no cash-flow advantage for payment by cheque. We were reassured to learn that payment by cheque by the bank giro method will continue to be possible, but there may be some cases where even that is not practicable, so payment by post may still be needed.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07071759000240"></a>The committee did a good job in considerable detail and I think that it is right for me to give a report of our work. We were not entirely critical of the Government. We recognise that they have some considerable problems to deal with and I hope that our contribution is helpful to them and to the Revenue in the work that has to be done in years to come.</p>

I will restrict my remarks to business taxation and the business tax reform package. I declare an interest as a past president of the CBI and a current member of its President&#146;s Committee, as well as a UK company director.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07071767000002"></a>I begin with a word of encouragement to HM Revenue and Customs. As our report noted, on Budget day HMRC published its progress report on the Varney Review of Links with Large Businesses and its plans for the delivery of all of that review&#146;s proposals. It is not often that the business community gives its almost unqualified approval to a Revenue and Customs initiative but in this case it has done so. It is seen as a major step forward in encouraging trust and dialogue between HMRC and large businesses, and provided that the ambitious implementation plan can be achieved in practice, it will set new standards for the relationship between the two parties. It shows what can be done if the traditional hatchets are buried and the focus shifts from areas of contention to those of common ground. Indeed, it represents something of a culture shift which could beneficially be applied in a wider context.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07071767000003"></a>That wider context might be provided in the recent announcement by the CBI&#151;to which the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, alluded&#151;that it has launched a tax taskforce to undertake a root-and-branch examination of whether the current UK corporate tax regime is fit for purpose over the longer term and to draw up proposals for how it might be adapted to ensure the continued competitiveness of UK-based companies. It aims to report early next year.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07071767000004"></a>I am not associated with the taskforce but I believe that its establishment is timely. The world economy is clearly becoming increasingly international. Economic liberalisation, boosted by new technologies, is creating more integrated markets and increasing competition on a global scale. That is all common knowledge. What is less well recognised is that, as a result, the challenges facing business are changing and becoming far more complex. Companies have wider choices to make about where they invest their capital, site their operations and, indeed, domicile their tax affairs. Business  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_166"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>taxation has become a strategic issue for company boards in a way that it would not have been 20 years ago. This is not just a phenomenon affecting UK companies&#151;you can see it almost anywhere you care to look. But against that backdrop, rightly or wrongly, over the past few years the UK corporate taxation system is perceived to have become more complicated, hostile, unpredictable and burdensome, leading many companies to believe that they are now operating at a competitive disadvantage, and an increasing number to consider relocating to places with more friendly tax regimes. Incidentally, This perception of the UK regime is not restricted to companies located here but is shared by firms in neighbouring countries.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07071767000005"></a>This is not just a problem for UK business. For government, too, problems will increasingly arise from the reduced ability to predict and collect a stable revenue stream and from increased administrative costs. There is more to this than just sabre-rattling. The forces of globalisation and market integration which I mentioned earlier are seismic changes that will sooner or later require a radical response on the business taxation front. Yet the overwhelming sense I have of the business tax reform package in the 2007 reform Bill is that it is incremental, not radical. The right buttons are pressed and all the right words are used&#151;consultation, simplification, reduction of administrative costs, international competitiveness, encouragement of investment and innovation and so on&#151;but the scale of the ambition of the package simply does not match its context. This is fine-tuning of an old model, not reform to match the needs of a new world.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07071767000006"></a>I would be the first to recognise that radical reform is much easier said than done, and this is not just the fault of the Treasury and HMRC&#151;business can be to blame as well. Take the key issue of simplification, upon which certainty, reduction in administrative costs and so on depend. It is very easy for business to plead for greater simplification, but ask business precisely what simplification it would like and that can be a different matter.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07071767000007"></a>Let us take an example centred on what is now Liberal Democrat policy. A substantial contribution to simplification could be made by abolishing capital allowances altogether, not just industrial and agricultural buildings allowances. Businesses could then be taxed according to their financial accounts; there would be no requirement for separate computing systems for taxation purposes; there would be no problems in interpretation; administrative costs would tumble, and so forth. But the traditional business response to such a policy would tend to be negative, for two overt reasons. First, business believes that the total tax take would be greater if capital allowances were withdrawn. Secondly, simplification almost invariably results in winners and losers. The winners silently pocket the gains while the losers kick up an unwelcome fuss. Of course, neither reason is fundamentally compelling. Hold the tax-take constant and any disbenefits to business from dismantling the capital allowance regime could be recovered through, for example, a reduction in the headline corporation tax. Shocks to companies from the withdrawal of specific allowances could be mitigated by phasing out the changes over time.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07071767000008"></a>There is, I suspect, a third and unspoken reason why both government and business appear reluctant to take a truly radical approach to simplification; that is, that the practitioners&#151;whether company finance directors, tax consultants or civil servants in the Treasury or HMRC&#151;all share an interest in complexity. The mastery of complexity lies at the heart of their mystique, expertise, value and, ultimately, livelihood.</p>

<a name="70717-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07071767000009"></a>Those forces of reaction are quite understandable but they need to be countered if we are not to end up with too little, too late. A shift in culture is required to wean the practitioners away from their great game of the past and to take a fresh look at the future. If the spirit behind HMRC&#146;s enthusiastic pursuit of the Varney review recommendations could be extended to HM Treasury, I am encouraged to believe that the Government might just be up for it, just as I am encouraged to believe that, with the launch of the CBI&#146;s tax taskforce, we can look forward to some fresh thinking that is aimed at promoting the UK&#146;s international competitiveness in everyone&#146;s interest. I hope that it is not too much to expect that the approach to business taxation in the 2008 Finance Bill can be shifted up a gear or two, from the predictably incremental to the refreshingly radical.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Vallance, made the very strange point that it is Lib Dem policy to simplify taxation by abolishing capital allowances altogether.

I agree that it should be possible but I am somewhat pessimistic that any Government ever will provide a simple tax system, for a variety of reasons, as we well know. For example, we have referred to the question of capital allowances; the Government have made changes which they and I hope will help, but I am a bit doubtful. Equally, there are all kinds of other allowances that could be abolished, increased, reduced or whatever. They include, for example, allowances for families with children, allowances for being married&#151;we are to get a new variable allowance for marriage, I

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07071767000015"></a>I want to say a few words about the Finance Bill and the current headlines about billionaires paying less tax. I hasten to add that I am not a billionaire, so I have no interest to declare in that sense. I have spent most of my life as an accountant and in my personal affairs I have, perfectly legitimately, tried to pay less tax.

The Government have rightly encouraged people to invest in AIM-listed companies for the reasons that I have indicated: one pays substantially less tax. I hope I am not encouraging the Government to change that situation, at least not for a while, because it is doing a lot of good. Small AIM-listed companies, in the main, do a great job investing in new plant and in new companies&#151;mine is a recycling company&#151;and that is very sensible. I admire them for doing so. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, whom I am delighted to welcome to the Front Bench, will agree with me.

She said that domicile rules are subject to an ongoing review. That started in 2002 so the ongoing review has lasted five years to date. I hope that my noble friend, or someone, will be able to tell me today, or in writing, what &#147;ongoing&#148; means. I am looking for a review on another matter, to which I shall briefly refer. I know &#147;non-domiciled for tax purposes&#148; is a complex area, but perhaps the Minister can give me a definition of &#147;non-domiciled for tax purposes&#148; and say why it has taken five years for an ongoing review to do nothing about it.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07071767000020"></a>I will leave that to one side, but another aspect of Finance Bills and criticism is the tax credits system. I shall leave the unfair criticism of it to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, who I am sure will help the Government with some constructive criticism of the errors in the tax credits system. However, most of them are errors, not fraud. I note that this happens because the system works over 12 months. We all know that when people&#146;s income changes during the course of a 12-month period, they do not always automatically notify the Revenue, sometimes for perfectly reasonable reasons. That inevitably means that there are many errors in the tax credits system.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07071767000021"></a>For my part, I am happy to see the figures that the Government have announced of the amount of help being provided for poorer families by tax credits. I welcome that. I do not know whether the Government saw some words by Sam Brittan in the <I>Financial Times</I> about the US tax credit system. Both he and somebody who wrote in about it recently have indicated that they think that there are better ways. This is from somebody who one normally regards with some respect, Rupert Darwall from the Centre for Policy Studies. He said,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="07071767000032"></a>&#147;The incentives in America&#146;s earned income tax credit are superior in every respect and show the way tax credits in Britain should go&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071767000030"></a>Can my noble friend say whether the Government have looked at the American tax credits system to see whether it is indeed better and can offer us any hope for a better solution? My own view is that a committee like the House of Lords sub-committee would be a better committee to look at tax credits and many other parts of the tax system. Any of us who have been in the other place know that Oppositions pick the sexy bits of a Finance Bill and the rest virtually goes through on the nod. It happened to me when I was in opposition and to noble Lords opposite when they were in opposition. I well recall the first time, in 1975&#151;a few years ago&#151;when the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, was leading the Opposition. Again, they picked out tiny bits and the rest went through on the nod.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07071767000022"></a>We in this House can do a much better job than the other place. I hope that this Chancellor will recognise that and agree and support our sub-committee in doing much more work to help him, the Treasury and the Revenue to provide a better system than we have now. We can do it, so I hope that we will get that kind of encouragement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07071767000023"></a>On the economy, the new Chancellor had a good economic inheritance. Again, I can rely on the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, to tell us what a terrible 10 years we have gone through&#151;the points of my noble friend Lord Davies were nonsense, of course:  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_170"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the economy was terrible for the past 10 years. But I leave that to one side. The new Chancellor has little room for manoeuvre. The Comprehensive Spending Review was virtually settled before he even took office. The amount of possible taxation reductions in variable tax systems are difficult to achieve. The Liberal Democrats&#146; proposed 4p off the rate of income tax would perhaps simplify the tax system, although maybe my noble friend Lord Davies can tell us how on earth the green tax payers are going to pay the balance.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07071767000024"></a>One or two changes could help. The Barnett formula could be changed, which would save quite a bit of money. My right honourable friend the new Chancellor is Scottish, so I know that he reads the Scottish papers. Tam Dalyell sends me them all, so I know that the formula is there almost every day. All I am asking for is a review, which would show that there is a case for substantial savings.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07071767000025"></a>There is also the problem of borrowing. In my view&#151;and I speak as a Mancunian&#151;the Government were not wrong to think again about a super-casino for Manchester, but if that area is to be helped without a super-casino, it will need a lot more investment in housing in the kind of area we know. So where is that money going to come from?</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07071767000026"></a>The other point I wish to make to my noble friend is that he should ask the Chancellor to tell the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England that its remit is not just inflation but is, in the famous three words, &#147;subject to that&#148; to look at the Government&#146;s economic policy. I am assured by a former member of the MPC that it never looks at that. I ask the Chancellor to emphasise that it should look at it. In the past 10 years, the Bank of England has only once had to report inflation going over the 1 per cent margin, and that was no disaster. I hope the new Chancellor will look at that and also at the borrowing figure of 40 per cent of GDP. The trouble with that rule is that investment in current expenditure is sometimes better than investment in capital expenditure: better long-term and better value for money. The rule needs to be rather more flexible than it is at the moment, and I hope he will consider that.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07071767000027"></a>I look forward with great interest to hearing my noble friend&#146;s answers to my specific questions because I know how knowledgeable he is on these matters, but if he does not have the details here and now, I am happy for him to write to me.</p>

Included in those 309 pages, is Schedule 26 on &#147;Meaning of &#145;recognised stock exchange&#146;&#148;. I have do not have a clue what it means, but the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, will. On my reading of that section of the Bill, it appears to give HM Revenue and Customs the power to decide what is a recognised stock exchange, so the bad news for the noble Lord is that his AIM shares may very well no longer qualify under the powers contained in the Bill. He was clearly not aware of that; I became aware of it only because I happened to be looking at the index when he made the point about recognised stock exchanges.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_171"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70717-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07071777000002"></a>The idea that former Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, is some kind of high priest of simplification is a joke beyond measure. This Prime Minister, as Chancellor, doubled the size of the tax code, added hugely to the complexity of the tax system and, as the noble Lord, Lord Vallance, indicated, has taken us from having a comparative tax advantage into lagging behind our competitors who learnt the lessons that Britain taught the rest of the world under the leadership of the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, and Sir John Major. At one time, we were well ahead of other countries in Europe and the OECD, but as they have cut their rates of tax and simplified their systems, they have made their economies more competitive than ours, as my noble friend Lord Wakeham stated in the introduction to his committee&#146;s excellent report.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07071777000003"></a>I am bit disappointed that this debate is not better attended and that there are not more contributions to it because the work done by my noble friend Lord Wakeham and his colleagues is of fundamental importance. Parliament is about voting means of supply. As the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, said, the involvement of Parliament in the control of those means of supply becomes less and less. I think it was the chairman of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, John Whiting, who worked out that every line of the average Finance Bill is considered for 10 seconds, taking into account moving, consideration, debate and voting, and, as the noble Lord indicated, what tends to happen in the other place is that focus is put on the politically contentious issues of the day, rather than the detail, which is not considered. As my noble friend Lord Wakeham pointed out, and as we saw, for example, on inheritance tax and the changes in the treatment of trusts, all kinds of difficulties that could be avoided are not avoided because there is no time for consultation or proper scrutiny.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07071777000004"></a>I do not share the pessimism of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, about the ability to remove complexity and bring simplicity to the tax system. I do not understand why it should be that because he owns shares in an AIM-listed company, he is able to pass them on free of inheritance tax, whereas if he owned shares listed on the London Stock Exchange, that would not apply. It is deeply unfair because poorer people who do not have savings or shares, whose only asset is their home, have to pay inheritance tax at 40 per cent. That introduces complexity into the system because different classes of assets are or are not subject to capital gains depending on whether they are traded on a certain exchange, and if an AIM company changes to being quoted on the main exchange, there has to be a valuation so there is further complexity in the system.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07071777000005"></a>The answer to this is not to invent more rules but to deal with the fundamental problem, which is the burden of tax. The system has become increasingly complex because the previous Chancellor tried&#151;and no doubt his successor will do so&#151;to find ways of taking more in tax; clever accountants tried to find better ways of getting around that; and the Chancellor responded by bringing in more measures to deal with the loopholes created by the complexities that he introduced. And so we go on in a continuous cycle.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_172"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07071777000006"></a>As the Economic Affairs Committee pointed out in its excellent report, this Finance Bill set out with a brief to improve competitiveness and to simplify. The proposal to reduce corporation tax by 2 per cent is welcome but, as has already been pointed out, the problem with simplification is that one man&#146;s simplification is another man&#146;s loss of privilege. Let us accept that there is no politically way to simplify the tax system on a revenue-neutral basis. If you are going to simplify the tax system, you need to reduce the overall burden so that you can compensate the losers and bring in a more effective system as a result.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07071777000007"></a>Why do we have a Finance Bill every year? It is because Parliament is required to renew income tax on an annual basis. In the spirit of co-operation that was evidenced a few moments ago by someone on the Government Benches who looked like a former leader of the CBI, in which apparently we all now believe the same things, I offer the new Chancellor of the Exchequer this idea: that we get rid of the notion that income tax has to be renewed annually. We would not then need an annual Finance Bill and the Finance Minister would not be tempted to tinker with the tax system every year. That might help to bring about a degree of stability. When the Prime Minister was Chancellor, the Finance Bill proved a tinkerer&#146;s charter. He messed about with every aspect of our taxation system.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07071777000008"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, mentioned the current row about private equity. It is a scandal that people who are paid the minimum wage and move from part-time to full-time work now pay an effective marginal rate of tax of 90 per cent, and 95 per cent if they are married. Someone who has perhaps made &#163;100 million by buying a company one year and selling it two years later will pay an effective marginal rate of 10 per cent. That is a scandal; it is indefensible. How can you defend a tax system like that? Who is the author of this change? It is the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, now the Prime Minister, who introduced the 10 per cent taper relief on capital gains. He introduced the tax credit system which has created the effective high marginal rates of tax. These two initiatives undertaken by the Prime Minister have created this anomaly.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07071777000009"></a>How much more sensible it would be to have a capital tax system, perhaps a short-term tax capital gains tax that tapered to zero, that applied to all capital gains; that does not distinguish between AIM shares, shares held by private equity companies, venture capital trusts or anything else on which anyone who makes a capital gain gets taxed. That kind of simplification would not only make it easier for people to understand our tax system but it would also remove the anomalies and unfairness which are created.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07071777000010"></a>I have been critical of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. I am a great admirer of his. Many people in Scotland would like to raise a statue to him in honour of the Barnett formula. He is a typically modest politician, and the only one I know who spends his life trying to get abolished something that was named after him. He shows clarity of thought. His comments on non-domiciled taxpayers are an example of anomalies in the system which creates complexity. I ask noble Lords, how can it be right that a young couple buying their first home in London, or in any other part of the country, have to  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_173"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pay stamp duty at 1 per cent while someone living in London as a non-domiciled taxpayer can buy a house for &#163;20 million and pay no stamp duty at all? What kind of nonsense is that? Again, the Government have said that they will review the system for non-domiciled taxpayers, but nothing has happened to bring about equity in the tax system. There is too much tax law and too little scrutiny.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07071777000011"></a>The work done by the Select Committee on Economic Affairs is excellent, but why can we not build on it? As the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, said, there is expertise here. I think that he did himself a great disservice. I was not in Parliament until 1983, but I have heard the tales that the Finance Committee used to sit until four o&#146;clock in the morning with people of real substance arguing points of detail with knowledge and authority. That no longer takes place in the other place, much to the relief, no doubt, of the Members of Parliament. Perhaps there is a case for building on the excellent work done by the Economic Affairs Committee and creating a Joint Committee of both Houses to look at Finance Bills.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07071777000012"></a>I return to my idea of getting rid of the annual need to renew income tax. If that were done, a timetable requiring that means of supply must be concluded by the summer after the Budget would disappear. We could have a more leisurely pace for considering tax matters. Indeed, you could have a rule that the Chancellor was required to publish in the Pre-Budget Report in November. He would be required to pre-announce before the Budget any major tax changes in law, so that there could be proper consultation, unless of course there were revenue implications or a matter of particular urgency. A Joint Committee could take evidence and build on the kind of good work which has been done by the Economic Affairs Committee operating in a compressed timetable.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07071777000013"></a>I offer that idea to the Prime Minister because there is something very odd, is there not, about a former Chancellor who on becoming Prime Minister immediately says, &#147;I believe in more open, accountable, consultative government. Therefore, I am going to pre-announce the Queen&#146;s Speech so that people can think about it&#148;? Why did he not do that for the Finance Bill when he was Chancellor? If that treatment is good enough for the rest of the legislative programme now that he is Prime Minister, why is it not good enough for the Finance Bill? I know the answer. It is that it takes power away from the Treasury. It prevents the Treasury springing daft ideas on us, which we would have to spend time unscrambling in subsequent Bills. But it is an idea that would go a long way towards meeting the Government&#146;s declared objective of having a fairer and simpler tax system.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07071777000014"></a>I have spoken for longer than I expected. I make one other suggestion to the Government. We get Bills with vast numbers of clauses written in incomprehensible language referring to previous Bills, written in equally incomprehensible language. Would it not be possible to have an economic impact assessment of a new proposal? The Government declare that their proposals will improve competitiveness without a shred of work being done to show that that is the case, and without any attempt to give an indication of the cost and impact that it will have on business as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07071777000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Vallance, rightly pointed to the importance of economic competitiveness and what had happened to our ability to attract companies from elsewhere. I never thought I would say it, but Ireland has become a beacon of what is achievable in increasing revenues, cutting taxes and simplifying the tax system. We can have fairer, flatter, simpler, lower taxes, prosperity and growth at the same time. That is the challenge. It is a challenge on which this Government have failed, and which I hope the next Government under David Cameron&#146;s leadership will take up with gusto.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07071777000018"></a>The House of Lords very effectively scrutinises the Finance Bill. We look at the whole range of financial measures and the ones that are introduced. The membership of the committee is extremely good and includes a couple of former Chancellors of the Exchequer, a number of former Ministers and an ex-governor of the Bank of England. So we look at the Bill with a great deal of financial background, rather different from that which operates in the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07071777000019"></a>In the past 10 years we have seen unrivalled growth. Nobody ever expected that growth to continue for so long and now nobody even questions that it will continue. That is one of the great achievements of this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07071777000020"></a>My noble friend Lord Barnett said that the move to simplification would be limited. I agree with him that we cannot produce the provisions in just a few pages; it always has to have the complications of legislation, but we should agree to move in that direction. He also mentioned scrutiny of the Finance Bill. The House of Lords scrutinises the Finance Bill more effectively than does the House of Commons. We have bipartisanship in a number of areas, which obviously is of great value in examining these matters.</p>

<a name="70717-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07071777000021"></a>First, I refer to the simplification issues. We have made many changes to create fairness and a greater degree of compliance. The problem is that these changes can lead to complications. As soon as you try to have simplification and to consider fairness you find that they are frequently opposite. The better balance has to be found, which is also very difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07071777000022"></a>I refer to the evidence given in answer to question 42 by Mr McCafferty, an economist at the Institute of Directors. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="07071777000087"></a>&#147;It is clear that the abolition of the agricultural buildings allowance and the industrial buildings allowance does offer some element of greater simplicity but in terms of the other allowance changes, the changes to plant and machinery, the simple change to the relative calculations rather than simplifying the nature of the allowances and introducing a new category, that of plant integral to a building, if anything they add a further modest complication or complexity to the system&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07071777000078"></a>That is undoubtedly true and is one problem. In our report, we mention that at paragraph 21, where we state that it is understood that the present tax system is highly complex and that simplicity is essential if the United Kingdom is to be made more attractive to international businesses that can move in our direction. In paragraph 22, we state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="07071777000088"></a>&#147;We recommend that a more determined and consistent attempt at simplification be made. What we see in this Finance Bill is a very modest step and more could be done. This will necessarily take more than one year and will require a combination of administrative and legislative measures. There clearly may be a tension here with the desire for fairness: it will also be necessary not to open up scope for avoidance. But it should be possible to find a balance here if the work is well researched and subject to wide consultation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071777000079"></a>I agree entirely with that. We had a long discussion on those matters and came to general agreement on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07071777000023"></a>I turn to mandatory on-line filing, which is the main thing that I want to deal with. I understand why there is a recommendation for on-line filing. Obviously, if all taxpayers had the ability to undertake on-line filing, compulsion would be acceptable. The problem is that despite the efforts made by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, insufficient understanding has been given to the problems of those who are unable to meet the requirements. We refer to that in paragraph 265, where we state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="07071777000089"></a>&#147;The witnesses were unhappy however at any suggestion that electronic filing be made compulsory. They thought that there would be some people who would remain IT illiterate or who for whatever reason would be unable to use the service and there would be costs involved. They were also concerned at the possibility of systems breaking down, of which there was some experience&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071777000080"></a>We must understand that a number of people in this country are not as IT-literate as many of us. We go back to our rooms, switch on our computers and do all sorts of things, but many people cannot do that. To make it essential that they do that will lead to problems. As one witness said at paragraph 266,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="07071777000090"></a>&#147;We are right behind the drive but it has to be business led. It ... makes life easier for businesses and taxpayers and it reduces costs. But I do not think we are in that position at the moment ... We are a long way from having robust, reliable electronic systems ... I am afraid we disagree. What we should be concentrating on is getting these systems right and then the natural move for businesses and taxpayers will be to use them. You may then have 90% and you will have to decide what to do with the ten per cent but we are not at that position at the moment&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07071777000081"></a>Theresa Middleton of HMRC said:</p>
<ul><a name="07071777000095"></a>&#147;we believe [compulsion] is essential to maximise the benefits for business&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071777000082"></a>The problem is the timing. At present, there is a number of not very computer-literate people engaged in businesses. She believes that some employers should not be required to file on-line until 2010.</p>

We understand why HMRC has taken the line which it has and certainly it has taken many steps to encourage on-line filing: it should continue to do so by every means. But the range of issues raised by our private sector witnesses need further consideration. There should be further concentration on ensuring the robustness and reliability of the systems and on making the change more attractive for those who are IT illiterate. We do not think that the efficiency savings to HMRC justify compulsion ... we recommend that the present proposals for requiring online filing by smaller businesses be dropped: better marketing by HMRC of the benefits of e-filing would be a better approach. There may come a time when e-filing could be made compulsory, but we think it premature at present,&#148;.</p>

We are also grateful for the report produced by my noble friend Lord Wakeham. As usual, his committee has produced a thorough and professional document, to which I shall return shortly.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07071777000027"></a>First, I want to make some comments about the economic background to the Budget. Then I want to look at the area of simplifying tax. Then I shall look at the Budget in a bit more detail. Finally, I will look at some other areas of my noble friend Lord Wakeham&#146;s report.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07071777000028"></a>First, I shall look at the economic background to the Budget. The Minister is right to emphasise the record of economic growth and the noble Lords, Lord Barnett and Lord Sheldon, the inflation record so far&#151;although there might be a case for being more cautious now. The Chancellor claimed that,</p>
<ul><a name="07071777000096"></a>&#147;our fiscal discipline is the foundation of the strength of Britain's finances&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071777000084"></a>If the story were that simple, he would have had the cash to cut taxes uniformly, rather than reducing the burden on some taxpayers while raising it for others. Nor would he be planning a squeeze on taxation and public expenditure over the next three years that will raise the tax burden to levels last seen at the start of the 1980s.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07071777000029"></a>Let us look back at the Chancellor's record on public finances since Labour first came to power. Between 1997 and 2001, the public finances improved sharply as the result of extremely tight controls on public expenditure and unexpectedly rapid growth in tax revenues. Then the Chancellor started spending and a black hole of lost revenues emerged. The Treasury's forecasts moved from persistently pessimistic to overly optimistic. The cyclically adjusted current budget surplus fell into deficit and, at its worst, was 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2004-05. The Chancellor has been clawing back that deficit ever since, first with upfront and stealthy tax increases raising tax rates and revenues as a share of GDP, then by planning much tighter public spending control in the years ahead.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07071777000030"></a>Every year since 2001&#151;for seven Budgets in a row&#151;the Treasury public sector net borrowing forecasts have been too optimistic. Analysis of the Budget figures shows a current budget deficit that is &#163;3 billion higher than the Chancellor's December forecast in 2007-08 and &#163;1 billion worse in every subsequent year.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07071777000031"></a>The problems have come from forecasting taxes and public expenditure. Tax revenue predictions have again been too optimistic and the Treasury has had difficulty in living within its current generous spending totals. Compared with last year&#146;s Budget, tax revenues are now projected to be &#163;2.1 billion lower in 2007-08. Corporate tax revenue is the villain of the piece, with North Sea oil revenue falling far short of expectation. The Chancellor blamed a lower oil price, lower production, higher investment and a stronger pound for reducing sterling profits in the North Sea. I would argue that the tax increases in 2002 and 2005 have been a big hindrance. In addition, the Chancellor has extraordinarily excluded oil companies from the corporation tax cut, which I shall come to later. Can the Minister say why they have been excluded?</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07071777000032"></a>On public expenditure, the Treasury was also unable to keep within spending plans for day-to-day bills, overshooting by &#163;1 billion this year and &#163;2 billion subsequently. &#147;So what&#148;, you might say. Persistent forecasting errors delay the point at which the Government can stop squeezing the public with a higher tax burden and slower spending growth.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07071777000033"></a>I turn to my noble friend Lord Wakeham&#146;s report. One of the three key topics covered by the report is the simplification of business tax. I agree with my noble friend&#146;s conclusion that more needs to be done in this area, and would extend that observation to personal tax. As the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, said, since 1997 <I>Tolley&#146;s Tax Guide</I>, which is usually referred to as the accountant&#146;s bible, has doubled in length to 9,841 pages. Prior to the 2006 Budget, a Pricewaterhouse and World Bank survey stated that the length of our tax code was second only to India: 8,300 pages of primary legislation compared with India&#146;s 9,000 pages. The 2006 and 2007 Bills have probably made the UK&#146;s tax code of primary legislation the longest in the world.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07071777000034"></a>According to the <I>Financial Times</I> of 22 March, in private briefings to a financially aware audience after the Budget, the Chancellor made a virtue of his reforming Budget. He claimed that it would secure his legacy as a tax simplifier, trumping even that of the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, between 1983 and 1989. But is this portrait of Mr Brown as a tax simplifier convincing? Did he not introduce many of the measures abolished yesterday? And will the personal and corporate tax system really be less complicated in future than it was, say, a decade ago? The Institute of Chartered Accountants described the Budget as,</p>
<ul><a name="07071777000097"></a>&#147;a piecemeal budget which tinkers with the system rather than starting the comprehensive reform which is so overdue&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70717-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07071777000035"></a>While the Chancellor&#146;s proposals reduce the number of tax and national insurance rates from five to three by April 2009, the story does not end there because many people will have to claim tax credits if they are to be winners from the personal tax changes. If tax credits are included, there are still myriad rates of tax. According to the <I>Financial Times</I> of 22 March, a lone parent with two children faces a 70 per cent tax rate until earning more than &#163;25,000 a year. It states that more than 1.7 million people face these extremely high marginal tax rates, as my noble friend Lord Forsyth said, and have to deal with a tax system so complicated that a Revenue and Customs official admitted just  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_178"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>before the Budget that she did not expect ordinary people to understand their tax credit awards. Since the personal tax reforms include another expansion of tax credits, the <I>Financial Times</I> believes that,</p>
<ul><a name="07071777000098"></a>&#147;it would take a bold chancellor to describe them as simpler than the current system&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70717-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07071777000036"></a>Turning to the detail of the Finance Bill itself, as usual, I will give praise where it is due. I can applaud increased investment in science and technology innovation with support for research and development in the area of fuel efficiency. I can also respect some of the raft of environmental proposals, such as grants for home insulation and heating for pensioners. I can also applaud reduced VAT on energy efficiency in the home. In the area of savings, it is good that there has been an increase, albeit small, in the overall ISA limit from &#163;7,000 to &#163;7,200. On the Chancellor&#146;s tax measures overall, however, they can be summed up in one sentence: what the Chancellor gave on the one hand, he took away with the other. For example, with regard to personal tax, the 2p cut in income tax was funded by the abolition of the lower 10p rate and an increase in the upper limit on national insurance contributions, moves which mean that few people will pay less tax and lower income households with no children will be worse off. It was curious though, that the Chancellor chose not to abolish the 10p band on certain interest income, prompting Mike Brewer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="07071777000099"></a>&#147;if the budget was genuinely about simplification the chancellor would have gone the extra step and abolished this anomaly&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70717-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07071777000037"></a>Likewise, on the corporation-tax front, the 2p cut will be funded by the clawback from raising the small business corporation tax rate and the overhaul of capital reliefs. Essentially, that means that while long-life assets are written off quicker, the vast majority of assets now take a further two years before 90 per cent of their value is written off. Many commentators were unhappy with the sudden scrapping of industrial building allowances and agricultural building allowances&#151;which amounted in effect to retrospective taxation. In my view it would have been fairer if allowances for existing buildings had been kept. Also, the Chancellor is poised to recoup nearly &#163;1 billion a year by clamping down on corporation tax relief for empty industrial buildings.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07071777000038"></a>Smaller and medium-sized companies were particularly badly hit by the Budget. They will see their tax rate rise by 1 per cent per annum to 22 per cent by 2009. While the Chancellor has put in place a 100 per cent investment allowance for the first &#163;50,000 of capital spending, details of which were not in the Finance Bill, this will not help service companies. Smaller companies are now paying more tax than in 1997, according to Roy Maugham, a tax practitioner at the accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young. Does the Minister think that that sends the wrong signal if the Chancellor is trying to create an entrepreneurial environment?</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07071777000039"></a>Another area that I wish to focus on, which may appear rather technical but I think goes clearly against the former Chancellor&#146;s expressed wish for simplicity in taxation, is the so-called targeted anti-avoidance rule&#151;TAAR&#151;for capital losses. I am indebted to Simon Mabey, tax partner at Smith and Williamson, for alerting me to this. I am referring to the general CGT anti-avoidance rule in Clause 27 of the current  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_179"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Finance Bill. HMRC has issued guidance to the clause in a separate document completely outside the Bill. The Chartered Institute of Taxation, in its submission of 1 June, makes the following statement:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="07071777000093"></a>&#147;The proposed guidance is likely to be ineffective as we believe it is (improperly) attempting to concede by concession relief from losses which Clause 27 has granted&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70717-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07071777000040"></a>So we have the curious situation where, as Mr Mabey believes, HMRC is taxing by legislation and un-taxing by guidance.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07071777000041"></a>Taxpayers should also worry about the Wilkinson judgment which said inter alia:</p>
<ul><a name="07071777000100"></a>&#147;HMRC&#146;s powers ... could not be construed so widely to enable the commissioners to concede, by extra statutory concession, an allowance which parliament could have granted but had not granted&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071777000085"></a>In another place, Mr Ed Balls defended the Government&#146;s approach, saying that experience with the company TAAR had been good and he could not understand why the Chartered Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants were concerned about Clause 27. That missed the point that companies are rather different from individuals and do not have spouses or trusts. The Chartered Institute of Taxation is considering judicial review of the guidance rules, and I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s up-to-date view on this area.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07071777000042"></a>The report of my noble friend Lord Wakeham and his committee&#146;s views on managed service companies are full of good sense. The verdict in paragraph 305 is clear that,</p>
<ul><a name="07071777000101"></a>&#147;the Government should review the taxation of employees and small businesses operating in various forms with a view to making structural changes to reduce the differences in outcome in terms of tax and NICs payable&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70717-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07071777000043"></a>The third topic covered by the report was the Finance Bill and the review of powers, deterrents and safeguards. I particularly support the sentiments of paragraph 320, which says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="07071777000094"></a>&#147;We see it as particularly important that where serious matters such as powers and penalties are under consideration, as much as possible is written into primary legislation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071777000086"></a>This re-echoes my concern, which I have already stated, about Clause 27. I also like the idea expressed in paragraph 327 that serious consideration should be given to setting out the way these powers have been exercised in the previous year and how the assurances that have been given at the present time are being adhered to.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07071777000044"></a>The report&#146;s section on online filing and electronic payment recommends in paragraph 336 that present proposals for requiring online filing by smaller businesses should be dropped because it is premature. I agree. However, I am surprised that the report makes no mention of the accelerated date of 31 October for income tax self-assessment returns from the tax year 2007-08 onwards that are filed manually. Will the Minister say why this date has been brought forward from 31 January, as it may well make it difficult for some taxpayers to provide the information in time?</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07071777000045"></a>In summary, the Budget fails to simplify the tax system&#151;a simplification that is desperately required. I like my noble friend Lord Forsyth&#146;s idea of an economic impact assessment on any future tax changes.</p>

I join the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, in expressing the hope that this Chancellor will see this committee as having a major and positive part to play in developing public policy on taxation, unlike the current Prime Minister, who saw it in some way as a threat to the constitutional settlement that has been in place for about 100 years.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07071777000047"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, that Parliament could do more to improve the way in which taxation is considered. I think that our colleagues in another place would find revolutionary his proposal for a Joint Committee of both Houses on taxation. Much as I am in favour of radical and revolutionary change in some things, I simply do not believe that that is within the bounds of possibility, although perhaps we could consider it in a review on the powers and operating structures of your Lordships&#146; House. However, I am not overly optimistic. We on these Benches have for a long time been in favour of a slightly different way of getting around this, although it may be no more realistic&#151;a tax administration Act that would deal not with tax rates but with all tax administration issues. Such an Act could logically be subject to scrutiny in both places. We have advocated it for a long time, but I fear that we have made no more progress than the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, in advocating a Joint Committee. We all agree, however, that the current scrutiny of tax legislation is inadequate, not least given its length and complexity. Although I congratulated the sub-committee&#151;I have served on it and know how hard it works&#151;I fear that it does not have the impact that its work really justifies.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07071777000048"></a>The part of the sub-committee report that has taken the most time to debate this evening and that is arguably the most important relates to tax simplification, particularly for businesses. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, was too pessimistic when he suggested that nothing can be done to simplify tax. The choice is not between the tax system that we have today and a simple tax system, which probably is a chimera, but between the tax system that we have today and a simpler tax system, which is possible. Incidentally, a simpler system is possible without being as generous as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, suggested when he said that the system can be simplified only within the context of reducing the overall tax burden. I do not see why one cannot have a simplification in which there are losers as well as winners, as we have seen with this Budget.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07071777000049"></a>I float two suggestions this evening. The first, made by my noble friend Lord Vallance, would be to abolish capital allowances and to replace them using tax-deductible depreciation as the basis of corporate taxation. That would be a simplification. For all the Government&#146;s trumpeting of their simplification in this Budget in this area, they did not simplify it at all, as the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, pointed out. In some respects, they have made things more difficult. The second simplification would be the introduction of a general  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_181"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>anti-avoidance rule, which we believe would remove a minimum of 500 pages of tax legislation. That would undoubtedly be a simplification. We would need a sensible pre-clearance system, as this simplification would not be straightforward, but if we want to simplify the tax code, that is one way of doing it. It is by no means impossible to do.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07071777000050"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, said, the Budget was a sort of &#147;now you see it, now you don&#146;t&#148; Budget. On the one hand, there were tax cuts such as the cut in the main rate of corporation tax. In the small print, however, the rate for small companies went up and the capital allowance changes meant that more revenue was coming in, so the overall effect was neutral. Equally, the two income tax changes more or less cancelled each other out. The one unambiguously tax-raising measure, which we debated a couple of weeks ago, related to empty property relief. I will not repeat those arguments again, except to say that the way of introducing this so-called rationalisation&#151;a marvellous phrase in the Red Book to describe a major tax increase&#151;and the economic costs that it will incur in areas of low demand and high unemployment mean that its net economic benefits are likely to be modest at best.</p>

<a name="70717-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07071777000051"></a>Looking forward, reports in the press in recent days have said that the Chancellor is planning to announce the Comprehensive Spending Review and the Pre-Budget Report together. In many ways, this is a sensible approach. In our own lives, we tend to have to worry about expenditure and income together, but will the Minister confirm that this is going to happen this year? If it is, will he also confirm that it will happen on 17 October?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70717-0009.htm"/>


<a name="70717-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07071777000052"></a>What are the key challenges for the Chancellor? The main challenge for the macro-economy appears to relate to the consequences of higher interest rates and continuing higher inflationary pressures. These challenges are most likely to be seen when those who have incurred high levels of personal debt find that they can no longer cope as interest rates remain high. I fear that we will return to this issue a number of times in the months ahead. The second challenge relates to the public finances and the squeeze on public expenditure, particularly public sector salaries, which has been heralded in recent times. The Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, was planning and continues to plan on the basis of a rise in public sector pay of 1.9 per cent&#151;a real-terms wage cut. The imposition of such a cut makes one wonder whether the Government are signalling that they believe that public sector workers have been paid too much in recent times, or is the real reason that, having increased public expenditure at unprecedented rates in recent years, public sector pay is the easiest element of expenditure to reign in? Either way, it seems to us that a period of rapidly rising public sector pay, followed by one in which there will be real wage cuts for the public sector, is not a wise way to manage employees or the public sector as a whole.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07071777000053"></a>The third challenge is almost new; it is an issue that, until recent months, has not reared its head much. It has to do with fairness and inequality. Today a number of noble Lords have discussed elements of  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_182"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the tax system which are now seen as encouraging inequality. There is evidence that inequality is rising, and stands at its highest level in more than 40 years, according to the report of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. We know that the bottom 20 per cent of households pay a higher proportion of their income in taxes than the top 20 per cent of households. In this afternoon&#146;s discussion we have heard that inequalities are rising, in part because the super rich are able to pay lower taxes at the margin than those on low incomes.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07071777000054"></a>When we last debated this issue, last week, it was suggested by a number of noble Lords that it did not matter that private equity millionaires paid tax at a lower rate than their cleaners, because in aggregate they paid a lot more. That does not sound fair or acceptable, but for many it is even worse than that. John Moulton, head of Alchemy Partners, recently stated that a large chunk of private equity players pay no tax at all. The debate about the tax treatment of the very wealthy, whether private equity magnates or the growing number of non-doms, is very important not only for tax receipts, but for the kind of society we want to live in. I accept that we should not impose a punitive tax regime that punishes effort and risk-taking, but paying a level of tax that broadly equates with the rest of the population is not an unduly harsh principle to apply to the very rich.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07071777000055"></a>The galling aspect of this is that, in part, at least, the problems we now see with the very rich and their ability to avoid tax, stem from changes that this Chancellor has made to the tax system itself. First, I refer to capital gains tax taper relief, which other noble Lords have discussed. The relief was originally designed to encourage enterprise but at its extreme it now accrues to second-home owners and those sophisticated financiers who are able to roll up interest on debt into capital. It now costs the Exchequer more than &#163;6 billion per annum.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07071777000056"></a>Another issue, which has not really been discussed this afternoon but is an unacceptable anomaly, is the way that inheritance tax is now, for the very rich, in effect, a voluntary tax. However, for the affluent middle classes, it is a tax that bears increasingly heavily. Since 2000, the number of estates charged inheritance tax and valued at more than &#163;2 million has fallen by 8 per cent, which is clearly crazy, given the vast increase in the number of such estates. The number of estates valued at between &#163;300,000 and &#163;500,000 and covered by inheritance tax has increased by 20 per cent.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07071777000057"></a>By transferring ownership of property to an offshore trust or company, the stamp duty bill on high-value property can be reduced from 4 per cent to a mere 0.5 per cent, which equates to &#163;175,000 on a &#163;5 million house. These are changes which have occurred because of changes to the tax system. The good news is that having changed them in one direction, it is equally possible to change them back. I have three or four suggestions for the Chancellor to consider over the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07071777000058"></a>First, he can abolish capital gains tax taper relief altogether. That was the system before it was introduced by this Government; it can revert to the previous

Secondly, he can make non-doms pay capital gains tax on the property they buy and sell in the UK by simply changing the rules that apply. Thirdly, he can close the loophole that allows individuals, in effect, to move their houses offshore. Fourthly, he could change the inheritance tax rules by extending the seven-year rule on gifts to 15 years, and using the proceeds to lift the threshold towards &#163;500,000. These are simple changes which the Chancellor could make in the next Budget. They would begin to address some of the major issues of fairness and inequality discussed by noble Lords this afternoon.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07071777000059"></a>As ever, this debate has taken place at the end of a Session. When we next debate these issues, it will be unusually close to the beginning of the next Session. We hope that Treasury Ministers have a productive summer, considering the ideas noble Lords have given them this afternoon, but I doubt that they will.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07071777000061"></a>At 309 pages, this year&#146;s Finance Bill is long but relatively modest compared with those of recent years. Nevertheless, it helps the UK to retain its title of the longest tax code in the world, having overtaken India a couple of months ago. My noble friend Lord Northbrook referred to this. Our tax code is not only long but it is so complex that the World Bank has said that it now threatens our international competitiveness. The committee chaired by my noble friend Lord Wakeham specifically looked at the extent to which this Finance Bill created any move towards simplification and concluded, rightly, that it did not do so. What little simplification there was in the Bill was outweighed by yet more complexity. I simply do not recognise the Minister&#146;s description in his opening remarks of the Bill as &#147;a simplifying package.&#148;</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07071777000062"></a>The Treasury&#146;s usual mantra is that complexity is necessary in order to combat tax avoidance and thereby achieve fairness. The Treasury does not grasp that simplification requires a radically new approach to tax legislation, which does not rely on micromanagement by way of reliefs and allowances, in turn buttressed by reams of anti-avoidance legislation. I share the approach of my noble friend Lord Forsyth to simplification: it can be achieved if there is the will.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07071777000063"></a>The Treasury&#146;s approach to simplification is much the same as its approach to lower rates of tax. I am pleased that my noble friend Lord Forsyth spoke today about the example of Ireland. His tax commission report last year was a valuable analysis of the benefits of both lower rates of tax and simplification. The Treasury really does not believe in either of those things. As has been pointed out, the Budget this year had some lower rates of tax, both corporate and personal, but it was not a Budget that reduced taxes. At best it merely redistributed them, but there were some significant categories of loser. Most of the media spotted that it was, to use the phrase coined by my honourable friend George Osborne, a &#147;tax con budget.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07071777000064"></a>This Finance Bill is the only opportunity your Lordships&#146; House has to debate the Budget from which it derives, since we do not customarily ask for the Chancellor&#146;s Budget Statement to be repeated in your Lordships&#146; House. We may well wish to revisit this in future because it is not satisfactory that your Lordships&#146; House has no timely opportunity to debate the economic and fiscal judgments in the Budget.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07071777000065"></a>The Budget was the last to be delivered before the Chancellor finally succeeded in his takeover bid for Number 10. It is right that we pause to examine his 10 years of economic stewardship. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, loves to predict what I am going to say in my speeches; I am not going to disappoint him. But let me disappoint him in another regard: I am not going to talk about either tax credits or the Barnett formula.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07071777000066"></a>The good thing about the Chancellor&#146;s stewardship is that he has continued the period of unbroken growth which we started in 1992. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, that it started in 1992 and not in 1997. But the UK&#146;s growth rate is now among the worst in the EU and there are other downsides. In 1997, RPI inflation was 3.1 per cent. This morning&#146;s news had it at 4.4 per cent. Since 1997, the trade deficit in manufactured goods has increased more than eightfold to &#163;59 billion and industrial production has stagnated. In 1997, the savings ratio was around 10 per cent. In the first quarter of this year, it had collapsed to 2.1 per cent. If one strips out the effect of employer pension contributions, the savings ratio is currently negative. In 1997, the Government inherited one of the best occupational pension schemes in the world. It is now one of the worst. That is not my judgment, but that of Mr Frank Field. The ACT raid was a big part of that. Unemployment overall may not be that bad, but the number of young people not in employment, education or training&#151;the so-called NEET&#151;has risen by 27 per cent in 10 years, which is not satisfactory.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07071777000067"></a>The past 10 years have been characterised by a combination of rising taxes and borrowing. Taxes as a percentage of GDP are now at levels not seen since the early 1980s. Borrowing is perilously close to the Chancellor&#146;s 40 per cent rule. We and the British public might not have minded all the extra tax and borrowing if our money had been spent wisely, but public expenditure has been accompanied by no public service reform and no amount of statistical ingenuity can mask the fact that for the past eight years public sector efficiency has been negative.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07071777000068"></a>The Budget also announced corporation tax and income tax changes that will be included in next year&#146;s Finance Bill. The Prime Minister has left his successor in the Treasury with very little room for manoeuvre on the tax front in the next couple of years, a point to which the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, has already referred. In turn, this will no doubt give the new Chancellor a problem on spending when he announces his Comprehensive Spending Review. So I join the noble Lord, Lord Newby, in asking the Minister to confirm that 17 October will be the date for the announcement of the CSR. I also ask the Minister to say whether that CSR statement will be combined with the Pre-Budget Report, as has been suggested in some parts of the media.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07071777000069"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, has already referred to the swingeing increase in business taxes from the removal of empty property relief from business rates, which will cost the business sector another &#163;1 billion or so each year. We have already debated that Bill, which I regret to say recently completed its passage through your Lordships' House without amendment. Like the Finance Bill, it was a money Bill and, hence, unamendable in your Lordships' House. I rather hope that the constitutional settlement referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, will be revised, because this House has a lot to offer on tax legislation, as the committee chaired by my noble friend Lord Wakeham amply demonstrates each year.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07071777000070"></a>The corporation tax changes were presented as largely neutral, but, of course, life is not that simple and there certainly will be winners and losers. This timid reduction in the headline rate to 28 per cent hardly affects our position in the international tax league tables, to which the noble Lord, Lord Vallance, referred. The report from my noble friend Lord Wakeham showed that our tax competitiveness remains a very serious concern. As has been said, small companies are hit even harder with their headline rate rising to 22 per cent. This, too, is presented as revenue neutral due to new investment allowances, but not all small companies will invest enough to trigger the allowances; and who can blame them with interest rates now rising to the highest level for eight years?</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07071777000071"></a>I can remember when the previous Paymaster General explicitly encouraged small businesses to incorporate. She actively sold the lower tax regime that applied to small companies. But the past few years have seen a progressive reversal of the advantages because the Government decided that when small businesses took advantage of them, as they were encouraged to do, it amounted to tax avoidance.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07071777000072"></a>The Government have a new seek-and-exterminate weapon in the managed service company provisions in this year&#146;s Finance Bill. We are concerned that the new provisions will affect more companies than might reasonably be targeted and that there will be unintended consequences for the labour market. More importantly, my noble friend Lord Wakeham&#146;s committee has highlighted that this is yet another piecemeal alteration to a system that has structural faults. I hope that the Minister will respond clearly to the recommendation made in the report that the issues of tax between the employed, the self-employed and those operating through a company need an overhaul. In his introductory remarks he referred to the recommendation but did not give a clear, unambiguous response to it.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07071777000073"></a>The Finance Bill includes a significant increase in HMRC&#146;s powers, which we predicted when the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Bill was debated in your Lordships' House. We completely support HMRC having the necessary powers to combat tax avoidance, but we fear that, armed with its new police-type powers, the culture of HMRC could change towards the vast majority of taxpayers who are compliant.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07071777000074"></a>One of the worst bits of the new powers&#151;using the term &#147;HMRC think&#148;&#151;was modified in the other place, but we remain concerned about how this and the other powers will be used. I join my noble friend Lord

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07071777000075"></a>Clause 98 contains a modest provision aimed at combating missing intra-Community trader fraud. Last year&#146;s Finance Act contained the more substantial reverse-charge provisions, but these were not implemented until last month because we had to wait to get permission from the EU, which resulted in a considerable watering-down of our proposals. Noble Lords might find it extraordinary that we had to go cap in hand to Brussels in order to fight VAT fraudsters. They will doubtless find it even more extraordinary that we have had to concede another &#163;7.2 billion of our rebate in the process. Will the Minister update the House on the net impact on the UK economy of the diminished reverse charge provisions less the cost of the rebate given away? Is there now any net benefit to the United Kingdom?</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07071777000076"></a>There is much more in this Bill which is unattractive. There is a continuing attack on private pensions in the provisions on alternatively secured pensions and pension term assurance. The sideways loss relief provisions in Schedule 4 and the capital loss provisions of Clause 26 are so widely drawn that they require heavy intervention by HMRC to make the provisions half-way decent. The so-called environmental provisions are primarily a vehicle for raising taxes via air passenger duty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07071777000077"></a>The Minister was loyal in his introduction of the Bill, but I do not believe that he can take pride in it. We have no option but to let the Bill pass, but we take no pride in so doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07071796000004"></a>I emphasise the fact that about 60 per cent of the Budget represents the result of extensive consultation with all those affected, which is why we have, in crucial areas, an element of consensus on the changes. I understand what the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, have said about the general issues with regard to the Budget and the management of the economy, but they will not be surprised that I disagree with their analysis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07071796000005"></a>As I said in my opening remarks, when I tried to presage the Government&#146;s response to the important aspects of the report, we take the report very seriously indeed. As the report recognises, the issue of managed service companies is complex, but we are resolved on tackling it and we will engage in further consultation. We need to produce legislation that balances clarity and certainty and is robust against abuse. An important technical area to which we need to address more thought in the light of the report is the growth of these companies and the problem of the issue of taxation with regard to employment, or other returns as far as taxation is concerned. That is the most important aspect of the report and the Government will pay serious attention to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07071796000006"></a>I want to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, who mentioned online taxation, and my noble friend Lord Sheldon, who devoted the bulk of his speech to the issue. I agree with both of them. Progress in this area is a reflection of the increasing capacity of business to cope with online demands, which will improve relationships between the tax-gathering authorities and business and the taxpayer. My noble friend is right; we must not run before we can walk. We must bear in mind the fact that not everyone is totally familiar with IT capabilities. We could not possibly make it mandatory. Compliance could not be met by those who were incapable. We have to approach this with some care, but as my noble friend will recognise, because he played his part in the committee, and as the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, identified, this is an area where, certainly as far as business is concerned, we are getting an increasingly voluntary approach to online compliance, which we expect to grow. Percentages are increasing right across business. I am not just talking about the big corporations; small businesses, too, are showing increasing capacity to comply. We will therefore seek to extend against the capacity of taxpayers to respond while recognising that reserve point of my noble friend Lord Sheldon that we would not dare to make it mandatory in law in circumstances where people were just not able to comply. So we will make progress on those issues.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07071796000007"></a>My noble friend Lord Barnett raised a wide range of issues. He is not going to get an answer from me on the Barnett formula today. He asked a direct question only a week ago and I thought that I gave him a perfectly satisfactory answer&#151;he totally disagreed with it, of course, as he said to me outside the Chamber afterwards. I have no doubt that he is going to sustain the pressure, but I have nothing more to add such a short time after I last tried to give him satisfaction on the matter. He will have to rest content with the Government&#146;s position for the time being.</p>

<a name="70717-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07071796000008"></a>I heard what my noble friend said about the tax credit system; he said that he thought that the American system was better. I am not in a position to comment. I have enough trouble keeping up with British systems of taxation and support without trying to verse myself deeply in American systems, so I cannot be authoritative in my response about the comparison with the American system. Despite the difficulties, we all recognise that the tax credit system, as we seek to make it work effectively for everyone who is entitled to it, still provides 20 million people, including 6 million families and 10 million children, with support. The take-up is a significant success. The latest figures show that the take-up rose from 79 per cent to 82 per cent in 2004-05. There is no doubt that it has decreased the level of poverty among many of the people whom we always had difficulty reaching with any other form of support in terms of benefits. Therefore, the Government, as my noble friend knows only too well, will seek to improve the system while defending the concept behind it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07071796000009"></a>Where I did enjoy my noble friend&#146;s contribution was when he referred to the extent to which any proposals from the Lib Dems on the reduction and even the abolition of income tax in favour of massive

The noble Lord, Lord Vallance, also gave voice to certain aspects of possible reductions in taxation. Unless the proposal is to significantly reduce resources to the Exchequer, noble Lords on those Benches will have to address themselves to where the costs would lie. Of course, they may be able to convince the electorate that very heavy emphasis on green taxes will produce these resources.</p>

He will know how difficult it is to persuade the electorate of the enormous virtues to be seen in a massive increase in air passenger duty or in a tax on fuel, or in other areas that I have no doubt his party will need to canvass if it is to make its figures add up on the overall position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07071796000012"></a>My noble friend Lord Barnett also questioned me on another area that we have debated in the House quite recently&#151;non-domiciled status. He indicated that he thought that the time for us to reach our conclusions was overdue. However, the review has been thorough and considered over a period of time. He will recognise that we have to balance the effects on the economy of tax returns with concerns among the public about the unfairness that certain aspects of non-domiciled status convey. I say to him that, when he is pressing the Government in this respect, he is joining a large number of representations. The Government are not mindless&#151;or do not fail to be mindful, I should say more accurately&#151;of the importance of fairness with regard to taxation and we intend to produce conclusions on this in due course. What he cannot expect me to do&#151;although I do not think that he expects it in his wildest dreams&#151;is to speak about the Finance Bill and produce fresh taxation proposals at this very late stage. I am not going to do it. He is going to have to put up with the Bill that we have before us, which I will defend rigorously.</p>

What is the logic of this? What is it that the Government need to think about here? Can the noble Lord tell us what the Government think makes this a justifiable system?</p>

The noble Lord shakes his head, which may suggest that the Conservative Government never had the slightest problem with rates of taxation in terms of both their effectiveness and fairness. All I can say to that is that they made a sorry mess of 18 years in power given that they found managing the economy so extraordinarily facile and straightforward. I think that the noble Lord will have to give credit to the Chancellor for having to wrestle with some fairly complex issues in areas where changes to rates of taxation have to be measured against what the yield might be. In another context, the noble Lord would be the first to acknowledge the fact that, if you increase the taxation for a particular group, the yield may not necessarily be greater. I hope that he will recognise the importance of my point.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, set a magnificent example, but I am not sure that he has been totally successful in influencing the overall debate. Certainly the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, has engaged in this debate in similar terms to those that he used so ably when he was in another place.

Some noble Lords have suggested that it will not be long before the House matches the Commons in its responsibilities for the Finance Bill. Some disparaging remarks were made about the conduct of the other place. If it is said about the other end of the building that people there over-engage in politics, it must be

If the fault lies anywhere at this time, it lies on the Conservative Benches, but it is the same fault that we enjoyed when we were in opposition. However, this House is a revising Chamber and its responsibility for finance is bound to be more limited, so I do not think that it is suitable for us to suggest that we should take an equal position with the other place regarding this Bill. What we can do is bring informed comments and considered thoughts to the matter, and the debate has strongly reflected that.</p>

It will not have escaped the attention of noble Lords that there have been one or two minor transitions in the Government in recent weeks, which may occasion a slight change in the dates. I apologise to the noble Lord and the noble Baroness for not being able to assure them on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07071796000022"></a>On the overall position as presented, the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and to a more moderate degree the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, identified failures of the Government as represented in this Finance Bill and in the way in which we have conducted the economy over the past few years. I have to say that the House needs to recognise the confidence with which the Government approach these issues. I heard the noble Baroness bemoan the fact that interest rates are rising. Interest rates have risen to 5.75 per cent at the present time. That must be measured against the record of the previous Administration, which never managed to get them down into single figures. That is the difference.</p>

<a name="70717-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07071796000039"></a>The noble Baroness said: I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 216 and 217. These amendments take us to the area of overview and scrutiny. Amendment No. 215 deals with who shall be subject to the attention of an overview and scrutiny committee. The amendment proposes that this should extend beyond the immediate local government family to others who provide services.</p>

<a name="70717-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07071796000040"></a>The White Paper stressed the need to expand competition and to have a diversity of providers. I think that it said that service deliverers should not be protected from public scrutiny. The requirement could apply to contractors delivering services through contracts and companies involved in public/private partnerships, which are a very topical issue. I say in parenthesis that the Greater London Assembly has paid some attention, and will pay a good deal more, to the London Underground PPP with Metronet. However, it is a bit early to apply the word &#147;legacy&#148; to the new Prime Minister. The amendment could apply also to PFI consortia, joint ventures, strategic service delivery partnerships and so on.</p>

<a name="70717-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07071796000041"></a>The Bill extends councils&#146; scrutiny powers to enable them to require the attendance and engagement in scrutiny of public service bodies defined as &#147;partner authorities&#148; in Clause 106. Partner authorities have a duty to co-operate in the context of local area agreements. They are required to take part in scrutiny and to have regard to scrutiny recommendations where the scrutiny report or recommendation relates to a local improvement target in the local area agreement. Amendment No. 216 would strengthen the duty to take part in scrutiny by requiring participation in scrutiny meetings as well as the provision of information. I am sure that the Committee will understand that it is not possible adequately to scrutinise an activity unless one can ask questions. Simply receiving written information is not enough. Amendment No. 217 would extend the scope of scrutiny to require the participation of partner authorities more broadly on issues which are of specifically local concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07071796000042"></a>This area was debated in Committee in the Commons where the Minister referred to the first of my amendments as being &#147;unnecessary and potentially bureaucratic&#148;. She added that it &#147;could undermine accountability&#148;. She raised an interesting point. Is it confusing and does it dilute accountability to require contractors to provide information to overview and scrutiny committees, as she said? She talked about encouraging,</p>

<p><a name="07071796000056"></a>It is interesting to note where the balance lies in this. Intellectually, one should hold to account the partner authority which engages the contractor. That is absolutely right. But in a world where we look to contractors to do so much work for local communities, and where they are brought in by the local authority, it is right to consider whether the contractor should be subject directly to the scrutiny function.</p>

<a name="70717-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07071796000043"></a>Contractors would also be witnesses, as it were, in this structure. What they have to say in explaining how things are working as part of the total picture is important. I should like to think that the Minister&#146;s comments in the Commons constituted a rowing back from contracting out services, but I suspect that they were not.</p>

<a name="70717-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07071796000044"></a>The Minister in the Commons also talked about overview and scrutiny committees being able to investigate any issue, to decide for themselves what they wanted to do and to &#147;ask anybody to attend&#148;. She referred to ploys that an overview and scrutiny committee might use to shine the spotlight on an unco-operative contractor. That is all very well. She referred to the occasion when the noble Lord, Lord Hattersley, did not accept an invitation to appear on the programme &#147;Have I Got News For You&#148; and a tub of lard was put in his place. However, you can do that only once. The formal arrangements and powers are important. I would not want to symbolise the shortcomings of local government members by putting tubs of lard in their places and recording that in the minutes. I do not think that is the way to go. I beg to move.</p>

Therefore, it is clear that we support it and are in general sympathetic to it. It needs to be made clear that it refers to organisations and contractors that are funded by the council; that is, the council is handing taxpayers&#146; money to people to do a job for the council. That covers not only private organisations, but voluntary organisations and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, it applies to contractors, who are being paid by contract.</p>

<a name="70717-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07071796000046"></a>The whole of this part of the Bill is designed to increase the authority and power of overview and scrutiny, which until now has been a toothless tiger&#151;no one much enjoys it and it has not had a hugely influential role. That is beginning to change. Interestingly, a short time ago three overview and scrutiny committees in my area looked at a plan for bringing two hospitals together, of one of which I am chairman. The three scrutiny committees worked together. It was a very effective inquiry into the proposals, which produced an effective and important report. There is beginning to be more of a role; clearly, where council money is concerned, overview and scrutiny ought to be able to extend its role, which is very important.</p>

<a name="70717-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07071796000047"></a>There are endless areas&#151;IT systems, care of the elderly in old people&#146;s homes, contractors providing food and voluntary organisations providing services for bathing and, in many cases, now running old people&#146;s affairs. It is crucial that the overview and scrutiny committee should have a role and be able to be part of a rigorous process that enables it to get information. It is not satisfactory to say that a written  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_194"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>report will be made and that someone will not need to appear. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, that would be useless. You need to be able to ask people questions, to see the colour of their eyes and how they respond to the question. It is over-protection of people in that position that they should not be required to appear and give information as put forward. Some might be limited, but it should be there.</p>

<a name="70717-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07071796000048"></a>For those reasons and because local area agreement targets will need to be scrutinised&#151;some of those targets will be with people receiving public money&#151;I think that the two amendments are extremely important. I therefore support them.</p>

<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="07071796000049"></a><b><a name="70717-0010.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07071796000081"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I entirely agree that the amendments are important and I appreciate the spirit in which they are brought forward. Obviously, we want to ensure that overview and scrutiny committees are able to hold public service providers to account. Unfortunately, we do not think that the amendments are necessary for that. I will try not to duplicate what was said in the Commons Committee, but it is difficult, because the arguments offered there were sound. I will try to find different language.</p>

<a name="70717-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07071796000050"></a>However, I took the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about how overview and scrutiny committees could be seen as rather toothless. Part of the Bill&#146;s purpose is to build on the Local Government Act 2000, as we have, to make three changes that will toughen up the overview and scrutiny committees and give them more power. Of those three ways, one essentially requires local authorities&#151;executive members and members&#151;to respond when called to a committee; they are required to attend and to respond to what the overview and scrutiny committee says. What have now come into the frame are the partner authorities; in the Bill is a requirement that information should be provided from partner authorities connected to the local area agreements and that they should sit together. There is also the duty to have regard to the report and recommendations of the overview and scrutiny committee. Those are three important changes that toughen up the O&amp;S committees.</p>

<a name="70717-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07071796000051"></a>The point about contractors is, however, important. As the noble Baroness said, a lot of work is now done through commissioning. Our principle, which is why we cannot accept the amendment, is the importance of those who are commissioning&#151;the local authorities and public service providers&#151;actually being responsible for the quality and delivery of the work that they commission. Once you start asking contractors to turn up and account for themselves, you have let the contracting body off the hook. It is terribly important, given the pattern of commissioning, that you get the responsible people to come and explain why they actually contracted those people, if it turns out that they have not got the capacity to deliver or whatever. Sometimes it is no good asking the IT provider to come. You want to know who made the decision, on what grounds and on what evidence. We might find ourselves in a position where we are allowing partner authorities to shift responsibility.</p>

<a name="70717-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07071796000052"></a>It is perfectly open to the overview and scrutiny committees to request anyone to appear before them.  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_195"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 195</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>If they feel that they have not got to the bottom of something in this situation, then they can call the contractor to come. It is a slightly different context, but there is nothing to stop them doing that. Furthermore, when local authorities contract, they have to specify in the contract those arrangements that would enable them to obtain information from the contractor, so that they in turn are able to respond to a request from an overview and scrutiny committee for information. A means for councillors to obtain information from contractors exists. We have provision for making information available. On those grounds, I have difficulty with Amendment No. 215.</p>

<a name="70717-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07071796000053"></a>Amendments Nos. 216 and 217 concern the requirements on partner authorities to respond to an overview and scrutiny committee. In response to Amendment No. 216, about partner authorities being required to attend to provide information, we think that the regulation-making powers under Clause 123 are sufficiently wide enough and that they address the question of attendance. We intend to provide in the planned regulations for partners to appear before scrutiny committees. However, I think it wrong to impose a blanket requirement on partners to attend in person. I take the point that on some days you have to look a person in the face in order to test out resolve, commitment and so on, but I do not think that where councillors are working in partnership with public service providers it is all that helpful to allow overview and scrutiny committees to compel attendance. In some instances they are statutory bodies in their own right. We do not want to destabilise or undermine relations. We think it right to provide discretion about whether there is oral evidence or a written submission. My impression is that if the written evidence is not sufficient, they could always call for oral evidence afterwards. I should have thought that that option remained open to them, but it may be appropriate in some circumstances simply to have written submissions. That would certainly reduce the work of the committee.</p>

<a name="70717-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07071796000054"></a>Amendment No. 217 requires partner authorities to have regard to any overview and scrutiny report. As I have explained, overview and scrutiny committees have the power to make reports to their executive on any matter that affects their area&#151;quite rightly. We all probably agree that where the councils have formal partnership arrangements with local partners, it is right that councillors should be able to send reports to those local partners to which they must have regard. The Bill requires that where councils and local public service providers work together on LAAs, local partners will be required to have regard to reports relating to the LAA targets. That is the focus and what they would want to be chasing up and ensuring that they are getting delivery on. It would not be appropriate to allow councillors to require partner authorities to have regard to wider reports on any matter relating to their areas. That strikes me as certainly losing focus. I could imagine, for example, that a council might do a report on global warming&#151;that would be forward-looking in some respects&#151;but requiring partners to respond to that report would be taking it beyond their scope and taking up time that they might be rather short of.</p>

It is much better to be able to say to a contractor, &#147;There are assertions that you have not done so and so; now tell us about it&#148;, rather than having a debate with the commissioner that brings into play allegations about the contractor&#146;s services. We should perhaps follow up that point, which is important in terms of how these things might function. Essentially, in the other comments by the Minister, I would characterise her as saying, &#147;It is not necessary&#148;; and I am saying, &#147;Better to have a stick and not to use it than to assume that the stick will never be necessary&#148;.</p>

However, we have a slightly different view on how these things may work. We will see. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70717-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07071798000008"></a>This is all tied up with the role of backbenchers, why people become councillors and the undoubted feeling in local government that the role of ordinary councillors has been downgraded since the introduction of new arrangements in the 2000 Act. We can talk about whether that is justified and what can be done about it, but there is a widespread feeling in local government that ordinary councillors do not have the status and the ability to influence things that they used to have; the existence of that feeling is a fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="07071798000009"></a>A very interesting report was produced recently which unfortunately came a bit late to inform the discussions on the Bill. It is <I>The </I><I>R</I><I>ole of </I><I>C</I><I>ouncillors: </I><I>R</I><I>eport of an </I><I>I</I><I>nquiry</I> by the All-Party Parliamentary Local Government Group. I will briefly refer to that report, because it confirms what I have been saying. On page 9, one of the witnesses, Councillor Katrina Bull from Nottingham&#151;who I do not know at all&#151;says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="07071798000041"></a>&#147;I would think backbenchers feel they are not part of the decision-making process any more ... the perception is that they are excluded from lots of decisions because of the new structures&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071798000035"></a>Professor Steve Leach says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="07071798000042"></a>&#147;Overview and scrutiny, which was the main element of the Act which involves ward councillors, has struggled to establish a high profile among local councillors&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071798000036"></a>Councillor Maggie Foot from South Somerset Council&#151;who I do know&#151;says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="07071798000043"></a>&#147;Scrutiny is becoming much more issue-led&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071798000037"></a>She is from a council that is making a real effort for overview and scrutiny to be successful.</p>

<a name="70717-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07071798000010"></a>Two elements are identified in the report: first, holding the executive to account and, secondly, investigations and policy development. It is interesting that, more and more, councils are finding that the investigations and policy development side is productive and helpful and provides a useful role for backbench councillors. Simply holding the executive to account and doing investigations some three, six or nine months after things have happened have turned out, in many cases, to be fairly arid.</p>

<a name="70717-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07071798000011"></a>The question that comes to the fore here and which is crucial to the amendments is: why do councillors get elected in the first place? Why do people stand for the council? Some might stand because they see leading councillors as role models in the community and they would like to be one of those people in due course, or even immediately. We have all come across such people. I do not think, on the whole, that councillors get on to a council because they want to take part in overview and scrutiny, even if they have heard of it before they get elected. It is well understood that most people, when first elected, want to represent their ward. They also want to take part in decision-making about things that affect their ward. Most new councillors do not expect to take part in the broad strategic decisions or the major decisions that the council makes, but they expect to be able to have a direct influence on what happens on their patch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07071798000012"></a>Page 14 of the interesting report from the All-Party Parliamentary Local Government Group sets out a table of 12 roles for councillors. I will not read them all out, but they are interesting. They range from managing relationships within a political group, to attending whole council meetings, to advocating on behalf of their ward, to taking part in overview and scrutiny, and so on. What is missing from that list is the idea that councillors want to be part and parcel of the decision-making process about the things that happen in their ward, in the slightly wider community, in the town or rural area or in their part of the city. Ultimately, they may become leading councillors and take part in strategic decisions. What is fundamentally missing in the new arrangements is the sense that people are able to take part in the decisions that affect their patch. That is at the heart of it, and that is where we need to get to.</p>

<a name="70717-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07071798000013"></a>What do the proposals do? A community call for action re-enacts Section 21(8) of the 2000 Act, which enables members of overview and scrutiny committees and members of sub-committees of those committees to put items on the agenda. That is no big thing. Proposed new Section 21A(1)(c),</p>
<ul><a name="07071798000044"></a>&#147;enables any member of the authority to refer to an overview and scrutiny committee of the authority of which he is not a member any local government matter which is relevant to the functions of the committee&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071798000038"></a>I am astonished that there are councils that do not allow that anyway. I know there are councils that do not allow it, and giving people that right is a very small advance. But it is something that councillors ought to be able to do without legislation. It is a minor step forward&#151;it is a bag of beans. In councils that are run so autocratically they do not allow that kind of thing, it will be a step forward. But as a community call for action, it is incredibly weak. These amendments attempt to firm it up a bit. Amendment No. 215ZA seeks to take out the words stating that it can only be a local government matter, and Amendment No. 215ZE to take out subsection (10), which defines a &#147;local government matter&#148; as a matter which,</p>
<ul><a name="07071798000045"></a>&#147;relates to the discharge of any function of the authority&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="07071798000039"></a>or which,</p>
<ul><a name="07071798000046"></a>&#147;affects all or part of the electoral area for which the member is elected or any person who lives or works in that area&#148;.</ul><a name="time_26"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07071798000014"></a>When people vote for a councillor, they do not expect that that councillor&#146;s ability to raise issues will be limited to the things that their authority can do. That is particularly so in two-tier areas. If there is a local health issue&#151;perhaps a controversy about building a new local health centre or closing one down&#151;everyone will expect the councillor to be able to take part. Under this legislation, overview and scrutiny committees will have a wider remit than they have now&#151;which would be welcome&#151;so why on Earth can a councillor not raise that as well as something that is the direct responsibility of the authority? Ideally they ought to be able to raise anything. If the overview and scrutiny committee then says that it is not going to do it because it has no power over the trains or whatever, then so be it. But it

It ought to be allowed particularly within the wider new powers of overview and scrutiny committees generally.</p>

<a name="70717-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07071798000015"></a>Amendment No. 215ZB refers to proposed new Section 21A(3), which says that the member has to have regard to guidance from the Secretary of State before they put forward an application. As my noble friend said on the previous group of amendments, &#147;having regard to&#148; is a weak form of words, and perhaps it is. But when it says, &#147;Have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State&#148;, and it is statutory guidance, people will have to obey it whether they like it or not. That means that the Secretary of State can give instructions without having to get orders through Parliament. That a member should have to have regard to guidance from the Secretary of State is ridiculous. The ordinary ward member ought to be able to put forward what they want. If the authority then has to have regard to guidance, fair enough. At the very least, any guidance ought to be locally determined. So that clause ought to be taken out&#151;it is a step too far where detailed national guidance is concerned.</p>

<a name="70717-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07071798000016"></a>The final point relates to Amendment No. 215ZE, which would remove proposed new Section 21A(10)&#151;which restricts &#147;local government matter&#148; not to the function of the authority but to all or part of the electoral area, or any person who lives or works in that area. Who on Earth, apart from councillors and other such people, knows where ward boundaries are? Sometimes they are obvious, but very often towns are divided in a completely arbitrary way between wards and nobody apart from the people who represent those wards knows where the wards are. If you get elected as a councillor in a town like Wilmslow in Cheshire which might be divided into four or five wards for the district, you ought to be able to raise any issue that affects that town. But councillors do not represent just their ward; they represent their town, their wider community, the whole council area and their political party if they have one and their own views. This is the balance&#151;the synthesis&#151;that all councillors have to sort out to their own satisfaction. If there is a call to action and an ability to take it to an overview and scrutiny committee, it ought to be open to a councillor to take on any issue, not just one linked to their own ward. Otherwise it is very narrow, very restricted and, I&#146;m sorry to say, not very sexy at all. I beg to move.</p>

I have a lot of sympathy with the points he raised about why people stand for the council and what it is that makes them want to represent an area and offer public service. What we have done here is to find ways of strengthening the role of the ward councillor by giving greater visibility, raising profiles and making clearer the expectations that constituents should have of ward councillors. The noble Lord is right to say that many local councils undertake a version of this as a matter of course, but he is also right to say that not all do.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_200"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70717-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07071798000018"></a>We have tried in the Bill to flag up that it should be the expectation of local electors that their council is there to raise issues that concern them and that can be acted on in ways that are above and beyond the normal processes of the council. I think we are right to express that in terms of the citizen&#146;s right to be able to make a community call for action. So although I think that there is much we agree on, I am sorry that we do not agree on the significance of this. It is a mechanism that allows local councils to escalate issues of concern to their local community by referring them to the O&amp;S committee. It is certainly for the committee to decide whether and how to proceed, but once an issue is raised, it must put it on the agenda and address it. If the committee chooses not to pursue the matter, then it must let the member know the reason, which is a new and very important power to pass on to the constituent. If it does take a matter up&#151;and it has a lot of flexibility in how it does so&#151;it has to let the member know what recommendations it ultimately makes.</p>

<a name="70717-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07071798000019"></a>We have seen in the development of O&amp;S committees over the past few years how some are turning into policy and development committees. It is often the case that an issue raised by a constituent can reflect either the failure or success of a policy, and how it might be developed. So what we are looking at is also a way of O&amp;S committees becoming more proactive and growing. The clause also provides for excluded matters, which I want to address now.</p>

<a name="70717-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07071798000020"></a>Amendment No. 215ZA, taken with Amendment No. 215ZE, would change the effect of the clause by enabling any member of a local authority to refer any matter. This switches the focus away from the community call for action. The noble Lord himself said that if they were to raise a matter of improving a railway, for example, they would know that they could not do anything about it. To raise matters over which the council has no control not only diminishes the purpose of the community call for action, but also reduces the credibility of the councillor as well.</p>

<a name="70717-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07071798000021"></a>Secondly, I detect a contradiction in what the noble Lord said. He was extremely focused on the ward councillor, and the first function of the councillor is to represent the ward and how things affect people in the ward. He is right to do that, and to speak of the direct influence of the people in the ward. But Amendments Nos. 215ZA and 215ZE together would mean that this measure would empower the elected member to go beyond the ward. Our intention is that the elected member is able to force a committee to address an issue of concern to the community in the area that he was elected to represent. That is what gives him his locus and his credibility&#151;if and only if those concerns are about the way the council is doing its job in that area. Yes, ward boundaries are arbitrary and often people do not know where they fall. That area-based responsibility is important. The two amendments open the door very wide to people who are not as scrupulous as the noble Lord. This could become an opportunity to trespass across boundaries and issues in ways that would not be helpful to local people.</p>

Some time ago&#151;this is an historical example&#151;in my ward there were a whole lot of houses on a railway line, and the assertion was that the railway was affecting the houses and that they should be double glazed. Double-glazing those houses was the responsibility not of the council but of the railway authority. The council took up that matter as a result of pressure from local residents. It was not strictly a council matter&#151;it was a matter for the railway. The only way in which any action could be taken was by the local ward councillor and the council putting forward the case. I do not see why a local councillor should not be able to take such a case to the overview and scrutiny committee as that is probably now the only way of getting the matter discussed. In the event, that matter was taken to a committee, which discussed it and the decision was that action should be taken to get British Rail to do something about it. You could not do that now because there is no committee to take it to; the only committee that you could take it to is the overview and scrutiny committee. If the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is not agreed to, that would mean that you could not raise such a matter&#151;that is, a matter for another public authority, not the council, but on which the council needs to effect some sort of amelioration.</p>

I was thinking of the example of double-glazing to deal with aircraft noise, which raises the same sort of issues. I wonder whether the Minister can answer the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, in the context of the leadership role that local authorities are being urged to take as part of place-shaping and all that. Noble Lords have referred to local authorities acting as community leaders, which is a good thing; those points fit in exactly with that. To deny it frustrates the community leadership role.</p>

In this instance, the local authority would have been acting under its responsibility to deal with nuisance&#151;with noise&#151;rather than with the railway per se. That is my understanding but I would be very happy to take the case away. Local authority powers and responsibilities are wide and there are ways to deal with the issue. That may be different from the case that the noble Lord raised about the powers; perhaps not. We will disagree on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="07071798000025"></a>One of the problems with the amendment is that removing the definition of &#147;local government matter&#148; from the clause also removes the specific focus of the community call for action. Incidentally, it also sweeps away the provision for excluded matters. We will discuss that later; it is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07071798000026"></a>The noble Lord is not impressed when I say that the amendments are technically defective so I shall not go into detail on that. Whether they are politically defective he is happy to debate with me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07071798000027"></a>Finally, I turn to the issue of guidance. On Amendment No. 215ZB, we are only trying to help. This is not a heavy-handed intervention. We offered to issue guidance

Material from central government may be helpful or a councillor may discard it. I understand that the Government may feel that it would be useful to suggest how the power might be used, and the clause is about the &#147;what&#148; of the power and the content. Those are two very different things. I come back to the first question, which involved whether non-statutory guidance should do the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07071798000030"></a>I deliberately did not give lots of local examples. One of the big issues in the past year in Colne, where I live, has been the fire service: the proposal was to reduce the number of pumps from two to one. The local council was prominent in the campaigns to stop that; the Lancashire fire authority is a separate body. That is a proper function of a district council in such circumstances. I could bring to the Minister&#146;s attention dozens of cases that are similar to the case raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham; that is what local councils do. They are the only body that has the legitimacy of being directly elected and they therefore take on anything to do with their community. The fire station in Colne happens to be in my ward&#151;just&#151;but there are three other wards in Colne. Could my two ward colleagues in Pendle have raised the matter if I had not thought it was important, although others in other wards could not? That would be ludicrous. The fire service covers more than just the town. There is an issue here which I hope the Minister will think about seriously. If the new power is to be used effectively, it must be widened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07071798000031"></a>A brief point occurred to me during our debate. If, as a member of the public, I want my councillor to raise an issue but I have only one councillor or they are in the wrong party and for some reason will not raise it, why can I not go to another councillor in the town or the area and ask them to? It is a bit like the situation with the ombudsman; you used to have to go through a councillor if you wanted to take your council to the ombudsman. That was changed because a few people found that their councillor was being obstructive and refused to refer it. I used to take the view that you referred it on principle, whether or not you agreed with it. There is a practical problem there.</p>

They are linked not to what the district or county council does but to the problems that people have in that neighbourhood. The problems often affect a series of different agencies. My concern about the scope being drawn too tightly&#151;this is also my concern about statutory guidance&#151;is that in some councils lawyers, officials or those running the council will try to keep the matter as restricted as possible. They will use legislation and government guidance to stop people doing things rather than encourage them to do things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07071798000033"></a>In many ways there are two types of councillor: those who want to encourage the public in and encourage that kind of activity, and those who want to say, &#147;No, you are out of order and cannot do it&#148;.

I hope that the Minister will consider some of the issues that have been raised, if not my drafting. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="070717106000002"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 215ZC and 215ZD. It is helpful to have time to read parts of the Bill and to hear explanations on them. As we have debated today, I have realised the error of my ways in tabling Amendment No. 215ZAA. I shall not speak to it, as I now understand the clause.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="070717106000003"></a>Amendment No. 215ZC provides that an O&amp;S committee or sub-committee can ask for information from members of the public. Here we are dealing with the so-called community call for action: the opportunity for a ward councillor to bring the matter to an O&amp;S committee. It took me some time to find this clause in the Bill; I knew there was to be a clause that allowed the public this extra right but there is no mention of the public in the clause and I thought there should be one. An overview and scrutiny committee inquiring into an issue will want to hear from the people who are affected by it and possibly the people who brought the matter to the ward councillor. However, others might feel that the ward councillor is making a case that it applies to only one or two people, but there is a wider and different interest which needs to be aired. I speak to that amendment with some feeling.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="070717106000004"></a>Amendment No. 215ZD adds to the provision that if a committee decides not to exercise the powers that we have heard about, it has to tell the member that it will not do so and give the reason. I am saying that it should publish its decision and its reasons. Local authorities are used to publishing things; that is the way in which the system works. Notices of what will happen are published and records of what has happened are published. This amendment should fit in with that. I beg to move the amendment and I do not expect an answer from the Minister.</p>

I see nothing wrong with the way in which the draftsman framed the provision in the first place. The noble Baroness could be forgiven for saying that she had to search for the clause in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="070717106000006"></a>Amendment No. 215ZC inserts a new subsection purporting to empower O&amp;S committees to ask for information from members of the public. It does not go so far as to say that they may require it, which I believe is right. This power already exists in Section 21(13) of the Local Government Act 2000. It already provides that an O&amp;S committee may invite any person to attend meetings of the committee. I think that takes care of that point.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="070717106000007"></a>Amendment No. 215ZD would require O&amp;S committees to publish their reasons when they decide not to act on a reference from a councillor. I have to go back further because Section 21(11) of the 2000 Act provides for Part VA of the 1972 Act&#151;access to meetings and documents&#151;to apply to overview and scrutiny committees. As the noble Baroness said, local authorities are very used to publishing things and that means that the public should have access to the committee meetings, to the documents of the committee and to the decisions that are recorded. In effect, that will be the publication that she seeks. There may be some circumstances&#151;for example, where confidential information is discussed&#151;where access is withheld or restricted, but I believe that the provision she seeks exists already.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="070717106000008"></a>The difficulty experienced by Members of the Committee in tracking through the legislation suggests to me a rather strong case for guidance to ensure that people understand where the rights are and where publication is available.</p>

I am also mindful of the amendment that I supported previously and which was tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, to make that even stronger.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="070717106000016"></a>However, some issues prevent this welcome power and we think they should be removed from the Bill. Amendments Nos. 215A, 215B, 215C, 215D and 224A seek to ensure that the community call for action covers all local issues that include crime and disorder matters and to ensure that the Secretary of State cannot use his discretion to exclude matters from the community call-for-action process. It is with some frustration that we think that the Government have not listened entirely to what has been said about this and that there is a widespread consensus, shared by the Local Government Association and people such as the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, that there should be just one community call-for-action process.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="070717106000017"></a>I cannot grasp why a councillor is able to refer a matter affecting their area to scrutiny by the council but cannot do so if it relates to a crime and disorder matter. There are problems here because of things such as ASBOs, which one should be able to raise. A councillor may have in his area a council estate where ASBOs are being issued. When there is a criminal aspect to a matter, it is of relevance. We cannot see how having two separate community call-for-action procedures&#151;the one set out in this Bill and the one covered by the Police and Justice Act&#151;will in reality operate. It will cause confusion for local people and councillors.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="070717106000018"></a>The Local Government Association has highlighted some important points that make it essential that these amendments and clauses are added to this Bill. The community call-for-action process has far clearer benefits in this Bill than that in the Police and Justice Act provisions. The additional powers given to ward councillors make certain that less council time is taken up by frivolous and vexatious complaints. That contrasts with the Police and Justice Act, where a member of the public, regardless of the council&#146;s refusal to send the matter to the overview and scrutiny committee, is still able to appeal to the executive. For those reasons, these amendments should be accepted. I beg to move.</p>

I am of course no longer chairman of the Local Government Association, but I can say how strongly the LGA feels about this issue. As a member of a local authority, I know that some individual issues that come forward, such as education appeals or planning, are not dealt with by scrutiny, but that issues coming forward from the community, such as crime, social disorder and simply the fear of crime, are often so limiting to people&#146;s lives.

Noble Lords will know that, for crime and disorder, any person who lives or works in an area can initiate the process simply by asking the councillor representing it to consider a crime and disorder matter. The councillor is then under a statutory duty to respond, indicating what action he proposes to take. The councillor has a power to refer it to the crime and disorder committee. He can do so even if no one else has asked him to consider it. If he declines to refer it, the person can, in a local authority operating executive arrangements, refer the matter to the executive of the authority, placing them under a similar duty.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="070717106000021"></a>The provisions of this Bill cover local government matters other than crime and disorder. They are simpler. The only person empowered to initiate the process is the councillor himself. No duties are placed on him. A little background: in the Local Government White Paper Implementation Plan, we undertook to work closely with the Home Office to ensure that our provisions, and those set out in the Police and Justice Act 2006, formed a coherent package, and bring them both into force on 1 April 2008.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="070717106000022"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that the Home Secretary has asked Sir Ronnie Flanagan to carry out a review of the Police Service, and to make recommendations around the end of this year. Part of his brief is to consider how to ensure that the public are driving local policing priorities and how to improve local involvement and accountability. I understand that the Home Office has recently indicated the need to reconsider the implementation date for community calls for action in the light of the review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="070717106000023"></a>Amendments Nos. 215A to 215D, taken with Amendment No. 224A, would have the effect of bringing the treatment of community calls for action on crime and disorder matters within this Bill, taking them out of the Police and Justice Act and aligning their treatment. The Police and Justice Act received Royal Assent only on 8 November last year. The provisions have not come into force yet. Parliament very recently decided that it wanted crime and disorder matters dealt with in this way.</p>

I believe that the Minister is saying that these can be referred to the crime and disorder committees. Members of local authorities, in referring these to the local authorities themselves, see that the crime and disorder issues are intrinsically linked to youth, education, social care, family and children&#146;s service issues. They must therefore be able to be taken by the local members to the local authorities themselves.</p>

There is an inextricable relationship with social and economic affairs. But in the Police and Justice Act, it was decided that community safety issues were different and that it was a more reasonable expectation. People are so exercised about personal safety. They are exercised about their family&#146;s safety, and the safety of their community and neighbourhood, so it required a more  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_207"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>stringent process in place to ensure that it could be treated differently, with additional powers for the councillor. That is what the 2006 Act provided, and why the distinction was made.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="070717106000026"></a>That is the case we have made, expressed in Act, for why there is a distinction in how councillors will respond. On the other hand, we also had to consider whether we should go in the other direction, placing an equivalent duty on councillors and council executives for any and every &#147;local government matter&#148;. But surely it would be insupportable for a local councillor to have to respond to everything that came from any direction. Most councillors are wonderful part-time workers, but to extend the duty to cover virtually all their work would impose an impossible burden. We have achieved a balance between those two situations in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="070717106000027"></a>There is a third, unintended, consequence of the amendment. Section 19(4) of the Police and Justice Act provides that the community call for action should not apply to county councils for areas where there are district councils. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will appreciate that that was included to ensure that the measure has the local focus which was intended for it, and to prevent confusion between the scrutiny role of police authorities and county councils&#146; scrutiny committees. If these amendments were carried, that distinction would be lost.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="070717106000028"></a>Amendments Nos. 215A to 215D go further than that, to bring the treatment of crime and disorder matters within the scope of this Bill. They seek to deprive the Secretary of State of the power we propose for her to make an order defining other descriptions of excluded matters. We said in the Local Government White Paper that there must be circumstances in which the community call for action should not be available for all; this goes back to the 2000 Act. There are already statutory appeals processes&#151;for example, on planning, licensing, council tax, non-domestic rates, the quasi-judicial functions and so on. In consultation with the Local Government Association and others, we will work at the detail of these exclusions, which is consistent with the present powers.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="070717106000029"></a>I understand the point that the noble Baroness has made. Her argument is being heard loud and clear by the Government. We do not feel that we can move on that, for reasons explicit in the Police and Justice Act about the importance of community safety. Again, the amendment has unintended consequences. We will have to ensure that measures to put community calls for action in place are implemented in a coherent way so that councillors, the police and the public can understand them. I assure the Committee that we will be doing that.</p>

We are here inviting the public to think that there is an entity called a community call for action. Why would they think that it would go either to one committee or another way? There is a real potential for confusion over this. The fact that the council is involved makes the whole thing much more confusing.</p>

I should have looked up whether those debates took place, but I did not.

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="070717106000037"></a>I find it thrilling to be here discussing councillors and what they do. Thirty years ago, I got a job as, effectively, the local government officer of the Liberal Party in our redoubt in Hebden Bridge in the Pennines. I spent a lot of time advising councillors on what they could do, how to do it, how to get things done and how to find their way through the particular system and culture that existed in their council. It is important that councillors are able to do that, but there is vast variation in the cultures of councils and the ways that they work, so I have tabled these amendments.</p>

In some ways, I had to pinch myself when I tabled this amendment because I asked myself which councils would not allow that. In the local government culture that I come from, councillors have always been able to attend any meeting of any committee, whether they are on it or not, and often take part in it in an informal way by asking permission or sometimes under the written or standing orders. That has been the case at county and district level. I regard it as something that

<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="070717106000039"></a>I tabled Amendment No. 215DB knowing that there are some councils where some of the powers that be&#151;senior staff and councillors&#151;will do anything they can to restrict the ability of back-benchers to take part or to be influential. There are councils with a very centralist culture, which I would call a very Stalinist culture, although I am not saying they are necessarily left-wing or right-wing as it applies across the board. The purpose of this amendment is to set out that those things that already happen in councils should not be restricted by this new right. It should not be regarded as being the maximum right of councillors, but the minimum floor. For example, there are many councils where a councillor already has a right to refer a matter to a decision-making or other body of the authority, whether that is a committee, the executive or a member of the executive or cabinet taking a decision that has been referred to it under the new arrangements. There are many councils where councillors can make representations to such decision-making bodies in person in public, and there are many councils where anybody&#151;never mind a councillor, any member of the public&#151;can turn up to a committee and can have their three or five minutes&#146; worth&#151;whatever it is in the standing orders&#151;on an item on the agenda before the decision is made. I sit on a council where hundreds of people do that every year. We regard it as normal. Twenty years ago, it was thought to be revolutionary, but now it is happening in more and more councils around the country. It leads to better decision-making, and it certainly leads to people believing that decisions have been made after taking account of what they said. That should continue and should be expanded in councils that do not do it.</p>

<a name="70717-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="070717106000040"></a>The danger of putting this in the legislation is that councils will think that it is how they have to do it and that they must go this far, but no further. I do not expect the Minister to think that this rather long amendment ought to be put in the already long Bill, but I hope that when the Government are giving statutory guidance on the various clauses about the community call to action they will give councils very strong advice that what is proposed is a minimum, a floor; that it should not under any circumstances be regarded as a maximum right for the public or councillors; that it should not affect existing rights for members of the public or councillors; and that they should go beyond it. That is the spirit of this amendment. I hope I shall get a generous response and look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="070717106000042"></a>I have a lot of sympathy for what he said. Amendment No. 215DA relates to the right of a member raising a matter to address in person the committee to which he referred it. However, we must retain the discretion of local committees to decide how and when they want to hear evidence from the people they call. New Section 21A(6)(b) already empowers, but does not require, a committee to have regard to representations made by the member. We have to oppose an interpretation that requires a committee to give a personal hearing to any member who raises any issue, however frivolous. Although I understand the sentiment entirely, this has to be a matter for the judgment of the committee. Some very serious issues would be raised if we were to accept the amendment and require committees to behave in that way. They are so experienced and know what they want to get out of evidence and out of people appearing before them. It would be counterproductive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="070717106000043"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 215DB&#151;</p>

Will it rely entirely on that member writing a request for the committee to consider? Why would members not have a right, or why would the committee not want to hear that member&#146;s representations? I do not understand why this should not be a member&#146;s right.</p>

He may feel more comfortable raising an issue in writing or being able to set out a complex case in writing and maybe following it up with a personal appearance. It is difficult to legislate for that. How to approach it is best left to the discretion of the member and the committee.</p>

<a name="70717-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="070717106000046"></a>The second point is that Amendment No. 215DB seeks to ensure that the existence of the community call for action is not taken as preventing local authorities engaging their communities in other ways. I could not agree more with everything the noble Lord said. It is a minimum, a new step, and it will certainly not sweep away both current best practice and future best practice. I have absolutely no doubt that the sort of example the noble Lord gave might be unique in some respects, but councils up and down the country are very proactive about engaging people in innovative ways and going beyond the usual suspects. That is admirable. It is reinforced in different parts of the Bill; for example, the new duty to inform, consult and involve, that we are putting on best-value authorities, takes that argument further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="070717106000047"></a>Although I agree with much of what the noble Lord said, he was quite right to predict that I could not accept the amendment.</p>

She did not respond specifically to my request that the Government should seriously think about giving guidance that this is not a minimum, particularly giving guidance that authorities should seriously think about going beyond it. I shall leave that thought with her for the moment and hope that she will ponder carefully on it.

The more people who engage in it, the more they will realise that it is good local government.

The amendments have the support of London Councils and are put forward on its behalf. London Councils is the body which represents all 33 London authorities.</p>

<a name="70717-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="070717106000056"></a>The Bill currently allows local authorities the power to require information from partner authorities. We have just been discussing that. Those partner authorities have a duty to respond to reports by the overview and scrutiny committees. Registered social landlords deliver public services and receive considerable funding from central Government in the form of capital subsidy to build new homes and revenue subsidy for rental charges through the housing benefit subsidy system. Hence overview and scrutiny committees should have the power to require information from RSLs operating in their local authority area, who should be required to respond to reports by the overview and scrutiny committees.</p>

<a name="70717-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="070717106000057"></a>In the recent consultation paper issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government, <I>Delivering Housing and Regeneration: Communities England and the future of social housing regulation</I><I>,</I> the Government stated that they propose to take forward the recommendation of the Cave review that all social housing providers,</p>
<ul><a name="070717106000094"></a>&#147;should have a statutory duty to engage constructively with the place-shaping role of local authorities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070717106000087"></a>My amendments meet the Government&#146;s commitment to ensure that registered social landlords are engaging with the local authorities and they seek to put this on a statutory footing.</p>

<a name="70717-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="070717106000058"></a>Many elected members of the 33 London councils have expressed their concern about RSL management. Lack of responsibility is particularly evident in areas where registered social landlords have a small number of properties in a given area. London Councils has identified that of the 390 registered social landlords operating in London, 85 per cent operate schemes of 50 or fewer units within certain boroughs. That has led to inconsistency of service provision and management standards across social housing and left local authorities  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_212"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and tenants without appropriate influence over registered social landlords and a lack of accountability to their residents.</p>

<a name="70717-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="070717106000059"></a>There is sometimes&#151;not generally, but sometimes&#151;a lack of transparency in the performance of registered social landlords locally. They are not required to disaggregate performance information locally, which makes it much more difficult to engage them in delivering local objectives. The Bill provides an important opportunity to ensure that social housing providers are brought in to work with local authorities and to be recognised as bodies which should be considered. I moved an amendment&#151;was it yesterday or was it a few days ago?&#151;raising that as an issue.</p>

<a name="70717-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="070717106000060"></a>I should be grateful if the Government would support the positive move proposed in the amendments. I beg to move.</p>

In doing so, perhaps I may say that when we discussed the previous group of amendments the Minister was very kind about the things that I have tried to do in my life. Only a few of us are here across the parties, but we have people with immense experience of different sorts. I hope that the Government understand that and recognise that we are trying to improve things&#151;certainly in this part&#151;and are not opposing the Bill out of hand.</p>

<a name="70717-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="070717106000062"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, is certainly one of the people with that experience. She spoke about small registered social landlords. I agree with her that that sometimes causes a problem, especially if it is in a part of the country where they do not have many properties and they are mainly based somewhere else. That can cause a difficulty. I want to speak in support of social landlords who exist after a large-scale stock transfer has taken place in an authority. They are not small players in the area but a very important part of the local scene. They are running what used to be, and what people still call, council estates.</p>

<a name="70717-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="070717106000063"></a>In some cases, they are running the whole of the previous council stock; in other cases, in bigger authorities, it may be just part of it. In either case, they are running what people think of as council estates and, regardless of that, are important providers of rented housing and social housing in the area. In those circumstances, it is very easy to get into an uneasy relationship between elected councillors&#151;the ward representation side of local councillors&#151;on the one hand and registered social landlords on the other. If there has been a stock transfer, typically, the council will have representation on the board of the housing association. So at a strategic level, at the level of looking at investment patterns in the authority and overall housing and allocation policies, the authority is well represented. But from the point of view of the ward councillor, it is very easy for the new landlords, the new housing association, to say, &#147;It is nothing to do with you any more&#148;, and have a slightly offhand approach.</p>

<a name="70717-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="070717106000064"></a>The proposal of the noble Baroness would go a long way to assist in that and create some accountability. At the moment, from what I am told by my colleagues  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_213"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in other areas around the country&#151;I am not speaking about Pendle here where the relationship at the moment is very good&#151;there are problems. I support the amendment, which I think would go a long way to solve the problem.</p>

Social housing providers are not the same as registered social landlords. Although I am very sympathetic to the amendment&#151;it sounds to me like good practice for registered social landlords to behave as they are expected to and to provide information to their partner local authorities, as suggested by the amendment&#151;unfortunately, they are not the only organisations empowered to provide social housing. Social housing grant is now available and will increasingly be given to private developers and house builders. This is despite my efforts to the contrary. But if you were to include all those providing social housing as being required to provide information to local authorities, you would be stretching this to include a large number of private sector organisations now moving into this field. That hazard is inherent in considering this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="070717106000066"></a><b><a name="70717-0013.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="070717106000115"></a>Lord Bruce-Lockhart:</b> I am also happy to support the amendment. Social housing issues are, as we all know, immensely important and a great deal of public money is directly involved in registered social landlords. The point about consistency in providing information, as raised by my noble friend Lady Hanham, is important. Information helps to drive up quality, it adds accountability and I hope that in the long run it will also add choice. What we need to see in the housing sector is wider choice. Information helps to provide quality, accountability and choice.</p>

<a name="070717106000067"></a><b><a name="70717-0013.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="070717106000116"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> Noble Lords have spoken with great experience and wisdom on this subject. I wish it were possible for me to give the noble Baroness anything other than the sort of response I gave her yesterday. It was yesterday, I think&#151;it is hard to imagine what else we have done over the past week except this Bill. Noble Lords have spoken about the importance of social housing, the RSLs themselves and the other provision now coming in from the private sector. The problem is that we cannot deal with that so long as we are dealing with bodies that are not part of the public sector. The amendments would apply to RSLs the same powers that the overview and scrutiny committees have in respect of their public sector partner bodies. They would add them to the list of partners in all but name. However, RSLs are private, not-for-profit organisations and they use largely privately raised capital. They are regulated by the Housing Corporation but they are not part of the public sector. It is this legal problem which confounds us here and makes it difficult for us to treat them as if they were.</p>

<a name="70717-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="070717106000068"></a>However, I can give noble Lords some encouragement. It may be that we have another tool which can deal with some of the problems that have been raised. I refer to the independent Cave review of social housing regulation. Many of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, about the small provider&#151;for  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_214"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>example; the difficulty of regulating standards and the issues of quality and choice&#151;are important and the growth of the sector presents a challenge in this area. The Cave review of social housing regulation has made clear recommendations on the engagement of social landlords with local authorities on place-shaping and on the role of stakeholders in the regulatory system. The Government are now consulting on their response and propose to accept the recommendation and incorporate it in housing legislation at an early opportunity. We will take the recommendations of the Cave review and see how we can strengthen the regulatory system.</p>

<a name="70717-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="070717106000069"></a>It would be premature to agree these measures before the consultation has ended and in isolation from other aspects of the new regulation regime. But we are certainly not indifferent to the problems in the sector and to the sorts of problems that London Councils has raised in its support for this amendment. Unfortunately, the amendment is not the way to deal with the problem as there is the legal issue I have already described, but we have got a way forward into solving some of the problems.</p>

It is the most extraordinary thing that in this place Bills pass by us and we think of wonderful ideas about what will go into them. There is always another bus coming behind on which you can put another passenger and if you are lucky they will not get off before they get to the right stop. This has happened with the community call for action measure, which is exactly the same measure. It was put into the Police and Justice Act and now makes it difficult for this Bill.</p>

<a name="70717-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="070717106000071"></a>We have raised this issue in good time. The Cave review is obviously extremely important, and I very much hear what the Minister says about the consultation, but we have a problem here and now. We are setting out powers for the overview and scrutiny committee to require and to get information about things that are to do with its own area. Every council is steeped in housing run in some way by registered social landlords, by ALMOs or by tenant management organisations. I imagine that ALMOs are bodies to which councils already relate because they are by definition still associated with them. However, registered social landlords are sucking up enormous sums of money. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Best, says about other private organisations that are coming in. In our discussions on the previous legislation, we had quite a happy exchange about how to prevent that, but, at the end of the day, people who are in social housing believe that the council has something to do with it and has to help them.</p>

<a name="70717-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="070717106000072"></a>How can we let this Bill pass without ensuring that the overview and scrutiny committee can get its paws on that? We need to think very carefully about that. If it is simply because the Bill is steered only towards partner authorities, cannot we change a word? There must be some way in which we can get a foot in the door in this Bill, because no amount of other legislation will do it. People will have to keep referring again and again to this issue. This is where we need it.

Amendment No. 217C would allow the overview and scrutiny committee to send reports to police authorities to which they could be required to have regard. The noble Baroness asked why the Bill is as it is. The exemption in the Bill regarding the overview and scrutiny of police authorities is not an accident or oversight; nor is it because we think that crime and disorder matters should be subject to strengthened scrutiny.

These provisions are far stronger than the general local government scrutiny arrangements set out in Section 21 of the Local Government Act 2000. Section 19 of the Police and Justice Act 2006 provides that every local authority shall have a crime and disorder committee, which can make reports and recommendations. When it does so, it must provide every chief officer of police, police authority, fire and rescue authority, PCT and local probation board in the area, and any other person named in an order by the Secretary of State, with a copy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="070717106000079"></a>Where such an authority or person then receives a copy of the report, they must consider it and respond, stating what action they are to take, and have regard to the report&#146;s recommendations in exercising their functions. In essence this Bill strengthens councils&#146; overview and scrutiny by allowing them to hold to account those public service providers they are not already able to hold to account through the specific provision of crime and disorder bodies&#151;by virtue of the Police and Justice Act 2006&#151;and health partners, which are provided for by the National Health Service Act 2006. Given that we have only recently legislated to provide for scrutiny arrangements on crime and disorder, there is no need to bring these back before the House and duplicate them in this Bill. As I said earlier, we intend to work as closely as possible with the Home Office in order to make sure that these provisions are lined up together.</p>

These are all probing amendments. Their purpose is to ask one or two interesting questions relating to overview and scrutiny. Amendments Nos. 217A and 217B and Clause 126 stand part probe the relationship between the district council&#146;s scrutiny committee and the county council&#146;s scrutiny committee in a two-tier system. The Minister will tell me that the amendments are not well drafted; I agree that they are not up to my normal brilliant standard. In particular, they probe the role of a district council&#146;s scrutiny committee. The Minister is nodding, so the amendments at least establish their aim, which is to get some debate on that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="070717106000086"></a>Can a district council overview and scrutiny committee make a report to the county council?

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="070717109000002"></a>Amendment No. 222A probes the matters that a joint scrutiny committee between a district and a county can scrutinise. I am talking about a district scrutiny committee scrutinising a county council function. Why might just the local improvement target be involved? Why could it not be widened to a designated improvement target? It is likely that, in the basket of improvement targets existing in the local area agreement, some will be designated and some will not, and they may be closely linked to each other. Why, by agreement, can the committee not do a scrutiny investigation into anything else? If the county and district councils are agreed, why could not either of those scrutiny committees do a scrutiny review of any subject in which either or both of them were involved by agreement between the two?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="070717109000003"></a>On whether Clause 123 should stand part of the Bill, I wish to ask a question about the regulations, which cover, as I understand it, the whole of the overview and scrutiny function. They will be extremely important; the powers to require information from partner authorities are vital. There could be real difficulties if they are too bureaucratic or prescriptive, although there is the necessity to get the right information. Perhaps the Minister would comment on these regulations and the approach that the Government will take to them. They are some of the most important regulations in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="070717109000004"></a>Clause 127, on guidance, refers to the whole of the overview and scrutiny function. Again, it would be helpful if we could see the draft guidance before Report stage after the Recess. When might the Government have at least some draft guidance on these matters? Will it be in the autumn like the other guidance that we have talked about? If so, how does the Minister define autumn?</p>

<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="070717109000005"></a><b><a name="70717-0014.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="070717109000039"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I shall reiterate briefly what I said earlier. The Bill strengthens the O&amp;S provisions in the Local Government Act, which enabled any overview and scrutiny committee to review or scrutinise and make reports to its council or executive on matters that affect the local authority&#146;s area. The provisions enabled overview and scrutiny committees to invite any person before them and to request information from any organisation, and they required members of the executive and officers to attend before scrutiny committees. The Bill builds on those provisions in the 2000 Act by requiring executives and councils to respond to the reports and recommendations of an O&amp;S committee. It provides that the O&amp;S committees may require information not just from the council and its officers but also from the council&#146;s local authority partners, and it allows O&amp;S committees of county and single-tier councils to send reports to LAA partners, which they may require these partners to have regard to in exercising their functions. That is the context in which the noble Lord has asked some important questions.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="070717109000006"></a>The role of districts in formulating LAAs, as we discussed yesterday, is very important. I assure the Committee that we believe that district councillors  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_218"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 218</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and councils themselves must be vital partners in any successful LAAs. I also explained that in two-tier areas district councils would be placed on an equal footing to their county councils on the agreement of local improvement targets. Therefore, it is obvious that districts should also have a key role in holding public services to account. We have strengthened that role in two ways. First, we have provided for joint O&amp;S committees with equivalent powers to upper-tier authorities when they are so desired. Secondly, we have made provision for regulations that will allow districts to scrutinise LAAs where they have a direct partnership with an LAA partner.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="070717109000007"></a>I will come on to explain why we have made that distinction and that restriction; we brought forward amendments in another place to clarify this. The point of creating joint committees is to enable us to make regulations to allow for the establishment of joint O&amp;S committees in two-tier areas between district councils and their respective county councils. We brought that amendment forward because we wanted these joint O&amp;S committees to be able to require information from and make reports and recommendations to LAA partners on matters relating to the attainment of an LAA target in the same way as a county or unitary authority could. We thought that joint committees were potentially a very important vehicle for improved working between districts and counties in two-tier areas. Therefore, in response to Amendment No. 218A, it would be wholly contrary to the spirit of joint working if we were to coerce local authorities into forming such a joint scrutiny committee. It would be counterproductive and something of a tautology. I assure the noble Lord that regulations will provide that the establishment of these joint scrutiny committees will be entirely at the discretion of the constituent local authorities. Therefore, I cannot accept Amendment No. 218A.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="070717109000008"></a>We will be issuing guidance about how joint O&amp;S committees might minimise or avoid overlap with other O&amp;S committees in the same area and we will commission that guidance in collaboration with key bodies. At this point I cannot give a date for the guidance, but officials are working exceptionally hard on this Bill. If I can provide some idea of when we can expect it, I will. But while we know that joint scrutiny committees could play a valuable role&#151;and I think that many will take it up&#151;that does not mean that there will not be a continuing role for O&amp;S committees of district councils in two-tier areas to scrutinise district functions. We also recognise that, in some two-tier areas, councils will simply not be able to reach agreement on these joint committees.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="070717109000009"></a>We have also brought forward amendments in another place to make provision to strengthen the O&amp;S committees of district councils of two-tier areas in their own right. The amendments that we have made allow us to make regulations under Clause 123 to enable district councils in two-tier areas to require information from local partners. The noble Lord asked me whether they would be able to send reports. Yes, they will. These amendments provide a new general power in Clause 126 to allow us to make regulations to enable district councils in two-tier areas to send reports to their respective county council where these reports also  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_219"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 219</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relate to matters that are LAA targets. Regulations under Clause 126 will enable us to make provision about the requirements on county councils to respond to those reports and on local public service providers to have regard to such reports.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="070717109000010"></a>I also explained when we discussed LAAs yesterday that, while there is a mutual duty in two-tier areas on both the county and the district councils to co-operate to agree LAA targets, it is equally important to avoid duplication and overlap. The county council, therefore, will have to have overall accountability for preparing the LAA. We believe that those local authorities that have responsibility for preparing an LAA should also have primary responsibility for holding to account any partner to whom a target specified in the agreement relates. So while the amendments that we brought forward are designed to give a real voice and real influence to district councils to recognise the responsibilities, in a two-tier area we must avoid duplicate scrutiny that would place unnecessary burdens on service providers, whoever they are.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="070717109000011"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s Amendments Nos. 217A, 217B and 218A would allow, in two-tier areas, O&amp;S committees of district councils and county councils to scrutinise and make recommendations to LAA partners on the same LAA target, including targets for which the district council might not be responsible. They would also allow O&amp;S committees of district councils to send reports to their county council on any LAA target. So the answer to the question why we have restricted the scope of the district is essentially to avoid duplication and the bureaucracy and confusion that might come with it.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="070717109000012"></a>The regulations will provide that the scrutiny committees will be able to require information from local public service providers in the more limited circumstances where they have formal partnership working arrangements. We have done that conscientiously. We also propose that the district council scrutiny committees should be able to send reports to their county council where, as a consequence of the partnership arrangements, they report on a matter that also relates to a target in the county council&#146;s LAA. Obviously we will have to consult before we do that, but it is worth reminding ourselves that local improvement targets cover both designated targets and purely local targets&#151;the undesignated ones. We are very anxious that district councils and two-tier authorities should exercise their scope for scrutiny on these partnership arrangements. However, a balance must be struck, otherwise reports will fly backwards and forwards on all sorts of areas and the resulting duplication will create exasperation, with the burden falling on public service providers, who are there to deliver services to the public.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="070717109000013"></a>I hope that, with that explanation in relation to the regulations as well, the noble Lord will feel able to accept Clause 123. However, I take the point about the importance of the regulations. I will look at the timetable and give noble Lords such information as I can about them.</p>

The three further amendments in the group are in the name of my noble friend Lady Hamwee. Amendment No. 216B is a traditional &#147;may/shall&#148; amendment relating to the recommendations and the report of an overview and scrutiny committee. New Section 21B, which is to go into the 2000 Act, states:</p>

<p><a name="070717109000034"></a>It seems to me that the word should be &#147;shall&#148;. Clearly, a general assumption that a report should be published will be subject to the constraints of acceptable information in terms of what can be made public. If a report contains personal or financial information, it may well be caught in that way. Subject to that, however, I should like to know why the Government are suggesting that there might be circumstances in which a report should not be published. The legislation should reflect a presumption for publication subject to the normal exemptions that apply throughout local government. Amendment No. 216F is consequential. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_221"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 221</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>scrutiny committees to publish any report that they make and executives or councils to publish every response to such a report. Amendments Nos. 216C, 216D and 216E would seemingly narrow the instances in which executives or councils must respond to reports by requiring them to respond only to those published by an overview and scrutiny committee. I shall explain why I believe that the Bill is correct.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="070717109000023"></a>The Local Government Act 2000 enables overview and scrutiny committees to make reports and recommendations to their executive or council where they feel that it is appropriate, and they may determine whether it would be helpful to publish these reports. This Bill builds on these sensible provisions and requires executives and councils to respond to reports and recommendations and consider what, if any, action they will take. Where these reports or recommendations have been published by the overview and scrutiny committee, the executive must publish its response.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="070717109000024"></a>Together, these provisions grant overview and scrutiny committees the freedom to decide where it would be helpful to make reports and recommendations and to consider whether these should be published, so placing them in the public domain. However, Amendments Nos. 216B and 216F would require an overview and scrutiny committee to publish any report or recommendations that it makes and an executive or a council to publish all responses to reports of an overview and scrutiny committee. I shall explain why we do not think that this is very sensible.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="070717109000025"></a>These amendments would severely undermine the discretion of overview and scrutiny committees in relation to making reports and recommendations. For example, where a scrutiny committee reviewed a matter and concluded that it should make a report to its executive or council, perhaps on a sensitive matter such as community cohesion, but not publish it, it would not be able to exercise its discretion; the report would have to be in the public domain or not made at all. There are sensitive issues in local politics where such discretion should be retained. Not only would this requirement make this process more bureaucratic, but these amendments also indicate a lack of trust in the judgment of overview and scrutiny committees. The noble Lord will surely agree with me on that. If the committees were required to publish everything in the way that the noble Lord suggests, they could become risk averse and very cautious, whereas we want to see them taking a robust and far-reaching role in contributing to local decision-making.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="070717109000026"></a>Amendments Nos. 216C to 216E would achieve much the same effect. They would not place a requirement on scrutiny committees to publish all their reports but they would require an executive or council to respond to the reports and recommendations of an overview and scrutiny committee where those had been published. There will be legitimate reasons why a scrutiny committee does not always want to publish its reports, but the matter would still justify a response. These amendments go in the opposite direction to the previous amendments and would prevent this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="070717109000027"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s amendments seek to provide improved transparency. However, we should be very careful about making these sorts of requirements because they would reduce discretion and therefore effectiveness

It seems to go against the whole principle of how local government operates.

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="070717109000029"></a>In my former role, I ran training sessions for councillors and potential councillors. We had mock council meetings, at which one of the motions was that the public should be excluded because of the political sensitivity of the matter to be discussed. That was a lampoon, which people were expected to denounce. There are clear rules and regulations within local government as to what is confidential and what is not. At an internal discussion stage, discussions among councillors, among senior staff and between councillors and officers are kept confidential, just as discussions between Ministers and civil servants are kept confidential&#151;until someone leaks them. However, once a matter reaches a committee or similar body of the council, it is in the public domain, unless it meets the exceptions clearly set out in the Local Government Act 1972: financial sensitivity; pending court actions that could be prejudiced; personal matters relating to individuals; personnel matters, which ought to be kept confidential; and so on&#151;there are probably more, which I have forgotten. This is clearly understood within local government. Some councils impose confidentiality more rigorously than others, but it is their choice; there are things that they are allowed to keep confidential. This Bill seems to be introducing a new area&#151;recommendations from overview and scrutiny committees&#151;that is to be treated differently from everything else that the council does. That is the clear implication of what the Minister said, which is why I said that I was astonished.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="070717109000030"></a>The Minister talked about reports and recommendations, but if a committee of the council is making a report or a recommendation, that is surely a public document, unless it comes within the accepted categories. To whom is it making the report and recommendations? As I read the legislation&#151;the 2000 Act and the new Bill&#151;those reports and recommendations are essentially made either to the council or to the executive, both of which are bodies that are not allowed by law to keep things confidential, unless they come within those categories. Now we have a category of sensitivity in local politics&#151;the Minister&#146;s phrase&#151;which might be because of an issue such as community cohesion. I am not happy. The Government need, very seriously, to think about this again. I seriously ask them to do this. I am not trying to make a political point here, but I think that there is something wrong. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment, but we may have to discuss it later. I hope that the Minister might correspond with us in the mean time.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="0707184000336"></a> Clause 125, page 84, line 7, leave out from beginning to &#147;a&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70717-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="0707184000005"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendments Nos. 218 to 223 are all on the same issue, and the Minister will have anticipated that they are at the behest of the Local Government Association. The amendments would remove the need for regulations to enable district councils in two-tier areas to set up joint overview and scrutiny committees with the county, or to report independently on local improvement targets.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="0707184000006"></a>The Government added new clauses on Report stage in the Commons to allow district councils to set up joint committees with county councils in their area, to review local area agreements and to enable district scrutiny committees to report independently on local improvement targets. The opportunity depends on the Secretary of State making the appropriate regulations to enable it to go forward. I do not know whether that was the quickest way that the Government could get this into legislation, to provide for regulations rather than spelling things out more fully, but the Local Government Association is concerned that the matter has not quite been achieved yet and that the district should not need to wait for secondary legislation or be dependent on secondary legislation to achieve that right. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="0707184000007"></a><b><a name="70717-0014.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0707184000432"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I appreciate why the Local Government Association wanted an explanation for this. There is nothing sinister in making provision in regulations for joint overview and scrutiny committees and enabling district councils in two-tier areas to make reports to their county councils. It is simply a practical measure to address matters of important detail to ensure that the various scrutiny provisions dovetail, work effectively and help to prevent the duplication of scrutiny and unnecessary burdens. We have already discussed joint scrutiny committees and district councils, and we have discussed the necessity of preventing duplication between different committees in two-tier areas and not placing undue burdens on local public service providers.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="0707184000008"></a>Putting this provision in the Bill would make the legislation much more difficult to amend and would make it difficult to deal with the sort of detailed matters that would enable joint O&amp;S committees to function effectively. Regulations not only enable one to go into matters of detail such as the composition, rules, procedures and remits of joint scrutiny committees, but provide the scope to address detailed matters to ensure that joint committees function effectively, such as in the appointment of sub-committees and co-opting people who are not members of the constituent authorities. We are rightly addressing those issues through regulations.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="0707184000009"></a>Clause 126 also allows us to make regulations regarding the requirements on local authorities, their executives and partner authorities in relation to those reports. However, to place that provision in the Bill could

It is a very practical point.</p>

<a name="70717-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="0707184000010"></a>Before making the regulations we would certainly discuss the matter with key stakeholders, including the LGA; the regulations will also be subject to consultation with local government and other stakeholders and partners. It may reassure the Committee to know that the House recently agreed that similar provisions could be made through regulations on the scrutiny of health matters in the National Health Service Act 2006 and on crime and disorder matters in the Police and Justice Act 2006. It is consistent with the way that we have approached those forms of regulation. I hope that that satisfies the noble Baroness and the LGA.</p>

The Secretary of State can devolve the power to make by-laws in some cases, but not in others. I hope the Minister can provide an explanation of what constrictions we may expect on the devolution of by-laws. It would be a great shame, and I know that local authorities around the country would be bitterly disappointed, if the great shining promise of devolved by-law-making powers were to be strangled at birth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="0707184000031"></a>The other amendment seeks to probe the meaning of subsection (2)(c) of the proposed new Section inserted by Clause 130. Paragraph (c) seems to constrict the by-laws that local authorities can make, even when the power to make laws has been passed to them, because the Secretary of State will be able to determine what is defined as a subject matter. Does this mean that the subject matter of every by-law is the Secretary of State&#146;s concern, and if so, to what extent? If this is a prescriptive back-door power then there is every reason not to include it in the Bill. Even if this is not the case, the subject matter of by-laws should be up to local authorities&#151;if &#147;subject matter&#148; is not too wide a term. Should this paragraph not indicate more strongly that it refers to the framework rather than the substance? I beg to move.</p>

Then I will not have to say anything at all when we reach that stage. I tabled the question on clause stand part precisely to probe the kind of thing that the noble Lord was probing in his first amendment.

<a name="70717-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="0707184000033"></a>There was an interesting discussion of this subject and of how wide the by-law-making power might be in the Public Bill Committee of this House. Some Members of Parliament had thought that it was restricted to by-laws which are normally under the control of the Secretary of State in the Department for Communities and Local Government. My honourable friend Tom Brake put down an amendment that listed about 18 different areas of by-laws that he wanted to put on the face of the Bill in order to ensure that they were included in this section. It included things like the Commons Act and the Dartmoor Commons Act and Hackney carriages and omnibuses and all kinds of things. The then Minister, Phil Woolas, admitted that it was not clear what the Bill meant, but said that in the Government&#146;s view it was quite clear that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="0707184000400"></a>&#147;If Parliament gives the go-ahead, we intend to use the powers to introduce the new procedures first in relation to byelaws that are confirmed by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707184000307"></a>Then he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="0707184000340"></a>&#147;In future, other Secretaries of State with responsibility for confirming byelaws may decide, following consultation&#151;that is not a caveat &#145;may&#146;, but a permissive power&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707184000308"></a>which, on the basis of what my noble friend Lady Hamwee said earlier, he was suggesting meant &#147;will&#148;&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0707184000401"></a>&#147;that it would be appropriate to make use of the powers&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0707184000309"></a>He also cited some examples such as,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="0707184000034"></a>There was quite a discussion in the Committee about Lake Windermere and other matters that I did not understand at all. But the general gist of Mr Woolas&#146;s comments was clearly that, once the Bill  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_227"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 227</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is passed, there will be a steady roll-out of by-law-making powers across Whitehall departments. They are all happy about that and only too anxious to get on with it. By-law-making powers regarding libraries and museums were mentioned as well as the fact that those would be handed down once the Bill is passed, which we suggest should happen fairly quickly.</p>

<a name="70717-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="0707184000035"></a>Is a clear list of the by-law-making powers that the Government will hand down to local authorities under this part of the Bill available, and if so, is there a timetable and a programme of which departments will hand them down first, second, third and so on, and how that will work? Are the commitments that Phil Woolas gave in the Commons genuine commitments that can be proved to be genuine, preferably before Report stage, or do we have to go back to the kind of amendment moved by Tom Brake in the House of Commons to stick more by-laws in the Bill? Those are my questions on this group of amendments.</p>

<a name="0707184000036"></a><b><a name="70717-0015.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0707184000439"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Hanningfield and Lord Greaves, for the way in which they have spoken to the amendments. On Amendments Nos. 225ZA and 225ZB and on Clause 130 stand part, it may be helpful if I explain our approach in setting out in regulations the type of by-laws that will be subject to the alternative procedures. We have taken this approach to ensure that the Government can retain their function of confirming certain types of by-laws where it is considered important to do so. That is why I cannot simply give a list, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, asked. It will be appropriate for some departments not to be devolved in relation to by-laws and for others to be devolved. I shall go through it and we can discuss the matter further if necessary.</p>

<a name="70717-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="0707184000037"></a>A large number of different authorities are empowered to make by-laws and a number of Secretaries of State have responsibility for confirming them. These by-laws, which will be subject to the alternative procedure, can be identified by a range of references, including the subject matter of the by-law, to ensure that there is complete clarity about which by-laws may or may not be subject to the regulations. I was asked about that. Our approach puts the position beyond doubt.</p>

<a name="70717-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="0707184000038"></a>The clause enables the Secretary of State to make regulations establishing a new procedure for local authorities to follow when making the kind of by-laws specified in the regulations. The changes will mean that once a local authority has consulted on, prepared and advertised draft by-laws locally, those by-laws can then be enacted without the authority having first to seek confirmation from the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="70717-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="0707184000039"></a>The vast majority of by-laws regulate matters such as low-level nuisances in local spaces, such as parks and beaches, and the use of market places. Those are very much local matters on which local authorities and their communities are best placed to decide. We take the view that a reference to central government in those circumstances is an unnecessary bureaucratic step. It may be helpful if I set out the rationale for the approach that we are providing in this clause, whereby the Secretary of State will no longer have a role only in by-laws specified in regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="0707184000040"></a>While it is clear that most by-laws deal with the essentially local issues that I have spoken about, some deal with matters where it might be thought that some central scrutiny should be retained. For example, as the noble Lord said, certain transport matters might be subject to by-laws made by private operators such as port management organisations which have no direct accountability to local people in the way that local authorities do. Another example might be by-laws that apply to activities in designated countryside sites that could raise issues of a far wider national interest. A regulation-making approach will mean that policy decisions on whether specific by-laws should remain subject to the Secretary of State&#146;s consent can be taken on a case-by-case or subject-by-subject basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="0707184000041"></a>I was asked by both noble Lords why I was not removing the confirming role for all Secretaries of State. This is a decision for individual Secretaries of State to take, taking account of the subject matter and the locations to which the by-laws they confirm can apply. If they decide, following consultation, that a central confirming role is no longer required, they may opt to use the new powers.</p>

I am grateful to the Minister for saying all that to us because it confirms our worst fears. It is therefore helpful to have it set out in <I>Hansard</I>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="0707184000043"></a>It seems that the promises, if they were promises, or even the wish list promised by Phil Woolas, do not exist. It seems that negotiations with other Whitehall departments are either still taking place or have not even started yet. There is no guarantee at all as to which ones might come out. I give a small, local example: on the recreation ground on the hill above our house, there was a huge nuisance for a long time with aeromodellers flying their model aircraft in a very inappropriate place around and above houses. There was a long campaign, supported by the parish and borough councils, to bring in by-laws to stop it. It took 15 years before the borough council was able to do so, because the Home Office&#151;the confirming authority&#151;would not do it. The idea that local by-laws can be passed by local authorities in a democratic, local way was not a great step forward, but a useful part of the devolution which the Government were promising us. Yet, whenever we look at these devolutions, they seem even more feeble than they sounded at first.</p>

<a name="70717-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="0707184000044"></a>I do not blame the Minister at all&#151;she is just doing her job here&#151;but her Government must stand up and tell us which departments are signed up to this. We understand very well that some by-laws will not be suitable, and some departments will be reluctant. We want to know which departments are signed up, and we want a clear list of those by-laws which are going to be released in the first, say, three years after the passing of this Bill. That is a reasonable thing to ask; perhaps the first 12 months. If we do not know that, we will not be very happy to let this clause go through at a later stage.</p>

I understand that negotiations are quite well advanced with other departments. These will, of course, be subject to consultation. Other departments are currently considering whether the by-laws they oversee should be included in these initial regulations. Indications are that two departments are minded to do so, and at least two others may well be looking at being included. They are live, ongoing negotiations with, we hope, a positive end to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="0707184000051"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment tidies up a simple point that came up in debate in the Commons. The Minister explained succinctly that where new Section 236A in the Local Government Act 1972 refers to the Secretary of State delegating the power to make by-laws, it applies to every department. I understand that that delegation will take place department by department&#151;so we are back to the subject of the previous amendment&#151;perhaps even by-law by by-law. It is a shame because, as the Bill is new government legislation, I presume that every department had to give the thumbs up that this delegation could take place with immediate effect in order to secure consistency on handover&#151;a clarified process of the welcome devolution of the power to make by-laws that we talked about before. In the absence of such a common-sense measure, the Minister may be able to accept Amendment No. 225ZC, which ensures transparency in this process by placing a duty on every department to publicise, no later than three months after the passing of the Bill, a timetable for the introduction of regulations that will delegate certain by-laws to local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="0707184000068"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 225ZE is a simple amendment which addresses what might potentially be a simple problem. In fact, I fear that the line numbers may have become confused as it should read &#147;Page 91, line 44&#148;. This amendment seeks to address potential ring-fencing in proposed new Section 237D entitled &#147;Use of fixed penalty receipts&#148;. I hope the amendment will make more sense in this context.</p>

<a name="70717-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="0707184000069"></a>Proposed new Section 237D places a duty on local authorities to have regard to the desirability of spending money gathered from fines and fixed penalty notices on addressing the problems of each precise fixed penalty notice. In another place, the Minister insisted that that was not ring-fencing. Indeed, on the face of it, it does not look like compulsory ring-fencing. However, I would be interested to know how the words &#147;have regard to&#148; will be enforced. My amendment would ensure that, although authorities would have regard to the desirability of spending fine money on the offences from which the fine arose, where part of that money might usefully be spent on other priorities, local authorities should have that potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="0707184000070"></a>I have indicated my intention to oppose the Question that Clause 133 stand part of the Bill.

On Amendment No. 225ZE, Clause 132 already provides local authorities with discretion to use the receipts raised from fixed penalty fines for purposes other than enforcement of nuisances if they consider that appropriate. We are not trying to tie the hands of local authorities in this respect. I hope therefore that the noble Lord will agree to withdraw the amendment.</p>

That clause gives the Secretary of State power to issue guidance about the new procedures for making by-laws and the use of fixed penalties to enforce by-laws. That guidance will help to ensure consistency of standards and provide local authorities with a robust framework of guidance and support. Again, we are not trying to restrict local authorities through guidance; we are trying to lay out a map for consistent standards across the piece and hoping that that guidance will allow local authorities to have a robust framework of support.</p>

It would be helpful if I explained the background to Clause 134. The aim of the clause is to extend to by-laws the procedures already in place in the Police Reform Act 2002 for publicising the enforcement arrangements which apply to specified low-level nuisances.

<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="0707184000098"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall also speak to Amendment No. 225G in the group. Amendment No. 225E would add to Section 3 of the 1999 Act an obligation on an authority when dealing with its best value duty to consult additionally to those listed in that Act representatives of voluntary and non-statutory organisations delivering services in the area. It was a reference in the Bill to that clause that made me wonder whether these organisations should not be referred to specifically, as well as representations which all noble Lords will probably have received from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. The Minister may tell me that mention of representatives of persons who appear to have an interest in the area covers voluntary organisations, and I suppose that I should hold my hand up again in that I must have sat through similar discussions and possibly even moved an amendment to this effect in 1999. I cannot remember. The role of the voluntary organisations, as we have been saying, is important and deserves recognition.</p>

<a name="70717-0016.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="0707184000099"></a>Amendment No. 225G would amend Clause 139 on the involvement of local representatives. I would be glad if the Government could explain their thinking. I propose taking out subsection (4), although I realise that I should have taken out subsection (3)(c) and (d) as well. However, I am sure that the Minister will have understood the drift of my question: who is to be specified by order?</p>

<a name="70717-0016.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="0707184000100"></a>In Committee in the Commons, Angela Smith, the Minister answering, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a><a name="0707184000352"></a>&#147;The clause will provide the Secretary of State with powers to make additional exemptions from the duty using secondary legislation subject to the negative resolution procedure&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707184000313"></a>I should understand better than I do the basis on which those powers will be used. The Commons were told that the clause,</p>
<ul><a name="0707184000405"></a>&#147;is a key plank in the Government&#146;s commitment to ensuring greater engagement and empowerment of local communities&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0707184000314"></a>and that it will place,</p>
<ul><a name="0707184000406"></a>&#147;a duty on best value authorities ... to involve representatives of local persons in the exercise of authority functions where appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0707184000315"></a>That does make me wonder about the persons appearing to the authority to have an interest in the area. I would have though that they were already there under the 1999 Act, but I obviously misread that. The language that Angela Smith used, such as,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a><a name="0707184000353"></a>&#147;The leverage provided by the duties&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill Committee, 27/2/07; col. 398.],</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707184000316"></a>is very prescriptive. It all seemed to turn a good into something doubtful, possibly even something bad, because of the top-down approach. I was confirmed in my apprehension by getting to the point in <I>Hansard</I> for the Commons Committee stage, where I learnt that the national performance indicators to be published to increase accountability are to include &#147;citizen perspective indicators.&#148; Yes, citizens are very important but, my goodness, what a piece of jargon. On the basis of the jargon alone, I beg to move that amendment.</p>

We are firmly in the morass and maze of &#147;best value.&#148; When first introduced, this was to be the new, simplified, liberating system to replace compulsory competitive tendering, which had been introduced by the previous Conservative Government and was generally disliked within local government. The Labour Party came to power promising to abolish CCT and replaced it with best value first in the 1999 Act and then in the 2000 Act which introduced the concept of community strategies, which we all now know and love.</p>

<a name="70717-0016.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a><a name="0707184000102"></a>I cannot understand what Clauses 138 and 139, and the rest of this part, will do or change that is not covered by the existing legislation. The proposed new Section 3A(1) of the 1999 Act refers to &#147;involvement of local representatives&#148;. There is already something about involving the people in the previous Acts. For example, the 2000 Act says that in preparing or modifying its community strategy, a local authority must consult and seek the participation of such persons as it considers appropriate, which seems a fairly straightforward statement in simple, easy-to-understand language. Then you get to the morass introduced by the second part, which says that it must have regard to any guidance for the time being issued by the Secretary of State. That is where immense complications come in.</p>

<a name="70717-0016.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a><a name="0707184000103"></a>Now we have this wording in the Bill. If anyone can tell me what this means, I would be very grateful. New Section 3A under Clause 139 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a><a name="0707184000354"></a>&#147;Where a best value authority considers it appropriate for representatives of local persons (or of local persons of a particular description) to be involved in the exercise of any of its functions by being&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a><a name="0707184000355"></a>(a) provided with information about the exercise of the function,</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a><a name="0707184000356"></a>(b) consulted about the exercise of the function, or</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a><a name="0707184000357"></a>(c) involved in another way,</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a><a name="0707184000358"></a>it must&#148; &#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707184000104"></a>&#147;must&#148; is a very strange word, there&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0707184000407"></a>&#147;take such steps as it considers appropriate to secure that such representatives are involved in the exercise of the function in that way&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70717-0016.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a><a name="0707184000105"></a>That is either a revolutionary statement or it means nothing; I think it means nothing. What is the purpose of putting words like that into legislation? All it says is that a council, when it feels like it, can tell people what is going on, ask them what they think about it and involve them in some way. They can have a survey, a questionnaire, a citizen&#146;s panel, or invite them to meetings. When councils want to do this, they already do so. There is no difficulty about it. There are no legislative provisions which say that you cannot do this. So why do we need this incredibly convoluted, complex, new section, which, if it means anything at all, simply means that you can do things you have been doing all the time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"></a><a name="0707184000106"></a>Clause 139(5) is the usual stuff. It states:</p>

<ul><a name="0707184000408"></a>&#147;an authority must have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0707184000318"></a>That takes us back to Clause 138, which says, in effect, that the Secretary of State can issue instructions&#151;it is called guidance, but no one goes against it&#151;to councils to do anything he wants them to do, in any way and at any time.</p>

<a name="70717-0016.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a><a name="0707184000107"></a>The whole thing is incredibly centralist. It is part and parcel of the system in which central government, particularly through its regional offices in this case, has its very close grips on local authorities. All this talk about devolution turns out not to mean very much in practice when this kind of legislation is passed. I am very cynical about the whole thing, which is why I have put down these amendments. Why does the Bill not just say, &#147;Consult who you want or consult everyone who wishes to be consulted&#148;?</p>

<a name="70717-0016.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a><a name="0707184000108"></a>I shall give an example of how this will work out in practice. Pendle Council, of which I am a member, is in the fairly early stages of consulting people under the 1999 and 2000 legislation on the community strategy, which is now suddenly called the &#147;sustainable community strategy&#148;. I think that it is the same thing. I do not know where the word &#147;sustainable&#148; appeared, but it does not appear in legislation. We have to call it sustainable now, which is fine, and we do not mind doing so. At the same time, we have the horrifically complex, new planning legislation, which went through your Lordships' House about two years ago, setting up the local development framework, so the two go side by side.</p>

<a name="70717-0016.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a><a name="0707184000109"></a>Instruction from regional offices&#151;that is, the Secretary of State&#151;is very prescriptive about how you have to consult, otherwise it is not approved. In effect, the consultation taking place now is a blank-sheet consultation. People are being asked, &#147;What do you think about the future of Pendle? What would you like to see in Pendle and what kind of place would you like it to be?&#148;. This overlaps with all sorts of other consultation that has taken place. There is consultation fatigue, so very few people will respond because they do not believe that that kind of consultation has any meaning. It is counterproductive because it brings the process of consultation into disrepute.</p>

<a name="70717-0016.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a><a name="0707184000110"></a>I speak as someone who thinks that public consultation and involvement is very important. I argued that a long time ago when organisations such as the Labour Party thought it was all nonsense. Because the consultation is open-ended, it is unrealistic and meaningless. People might come along and say, &#147;We would like 5,000 new houses built&#148;, or &#147;We would like a university&#148;, or &#147;We would like the Leeds and Liverpool Canal turned into a continuous marina&#148;. However, they might say, &#147;We want no more development at all&#148;. For consultation to be relevant and sensible, it has to be based on practical things. If people ask sensible questions about practical situations in the real world, they will come up with sensible answers and will tell you what they think. You may or may not agree with them, but there will be sensible consultation. Open-ended consultation is being forced on local authorities by the regional offices and the Secretary of State. I fear that this part of the Bill is simply more of the same. It is written by people who

<a name="70717-0016.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a><a name="0707184000111"></a>I hesitate to use the words of John Prescott about teeny-boppers in Downing Street, but one suspects that a lot of this legislation comes from such people.</p>

I, too, have been committed to and involved in promoting the concept of public involvement, particularly in health. Sometimes listening to the noble Lord&#146;s interpretation of the Bill, I wonder whether we are reading the same document.</p>

<a name="70717-0016.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a><a name="0707184000222"></a>Let me speak to the amendments. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, raised a particular concern about the voluntary sector and I hope that my comments will go some way to providing her and the voluntary sector with some reassurance. Amendments Nos. 225E and 225EA would amend Section 3(2) of the Local Government Act 1999, which states that authorities must consult representatives of persons who pay local taxes, levies or business rates, those who use council services and anybody else with an interest in best value. This includes citizens, electors, residents and local councillors. These amendments would go beyond this and make it mandatory for local authorities to consult all people and councillors. We believe that it is unrealistic to expect local authorities to involve all local people. Such a duty would be hugely burdensome in time and money. Also, this amendment would only cover how an authority consults on its duty of best value. The new duty we are proposing in Clause 139 goes much wider.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70717-0017.htm"/>


<a name="70717-0017.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a><a name="0707184000223"></a>The clause places a new duty on best value authorities in England, except police authorities. It is a very significant plank of this legislation. It requires authorities to inform, consult and/or involve representatives of local persons in the exercise of the authority&#146;s functions as appropriate. By &#147;representatives of local persons&#148; we mean that an authority must involve a cross-section of the population affected by or interested in a particular service. Who the authority involves will vary according to the type of authority, policy or service area. However, the current drafting means authorities will be required to consider when and how local councillors, community spokespeople and&#151;of importance to this discussion&#151;voluntary groups should be engaged. The statutory guidance will reinforce this message. Noble Lords will have received a statement of intent setting out the scope of the statutory guidance with a clear expectation that authorities should engage local voluntary groups and community leaders where appropriate, as well as reaching out to individual citizens. The guidance will also emphasise the voluntary sector and community leaders&#146; role in advocating on behalf of the most vulnerable and marginalised in society&#151;an extremely key area&#151;and helping such groups to engage. However, it would not be right to require authorities to involve specific groups such as voluntary and community organisations in every given circumstance. There may be instances where it would be inappropriate to involve certain groups and we should give authorities the

<p><a name="stpa_441"></a><a name="0707184000224"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked me to explain further the question of exemptions and I will do my best to help her. Amendments Nos. 225F and 225G affect the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to create exemptions from the duty to involve. The first amendment would remove the order-making power and the second would extend the scope of this power by removing the constraints placed upon the extent of the order. The Secretary of State may need to provide clarity on when and how authorities should not involve citizens and communities over and above what can be achieved with guidance. This provision ensures that there can be a clear answer to whether a matter is outside the scope of the duty. Without the provision, the scope could be left unclear or left to the courts to decide. It is envisaged that this exemption would only rarely be used. For example, there could be an exemption under the new duty. In the new world, when this power comes into force, you could have a situation where the duty creates an expectation that individual or personal matters are seen as an area for consultation, such as in adoption cases or staff disciplinary proceedings. It is important that if there is any ambiguity in an area involving a matter of personal or individual concern, the Secretary of State is able to create an exemption. We can imagine a situation where a body wanted to consult the community on the development of the policy around an issue like adoption, but we would not want any involvement of individuals in the execution of that policy. It is also possible that in the future, the functions of individual best value authorities might change, and therefore it may become appropriate to exempt those authorities or some of their functions from the duty. However, as I have said, it is expected that this provision would be very rarely used.</p>

<a name="70717-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a><a name="0707184000225"></a>I turn briefly to the meaning and importance of Clauses 138 and 139. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, was very sceptical, although I see them as forming an important, interrelated part of the Bill. Clause 138 is needed because statutory guidance on best value is provided using the powers under Sections 3(4), 5(5) and 6(4) of the 1999 Act. With the repeal of Sections 5 and 6 of the 1999 Act, only the power to issue guidance on how authorities consult representatives of local people will remain, and we believe that that is far too narrow. Clause 138 widens the scope of guidance by allowing the Secretary of State to issue guidance about a broader range of matters related to how authorities should fulfil their general duty of best value.</p>

<a name="70717-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a><a name="0707184000226"></a>Clause 139 is needed to ensure that people across the country are given the opportunity to have their say and get involved in local services and policies. Evidence from both the UK and overseas shows that where citizens and communities are involved, services improve and better reflect the needs of local users, resulting in higher levels of user satisfaction. However, Comprehensive Performance Assessment 2006 found that while,</p>
<ul><a name="0707184000418"></a>&#147;council approaches to consultation and engagement are at different stages of development ... councils need to do more to engage greater involvement of users in ... services&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="0707184000331"></a>It also found that,</p>

<p><a name="0707184000332"></a>So not everything is completely bright and rosy in the garden and we need to do more. This is a very important clause in that. The duty also provides an important counterbalance to the reduction in top-down controls which this Bill is also all about in the new performance framework. With that, I hope that the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

The Minister has talked about a &#147;new world&#148;, which has Orwellian overtones, or that is how it felt to me.

<p><a name="stpa_466"></a><a name="0707184000256"></a>Clause 155 is short but significant. The Audit Commission Act 1998 is to be amended so as to take away from the Audit Commission its power to undertake studies at the request of bodies subject to audit and studies for functional bodies at the request of the Greater London Authority.</p>

<a name="70717-0017.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a><a name="0707184000257"></a>I am aware of the dangers of being too anecdotal, but when I first came into local government the whole area of performance review and what the Audit Commission and indeed the district auditor had to say was regarded in a rather different way from the way it is now. It was all very positive and helpful&#151;or a lot of it was. The opportunity for the Audit Commission to undertake these studies is important. I understand from the debate in the Commons that only about 0.5 per cent of its turnover currently arises  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_241"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column 241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from these special studies. As my honourable friend the Member for Hazel Grove pointed out, the Bill will no doubt result in more joint commissioning of services. The studies subject to this clause could be potentially useful there.</p>

<a name="70717-0017.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a><a name="0707184000258"></a>The problem seems to be that there is a potential conflict of interest. I find that difficult. The Minister said that the same body is offering improvement, support and inspection. If that is so, then it is only in connection with these studies, which, as I said, are potentially very valuable. If there is a bigger problem over conflict of interest, I think that the thing needs to be addressed in the round, not by taking away that provision. The Minister said that, having heard the arguments, the Government would reflect on the concerns that had been expressed, rethink and introduce proposals later to the Committee or to the House to address this matter. It may be that proposals have made their way into the Bill that I have not understood; I am perfectly willing to accept that that might be the case. If so, perhaps the Minister can tell me where they are and, if not, perhaps she can tell me where the thinking that the Government undertook to do has got to.</p>

Essentially, our initial view was that there was a potential for conflict of interest, with an inspectorate offering improvement advice, and a value-for-money issue, with different publicly funded bodies competing for the same work. However, as the noble Baroness said, we listened to the representations made during the passage of the Bill and we discussed the matter at length with the commission. We were reassured when we did so that there had never been any accusation of conflict of interest and that there genuinely were advantages for local authorities in having a wider choice of improvement support agencies. We concluded that the commission should continue to be able to respond to requests for help using the new advice and assistance power.</p>

<a name="70717-0017.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a><a name="0707184000260"></a>Clause 155 repeals Sections 35 and 35A of the Audit Commission Act 1998, which allow the commission to undertake fee-paid improvement studies of certain bodies at their request, or in some cases at the request of the Mayor of London. The clause is fine, as it seeks to tidy up legislation, since the power is now obsolete, having been superseded by the new power for the commission to provide advice and assistance to a wide range of public authorities, as set out in paragraph 9 of Schedule 12. There is a potential overlap if that power were to remain. The new powers are much broader than the powers in Sections 35 and 35A of the Audit Commission Act 1998 and they enable the Audit Commission to advise any public bodies, including those outside the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_479"></a><a name="0707184000272"></a>The noble Baroness said: Again, this is a probing amendment, but it is essential to bring into the debate the adequate safeguards that are to be put in place to protect the information that can be disclosed in audit processes. Amendment No. 226AA would ensure that any information disclosed under the section would be destroyed within six months. Amendment No. 226AB covers the situation where the publication would be likely to be prejudicial to the effective safeguarding of the personal details of any individual. It is important that there is a duty on the Audit Commission to safeguard such information. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70717-0017.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a><a name="0707184000274"></a>The problem with Amendment No. 226AA is that it goes in the opposite direction to improving the transparency of public bodies. I am sure we all think that the public ought to be entitled to see information obtained by the Audit Commission about public bodies. By definition, the audit of public bodies ought to be transparent. People who control public money ought to be held to account. If public bodies act unlawfully, or persons in official positions in public bodies do not account for public money properly, I am not sure why the details should be destroyed after six months. The amendment would also create practical problems for organisations or individuals commissioned to conduct a study or review lasting more than six months, because the information provided would no longer be valid for use. I worry about this amendment, because it would make the process of disclosure and the use of information onerous and bureaucratic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"></a><a name="0707184000275"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 226AB. Clause 166 as it stands will allow the Audit Commission to publish any information provided that the publication will not prejudice the effective performance of its functions, or those of an auditor. Section 51 of the Audit Commission Act 1998 currently restricts the type of information the commission can publish. Since the commencement of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, individuals can request information from the commission, which it is happy to provide. But this clause makes it clear that the commission can publish any information except where publication may prejudice its functions, or those of an auditor. The main purpose of the clause is to bring more transparency to information about public bodies. It is very unlikely that the Audit Commission would release personal details in an irresponsible way. It would certainly damage its reputation by indicating that it was acting irresponsibly. I consider that the noble Baroness has moved the amendments in a responsible and genuine way. But the Data Protection Act 1998 also prevents the Audit Commission from releasing and publishing personal data in a report. For those three reasons, I hope that she will feel that there is sufficient protection to allay the concerns that she raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_491"></a><a name="0707184000288"></a>As to Amendment No. 226B, it may be helpful if I first explain the general background to Clause 173. This clause is intended to make it clear that the local commissioners&#146; jurisdiction extends to the investigation of maladministration or service failure where local authority functions are exercised under partnership arrangements. By way of further clarification in this respect, we have also taken the opportunity to reformulate the wording of Section 25 of the Local Government Act 1974 on the &#147;relevant matters&#148; falling with the commissioners&#146; jurisdiction, as this has been subject to many amendments over the years and has consequently become somewhat difficult to decipher.

<h4 align="center"><a name="07071763000008"></a>The Committee met at half-past three</h4>


<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000009"></a>[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Baroness Gould of Potternewton) in the Chair.]</p>

<p><a name="07071763000010"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07071763000151"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Baroness Gould of Potternewton):</b> Before the Minister moves that the first order be considered, perhaps I may remind noble Lords that, in the case of each order, the Motion before the Committee will be that it do consider the order in question. The Motion to approve the order will be moved in the Chamber in the usual way.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="07071763000002"></a>Private Security Industry Act 2001 (Amendments to Schedule 2) Order 2007</h3>

<p><a name="07071763000011"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071763000152"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Private Security Industry Act 2001 (Amendments to Schedule 2) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000012"></a>The noble Lord said: The Private Security Industry Act 2001 provides for the regulation of the private security industry through the licensing of individual operatives working in the private security industry. At present, the licensing requirement applies only to England and Wales. In Scotland, licensing will become a requirement from 1 November 2007.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000013"></a>The main purpose of this order is to amend Schedule 2 to the 2001 Act to ensure that, in line with similar functions in England and Wales, certain prison- and police-related activities carried out in Scotland are not caught by the licensing requirement. </p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000014"></a>The order also makes a number of minor and technical amendments. The 2001 Act sets out certain types of activity for which an SIA licence is required. These activities, which are designated by orders made under Section 3(3) of the Act, are listed in Schedule 2. They include manned guarding, door supervision, the transport of cash and valuables, and key-holding. When licensing becomes compulsory in Scotland, from 1 November 2007, those activities will also be designated in respect of Scotland. Crown employees who hold office and undertake security activities, such as police officers and prison officers, are outside the scope of the 2001 Act.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000015"></a>However, the original legislation had the unforeseen effect of extending to security guards who undertook manned guarding activities while working under contract in prisons, in immigration centres, as prisoner escorts and in other similar areas under the control of the police and prison authorities. They were subsequently excluded in respect of England and Wales. Article 2 will ensure that the position is the same in Scotland.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000016"></a>Article 3 makes a minor, technical amendment. Article 4 ensures that the restriction and/or removal of vehicles is not caught by the licensing requirement  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in Scotland. Vehicle immobilisation, or wheel-clamping, where a fee is charged for the release of the vehicle, is already illegal in Scotland.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000017"></a>Paragraphs (2) and (5) of Article 5 bring the position in Scotland into line with that in England and Wales to ensure that the door supervision requirements apply to licensed premises only when alcohol or entertainment is being provided. Article 5(3) is intended to establish beyond doubt that licensable security activities in respect of cash and valuables in transit and close protection are not caught by the door supervision requirements. It applies to all areas.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000018"></a>Article 5(4) avoids potential problems caused by an incorrect paragraph number used in a similar amendment made by the Gambling Act 2005. The amendment makes it clear that casinos and bingo halls do not fall under the door supervision requirements in addition to requiring a premises licence under the Gambling Act.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000019"></a>Article 5(5) amends the list of premises not to be treated as licensed premises for the purposes of paragraph (8) to make provision for the position in Scotland.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000020"></a>Once the order is passed, implementation of the licensing requirement in Scotland will require an order made by the Scottish Parliament applying the offence provisions of the Act to Scotland from 1 November 2007.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000021"></a>In closing, I can say that the SIA has overcome the problems of last year caused by a last-minute rush for licences and is now well placed to extend its functions to Scotland. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000022"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Private Security Industry Act 2001 (Amendments to Schedule 2) Order 2007. <I>19th r</I><I>eport from the Statutory Instruments Committee</I>.&#151;(<I>Lord Bassam of Brighton</I>.)</p>

I would welcome his assurance that the order is, as the Government said, &#147;appropriate and proportionate&#148; both in England and Wales and in Scotland. My party did not oppose the Act when it was brought into force, and I would welcome the Minister&#146;s assurance that the Government have in mind not to penalise excessively the smaller businesses in this industry. We have no other objections to the measure. </p>

Like the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, I want to ask whether it is appropriate and proportionate. The second and only other query that I have is why there is an exception for casinos under Article 5(4).</p>

<p><a name="07071763000025"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07071763000155"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to both noble Lords for their kind comments of welcome to this order. The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, is right to ask about its appropriateness and proportionality.  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We have consulted extensively on this. There is support across the security industry sector, and business, too, largely accepts the measure as the right way to proceed. Following the passing of the Act, there was some debate about whether it had been sufficiently fine-tuned and whether, for some businesses, it could have been an excuse for over-zealous regulation. We think that we have that right, and the messages that we are getting back say exactly the same. I can tell noble Lords that a small business impact assessment was carried out before the decision was made to extend the measure to Scotland. Therefore, we think that it is appropriate and that we have the balance right in terms of proportionality for enforcement.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000026"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, asked about casinos. My understanding is that casinos are already exempted, so the order need not apply and it is therefore entirely workable. There is no explanation other than that.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000027"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="07071763000003"></a>Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Investigation of Protected Electronic Information: Code of Practice) Order 2007</h3>
<h5><a name="07071763000147"></a>3.39 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07071763000028"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07071763000156"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Investigation of Protected Electronic Information: Code of Practice) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000029"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall also speak to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Acquisition and Disclosure of Communications Data: Code of Practice) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000030"></a>These orders, made under Section 71 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, were laid before Parliament on 14 June. The purpose of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Acquisition and Disclosure of Communications Data: Code of Practice) Order is to secure approval of a draft code of practice relating to the acquisition and disclosure of communications data under the 2000 Act, its acquisition by public authorities and its disclosure by communications service providers.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000031"></a>Communications data, such as telephone and internet subscriber information, allocation of internet addresses, itemised call records and mobile phone location data, remain a vital tool in the prevention and detection of crime and in safeguarding the public. It is data about who contacted whom and when; it provides evidence of associations between individuals and events in time and place; it can corroborate the testimony of victims and witnesses; it can also provide evidence of innocence. Most importantly, it is not about the content of communications and what was said in telephone calls or written in e-mails.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000032"></a>The provisions of Chapter 2 were implemented in January 2004 and brought long overdue regulation to  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC4"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>public authorities&#146; acquisition of communications data. Exercise of the provisions is under the vigilant oversight of the Interception of Communications Commissioner, Sir Paul Kennedy, assisted by a team of inspectors who scrutinise public authorities&#146; conduct to obtain communications data.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000033"></a>A draft code of practice has been in place since these provisions were implemented. It has been extensively revised to take account of actual practice and to address issues on which public authorities and communications service providers have sought guidance or clarification. Sir Paul and his inspectors have contributed significantly to the development of the code of practice, as have respondents to a public consultation on the draft. The code presented to Parliament sets out procedures that ensure proper respect for individuals&#146; human rights and reflect the reality of operational and investigative work.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000034"></a>The application of the code will significantly reduce unnecessarily bureaucratic processes. For example, it makes clear that a senior officer can authorise the obtaining of subscriber information without needing to know which service provider operates the phone number. It also makes clear that it is unnecessary to undertake a subscriber check prior to, or separate from, checking call records; that a single authorisation can cover the acquisition of specific data and the additional data necessary to interpret that; and that, where data is required in an emergency, no special internal paperwork is required but the public authority must collate the evidence of its decision-making from operational logs, which must be available to the commissioner&#146;s inspectors.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000035"></a>The code also makes clear, and reflects operational practice over many years that, where the connection of a 999 emergency call is lost and information is needed to provide emergency assistance to the caller within the so-called &#147;golden hour&#148;, that is outside the arrangements of the Act.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000036"></a>The code makes clear that only appropriately trained and accredited investigators who understand the legislation can engage with communications service providers and spare them from ill informed, impractical or unlawful inquiries.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000037"></a>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Investigation of Protected Electronic Information: Code of Practice) Order seeks the approval of a draft code of practice relating to the exercise and performance of the powers and duties under Part 3 of the Act to require the disclosure of protected electronic data in an intelligible form or to acquire a key, or a password, to that data. Part 3 gives public authorities no new powers to seize or acquire data, but it does give them powers, to be used only when necessary and appropriate, to require data they possess or are likely to possess to be made intelligible or to require disclosure of the key that will make the data intelligible.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000038"></a>These provisions are not in force. It has taken longer than was expected in 2000 for the same technologies that have enabled electronic commerce to develop to be taken up by terrorists and criminals to secure their information and to protect and conceal evidence of unlawful conduct.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC5"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC5</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000039"></a>Equally, encryption tools have remained cumbersome to use properly. That has been exploited by technical facilities such as the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC), which processes protected data on behalf of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000040"></a>However, these tools are becoming easier to use and are being installed in the standard operating systems of consumer devices. The impact of encrypted data on the work of investigators and their ability to work within statutory custody time limits will continue to increase.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000041"></a>The Government have made it very clear that these provisions would not enter in force until the time was right and not before Parliament had approved a code of practice. The time is now right.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000042"></a>The code of practice addresses issues on which Parliament sought clarification when the primary legislation was considered and debated. It takes account of the comments of respondents to the public consultation. The code makes it clear that the overriding purpose of the provisions is to enable investigators to access lawfully acquired information in an intelligible form, not to access the keys to data.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000043"></a>The power to require disclosure of key material can be expected to be used only where a person who is able to put protected information into an intelligible form indicates that they will not exercise that ability either voluntarily or on compulsion. The power is most likely to be exercised in relation to individuals who are the subject of investigation and responsible for protecting information that the authorities have obtained lawfully and believe to be evidence of unlawful conduct or relevant material to the investigation.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000044"></a>Once the provisions are in force, it will be an offence knowingly to fail to comply with a disclosure requirement, with a maximum penalty of five years&#146; imprisonment in national security cases or two years in other cases. We have consulted on whether that five-year penalty should be available in cases relating to possession of indecent images of children. I should report to the Committee that there is support for that, which would require amendment of the primary legislation. We will consider taking that step after assessing how well the provisions are used.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000045"></a>When this legislation was debated in Parliament, much concern was expressed that it would criminalise people with poor memories or would reverse the burden of proof in the case of those who claimed to have forgotten or lost keys to their data. The code makes it very clear that, where a person claims not to have had a key to the data, the prosecution must prove the contrary beyond reasonable doubt. If a person claims that they no longer have a key or do not know a key to the data, the prosecution must prove the contrary beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000046"></a>In direct response to concern expressed in public consultation that technical expertise is required to understand and apply this legislation appropriately, the code of practice makes it clear that no public authority may serve on any person a Part 3 notice without the prior written approval of NTAC. In this way, NTAC will have the crucial role of ensuring that  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the provisions are used appropriately, expertly and with the highest regard for compliance with the requirements and principles of the Act and the code. NTAC will also help to assure the various oversight commissioners of that.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000047"></a>Recognising the critical importance of the integrity of information security in the financial services sector, and in response to the concerns expressed by Parliament and the public, the code makes it clear that no requirement to disclose a key to protected information should be imposed on any company or firm authorised by the Financial Services Authority without prior notification to the chief executive of the authority or a person designated by him for that purpose.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000048"></a>Finally, as an additional safeguard against abuse, both these codes of practice make it clear that, if an oversight commissioner establishes that an individual has been adversely affected by any wilful or reckless failure by any person within a public authority to comply with the Act, the commissioner shall, subject to the need to safeguard national security, inform the affected individual of the existence of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which considers complaints about unauthorised or inappropriate conduct and should enable that person effectively to engage the tribunal.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000049"></a>Subject to Parliament&#146;s approval, both codes and the provisions of Part 3 will commence on 1 October. Arrangements for delivering briefings to practitioners and other interested parties on the detail of the new provisions and the codes are being planned.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000050"></a>The primary responsibility for any democratic state is to protect its citizens, whether from the threats posed to us all by terrorism or from the threats posed to our most vulnerable citizens by sexual predators. It is right that in so doing the Government strike the right balance between the rights of communities and those of individuals. The guidance in both codes of practice does just that. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07071763000051"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Investigation of Protected Electronic Information: Code of Practice) Order 2007. <I>19th report from the Statutory Instruments Committee</I>.&#151;(<I>Lord Bassam of Brighton</I>.)</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000053"></a>In the second order the controls on public authorities to ensure that the use of the powers is undertaken appropriately and in compliance with the requirements and principles of Part 3 and the code of practice are, again, reassuring. I am grateful to the Minister for recognising the question of the burden of proof, on which we are reassured. We have no objections to either order.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07071763000054"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07071763000158"></a>Lord Dholakia:</b> I thank the Minister for his detailed explanation of the safeguards included in this provision. I have five areas of concern.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000055"></a>First, there is the secrecy requirement. Paragraph 10.8 of the code of practice details the possible provision mandating that the person to whom a Section 49 notice is delivered keeps the existence of the notice secret. The enactment of such a secrecy provision, in combination with the fact that an individual may be ordered to disclose encryption keys to which he has access with a business or personal associate, means that authorities might be able to encrypt an individual&#146;s information without their knowledge.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000056"></a>Secondly, paragraph 3.19 notes that encryption key material can be retained in the memory of an individual. The Minister explained at some length how the provision would work. Paragraph 10.5 states that if an individual provides evidence to the effect that he or she does not have possession of the key, the burden is on the prosecutor to prove the contrary beyond reasonable doubt, but it is unclear how that would work in the case of memorised passwords.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000057"></a>Thirdly, the sentencing guidelines seem to provide some bizarre incentives. Paragraph 10.2 lays out the penalties for failure to comply with an order: a maximum of two years&#146; imprisonment in most cases, rising to five years in national security cases. However, if an individual were in possession of an encryption key that would reveal their involvement in, say, a terrorist plot or other crimes such as child pornography, they would get off far easier by refusing to give the key and going to prison for non-compliance than they would by revealing the evidence of their other crimes.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000058"></a>Fourthly, the penalties for the abuse of power under Part 3 of RIPA need to be laid out. At present, only failure to protect disclosed information is covered, but there is a danger that public authorities will misuse their investigative power, and that remains unaddressed.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000059"></a>Finally, no mention is made of the need to protect the confidentiality of financial services. I refer to paragraphs 6.8 to 6.9. There are concerns that, if a bank is required to disclose keys that enable investigators to track the flow of money into and out of suspect bank accounts, the same data could be used to monitor other accounts. It would be helpful if the Minister could give his observations on the five points I have raised.</p>

<p><a name="07071763000060"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07071763000159"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to both noble Lords, particularly the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, for his helpful observations. We have had fairly widespread support for both orders, and from wider than the usual suspects. We have had very welcome support from Liberty, which now thinks it wise to implement these powers and that they are actually quite helpful in the protections that they offer for the benefit of people who may be affected. This broad welcome was reflected in noble Lords&#146; comments today.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000061"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, understandably sought reassurance on points relating to the second  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC8"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC8</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>order. I am not sure that I shall be able to answer all his questions this afternoon&#151;</p>

<p><a name="07071763000062"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07071763000160"></a>Lord Dholakia:</b> I appreciate that there are some detailed points. It might be better, as this matter will come to the main Chamber, if in the mean time the Minister wrote to me with some details. That would help me.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000064"></a>The noble Lord asked how the powers would operate with regard to a memorised key. In reality, it would not work that way, as even hardened paedophiles write down their passwords. They suffer from the same memory problems as all of us.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70717-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000065"></a>The noble Lord made the point that an offender could take a two-year penalty rather than a longer one for disclosing information. I recognised that in my comments, but we shall have to see how this  works in practice. If there is a problem, we will  more than happily reflect on it and, if we have to, bring it back&#151;in that case I am sure that we would want to amend the legislation to make it more effective.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000066"></a>We can give the assurance that confidentiality is an issue for us and, where it is right, it must be respected. That is how we should operate.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000067"></a>I shall reflect some more on at least one of the noble Lord&#146;s other two points and write to him. With regard to bank keys, to restate the obvious, the point is to acquire data in an intelligible form, not the keys themselves. The financial services are expected to disclose intelligible data, not the keys, and the Financial Services Authority has to agree before that will happen. I made that clear in my opening comments, but I shall reiterate it because it probably answers the noble Lord&#146;s point.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000068"></a>I hope that the orders find favour with the Committee.</p>

<h5><a name="07071763000149"></a>3.59 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07071763000073"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07071763000163"></a>Lord Rooker</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Terrorism (Northern Ireland) Act 2006 (Transitional Provisions and Savings) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000074"></a>The noble Lord said: On 1 August 2005, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced a programme of security normalisation, including the repeal of all counterterrorist legislation particular to Northern Ireland by 31 July 2007, subject to an enabling environment. As is well known, the security situation in Northern Ireland is markedly different from that of a few years ago. The normalisation programme is on target and in its final stages. Bessbrook Mill military base, in south Armagh, was vacated by troops as recently as 25 June. This is the second consecutive year when troops were not needed on the streets of Belfast on 12 July. In this context, the time is right to repeal Part VII of the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000075"></a>However, it is sensible to put in place some transitional and saving provisions to ensure an effective and smooth change from one regime to another. There are some transitional provisions in Section 113 of the 2000 Act, but these are temporary and will expire on 31 July 2007 without this order. We also think that these provisions are not sufficient by themselves to deal properly with these important issues; the more detailed provision in this orders are believed necessary. It may help if I explain some of the main elements of the order and why they are believed to be necessary.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000076"></a>The order preserves the arrangements for scheduled bail in respect of defendants who are granted bail for a scheduled offence under Section 67 of the Terrorism Act 2000 on or before 31 July. This will ensure that a defendant will still be under a continuing duty to surrender to the custody of the court and comply with any bail conditions. It will also ensure that the provisions relating to absconding and the power to arrest without warrant for breach of bail conditions will continue to apply.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000077"></a>The order preserves the existing transitional provisions in the 2000 Act relating to Diplock trials in progress. If the indictment has been presented in a case&#151;this normally happens a day or two before the defendant enters his plea at the arraignment hearing&#151;the trial can continue under the Diplock arrangements. Without this, double jeopardy rules could apply, potentially preventing any conviction at all of an individual. The order maintains the unfettered right of appeal from a Diplock court, where it is not necessary to seek leave to appeal first. This means that individuals convicted by a Diplock court will still benefit from this provision, even if they lodge their appeal after the repeal of Part VII. That is an important safeguard.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000078"></a>The order also preserves police and military powers in relation to operations which may be in progress at  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC10"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC10</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the end of 31 July 2007. For example, if a search is in progress when Part VII is repealed, the police will be able to continue that search until it is completed. If evidence has been seized under Part VII, it can be kept to support any prosecution. The order preserves obligations on the police and military to make records of actions taken under Part VII. The compensation scheme is also preserved, so that claims relating to things done up to the end of 31 July 2007 can be made and compensation paid. The order enables the Independent Assessor of Military Complaints Procedures to make a final report covering the period up to the end of 31 July 2007. The military will remain under a duty to provide him with information necessary for his reports. Sections 107 to 111 of the 2000 Act can continue to apply in respect of Diplock trials in progress or individuals convicted before 31 July 2007.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000079"></a>Finally, the order makes savings for physical security measures in Northern Ireland, road closures and land requisitions. An audit has been conducted so that only those that are necessary on security grounds will remain, and those that are retained will be kept under review. Several security measures have been able to be removed. Much of the land requisitioned for Crossmaglen police station has been handed back to the landowners, Shore Road at Ballykinler army base has been opened, and there are plans to open lower Chichester Street, in front of the Royal Courts of Justice, to buses.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000080"></a>We are all looking forward to the day when there will be no need for barriers between the communities, and physical security measures will be authorised only as a last resort, where it is necessary to protect life and property. I am sure that the political leadership shown by the Executive is bringing that closer each day.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000081"></a>Each measure will be examined individually and fresh authorisations made for any that need to remain. This will be done on the basis of new security advice from the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the new powers in the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007. This work will be done in the autumn and the measures kept under regular review thereafter. I am sure that noble Lords will agree, as elected colleagues in the other House did, that these transitional provisions and savings are both proportionate and necessary for the effective repeal of Part XII. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000084"></a>We recognise that the exceptional security situation in Northern Ireland still warrants the continuation of non-jury trials. During the passage of the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007, my party raised

Can the Minister tell us the position on that? Otherwise, we have no objections to the order.</p>

<p><a name="07071763000085"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07071763000165"></a>Lord Smith of Clifton:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for his elucidation of the order, which he did with characteristic aplomb. I also endorse what the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, has said. It is clearly necessary to have transitional provisions. All dates are arbitrary; there is nothing special about the end of July. I echo the words of the noble Viscount: it is very good news that we are at this stage, which signals yet a further step towards the normalisation of life in Northern Ireland. We support the order.</p>

<p><a name="07071763000086"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07071763000166"></a>Lord Maginnis of Drumglass:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for the clarity with which he has brought the order before us. Along with other noble Lords, I welcome the order in so far as it is further evidence of a move towards normalisation in Northern Ireland. I choose my words wisely when I talk about a move towards normalisation. The Minister and other noble Lords who know Northern Ireland will understand that a threat, albeit at a very low level, still remains from dissidents, probably within both traditions. Many areas of normalisation have still to be completed, not least loyalist decommissioning. I am not up to date and do not know the extent to which the Real IRA and Continuity IRA are able to increase their current level of activity.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000087"></a>One carry-over from terrorism in Northern Ireland is the extent to which organised criminality exists and to which organised criminals are still able to dominate certain areas. There is always a problem in bringing a big player within the criminal world before a jury trial; there is always the possibility of intimidation of juries.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000088"></a>I hope that the normal&#151;if I can call it that&#151;law to which we are all subject will be implemented speedily, not something we are not used to in Northern Ireland, where the law moves so slowly that its effect is not properly felt or appreciated. The ordinary, law-abiding citizen may see something wrong happening today but the process ends somewhere in the distant future. If we are going to discourage those who may be tempted to continue to disrupt the life of ordinary people in Northern Ireland, then, together with normalisation, the law that serves our community must be implemented much more speedily. I hope the Minister can give an assurance on that.</p>

It gives me an opportunity to place on record my sincere belief that the terrorist situation in Northern Ireland has indeed changed. It is both fitting and proper that provisions that were once necessary to combat terrorism and the onslaught of violence in my province should be amended and brought into line with those in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

We need legislation that is fit for purpose in dealing with the renewed international threat that we now face, and I believe that the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007 and this order will do just that.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000093"></a>I was encouraged yesterday, following a meeting at Stormont of the British-Irish Council, by a statement made by the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness. He commented on a recent dissident republican attack on Strabane PSNI station and likened the terrorists involved to those estranged Japanese fighters who continued their struggle for 15 years after the end of the Second World War, not realising that the war was over. I welcome the statement that the war in Northern Ireland is, I hope, over. However, following the removal of the Army presence in south Armagh, there has appeared to be an upturn in sectarian violence in that region, with Orange halls attacked and so on. But while it appears that the threat from dissident republicans remains genuine, there has to be wide acceptance of the emerging optimism that has gripped Northern Ireland and the hopes for a stable, peaceful future for my province. There is optimism that we are coming to the end of this period of violence.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000094"></a>That said, the attacks on Glasgow airport show just how the threat from extremists is easily transferable. As a nation, right across our regions we must be up to the task of thwarting those who seek to cause maximum disruption, mayhem and misery. I hope that the experiences of Northern Ireland will help to shape the provisions necessary to deal with such risks and that the legislative provisions that were once necessary to combat local threats will be used equally and appropriately to deal with those who seek to disrupt the way of life that we enjoy and wish to preserve here in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000095"></a>On a more localised front, I welcome the removal of barriers, particularly in Belfast, where the economy, I am glad to say, is growing. The removal of the barrier at the end of Chichester Street, in particular, which will open the thoroughfare to the Laganside development, where many things are happening, will be beneficial to the economy of Northern Ireland. I welcome the order. I hope that we will not need any such orders in the years to come and that we will have a peaceful, democratic society.</p>

I am deeply grateful for that. I am grateful also to the noble Lord, Lord Smith.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000097"></a>I was asked a couple of specific questions which I shall do my best to answer. The noble Viscount asked how many cases were ongoing. As we speak&#151;the new situation will be triggered at the end of the month, so I do not know how long these cases will last&#151;26 Diplock cases are ongoing, involving 53 defendants. As the figures show, there has been a massive drop in the number of Diplock cases in recent years. There were only 61 in 2006, 49 in 2005 and 65 in 2004, involving some 90, 91 and 77 defendants respectively, which is about par for the course. I do not know how many of those will be ongoing when the new situation is triggered.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000098"></a>The Act that replaced the Diplock courts with the powers of the Director of Public Prosecutions provided for the DPP to take the decision for a non-jury trial. We debated the matter at some length. I understand that my noble and learned friend the former Attorney-General dealt with a good deal of it. We explained that we thought that the decision should be with the DPP because it would be based largely on sensitive material. Time will tell whether we have got it right, but I understand that there are no outstanding issues in terms of the legislation. Therefore, we will see how the replacement courts progress.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000099"></a>It is true that there are dissident republicans, as the noble Lords, Lord Smith, Lord Maginnis and Lord Browne, said. They are unquestionably isolated in number but nevertheless a threat to the security situation. We believe that the Police Service of Northern Ireland is more than up to coping with the threat. People can always do more. In this case, as I have said on other occasions, I hope that if everyone can come to the table and walk away with a gain, however great or small, it can be seen that that is the way to operate. That is the reason why not only the war is over but the peace is well on the way. There is no question that the economy is booming, although there are substantial changes to make to it.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000100"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, said, the police service has to be on the case with organised criminals; we must not allow vacuums to arise in our communities. I wholly agree with him about the speed of implementation of the law but with one caveat: it is now July 2007; noble Lords should think where we were when I was in this Room in July 2005, having just gone to Northern Ireland&#151;that is about four pieces of primary legislation ago and more orders than I care to remember. We were optimistic but mindful of the territory we were in. Therefore, I ask noble Lords to judge the situation. We are now in July; by spring and summer of next year, we will have a better idea. But slow law is bad law, and people will not respect it; the noble Lord is quite right on that. I am sure that the authorities will do everything they can, because it is in their interests to bring about a normal civic society in Northern Ireland&#151;if we call everything in England, Wales and Scotland normal for most of us&#151;where the rules of law are followed.

<h3 align="center"><a name="07071763000006"></a>Regulatory Reform (Deer) (England and Wales) Order 2007</h3>
<h5><a name="07071763000150"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07071763000104"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0002.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07071763000172"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Rooker)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Regulatory Reform (Deer) (England and Wales) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000105"></a>The noble Lord said: This draft order will amend the Deer Act to improve the management and welfare of deer. The deer population has increased significantly, doubling in size over the past 25 years, we believe. The population rises have resulted in increased conflict with conservation, agriculture and other human activities. This order will help those who need to manage wild deer to do so in a proportionate manner, while maintaining appropriate welfare safeguards.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000106"></a>I am always wary of saying this when one has not been deeply involved in a matter, but the words on the brief in front of me are as follows: I understand that the draft order is not controversial&#151;I sincerely hope that that is the case&#151;and that it has been welcomed by deer stalkers, managers, land owners, conservation agencies and those concerned with the welfare of our wild deer.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000107"></a>Full and proper consultation on this draft order was carried out in 2006. Respondents strongly supported the proposals that will facilitate improved management of the wild deer populations. There was also overwhelming support for the proposals that will enhance the welfare of deer. I remind noble Lords that the draft order applies to England and Wales only and that consent of Welsh Ministers has been obtained for it.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000108"></a>The order will facilitate improved management of deer by increasing the range of tools available to those responsible for managing wild deer populations and reducing associated burdens. I will briefly remind noble Lords of the key changes made by the draft order. It will make it permissible to use .22 centre-fire rifles for shooting the non-native muntjac and Chinese water deer; it will introduce licensing provisions for the killing or taking of deer during the close season to prevent deterioration of the natural heritage or to preserve public health and safety; it will introduce licensing provisions for the killing or taking of deer at night to prevent deterioration of the natural heritage, to preserve public health and safety or to prevent serious damage to property; it will shorten the close season for all female deer to allow  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC15"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC15</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>better management of population levels by moving the commencement date to 1 April; and it will amend the meaning of &#147;mechanically propelled vehicle&#148; in the Deer Act to permit the shooting of deer, provided that the vehicle is stationary and the engine is switched off. This will provide a stable platform.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000109"></a>Alongside these changes to deer management, the order will also enhance the welfare of deer by removing restrictions on the mercy killing of sick and injured deer by allowing any reasonable means of humanely dispatching deer that are suffering due to illness or disease; allowing dependent deer to be taken or killed if they have been, or are about to be, deprived of their mother at any time of the year; and introducing a close season for Chinese water deer and hybrid species from 1 April to 31 October inclusive.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000110"></a>The amendments in the order will have a positive impact on the management of deer through the provision of an increased range of tools for those involved in the management of these species. The order will increase the time available to managers to carry out their work by shortening the close season. The introduction of licensed control will provide an opportunity for deer managers to mitigate the problems caused by deer when other methods have been shown to be ineffective.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000111"></a>The order also provides positive benefits for the welfare of deer through allowing quicker alleviation of suffering where they are found injured. It will align the protection afforded to female deer through the introduction of a close season for Chinese water deer and red hybrids. The draft order will ensure that necessary protection will remain. Licences to kill deer during the close season will be issued only if there is no other satisfactory solution and the control will not affect the conservation status of native deer.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000112"></a>I said at the beginning that the wild deer population had probably doubled in the past 25 years. We are not exactly clear, but I have figures that show there are about 1 million now, a very large number. The order is not designed to wipe them out&#151;far from it; no one wants to do that&#151;it is to improve the management of the wild deer population. Those who manage them do a good job on behalf of society and the conservation of wildlife, but they need the tools to do it given the circumstances they are now working under, which are not the same as when the Deer Act was passed. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0002.htm_para37"></a>

<p><a name="07071763000115"></a>I want to put on record my thanks to the Minister. This time last week, when he was taking through the animal welfare order and I could not be here because  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC16"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it was my grandson&#146;s speech day, he was very generous in his comments following the announcement of my retirement from the Front Bench. I thank him most warmly. It is nearly 10 years since I took the first of many Bills through the House; it set up the Food Standards Agency. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, then the MAFF Minister, met me and said, &#147;And how are you doing with this particular one?&#148;, to which I said, &#147;It&#146;s the first one I&#146;ve taken through on my own&#148;. What the noble Lord brings to the House, as he did to the other House, is that he tries to help those who are on Benches opposite to him to succeed in getting legislation through in the proper manner.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000116"></a>The order, interestingly enough, has been laid under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. Only last Session the House debated at great length the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, which gave the Government enormous powers to amend primary legislation by secondary legislation. I find it surprising that, so far as I am aware, no order has yet been moved under that Act. Why are we still moving orders under the 2001 Act? That seems very strange.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000117"></a>I thank the Minister for acknowledging that Defra reconsidered the close season. It was originally proposed by the specialists that it should be shortened by four weeks, but at that stage Defra was recommending only two weeks. I am grateful to the department for accepting the longer period. As the Minister has said, the deer population is rapidly on the increase, and anything that helps to reduce the number without causing suffering seems to make great sense.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000118"></a>The crux of the legislation as it stands is to protect the health of the deer and of humans, conserving natural heritage and trying to prevent damage to property. When we took the CROW Act through in 2000, some 28 days had been set aside for the management of wildlife. We need to ensure&#151;and the House of Commons Regulatory Reform Committee has picked up on this&#151;that good warning is given to people that night-time culling will be happening on a particular section of property at a particular time. My fear at the time was that people do not always listen  to advice about what will be happening and consequently could be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I am sure the department has taken that on board, and I am grateful to it for that.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000119"></a>As we know, there are no real natural predators. The estimated damage caused by road accidents is  &#163;41 million to &#163;181 million a year. That is a huge cost, which is not commonly known.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000120"></a>On the estimated costs, based on 60 applications a year, if broken down that might work out at around &#163;5,000 covering costs for each licence. Does the department control those costs when they come in or will that be for Natural England? The Minister will be acutely aware of an issue that I have raised consistently, on the IPPC charges for pigs and poultry. Those charges are set by the Environment Agency, and I do not think that the department has any control over them, but the amounts and hourly rates set do not seem to be reviewed in any meaningful way. Will the Minister touch on that?</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000121"></a>Disease is one of the reasons culling is allowed. Some deer may be infected with bovine TB, and I was not sure from reading the paperwork that I received whether that was considered.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000122"></a>On the subject of bovine TB, I place on record my dismay at the overnight news that Shambo the Hindu cow is being reprieved. It is not that I have anything against it, but it is an infected cow carrying infective diseases. It seems extraordinary, as it must to the many farmers who farm close by, that one known disease-carrying cow is being permitted to live when 28,000 to 30,000 cows troubled with bovine TB are killed annually. Can the department raise this matter again or is that the end of the matter, now that the judge has given his judgment? One could say that, because this is happening in Wales, it is a devolved matter, but the judge was sitting in the High Court; therefore, I presume that it was a UK judgment, but I am not clear on that.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000123"></a>I thank the Minister for introducing this measure as he did and for the work that has gone into it. Basically, we need to be able to control the deer population in the most humane way possible. I am pleased to see that one is allowed to use a vehicle when shooting deer but that it must be stationary at the time.</p>

<p><a name="07071763000124"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071763000174"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> I welcome this important order. I am glad of this opportunity to pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. She and I have worked on the Defra brief for almost the same length of time. Perhaps the most memorable occasion that we shared was when we sat through the night and worked together on the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill. We very often did not work on things completely together, because there were many occasions when we could not vote on the same side; however, the triumph that emerged from our working together on that Bill was with Part 3, which will probably remain in my mind as one of our biggest joint successes in this Chamber.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000125"></a>Probably nobody will equal the noble Baroness&#146;s ability, for which she has been noted, to fire off questions to Ministers. As was recorded in <I>Hansard</I> not long ago, she is known as &#147;Mrs UK Agriculture&#148;. I am sure that she will be able to retire with great honour and with that title well in place.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000126"></a>I have a few questions for the Minister on the order. First, as he said, there has been a significant increase&#151;a doubling&#151;in the deer population in the past 20 years. One significant outcome of that, which has not been mentioned at all so far this afternoon, is the incidence of Lyme disease. Julia Goldsworthy, my colleague in another place, has put a number of Questions to the Department of Health and Defra on this issue. This order covers public health aspects. The question is very serious; I wonder whether the Minister has any comments on it. I presume that Lyme disease is covered by the reference to preserving public health. Is the department making any analysis, with the Department of Health or separately, of the incidence of Lyme disease and how exactly it relates to the density of deer?</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC18"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000127"></a>My second question relates to conserving the national heritage, in terms of interpretation and especially given the different pressures on areas that may have had stock removed following CAP reform but which need grazing and are subject to deer grazing, as opposed to new tree growth. Those are areas of potential conflict. I presume that the Minister will tell me that Natural England will decide the priorities there, but is there actually a definition of natural heritage? Will it be a grazed landscape or a treed landscape, and so on?</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000128"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, raised the issue of bovine TB, so I shall await the Minister&#146;s answers on that.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000129"></a>Finally, on the matter of serious damage to property, presumably with regard to deer that means damage to crops. What would constitute serious damage? Would it be 10 per cent of the crop or more than that? Is that being considered by Defra?</p>

<p><a name="07071763000130"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07071763000175"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I am most grateful to the noble Baronesses, and in particular the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. As I said last week, she has brought elegance and charm to the Front Bench, which I suspect her successor will not be able to do. That is a very sexist remark for which I make no apology.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000131"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned the cost attributed to road accidents, which is a very serious issue. I have been astonished to see the range of figures; there seems to be a minimum of &#163;14 million. I freely admit, as I told officials this morning, that occasionally I see the signs warning drivers to beware deer, but I pay very little attention because I do not expect any deer to come out on the road. However, they clearly do, and the accidents are very serious. I understand that work is taking place to look at signage around the country, because there is a cost in all kinds of ways, as one can imagine.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000132"></a>There must be good warning of night-time culling so that there is no confusion among people about what is happening in their locality.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000133"></a>On the noble Baroness&#146;s first point, the process brought about by the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, inside government, is incredibly lengthy. It takes the best part of two to three years to put a reform order through the Whitehall and parliamentary process, and I suspect that, as it started that way under the 2001 Act, that is how it would complete. The Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 came into effect in January 2007. The process of this order was well under way, and consultation and everything else under the rules that applied then had started. It came into Parliament in December 2006, so that is why it is covered.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000134"></a>The costs for licences are high. Night-time licences require site visits and follow-up for safety. At this time there are no plans from Natural England to charge applicants, but I have no better information on that. One thing for sure is that, if and when charges are made for licences, they will be purely for cost recovery. It will not be allowed to be used for an income generator&#151;nor is the Environment Agency supposed to be using it as income generator, although people have different views about that from time to time.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC19"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000135"></a>In what I thought was an incredibly unfair question, the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, raised the issue of bovine TB. I have not come equipped with the answer but, as everyone knows, Ministers are considering the report on the matter by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle. In addition, a Question to Defra will be asked in your Lordships&#146; House next week. The Government&#146;s own scientists&#151;that is, the scientists in Defra and the government chief scientists across Whitehall&#151;are assessing the scientific aspects of the report. It went beyond some of the science, but I am not in a position to say anything about it.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000136"></a>Shambo is currently a matter exclusively for the Welsh Assembly. I understand that the Assembly will appeal the decision, but there is no question but that it comes under Welsh jurisdiction. Defra is not involved, but the idea that we are not interested does not stand up. Simply, the case concerns a disease in an animal that in general is used for food production, and this is a matter of controlling disease in food production animals. Whether or not the animal goes into the food chain does not really matter. One might argue about the scientific report that we have just had from Professor Bourne&#146;s group, which was set up 10 years ago, and about what it found out. Ten years ago, Ministers were told, &#147;Do this trial and you will find out the transmission route of TB, cattle to cattle and badger to badger&#148;, but we do not know what the route is, and the report does not tell us. Frankly, how much the judge in Wales read into that, we do not know.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000137"></a>The cow was diagnosed as having TB on the basis of one test. Everyone knows that the test is not perfect, but it does not matter whether it is an isolated case; the fact is that scientists cannot tell Ministers the transmission route of the disease. If you know that the disease is there but you do not know the transmission route, it is fairly obvious that you have to take a certain course of action. However, the matter will go to appeal; therefore, I have probably said more than I should have done. I am not in a position to criticise judges; Ministers should never do that. Public health, public safety, animal health and animal safety are our responsibility. However, I understand that the Welsh Assembly is appealing the issue.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071763000138"></a>With regard to Lyme disease, ticks are thought to be the most significant vectors of human and livestock diseases in the UK. Many reports suggest that ticks have become more abundant recently, coinciding with increased densities of deer. We are not currently funding research specifically into Lyme disease but we are funding one project at Oxford University&#151;reference SE 4105&#151;that is taking a broader look at tick-borne zoonosis in deer. The project will define how the UK tick fauna has changed and how it may change in the future under the influence of changing environmental factors, including climate, land use and the host&#151;that is, the availability of deer&#151;taking the following progressive steps.

<p><a name="07071763000140"></a>Natural England already assesses serious damage to the environment under other legislation. A loss of &#163;100,000 to a large enterprise may not be considered serious but, to a small holding, naturally it would be very large, so one has to look at the present circumstances. Natural England advisers will assist landowners in identifying methods of alleviating the damage.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="07071795000001"></a>Companies Act 2006 (Commencement  No. 3, Consequential Amendments, Transitional Provisions and Savings) Order 2007</h3>
<h5><a name="07071795000065"></a>4.56 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07071795000003"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07071795000067"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that  it has considered the Companies Act 2006 (Commencement No. 3, Consequential Amendments, Transitional Provisions and Savings) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000004"></a>The noble Lord said: The Companies Act 2006 will bring major benefits to business by modernising and simplifying company law. This commencement order represents an important milestone in its implementation. It will commence some of the key provisions of the Act, including those relating to part of the statutory statement of directors&#146; general duties, derivative claims and proceedings, the business review, and resolutions and meetings.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000005"></a>Provisions being commenced by the order will play a major part in meeting two of our key objectives for the Act: ensuring better regulation and a &#147;think small first&#148; approach, and enhancing shareholder engagement and a long-term investment culture.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC21"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC21</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000006"></a>Let me first look at our aim of better regulation. The provisions in Part 13 on resolutions and meetings will deliver some of the most important benefits for business in the Act. In particular, they will simplify decision-making for private companies by making it easier for decisions to be taken by written resolution and by making annual general meetings opt-in rather than opt-out through the abolition of statutory AGMs for private companies.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000007"></a>Other parts being commenced on 1 October 2007 will deliver deregulatory benefits for business. It will, for example, be possible for holding companies to seek authorisation of political donations and expenditure in respect of the holding company and one or more subsidiaries through a single approval resolution. Companies will be permitted to make loans to directors, subject to member authorisation.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000008"></a>The other objective at the heart of the provisions to be commenced by the order relates to effective shareholder participation and a long-term investment culture. We believe that it is vital that there is a good understanding and effective engagement between those who own companies and those who run them on their behalf. The Act will therefore provide better guidance for directors on their duties and responsibilities and make it easier for shareholders, including investors who hold indirectly through nominees, to exercise their rights of ownership. It is essential for this country&#146;s long-term prosperity that company decisions are based on the longer-term view and not only the medium term.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000009"></a>The length and complexity of the 2006 Act and its phased implementation have resulted in an order which is itself long and complex. I should make it clear that the Government decided to implement the Act in stages so that companies could take advantage of some of the deregulatory benefits as soon as possible. I apologise to noble Lords, especially members of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, that it was necessary to take up and re-lay the order. In view of its complexity, it may help if I briefly outline its structure.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000010"></a>Schedule 1 contains transitional adaptations of the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 brought into force by this order, which are needed because the order brings only some of the provisions of the Act into force. Schedule 2 brings some of the repeals in the Act into force. Schedule 3 makes traditional provisions and savings. Schedules 4 and 5 make consequential amendments and repeals. The transitional provisions are essential to ensure that the Act operates in a reasonable way for existing companies and for ongoing activities or arrangements in which they might be involved around the time of commencement.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000011"></a>One of the key areas of interest in respect of transitionals has been that relating to derivative claims and proceedings in Part 11 of the 2006 Act. These are claims and proceedings brought by shareholders of a company, on behalf of the company, against its directors. Under the transitional provisions, the new derivative procedures must be used for all claims started on or after 1 October 2007, but the courts must ensure that the outcome of any

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000012"></a>The Companies Act 2006 is, by any standards, major legislation of great importance to corporate life in this country. The order will, as I have said, deliver some of the key benefits introduced by the Act. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000013"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Companies Act 2006 (Commencement No. 3, Consequential Amendments, Transitional Provisions and Savings) Order 2007. <I>23rd report from the Statutory Instruments Committee</I>.&#151;(<I>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="07071795000014"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07071795000068"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the order. I declare interests as a shareholder and a director of companies.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000015"></a>While it is not controversial, the order is complicated, as the Minister said, and I have some concerns about the ability of lay people who run companies to interpret it without expensive legal advice. I suspect that the problem has been exacerbated by the Government&#146;s decision to activate the Act in stages, some but not all of which is due to causes outside their control. The consequence is a very complicated order. With the benefit of hindsight, would the Minister ideally have done it like this? I ask this in the hope that he can use the experience from the No. 3 order to the benefit of everyone when bringing forward the No. 4 order. He might also let us know when that one is coming.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000016"></a>It is perhaps unfortunate that the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, is not here today to speak to the order. I think I am right in saying that the position of the CBI when he was its director-general&#151;particularly, for example, on Section 172, which deals with the duty of directors to promote the success of the company&#151;was directly contrary to that of the Government. Many noble Lords would benefit from his explanation of how he has reconciled his personal position on this point.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000017"></a>Although I do not object to the order, which in many ways is a good piece of work, it is worth dwelling on one or two other points it deals with, resulting from an enormous Act introduced by a Government who, I observe, claim to be in favour of deregulation. I am talking, for instance, of Section 261, relating to derivative claims&#151;or class actions, as they are called in the United States. The Minister referred to that. Our principal concern was that this section might be used by malcontents to obtain publicity for their causes which did not genuinely have anything to do with a particular company.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000018"></a>An example might be where a group of activists pursued a company&#146;s directors under Section 172(1)(d) when the company was operating perfectly legitimately and in good faith in the Amazon basin, or some such place, on the basis that it was possible to imply that its actions somehow had an impact on the habitat of the aboriginals. During the progress of the Bill, the Government showed some worrying innocence about how sophisticated groups of campaigners used legislation like this, for instance, in the United States. It was only

<a name="70717-gc0003.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000019"></a>Nevertheless, it must be more than coincidence that the major US law firm Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld and Toll, which specialises in class actions, has recently set up a London office, publicly stating that it is lining up huge British-based class-action lawsuits. It would be helpful to hear from the Minister what action the Government intend to take if there is a flood of derivative claims, which could threaten Britain&#146;s attractiveness as a place to do business.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000020"></a>I have a question relating to investigations under Section 1035. What information gateways exist to permit information gathered in the course of an investigator&#146;s work to be passed on to other government departments and elsewhere? This section is not as clear as Section 948, which deals with the analogous point regarding investigations by the Takeover Panel, under which it became clear during the passage of the Bill that information might be&#151;and, apparently, is&#151;passed, for example, to takeover authorities in other EU countries where privacy standards are noticeably slacker than here. Our concerns focus on commercially sensitive information that companies legitimately conceal from their competitors, which from time to time comes into the possession of investigators. Is there a risk that such information might, for example, find its way into the hands of overseas authorities?</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000021"></a>My only other question is rather technical, for which I apologise. Am I right in thinking that, while Section 116(4), dealing with transitional arrangements relating to disclosures of the register of a company&#146;s members, is activated under the order, Section 811(4), which deals with the almost exactly analogous provisions relating to disclosures of the register of interests, is not? I may be wrong; if so, I apologise. If not, should not the two sections have been synchronised, and is there a genuine reason for this difference?</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000022"></a>Having said all that, the Companies Act has detained your Lordships quite long enough already, and despite the fact that not all the concerns expressed from these Benches have been wholly satisfied, I do not propose to detain the Committee further today.</p>

<p><a name="07071795000023"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071795000069"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> I thank the Minister for his explanation of this order. I was not involved in the Companies Bill as it passed through the House and, therefore, do not have the background that some other noble Lords here have. I know that it was a long process involving a great deal of time and knowledge. Even this order is 52 pages long and, as the Minister said, is rather complicated and includes important matters such as directors&#146; duties, annual general meetings, pre-emption rights and even political donations.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000024"></a>I note that the order requires a number of transitional adaptations. It seems unfortunate how the transitional arrangements for the implementation in stages of the major, complex changes in the Companies Act have worked out in practice for real businesses and business people, particularly directors,  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC24"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who wish to understand what is going on and how and when the provisions will apply. I would be interested to hear from the Minister how the new department is communicating the staged application of these very detailed regulations to the business community. How are otherwise very busy company secretaries, particularly in medium-size private businesses, to be kept in touch with these complex changes?</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000025"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked, how many more implementing orders are there likely to be, and when will they be made? Given that the business community has in many ways already adjusted to, and is ready for, the changes in the Companies Act, perhaps there is a need to get on with implementing it as a whole rather than this awkward, complicated and many-phased approach.</p>

<p><a name="07071795000026"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07071795000070"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I am grateful to the two noble Lords for their questions, which I shall attempt to answer. I was interested by the opening remarks of the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, about how lay people running companies will understand these provisions. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said that it was unfair that this was how they were going to be told what is happening. Companies are run by professional people who have professional advisers, whether they are lawyers or accountants. We had lengthy discussions on the Companies Bill and, with the other place, produced a major Act that was welcomed by the business community.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000027"></a>I was asked about the target date for implementation. It is our intention to commence all parts of the Act by October 2008. Both noble Lords asked why the Act was introduced in stages rather than in one fell swoop. The commencement timetable seeks to strike a balance between early introductions of benefits for business, such as those on resolutions and meetings, and the need for companies, their legal advisers, auditors and accountants to familiarise themselves with its provisions and make proper preparation for full implementation. We also wish to ensure that we implement EU company law requirements falling due during the implementation period, while implementing the Act in a way which minimises the number of changes for business.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000028"></a>I was asked when the department will lay the commencement orders for April 2008 and October 2008. We aim to make all secondary legislation, including commencement orders, or lay it in draft if parliamentary approval is required, by the end of this year.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, raised a number of interesting questions on derivative claims. Derivative claims are brought by a member or shareholders against a director on behalf of the company. If the action is successful, damages are paid to the company, not the individual member or members who brought the action. They are therefore not equivalent to an American class action.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000030"></a>I was asked whether, if we put derivative action on a statutory footing, it would lead to more claims against directors. It is important that there is greater clarity about how a shareholder may bring a  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC25"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>derivative action, but we do not believe that this will lead to a significant increase in the number of actions brought. Shareholders will still want to consider very carefully the case for bringing such actions.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000031"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, argued that derivative claims might be used by malcontents. This risk is anticipated by Sections 262 to 264 by requiring the permission of the court for a derivative action. Permission must be refused if a person acting in the interests of promoting the success of the company would not continue the claim.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000032"></a>A very interesting point was raised on investigations, but the answer is long and complicated and we will have to write to noble Lords on that. We will also put a copy in the Library.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000033"></a>I was asked why we have commenced only Sections 116 to 119 and not the rest of Part 8. We have been asked to implement as soon as possible the safeguards for companies&#146; members which these sections provide. In so far as the remainder of this part involves changes to the law, we consider that those affected should have more time to adapt their procedures.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000034"></a>Why is Section 811(4) not being commenced yet? The rest of Section 811 was commenced in January this year; subsection (4), however, must await the commencement of other provisions relating to the inspection of information held by companies, which will be covered by the fourth commencement order we will table.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000035"></a>I hope that I have answered all noble Lords&#146; questions.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000038"></a>The noble Lord said: This order is made under Sections 30(3) and 63 of the Scotland Act. It was laid before both the UK and Scottish Parliaments on  20 June. Section 63 of the Scotland Act allows for the transfer to Scottish Executive Ministers of functions that are exercisable in or as regards Scotland. This is commonly known as executive devolution.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000039"></a>Since 1999, 14 orders have been made under Section 63 of the Scotland Act. These orders demonstrate the Government&#146;s pragmatic approach to the devolution settlement and the flexibility contained in the Scotland Act. In certain circumstances, there will be a case for functions to be exercised by the Scottish Executive Ministers where the subject matter remains the responsibility of this Parliament. Each case is examined on its merits to ensure that functions are exercised at the appropriate level.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000040"></a>In 2000, this Parliament passed the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, otherwise known as RIPA, which governs the use of surveillance and information-gathering to help prevent crime. The 2000 Act   


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC26"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sets out a series of safeguards and procedures for the use of covert surveillance and the interception  of communications. While the interception of communications remains a reserved matter, in Scotland the issuing of warrants to authorise the interception of communications under RIPA was devolved to the Scottish Executive Ministers in 2000. These functions were transferred to the Scottish Executive Ministers by way of an order made under Section 63 of the Scotland Act.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000041"></a>A further order was made in 2003, which executively devolved the power to issue warrants in accordance with international mutual assistance agreements under the 2000 Act. Under RIPA, warrants may be issued to enable UK law enforcement agencies to seek assistance from other agencies in Europe with the interception of telecommunications outside the UK.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000042"></a>Since the order was made in 2003&#151;this is the point of the order&#151;two new agencies have become operational: the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency and the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The order before us will allow the Scottish Executive Ministers to issue warrants to the new agencies in accordance with international mutual assistance agreements under the 2000 Act.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000043"></a>The effect of the order will be that the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency and the Serious Organised Crime Agency will be able to apply directly to the Scottish Executive Ministers for interception warrants, just as other law enforcement agencies in Scotland can.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000044"></a>On a technical note, to facilitate the transfer of functions under Section 63 of the Scotland Act, it is necessary to specify which functions of the 2000 Act are exercisable in or as regards Scotland. Section 30(3) of the Scotland Act provides that Her Majesty may by Order in Council specify which functions are to be treated as exercisable in or as regards Scotland. The order will specify the aforementioned functions as being exercisable in or as regards Scotland so that they may be transferred to the Scottish Executive Ministers.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000045"></a>We believe that the order is a sensible use of the powers in the Scotland Act and the result is about the practical allocation of executive functions across  the United Kingdom. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07071795000048"></a>Some years ago I was a Minister and had to answer a debate on telephone tapping, with the late Robin Cook. We took our duties very seriously to make absolutely certain that correct procedures should be followed.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000049"></a>I note that the Home Secretary is entitled to set strategic priorities for the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Obviously, operational matters and strategic priorities have a relationship with each other. In dealing with the Scottish Executive on these matters, there should be clarity and goodwill as well as good working relations, with the stress on best practice. Everybody has a common interest in crime prevention. We hope that a meeting of minds will be possible between Her Majesty's Government and the Scottish Executive in the public interest.</p>

<p><a name="07071795000050"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07071795000073"></a>The Duke of Montrose:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister for explaining the elements that have gone into the drafting of this measure. At first sight, one wondered why it was necessary for the Government to introduce it. The Serious and Organised Crime Agency is a UK body concerned with the security of the whole of the United Kingdom. We are told that this measure is directed at any international mutual assistance agreement.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000051"></a>Paragraph (7)(2)(b) of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act makes it perfectly possible for a Scottish Minister to assist the UK Secretary of State in carrying out his duties. However, from what the Minister was saying, I think that the initiative for this activity will come from SOCA itself, and it will not be up to Scottish Ministers to take any primary initiative in the matter. I was concerned, if the primary initiative passed to Scottish Ministers, how the co-ordination would be carried out with the various UK bodies that operate in this field.</p>

<p><a name="07071795000052"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07071795000074"></a>Baroness Carnegy of Lour:</b> I have one question for the Minister. I am sure that there is a very simple answer but I should like to be clear about it. In Schedule 2 to the order, the restrictions on the enactment of Section 5 apply only for the purposes of,</p>
<ul><a name="07071795000063"></a>&#147;preventing or detecting serious crime&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071795000060"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="07071795000064"></a>&#147;in circumstances appearing to the Scottish Ministers to be equivalent to those&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071795000061"></a>which would apply in other circumstances. If it has  to appear right for Scottish Ministers, should it not also appear right for the relevant Minister with responsibility for crime? Surely the appearance must be thus on both sides of the fence. I hope that that question is clear.</p>

<p><a name="07071795000053"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07071795000075"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> Perhaps I may take a few moments to answer the question of the noble Lord, Lord Selkirk of Douglas, which was important. To reiterate, there are two reasons why this order is necessary: to include those two agencies. There is no hidden agenda or flexibility to include any other function.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000054"></a>The question is: what will Scottish Ministers be able to do or how will orders be issued? The order transfers functions under Section 5(1)(b) and (d) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 to Scottish Ministers in respect of serious crime in  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC28"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Scotland. The functions relating to the issuing of warrants in Scotland are transferred to the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency to authorise the making of requests for the interception of communications under international mutual assistance agreements and the disclosure of those intercepted communications. The purpose of the order is to allow the two organisations to apply to Scottish Ministers for warrants under Section 5(1) in the same way as other law enforcement agencies in Scotland can already do and to disclose the associated material under Section 5(1)(d). Certain related functions under Sections 9(1)(b), 9(3), 10(1)(a) and 10(2) of the 2000 Act are also transferred by this order so as to allow Scottish Ministers to renew, cancel or modify warrants issued to the directors-general of the two organisations. In addition, functions under Section 15(1) of the 2000 Act are transferred so as to allow Scottish Ministers to ensure that certain safeguards are in place in relation to the disclosure of intercepted material.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000055"></a>We believe that the order is consistent with two previous orders made in 2000 and 2003 transferring functions related to the interception of communications to Scottish Ministers. I hope that the noble Lord finds that answer reassuring. If he wishes to have further information, I am sure that my colleagues in the Scotland Office will provide it.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071795000056"></a>The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, asked whether a UK Minister can issue Section 5 warrants in Scotland anymore. The Secretary of State will issue interception warrants in respect of serious crime south of the border and national security for the whole of the UK, and Scottish Ministers will authorise interception warrants in respect of serious crime in Scotland and in order to request interception assistance from the EU MLAC. The noble Duke also asked about cross-border operations. English and Welsh officers do not have powers to conduct directed surveillance in Scotland under RIPA. Why not? It is correct that Part 2 of RIPA extends to Scotland only in limited specified circumstances; for example, UK-wide organisations such as the two we are talking about may operate in Scotland under RIPA. Otherwise, lawful surveillance in Scotland must be authorised under Scottish legislation. However, it is recognised that the current arrangements may hamper some cross-border operations, and the Scotland Office is working with the Home Office to rectify this.</p>

<p><a name="07071795000057"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, asked about the schedule to the order. We will write to her with a full explanation of it and pass a copy to everyone else who has taken part in the debate.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC29"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000007"></a>The noble Lord said: It may be helpful to noble Lords if I start by going over the background to the order. On 8 May, the then Secretary of State for Scotland made a Statement in another place about the problems faced at this year&#146;s Scottish parliamentary elections. I repeated his Statement in this House. It focused on the statutory review to be undertaken by the Electoral Commission under Section 5 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. That review will focus on the following issues: the high number of rejected ballots, the electronic counting process, the arrangements for postal voting, the decision to hold the parliamentary and local government polls on the same day, the decision to combine the two parliamentary votes on one ballot sheet, the process by which key decisions were made, and the role of the Electoral Commission in the preparations for the elections.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000008"></a>The Electoral Commission has, as we know, appointed Mr Ron Gould, an international expert in electoral administration, to lead its review. As requested by Scottish Executive Ministers prior to the elections, the review will also cover the Scottish local elections. Mr Gould has said that he aims to complete his work by the end of August. Last month, he met with the then Secretary of State for Scotland and the current Minister of State at the Scotland Office. At that meeting, Mr Gould asked about the possibility of gaining access to ballot papers to examine the nature and cause of the high level of spoilage. Ministers undertook to follow up this request and, following consideration of the legal framework and official-level discussions with the review team, this order was laid before the House.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000009"></a>That, briefly, is the history to date of the order. I will now say a little about its substance. It provides a mechanism to enable the Electoral Commission to access the ballot papers and electronic counting images from this year&#146;s Scottish parliamentary election. Currently, papers are sealed up and held securely by sheriff clerks and access can be granted only in cases of alleged fraud or where an election petition is being prepared. The same applies to the electronic record, which is a new item in Scotland, but which can provide the review team with information about spoilt ballot papers and may reduce the need for the team to examine actual ballot papers.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000010"></a>Before the commission&#146;s review team is given access, it is vital that safeguards are in place. The order&#146;s primary security feature is that it denies the commission access to the corresponding number lists, which link elector numbers with the barcodes and numbers printed on the back of ballot papers. Without these lists, ballot papers cannot be linked back to individuals and so the secrecy of the ballot is maintained. Further, and to ensure proper controls over documents, the order requires that once the review team has completed its work, the papers and records must be sealed up again, returned to the relevant sheriff clerk and any copies destroyed.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000011"></a>Since the time of this House should be used wisely, we do not yet know whether further scrutiny might be desirable after future Scottish Parliament elections or  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC30"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by-elections. The order is not expressly limited to the poll last May. However, it does not simply provide open-ended access.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000012"></a>Control is achieved by linking access to Section 6(2) of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which allows the Secretary of State to request the commission to undertake reviews into specific subjects. Under the order, the commission may access ballot papers only when requested to do so by the Secretary of State. Since the Secretary of State is answerable to Parliament, the order therefore provides for parliamentary accountability for any decision to provide ballot paper access.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0004.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000013"></a>As local elections in Scotland are a devolved matter, the order applies only to the Scottish parliamentary elections. If we are to learn the lessons of the 2007 elections, the Electoral Commission&#146;s review team must, as has been requested, have access to ballot papers. The order provides that access, while maintaining the secrecy of the ballot and ensuring parliamentary accountability. I beg to move.</p>

As the Electoral Commission&#146;s briefing states, democracy depends on public confidence in the electoral system. The Scottish elections came near to making a nonsense of that process. More than 140,000 votes were rejected, which is the proportional equivalent of 1 million in a UK general election. We are always interested in finding out what went wrong.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000016"></a>Some of the causes mentioned by the Minister are surely obvious: too many systems, too much novelty, and the bright idea of introducing everything on the same day. We would like to be sure that any inquiry gets to the bottom of things, but we must be doubly careful that nothing is done to set a precedent which could be unscrupulously used in the future. If any change in electoral legislation is contemplated, the proper safeguard is that it should be in place before, rather than after, the conduct of the poll. I hope that enough care is being taken in considering this legislation and expect the Minister to limit any change to as specific an area as possible.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000017"></a>A great many of us will have received a brief from the Electoral Commission, in which it clearly states two things: first, the major obstacle that it faced was its inability to access the rejected ballot papers; and, secondly, it considers that any measure that we pass should be restricted to the current circumstances.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000018"></a>Any powers that were required in this regard could have been achieved under Section 12(1)(b) of the Scotland Act, whereas we notice that the Minister is calling on the powers in Section 12(1)(a).</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000019"></a>Access to rejected ballot papers is allowed under the Scottish Parliament (Elections etc.) Order 2007 but, as the Minister explained, only for the purpose  of instituting a prosecution or taking up a case.   


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC31"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC31</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I understand that that route is not being pursued. Very properly, these provisions are subject to the judgment of a Court of Session or a sheriff. Here we are being presented with a statutory instrument to give the Electoral Commission access to all ballot papers incorporated into an ongoing legal instrument which can be triggered by a politically-appointed body requesting permission from the Secretary of State. Can the Minister tell the Grand Committee why it was not considered sufficient to give powers limited as the Electoral Commission recommends? The need for ongoing powers would, very properly, then have been part of the Electoral Commission&#146;s review, and that, I expect, is what it would have wished.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000020"></a>There is one point on which the Minister could offer clarification. The Explanatory Notes state that the provision is to do with the conduct of the elections for the Scottish Parliament, and that is perfectly clear; but the Explanatory Memorandum states at paragraph 5 that the instrument has UK extent. What is the meaning behind this provision? When these ballot papers are released, how many people will have access to them? They cannot be left lying around in some office. Will a person be identified and nominated as the person responsible? Will a requirement for how they should be sealed up again and returned be laid down?</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000021"></a>A further consideration is that under rule 70 of the Scottish Parliament (Elections etc.) Order 2007, any production and scrutiny of sealed electoral papers is available only after obtaining authority through a legal, not a political, channel. Can the Minister explain why the element of legal scrutiny of the necessity for investigation of sealed electoral material has not been included as part of this instrument? The Government have made a great issue of how every possible element of the judicial process should be totally separated from the political process. The electorate has received a great deal of assurance that electoral material is in the custody of the legal process, and here we are saying that a Secretary of State and a Government-appointed body can get together and have a look at the ballot papers.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000022"></a>Surely this is not an issue that needs consideration for Scotland alone; it is something for our whole electoral process in the UK. Given the importance of this, I give notice to the Minister that we may consider moving a Motion when this returns to the Floor of the House.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000023"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071797000166"></a>Lord Steel of Aikwood:</b> Perhaps I may preface my remarks by expressing some sympathy for the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Evans. It seems to me that he is constantly being dragged here to propose Scottish orders in which he has no genuine interest. I want to know what has happened to the Advocate-General who is now installed in the House. The noble Lord, Lord Selkirk of Douglas, will agree that he was a perfectly good Solicitor-General in the Scottish Parliament. His light was not hidden under a bushel there and I do not see why it is hidden here; we never hear from him. It would be very good to have a Scottish Minister presenting these orders. So I have every sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Evans.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000024"></a>Turning to the issue, I endorse entirely what the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, has just said: this was an extremely grave matter. The scale of spoilt ballot papers ruined the reputation of the elections in Scotland. It is very serious when the number of spoilt ballot papers in many constituencies exceeded the majority of the elected member. That is a disgraceful situation. It is why many of us pressed for a wholly independent inquiry into the conduct of the elections. </p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000025"></a>None the less, the Electoral Commission has taken this on board. Mr Ron Gould is well known to me&#151;he is a Canadian expert with whom I worked in the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance in Stockholm&#151;and I look forward to having a one-to-one meeting with him later this week when I will no doubt repeat my speech to him personally.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000026"></a>It is sensible that, for the inquiry to be properly conducted, it must be able to look at the ballot papers and see what caused this extraordinarily large number of spoilt papers. I fully endorse the Government&#146;s decision to bring forward this order to enable  Mr Gould and his colleagues to do that.</p>
<h5><a name="07071797000160"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000027"></a>In my view, some of the theories about why there was a large number of spoilt papers are misplaced. After the noble Lord repeated the Statement in your Lordships&#146; House, there was a lot of criticism about the fact that the elections for the Parliament and the local authorities were held on the same day. However, that had happened before and we did not have the problem then, so that cannot be a real grievance. My own experience of going into the ballot booth was that the instructions on the ballot paper were extremely inadequate. I think that that will probably be discovered as one of the main reasons why there were so many spoilt papers.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000028"></a>As to the conduct surrounding the postal votes, I hope that one question the Electoral Commission will consider is why on earth some local authorities took it into their heads to subcontract the handling of the postal votes to an organisation south of the border. I have no prejudice against organisations south of the border but clearly they could not have the knowledge of the local geography that a local authority has. In my view, they had no business exporting responsibility for seeing that the postal votes were delivered to the right people. As I think I have mentioned before, my noble friend Lord Kirkwood, who lives a couple of miles away from me in the Ettrick Valley, was sent the ballot papers for a completely different ward, so the organisation handling this clearly did not understand the nature of the geographical boundary, and I do not think that that should be allowed to happen again. I know that that is going a bit wide of the order but it should certainly fall within the remit of the inquiry.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000029"></a>I am also seeking an assurance from the Minister that, in presenting the order, the remit of the Electoral Commission&#146;s inquiry will be extremely wide. It should not just look at the issue of spoilt ballot papers&#151;and I know that that will not be the case&#151;but I want to ensure that it will genuinely look at the whole administration of the election.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC33"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000030"></a>When I first came into politics, party names did not appear on the ballot papers, and that was for a very good reason. Every time the returning officer declared an election, he said that we were elected to serve the people in such and such a constituency, so the ballot papers did not contain the party names. That was changed later and I understand why. It was for the convenience of, and to provide clarity for, the electorate. But now things have gone too far and we have sloganising on the ballot paper. I think that that was a contributory factor in the shambles of the Scottish election. Why should we allow someone to declare on the ballot paper that they are standing for Free Lollipops for the Masses (Liberal Democrat)? It appears that there is nothing to stop that happening.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000031"></a>Campaign slogans were introduced by Tommy Sheridan. He was the first person to use them in the previous election, and that was followed up very strongly by Alex Salmond. Most of the candidates who stood for the Scottish National Party put on the ballot paper, &#147;Alex Salmond for First Minister&#148;, even when they were standing for local elections. That made a complete nonsense of the whole local authority election. They did it partly because having a name starting with the letter &#147;A&#148; meant that he was at the top of the list every time, but it also caused confusion when it came to choosing between individual members and the party list system.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000032"></a>Therefore, I hope very much that the Electoral Commission will look at that process; it will probably mean taking back responsibility for registering political party names. Of course, if a political party is allowed to register itself under a whole series of names and then select the one that it thinks it might be advantageous to have on the ballot paper, that will be an abuse of the system. These wider issues have to be examined, and I am sure that Mr Ron Gould will do so if he is allowed. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an undertaking that the inquiry will be thorough and widespread, and that this order is simply one small part of it.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000033"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07071797000167"></a>Baroness Carnegy of Lour:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Steel, has raised a number of extremely important points.

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000034"></a>The point about sloganising in the name of the party is extremely important. People really resented this. Members of the Committee who were here at the time may remember when the ballot papers for the Scots Parliament election went through the House of Lords and we discussed it here in the Moses Room. We looked at the ballot papers and raised these points. I asked whether it was necessary for a party to call itself the same thing in different parts of Scotland. I received a letter saying that it was not. A party could put itself at the top with the letter A in one part of the country and lower down with another letter in another part. That is quite extraordinary. People in Scotland were horrified by what they felt was a performance worthy of a banana republic; that

They were very embarrassed on Scotland's behalf that we should have such an ineffective system.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000035"></a>The reasons have all been given, but one incident was reported in several papers, although I have not confirmed it. A ballot box arrived from some remote polling station and, when it was opened, the ballot papers were soaking wet for some reason that nobody understood. It was reported that there were 400 more ballot papers in the box than votes had been cast at that polling station. That is very shocking if it is true, and the Electoral Commission needs to go into it.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000036"></a>The commission is right to want to be able to look at the ballot papers and deduce from its examination what actually happened. Having asked for this, the commission is pleased to see the order; but it feels that two things are wrong with it. First, the commission can do this only if instructed by the Secretary of State. The commission is independent and does not want to be mixed up with politics. It would prefer the order to have been worded in such a way that it could do this under its existing powers. Why is it being done in this way? That is a big question. My last question was very small and I was horrified to hear that I was going to get a letter about it because nobody knew the answer. But this is a big question and I am sure that the Minister will be advised why it is being done in this way.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000037"></a>The other point that the commission makes, which my noble friend the Duke of Montrose has already mentioned, is that the Secretary of State can do this again and again under the order. The act that he is performing can be repeated&#151;and not only can it be repeated but it is likely to have a knock-on effect for elections for other bodies. We do not want our electoral systems to be totally different or for their rights and wrongs to be totally different in different types of elections and different parts of the United Kingdom. So there could be a knock-on effect. The commission suggests that this could be a one-off order just for the circumstances of this time. and it will be interesting to know why that is not the case. It seems a much more sensible idea. Why does the Secretary of State have to give the instruction if it could be done by an independent commission with a different order to enable it to do that? Could it not be a one-off affair in any case?</p>

<p><a name="07071797000038"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07071797000168"></a>Lord Selkirk of Douglas:</b> I have some probing questions. The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, has highlighted the issue of whether this provision should have been founded upon Section 12(1)(a) of the Scotland Act or Section 12(1)(b). My understanding is that (1)(a) refers to electoral processes, while (1)(b) refers to irregularities. The elected representatives in Scotland expect this matter to be resolved by the Electoral Commission getting to the bottom of what happened. If any obstacle is put in their way, there will be a lot of dissatisfaction.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000039"></a>I declare an interest. The noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, and I were among the last three to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. We had to wait another 24 hours for, if I may say so, another  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC35"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>substantial mistake at the polls. In fact, 2,000 votes were not even counted. When I wrote to the Secretary of State, John Reid, about that, he replied that he had no powers to intervene; he could do so only if there were a court action. Will the order make it less likely that people will have to contemplate court actions? I do not think the noble Lord, Lord Steel, Robin Harper, the first Green MSP, or I had any desire whatever to be involved in an expensive court action. As we were all convincingly elected, the only thing such an action could have proved is that one of us might have been elected before one of the others. As we all got in, that did not seem to matter to any of us. If in practice the order means that court actions would be less desirable and less frequent, that would be a service.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000040"></a>As these powers have been given to the Electoral Commission in Scotland but not in England, is that not an inconsistency? Is it not undesirable to have a different form of election north and south of the Border?</p>

<p><a name="07071797000041"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07071797000169"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I could perhaps be forgiven for feeling a little sorry for myself. I do an order on the Companies Act 2006 and the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, regrets that it is not being answered by my noble friend Lord Jones of Birmingham. I am then told by the noble Lord, Lord Steel, that he would prefer the Advocate-General to be answering these Scottish questions, and accuses me of having no genuine interest in Scotland. I have been spokesman for Scotland in your Lordships&#146; House for four years, I gather, although I thought it was five. I have an interest in Scotland and it is perhaps rather parochial to suggest that you can speak on Scottish order only if you are Scottish.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000042"></a>I shall deal first with why the order is in Grand Committee, because the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, said he was unhappy about that. Notice was given on Wednesday 4 July of our intention to take the order in Grand Committee. The House agreed on 5 July to refer the order. We require notice from any party that is unhappy with a referral to give us the opportunity to consider how that can be addressed. We received no such notice until this afternoon. The order requires approval before the Summer Recess, so if it is to go through&#151;as I am sure we all want it to&#151;it will unfortunately not be possible to take another route on it.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000043"></a>I will answer the questions I have been asked as best as I can. The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, and the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, asked why the order is not limited to the current election. A form of drafting providing the commission with access to ballot papers as part of its statutory review under Section 5 of the PPERA, along with a sunset provision limiting the order to the 2007 elections, was an option that we considered. On balance, however, the Government felt that if the commission were given access to ballot papers, the more prudent use of parliamentary time was not to introduce legislation that applied only to these elections but to provide a mechanism capable of being used in the future, should that be necessary. This was a fine judgment,

Ultimately, given that the order is subject to affirmative resolution, it will be for Parliament to decide.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000044"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0005.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07071797000170"></a>The Duke of Montrose:</b> I thank the Minister for giving way. The idea in his earlier statement that if this were done in two parts it would take up parliamentary time unnecessarily is a bit unfair. Surely the most important thing we do here is govern the democratic process, and that takes however much time it needs.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000045"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07071797000171"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> The point I was making was that there was ample time for any noble Lord or political party to object to the order being heard in Grand Committee in the Moses Room, but we received no such communication. I notice the noble Baroness is shaking her head.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000048"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07071797000174"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> That is the point I made. Our view is that this is the appropriate way to proceed with the order. Clearly there is a disagreement here.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000049"></a>The noble Duke and the noble Lord, Lord Selkirk of Douglas, asked why the order is made under Section 12(1)(a) of the Scotland Act and not Section 12(1)(b). The provision is about how the election is conducted, but Section 12(1)(b) deals with the questioning of an election and consequences of irregularities. We are clearly not dealing with irregularities. Although at first sight the draft order might appear to be concerned with questioning an election, that phrase has a technical meaning in electoral legislation.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000050"></a>The 2007 order, which the draft we are debating will amend, adopts at Schedule 6 a provision contained at Section 120 of the Representation of the Peoples Act 1983. That provision relates to the method of questioning an election. It states that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071797000157"></a>&#147;No parliamentary election ... shall be questioned except by way of&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071797000155"></a>an election&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07071797000158"></a>&#147;petition&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071797000156"></a>The Electoral Commission and Mr Gould&#146;s review are not questioning the election, in that sense, but examining how the election was conducted. So we are satisfied that it is correct to find vires for the order in Section 12(1)(a) and not Section 12 (1)(b).</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000051"></a>The noble Duke also asked: why UK extent? It is the same as the order it amends; the 2007 order has UK extent. He asked how access to the papers will be restricted. The order requires that copies of papers must be destroyed after scrutiny. Detailed arrangements will be for the commission and the sheriff clerks to  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC37"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>decide. The noble Duke asked why this is not linked to a court order. It is true to say that the mechanism does not require a court order, but the instrument is subject to affirmative resolution that provides for the appropriate level of scrutiny.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Steel, wonders whether the commission&#146;s review remit is wide enough. We believe it is. It is not limited to spoilt ballots; it will consider e-counting, postal votes, spoilt ballots and so on. The intention is that we fully review what happened and come up with the proper answers. There will then be an opportunity for discussion.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000053"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0005.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="07071797000175"></a>The Duke of Montrose:</b> I beg your Lordships&#146; pardon, but I ask the Minister again: could he please write to us? I am slightly worried because he keeps saying that papers might be burned. Presumably the issue is that the papers should be returned to the sheriff&#146;s officer, although some other papers may need to be burned.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000054"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07071797000176"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> They will be returned and it will be up to the sheriff&#146;s office to decide what should happen to them. If there is more to say on this, we will write.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000055"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Steel, and the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, asked about party descriptions. Section 49 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 provided for a registered political party to register up to 12 descriptions of six words or more to be used on nomination papers and/or ballot papers. Responsibility for registering party descriptions lies with the Electoral Commission. The criteria the commission has to follow in registering party descriptions is set out in the Electoral Administration Act.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000056"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, asked whether this order will set a precedent. The administrative problems faced in the 2007 Scottish elections dented public confidence&#151;there is no doubt about that&#151;and, in order to rebuild that confidence, we need to ensure that the commission&#146;s review is detailed, thorough and has access to the information it needs, including ballot papers. Only in this way can we be sure to learn the lessons of the elections and be seen to be learning from them, which is very important. The order is limited to Scottish Parliament elections. Following the review, it is possible that the Electoral Commission may request that a similar power be written into electoral law relating to all elections. Such a request would, of course, be for Parliament to decide upon.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000057"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Selkirk of Douglas, asked whether this order will make it less likely that people will need to go to court to question a result. The order does not affect the general provisions relating to election petitions; instead, it is a response to particular circumstances.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000058"></a>If I have failed to answer any questions, noble Lords will receive letters, and copies of correspondence will go to everyone who has taken part in what has been an interesting debate.</p>

<h5><a name="07071797000161"></a>6.07 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07071797000060"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071797000177"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Railway Pensions (Transfer of Pension Schemes) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000061"></a>The noble Lord said: This order transfers some of the members, assets and liabilities of six historic British Rail pension funds to the 1994 Pensioners Section of the Railways Pension Scheme. Where members of these historic funds are also members of the British Rail 1974 Pension Fund, their membership and the liability of the 1974 fund to make payments to them will also be transferred. Where discretionary benefits are given to members of the British Rail historic funds, these benefits will be continued. Once the transfer has been completed, these historic funds will be wound up.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000062"></a>The British Rail historic funds are: the London and North Western Railway Provident Society for providing pensions for the widows and orphans of members of the salaried staff; the Great Western Railway Supplemental Pensions Reserve Fund; the Great Western Railway Salaried Staff, Widows and Orphans Pension Society; the Great Northern Railway Superannuation Fund; the Great Western Railway Inspectors and Foremen&#146;s Special Pension Fund; and the Southern Railway (South Eastern and Chatham Section) Enginemen and Motormen&#146;s Pension Fund Society.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000063"></a>The main purpose of the proposed transfer is to achieve more efficient administration of the pension arrangements for railway pensioners and a saving in administrative costs for the taxpayer. This ensures that the running costs of the scheme are proportionate and do not erode the benefits. The Secretary of State is the designated employer of the 1994 Pensioners Section. He is also the designated employer of all but one of the historic funds. The exception is the South Eastern and Chatham fund. Stagecoach South Western Trains Limited inherited responsibility for this scheme at privatisation because it employed the last active member of the scheme.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000064"></a>The 1994 Pensioners Section is mainly comprised of all the pensioners plus the deferred pensioners at the time of privatisation. The section benefits from a Crown guarantee. When the 1994 Pensioners Section was set up, a special reserve fund was established within it. If a surplus arises under the 1994 Pensioners Section, 40 per cent of it is distributed to the scheme members and 60 per cent is directed to the reserve fund. The reserve fund is used to make up any future shortfall in pension liabilities under the 1994 Pensioners Section. The special reserve fund is currently sufficient to meet any deficit in the 1994 Pensioners Section even after the transfer of liabilities effected by the transfer order. If in the future  the reserve fund were to be insufficient to meet the liabilities of the 1994 Pensioners Section, the Secretary of State would have to meet any shortfall under the guarantee issued by him.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC39"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000065"></a>The transfer involves extending the guarantee already given to the 1994 Pensioners Section to cover the liabilities of the historic funds. It should not increase the exposure of the Secretary of State except in relation to the South East and Chatham fund, since the other historic funds already benefit from a Crown guarantee. The Secretary of State is expected to make a top-up payment of approximately &#163;180,000 in relation to the Great Western Railway Salaried Staff, Widows and Orphans Pension Society, and Stagecoach South Western Trains Limited is making a payment of approximately &#163;44,000 in respect of the South East and Chatham fund, so that those transfers comply with the Pensions (Protection and Designation of Schemes) Order 1994 and are transferred on a fully funded basis.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000066"></a>From the point of view of the 1994 Pensioners Section members, the transfer makes little difference. There are approximately 2,942 members in the historic funds as compared with some 155,592 members in the 1994 Pensioners Section. The historic funds assets being transferred are about &#163;54 million compared with &#163;4,591 million in the 1994 Pensioners Section. The liabilities transferred represent about 1 per cent of the current 1994 Pensioners Section liabilities. The transferring liabilities are therefore more than covered by the transferring assets.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000067"></a>For members of the BR historic funds, the proportionate cost of administering the 1994 Pensioners Section will be much lower. There is also an improved prospect of enhanced benefits, because the 1994 Pensioners Section is not restricted to a cautious investment strategy and its rules permit a distribution of 40 per cent of the surplus among members.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000068"></a>Two of the BR historic funds currently have a surplus of assets over liabilities. There is little likelihood of any benefit improvements to the members of these funds if they remain as separate funds, but the transfer will provide for those members to benefit from a one-off 4 per cent uplift in their benefits. Consultation took place with the trustees of each of the pension schemes concerned. Those trustees represent the interests of the members and are made up representatives of the pensioners, trade unions and employers. The transfers have the support of the trustees of all of the funds involved. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, properly declared his interest. It is a little sad that the historic funds are being wound up. My understanding is that one of them goes back to 1851, as noble Lords can probably read in its long title. However, it makes good sense to transfer the funds. We do not think that any member of the historic funds or the 1994 Pensioners Section, including the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, will be at all disadvantaged. As I said earlier, there is a prospect of enhanced benefit for some members, who will now automatically benefit from a share of any future surplus in the 1994 Pensioners Section. I assure noble Lords that all members will be notified of these changes; in fact, they have already been put on notice. Some of them will no doubt be very happy, particularly when they realise that they will be 4 per cent better off.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000075"></a>The noble Baroness said: The western Balkans, of which Albania is a part, has had a troubled past. We can all remember the distressing images that multiplied across our television screens throughout the 1990s of conflict, ethnic cleansing, massacres and breakdowns of law and order. Our challenge today&#151;this is one of the UK&#146;s foremost foreign policy priorities&#151;is to help this region to draw a line under its troubled past and move towards a more stable future.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000076"></a>The UK&#146;s vision is to see all the countries of the region move steadily towards European and Euro-Atlantic integration. This is the right vision for these countries. It provides the incentives for reform and will bind the countries together into relationships of mutual co-operation and interdependence. It is also the right vision for the existing EU. These countries are not remote and distant; they directly border the European Union. Our interests are served by their progress towards meeting EU norms and by their eventual membership of an EU, which will offer security and prosperity to the western Balkans region. That is the context against which today&#146;s debate is taking place.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000077"></a>At the Zagreb summit in November 2000, the EU established a process to bring the region closer to the EU, fostering stability and facilitating development. The agreement that we debate today is a key part of the process. It creates a contractual relationship between the EU and Albania, setting the terms for  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC41"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>free trade and easier movement of workers, services and capital. It also sets out responsibilities in the areas of justice, freedom, security and regional co-operation. The Government are convinced that proper implementation of this agreement will help to bring stability, economic growth and strengthened rule of law to Albania. That will be particularly important, not just for Albania but also for the UK.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000078"></a>Albanian criminal interests directly impact on the UK&#146;s well-being. Our best way of dealing with them&#151;both bilaterally and through the EU&#151;is to establish the close partnership with Albanian institutions that will allow a strengthening of the rule of law in Albania, leading to stronger capacity to tackle organised crime and corruption.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000079"></a>As part of the EU integration process, the countries of the region are required to take forward key reforms in areas such as public administration and economic governance and in the fight against organised crime and corruption. While more progress is needed across the region, the prospect of eventual EU membership has been a powerful driver behind reform efforts, improving governance and stability. As these countries move closer to the EU, we hope that the likelihood of a return to conflict will become increasingly improbable.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000081"></a>Albania&#146;s Stabilisation and Association Agreement&#151;the SAA&#151;has now been ratified by Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Poland, Sweden, Slovenia and Slovakia, as well as the Albanian Assembly and European Parliament. The key elements of the agreement for Albania are that it recognises Albania as a &#147;potential candidate&#148; for the EU; it sets out the stages for Albania to progress towards eventual membership via a closer partnership with the European Union; and it promotes regional co-operation and will open up regional economic opportunities. In addition, the SAA supports the efforts of Albania to complete the transition into a functioning market economy, to promote harmonious economic relations and gradually to develop a free trade area between the Community and Albania.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000082"></a>Implementation of the SAA will be a central and continuing requirement of the European Union and, along with the priority reforms highlighted in the European partnership between Albania and the EU, will help to reinforce public administration reform and good governance. The Department for International Development and the Commission are working to support these reform efforts.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000083"></a>The Government believe that the EU&#146;s role in encouraging reform and stability is vital for the future peace of the western Balkans. The SAAs are important building blocks in this process. The Albania stabilisation and association agreement will serve as a strong political message of EU support to the wider region and should provide motivation for Albania and other western Balkan states to make further progress, taking the steps needed to move further towards the EU. The process benefits the UK,

We on these Benches fully support EU enlargement into the Balkans region providing that the candidate countries meet the necessary criteria.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000086"></a>The SAA was signed with Albania, after three years of talks, in recognition of the progress made with political and economic reform. However, while there have been signs of economic progress there, with inflation under tighter control and some growth, the country remains still one of the poorest in Europe. The EU is keen to encourage further reform, particularly in regard to tackling organised crime and corruption and developing media freedom and property and minority rights. Last year the United Kingdom provided around &#163;2.3 million of bilateral aid to Albania. This was mainly in the form of technical assistance aimed at building government capacity for policy formulation and for the development of effective services.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000087"></a>Given the well-documented problems of corruption that still plague Albania, what safeguards did Her Majesty&#146;s Government seek to put in place to ensure this money was well spent? According to a recent survey, more than 60 per cent of Albanians perceive the United States as the best advocate of their country&#146;s interests and on his recent visit to Albania President Bush was given a hero&#146;s welcome. Do the Government have any plans for discussions with our American friends to encourage the Albanian Government to introduce the reforms required to meet the accession criteria of the EU?</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000088"></a>Finally, Albania has made it clear that the key objective of its foreign policy is to join Euro-Atlantic organisations. Given that Albania has contributed to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, can the Minister provide an update on Albania&#146;s efforts to join NATO?</p>

I was also a member of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments which, at the end of June, listed this draft statutory instrument for approval by the House. I thank the Minister for her explanation of the background to the treaty with Albania. Incidentally, it is considered to be a very well-written treaty and a good model for future occasions when there will be other applicant countries, although not necessarily only from that geographical part of the world. We on these Benches were grateful for the way in which the UK Government also took an enthusiastic lead with other countries.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000090"></a>On the tally the Minister described recently, around half of national parliaments have already ratified, plus the European Parliament. Presumably that process will continue apace, although I imagine there will be the usual summer interval before most parliaments resume again in September&#151;unlike our own Parliament, which resumes a little bit later than that.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000091"></a>Although the situation since the July 2005 parliamentary elections was not entirely satisfactory&#151;indeed, the way in which those elections were administered were not considered to be 100 per cent&#151;none the less, they were impressive for a newly democratic-structured country, and the international observers considered the anomalies to be within the bearable spectrum of examples, compared with other countries. That was rather encouraging.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000092"></a>The country has, therefore, been recovering from some of the tensions and turmoil involved in those elections and the later local elections. President Bush received an extraordinary welcome in Albania. It was described by the previous speaker as a hero&#146;s welcome, and some people, prima facie, thought that that might have been the case but, then again, there may have been second thoughts that it was a competition as to who would be able to snatch his watch. There were further doubts about what happened with that article and differing explanations were given by the State Department and the President&#146;s office in the White House.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000093"></a>Albania is, by all appearances, firmly intent on being a strong ally of the West and it is an applicant of increasing respectability for joining the leading institutions in which it has expressed interest&#151;NATO and the European Union&#151;even if that process is inevitably slow. The country has benefited from considerable support from the European Union&#146;s aid programmes, the support programmes under this treaty and the UK&#146;s development assistance that has been mentioned. With those thoughts, we are pleased to support the order.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000094"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07071797000184"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> I am grateful for the support for the SAA process and this order, as well as for the points raised in the debate. We all fundamentally agree that the countries of the western Balkans need to continue making progress towards stability and that they need to continue to move away from the dark shadow cast by the 1990s. That will require our continued commitment to the region and to promoting its political and economic process.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000095"></a>As regards the questions of the noble Lord, Lord Astor, about safeguards to ensure that the money provided for Albania is properly spent, UK embassies and EC delegations on the ground monitor the effectiveness of EU and EC spending. The integrated planning system for government, which was a key element of programme activity funded by the UK, has been monitored by the UK and its international partners. Do the Government have any plans to discuss Albania&#146;s progress with the United States? I do not know, but I will certainly mention that to my colleagues in the Foreign Office. I am sure that it will be discussed at some point.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000096"></a>With regard to NATO, Albania hopes to get an invitation to join the alliance at the 2008 NATO summit. At the previous NATO summit in Riga, the allies committed to extending invitations to aspirant members, provided that they met the required standards. Success for Albania will depend on it meeting the conditions set out in its NATO membership action plan and satisfying NATO allies that it is indeed ready to take on the responsibilities of membership.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000097"></a>The country is reasonably well positioned in many respects, but in the coming weeks and months its political class must show that it has the political maturity to deal with political challenges to keep the reform process on track. That will give Albania the best chance of receiving an invitation. As the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, said, Albania is already proving itself to be a strong ally of the West. I am grateful for the noble Lord&#146;s kind words about the treaty itself and the fact that it is, perhaps, a model. It is good to hear that a treaty is a model, because often we are lambasted about treaties. I assure noble Lords that the ratification process will continue. Everything is going according to plan and we can see no problems. The noble Lord was right to be encouraged by the recent election process, which is a great tribute to Albanians.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000098"></a>The Government believe that the prospect of European and Euro-Atlantic integration has been vital in driving reform and encouraging stability in the western Balkans. The stabilisation and association agreements are important building blocks in this process. Albania&#146;s SAA will provide a framework for continued reform and will send a strong signal to the countries of the region that we are serious about their European future. We will continue to encourage progress towards the EU, while insisting that the countries meet the necessary conditions. I commend the order to the House.</p>

<h5><a name="07071797000163"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07071797000100"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0006.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07071797000185"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Housing Benefit (Loss of Benefit) (Pilot Scheme) Regulations 2007.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000101"></a>The noble Lord said: Anti-social behaviour ruins lives. It does not just make life unpleasant but prevents the renewal of disadvantaged areas and creates an environment where more serious crime can take hold. It is also very expensive. It is estimated to cost the British taxpayer &#163;3.4 billion a year. One of the commitments in the respect action plan, launched in January 2006, was to consider how to encourage those involved in persistent anti-social behaviour to engage with intensive family support.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000102"></a>As part of the plan, we developed the policy of a housing benefit sanction for people who have been  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC45"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>evicted for anti-social behaviour and then refuse to take up offers of help. This proposal is different from sanction proposals previously considered but not taken forward. It is a post-eviction sanction, designed to encourage people to access support to tackle their problem behaviour, as opposed to a pre-eviction proposal intended to deter but not tackle the causes of the anti-social behaviour. The aim is to provide a very strong incentive to encourage these households to undertake rehabilitation when they have refused other offers of help.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000103"></a>This measure was thoroughly debated during the course of the Welfare Reform Act 2007, so I know that there are concerns about its impact on the vulnerable. However, the measure is about helping vulnerable people and about getting people in crisis to accept the support offered to them. Because they have already been evicted, the chances of it happening again are high unless they change their behaviour. As I told noble Lords during the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill, this policy will be considered a success if no sanction is imposed. It will mean that people have accepted the help that they need.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0006.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000104"></a>We know that intensive rehabilitation can achieve positive and significant changes in behaviour, resulting in long-standing difficulties and entrenched anti-social behaviour being stopped. The evaluation of the Dundee families&#146; project showed an 84 per cent success rate with the most difficult families, using a variety of key indicators, including prevention of issuing anti-social behaviour orders and preventing children being taken into care.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70717-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000105"></a>A Sheffield Hallam University evaluation of six family support projects found that the projects were strong on their primary objective of reducing incidents and complaints about anti-social behaviour. An 85 per cent reduction in anti-social behaviour was recorded. This study used key indicators, including the reduction in the level of complaints and improved school attendance over two years. Evaluations show success rates of over 80 per cent. It means that behaviour improves and communities get respite from the behaviour that is plaguing them, and it also delivers other positive outcomes. An 84 per cent improvement in school attendance was recorded across the six projects covered in the Sheffield Hallam evaluation. Parents often report feeling better able to control, supervise and parent their children.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000106"></a>Given the strong evidence that such rehabilitation works, it is justifiable that a sanction of benefit should be linked to the refusal of such help and support. The fate of those who have a sanction imposed is within their own hands. Benefit will be reinstated if they choose to take up the rehabilitation services offered to them. These regulations underpin the possible sanction of housing benefit and set the rate for the reduction. It is right that they are subject to the affirmative procedure. The regulations would allow the pilots to run for two years, starting from 1 November 2007. Under the primary legislation, the conditions that must be satisfied for a sanction to be applied are that the former occupier has been evicted on grounds of anti-social behaviour; they have secured alternative accommodation and a new claim  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC46"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to housing benefit has been made; they have been issued with a warning notice requiring them to take specified action to avoid a sanction; and they have failed, without good cause, to comply with the warning notice.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000107"></a>Regulation 3 sets out that that must all take place within a pilot area&#151;not necessarily the same pilot area&#151;and within the pilot period. Under regulation 4, if those conditions are satisfied, housing benefit will be gradually reduced in three phases, the intention being that the increasing deduction acts as a rolling incentive to take up support. Because we want this to be a strong incentive, it is a severe sanction, taking away up to 100 per cent of benefit. However, if the person falls into the category of &#147;person of hardship&#148;, the maximum reduction is 30 per cent. Hardship is defined in regulation 5. As well as those listed as automatically qualifying for hardship, local authorities have discretion to award hardship in any case where they have taken account of all the circumstances of the household and are satisfied that it will suffer hardship.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000108"></a>The proposed regulations would amend the Social Security (Loss of Benefits) Regulations 2001 so that, where another sanction was being applied to the household&#146;s housing benefit for benefit offences, the rate of deduction that would apply would be the greater of the two rates. The schedule to the two regulations lists the local authorities where the pilots will take place, and only claimants in those local authorities will be subject to the sanction of reduced housing benefit. The local authorities piloting the scheme are volunteers who believe it is a tool that will be useful to them.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000109"></a>Further detail on the sanction scheme will be provided in negative-resolution regulations&#151;the Housing Benefit (Loss of Benefit) Pilot Scheme Supplementary Regulations 2007. Those regulations contain details of appeal rights and of what will be considered good cause not to comply with a warning notice. They will provide the rules about discretionary housing payments and provide the arrangements for sharing of information between the courts, the DWP and local authorities. Detailed guidance will be provided for housing benefit administrators, the courts and local authorities. It is being drafted in conjunction with the piloting local authorities and with relevant stakeholders.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000110"></a>In my view the provisions of the Housing Benefit (Loss of Benefit) (Pilot Scheme) Regulations 2007 are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. I beg to move.</p>

We are glad that they have the power only to set up a pilot scheme, which cannot be rolled out across the country without primary legislation.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000113"></a>As the Minister acknowledged, many charities and organisations involved are deeply opposed to the idea of imposing benefit sanctions for anti-social behaviour. Several local authorities also oppose the idea. There are concerns that it will drive the most vulnerable families, often involving children living in poverty, out of safe housing into slums, and from there on to the streets. Will the Minister clarify how many families the Government expect sanctions to be applied to under the scheme, and how they will protect the children who will unavoidably be affected by the sanctions?</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000114"></a>The stick is meant to be balanced with a carrot. Those subject to sanctions must have the support they need. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions called this &#147;intensive&#148;. There was a lot of concern during the original debate that the Government were not going to provide any extra funds to the organisations&#151;the local authority, independent charities and so on&#151;that would have to provide that support. Will the Minister clarify what funding has been made available to them? Will any extra funding that would be provided for in the pilot, but not necessarily in the rollout, be fully transparent in the final report?</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000115"></a>There was a lot of concern that those imposing the sanctions would not have the training or the duty to identify those whose anti-social behaviour was as a result of mental illness. What safeguards have the Government put in place to ensure that those with mental illnesses are identified and given the support that they need? Will the Government provide any extra funding to the mental health organisations that will have to provide this support, even if they are outside the usual &#147;intensive support&#148; that the Government intend to provide as a consequence of these regulations?</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000116"></a>Other pilots in the Welfare Reform Act were criticised either for the inadequate number of test bases, so that the evidence was meaningless, or for the fact that funding for the pilot was much greater than funding for the planned rollout, so that the results would not necessarily be comparable.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000117"></a>I think that the Minister will see that the thrust of my contribution to this discussion is an attempt to ensure that the eventual report will be as full and transparent as possible. I hope he will guarantee that that will be the case. For our part, we will be interested in the pilot and await the outcome.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000118"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07071797000187"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> I am very pleased to follow the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, and I concur with just about everything that he said. The Committee should be very wary of taking on additional pilots. I think that there is already a feeling that the department is more or less &#147;piloted out&#148;. It is very easy to agree that we should look at these issues and, indeed, many of them benefit from pilots being run, but one wonders to what extent we overdo the  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC48"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>technique. However, as has been said, we will look at this pilot programme with great interest once the results have been evaluated and made available.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000119"></a>I have a number of questions for the Minister. He is right to say that we had some full discussions about the principle during the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill. He will know that the legislation was amended to the extent that we have a sunset clause, under which, unless we have further primary legislation, the legislation will be brought to an end by 2010. That has an impact on its interaction with these pilots, and I should be very interested to know how he sees that working. Of course, the power for the sanctions can last for up to five years but, as there is only two or three years to go between now and 2010, it will be interesting to watch how these things interact.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000120"></a>I have serious doubts about a post-eviction policy. I absolutely concur with the analysis of the evil and damage that anti-social behaviour does and the fact that there is a need to do something. I understand that there is always pressure on Ministers to be seen to be doing something, but they must resist the temptation to do that. I also have serious doubts about using the benefits system to impose penalties as part of the so-called respect agenda. I do not think that you do that easily without potentially damaging very fragile households.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000121"></a>The pilots are interesting and they need to be watched but I think that Ministers need to be careful about how they are rolled out. I should be much more interested in devoting resources, time and energy to a preventive strategy. I know that that has been tried. The Minister has said, rightly, that the experience of the work carried out at Dundee and the research at Sheffield Hallam University indicates that you can get considerable returns from actively preventing people being evicted and getting involved in anti-social behaviour in the first place. If I were given the choice, that is the direction of policy that I would take. It is not the one that we have before us this afternoon, which looks at the requirement for post-eviction support services to try to reduce anti-social behaviour. I do not think that that is the right way to do it.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000122"></a>One immediate question that arises is that this power derives from 1992 regulations, which are UK wide, but the pilots are only English in their dimension. Does that mean that the policy as currently constructed is intended in the long term to be rolled out only in England if it is rolled out, or are there discussions with colleagues in Scotland, Wales and indeed Northern Ireland about what happens in the longer run?</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000123"></a>As far as I can see, there is certainly not a great deal of demand for these policies. What do the local authorities that have volunteered&#151;and that is an interesting verb to use sometimes&#151;actually feel about this? Their view may be that this is another additional tool that they might use as a way forward in future, but I get no sense from the stakeholders or local authorities that people are queuing up to press the Minister for these measures.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000124"></a>One reason for that is that the proposals will involve additional complexity. The guidelines are

It all gets a bit convoluted, and we all know that the benefit system is complex enough as it is. We need to guard against increasing complexity where we can.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000125"></a>I shall be interested to know why these areas were chosen and whether they were volunteers. As far as I can make out, in the timescale for which figures are most recently available, only 28 families in total were evicted across these eight areas. That suggests to me that we have a potentially very small sample here, which is something that needs looking at very carefully. I should also like to try to work out what control arrangements there are. Will there be interviews and will evaluation be attempted for those families who are evicted but are not threatened with a sanction to get a control that makes the evaluation a bit more scientific? Perhaps something could be said about that, if not this afternoon then by way of a letter to me and the noble Lord. That would be helpful.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000126"></a>There is confusion here about responsibility, too. The respect agenda is a Home Office matter, for which there is a budget and a rollout for national policies. The delivery of these pilots will be exclusively in the hands of local authorities, which will have some discretion in that regard while obviously being subject to the Department for Communities and Local Government. The DWP seems to fit into this process simply because it is that department&#146;s money that is potentially being sanctioned. Can I have some assurances that there have been meaningful talks between all these various government departments so that they all know what they are trying to do?</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000127"></a>As for the policy outcome and evaluation, will we not end up with the pilots eventually evaluating nothing much more than the quality of the service packages available in these eight areas? If they are very good service packages, a lot of people will readily accept them. Therefore, I do not see how the evaluation of the actual policy can be unbundled from the extent and provision of the package of services of support that are available. I am puzzled about that and would like some reassurance about that, too.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000128"></a>There is a mismatch between the legal and practical arrangements in these orders, because I think that there is a confusion of language and definition between &#147;tenant&#148; on the one hand, who is responsible for the rent&#151;that comes from the rent Acts and a body of law that is separate and distinct&#151;and &#147;household&#148; or &#147;benefit unit&#148; on the other, which come from social security law. The tenant is the person who is going to be sanctioned, because he or she will get the warning letter and the terms of the sanction threat put through his or her door. But the tenant may not be responsible for the anti-social behaviour about which the complaint is raised, because it is a member of the household who is responsible. The two are not the same thing. The loose use of terms such as &#147;family&#148;, &#147;household&#148;, &#147;tenant&#148; and &#147;former occupier&#148; will lead to potential difficulties.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000129"></a>The benefit unit is different from the household. We know that because housing benefit is paid to the family unit, not to the household; they are considered separate units. Deductions are made from non-dependent units, which are considered to be economically distinct and separate from the household. So you could have anti-social behaviour conducted by a non-dependent for housing benefit purposes, but how does that fit in with who gets the sanction letter and who gets the penalty applied to him or her? It is difficult to understand. I certainly do not understand it, but perhaps I am missing something here.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000130"></a>There are some prima facie problems about human rights. I am not an expert in this area, but because these regulations discriminate households that are guilty of anti-social behaviour simply according to where they live, there is an element of potential discrimination that the Minister should get his officials to look at carefully. There are another 53 family intervention pilots in other parts of the United Kingdom that have been in place for some time, and anti-social behaviour households in those areas can refuse to co-operate and not be sanctioned. So there is a potential area of discrimination there, too. These pilots may be inherently contradictory to some of the provisions of the Human Rights Act. If the Minister cannot give me an answer today, I should like him to write to me.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000131"></a>The &#147;good cause&#148; provisions in the guidelines will exempt just about everyone who is potentially subject to these sanctions. The Minister in his introduction rightly referred to the Dundee scheme. My figures indicate that the Dundee scheme showed that 55 per cent of families engaged with the support, and that the other 45 per cent were likely to have additional barriers. Given the fact that they have additional barriers, those with extra problems will probably not be subject to the sanctions because they will be excluded by the &#147;good cause&#148; provisions and the guidelines. So we could be left with precious few families to whom these regulations and sanctions can ever be applied. I wonder whether this is all a great fuss about not a lot at all.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000132"></a>I may have got it wrong, but I think it is possible under these regulations for members of the household to engage in support intervention&#151;to accept the letter to come and engage in the support intervention and therefore not get sanctioned&#151;and to continue with anti-social behaviour and not get sanctioned.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000133"></a>Another problem is that the former occupier as defined in these regulations could quite easily go outside the pilot area and get a housing benefit application successfully accepted in some region outside of the eight current pilots. I wonder whether they will be advised about that by the local CAB. That seems to me to be a bit of a no-brainer and I do not see how it helps the constructive evaluation of the pilots.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000134"></a>How do you separate out the effect of a sanction from everything else that is going on at the time? I think all you will end up doing is increasing rent arrears, which is in no one&#146;s interest.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000135"></a>Have the department considered a disability impact statement for these regulations? The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is right: mental illness is fundamental and at the core of this, particularly with Asperger&#146;s syndrome sufferers. There is a great deal of evidence that such people are subjected unduly to ASBOs for reasons of their mental illness. The disability aspect has to be looked at very carefully.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000136"></a>The ethnicity dimension also has to be considered because some minority communities&#151;black ethnic minority communities foremost among them&#151;feel that they are subjected to a disproportionate number of ASBOs. Can we be sure that we are not discriminating against ethnic minorities in this process? Will specialist advisers in both departments be available to the eight local authorities which are part of the pilot?</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000137"></a>We need to be careful about the guidance we are drafting. The discretion that we are asking local authorities to exercise will be very difficult and potentially very damaging for the families to which  it is applied. I support intervention/prevention strategies to help the problem much more along the lines of Sheffield Hallam and the Dundee experience than going down this route.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000138"></a>Having said that, it is a question of value for money. There is a real chance that not much useful will be learnt from these pilots outside the eight regions in which they apply. It might be interesting to see what happens within those regions but, outside of them, I do not think best practice will be easily translatable because the context will be so different. The money should go to local schemes with a proven record of success in prevention rather than anything else. At the end of the day, penalties should be reserved for the criminal justice system and not used in the benefits system in the way that these regulations suggest.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000139"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07071797000188"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank the noble Lords, Lord Taylor and Lord Kirkwood, for their contributions. I acknowledge that there was a degree of scepticism from each of them about the value of the regulations, which I understand. It rolls on from our debates during the course of the Welfare Reform Bill.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000140"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked about the impact on families with children and those with mental health problems. Clearly, both of those are considerations to which the local authority will have to have regard when deciding whether to proceed with the sanctions. That is part of the important judgment that will have to be made.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000141"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked about funding. We are investing heavily in support services through the family intervention projects and other programmes. The projects are important in ensuring that significant resources already being spent on the families in question are co-ordinated and used to best effect. The Respect Task Force has established a national network of family intervention projects in more than 50 areas. The Department for Education and Skills has made an additional &#163;6 million available  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in 2007-08 to enable the new Respect areas announced on 22 January to invest in extra parenting provision to tackle and prevent anti-social behaviour. Ensuring that the most difficult and resistant households take up rehabilitation could help to reduce significantly the levels of anti-social behaviour. Money is being invested in those areas.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000142"></a>Five pilot areas have family intervention projects in place: Blackburn, Blackpool, Manchester, Newham and Wirral. Although this is just one model of support, each area is confident that it will have an appropriate array of support available.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000143"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked why those particular authorities were willing to take part&#151;although he partly answered his own question. They have each had anti-social behaviour evictions in their areas. I accept entirely that the base of the numbers is relatively small; nationally, we are looking at perhaps 1,500 people. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, raised that. Within the pilot areas, a relatively small number of people will be focused on. The other key element of the pilot sites is that they will have the support services available, which is very important.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000144"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said that we in the DWP were &#147;piloted out&#148;. I think that someone in the other place said he thought the DWP had more pilots than British Airways. That might be Ryanair; I do not know. The noble Lord said also that the sanction could last for five years and the pilots only for two. Clearly, everything comes to an end at the end of that two-year period.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000145"></a>It is correct that the pilots will be in England only. If we were to roll them out nationally, we would need to return to Parliament as necessary. If we were to do so, we would seek to apply the scheme to all of Great Britain.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000146"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked whether government departments have spoken to each other, because a number of players are involved in the sanctions. Yes, extensive close working between the DWP, the Respect Task Force and Communities and Local Government has taken place. We have also consulted lobby groups such as Mind and Shelter, which are working with us in drawing up the guidance.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000147"></a>I was asked whether someone would escape sanction if they moved out of a piloting area. It is inevitably the case that if we are piloting only in a few areas and somebody is outside, the scheme ceases to apply. As I said in my introductory remarks, the eviction, the sanction and the behaviour involved have to take place within one of the piloted areas, although not necessarily the same one. However, someone who was outside would not be covered.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0007.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000148"></a>Obviously the scheme will not be a success if we end up sanctioning lots of people, but we need to evaluate that. The evaluation will be independent and carried out by experts in this field of research.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000149"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, challenged whether the scheme was consistent with human rights legislation. The advice we have had is that it is. Our advisers look at all these things very carefully, which   


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC53"></a><b>17 July 2007 : Column GC53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is why I was able to make the statement that I did. The definition of hardship is fairly broad, and it is good that it is. The noble Lord may well be right that at the end of the day there are relatively few people to whom this might apply. Ultimately we want to sanction no one under these provisions, because we want people to take up the rehabilitation that is on offer.</p>

<a name="70717-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000150"></a>I hope I have covered most of the points that noble Lords have made. If not, they are welcome to have another go.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000151"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071797000189"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> I just want to go back to the report. In many ways, Parliament&#146;s task in looking at the success of the pilot will involve the way the report is presented. The Minister mentioned that in certain cases local authorities will be making judgments on how to proceed with cases that might involve hardship, mental illness or a risk to the welfare of children. I hope that when the evaluation is made those judgments will be part and parcel of it, so that we will be aware how frequently, and in what way, they have been made. That will help to give us a balanced view of just how effective the mechanism has been and to what extent it is able to deal with the greater problem, and how much of that problem is identifiable as being caused by other elements of anti-social behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="07071797000152"></a><b><a name="70717-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07071797000190"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I understand that point. It might help if I expand a little on what we will be

We will be seeking to establish whether local authorities feel it is a useful tool; whether the sanction is an effective incentive to take up rehabilitation; what resources are needed to set up and run it; its impact on anti-social behaviour; the impact on landlords; the effect on rent arrears; how it can best be operated; the impact on housing and homelessness; the impact on charities and voluntary bodies; and the profile of those sanctioned. As I said earlier, the evaluation will be independent and carried out by experts in the field. I accept that that will be an important part of the pilot. </p>

<a name="70717-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071797000153"></a>Households that have been evicted have clearly reached crisis point. Previous interventions have not resulted in the household obtaining the support it requires. If we do nothing we will be failing those households and the communities in which they live. As I have said, it is not the intention to sanction widely; the sanction is targeted at the most problematic households that have refused offers of help. It will provide local authorities with an additional tool to encourage households to address their behaviour. We strongly believe that the welfare state should combine rights with responsibilities, and the right to benefit can only come with a responsibility to behave with respect for others. This proposal strikes the right balance.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07071757000014"></a>I am today giving Parliament advance notice of a major consultation on children and young people's safety. Keeping children and young people safe is a top priority and the responsibility of us all. The consultation document, <I>Staying Safe</I>, seeks views from parents, children and young people, our partners and the children's workforce on the issues. I am today placing a copy of the document in both Libraries.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07071757000015"></a><I>Staying Safe</I> has been developed working across the Government and signals the Government's strong collective commitment to the safety of children. It has four key objectives. These are to:</p>
raise awareness of the importance of safeguarding children and young people;promote better understanding of safeguarding issues, and start to change behaviour towards children and young people, and their safety and welfare;ensure that safeguarding activity is coherent and effectively co-ordinated across the Government; andreinforce existing activity by proposing new actions to plug gaps or improve linkages.
<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07071757000016"></a>The consultation will run until 31 October 2007 including a range of activities for all interested parties to explore this vital area of work, and respond to the questions and issues set out in the consultation document. After the consultation, the Government will produce a response and decide on follow-up action.</p>

<a name="07071757000045"></a><b><a name="70717-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="07071757000235"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (James Plaskitt) has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="07071757000046"></a>The employment and social policy informal meeting was held on 5 to 7 July in Guimares, Portugal. I represented the UK.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="07071757000047"></a>The theme of the informal was &#147;improving policies, improving results&#148;, which was discussed in two plenary sessions. The discussions were informed by a paper presented by Maria Joo Rodrigues, who was involved in the formulation of the Lisbon strategy during the last Portuguese presidency.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="07071757000048"></a>Ministers discussed what the future priorities of the Lisbon strategy should be and how to make the open method of co-ordination (OMC) work better. There was broad agreement that the Lisbon goals were the right ones and that next year&#146;s review should avoid major changes to the strategy, as continuity was needed and would enable comparisons over time. Ministers believed that the focus should be on proper implementation and better exchange of good practice. A number of member states called for greater prominence to be given to the social dimension of Lisbon. On behalf of the UK, I made it clear that we should not reopen the employment guidelines and that the focus should remain on jobs and growth. I also emphasised that we needed to do more to tackle skills issues, as this is the key to helping people into work and ensuring their progression.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="07071757000049"></a>In terms of process, most felt that the OMC was a success. There was broad agreement that there should be no new instruments or processes. Suggestions for areas of greater focus were: education, skills and lifelong learning; making flexicurity work; increasing labour market participation (including active ageing, work-life balance, gender equality and childcare provision); fighting child poverty; making mobility in the EU work; and tackling the social impacts of migration.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="07071757000050"></a>Germany also suggested a one-off &#147;European social day&#148; where, for example, parliaments across the EU could discuss the EU&#146;s contribution to social policies on the same day. The idea received considerable support.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="07071757000053"></a>The review of pension scheme assets led by Andrew Young published its interim findings yesterday on  16 July.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="07071757000054"></a>The review team has worked hard to gather data and engage with stakeholders and I am grateful for its efforts and the co-operation of those who have contributed. The interim findings represent a significant improvement on our understanding of the circumstances of failed pension schemes and provide us with an evidence base on which to build policy in the future.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="07071757000055"></a>The assets review has made considerable progress in identifying the value of assets remaining in pension schemes that qualify for FAS and has stated that the current process of annuitisation on a scheme-by-scheme basis may not offer the best use of these assets. It concludes that it is probable that additional value for money could be secured through a number of different methods and the team will focus on investigating the feasibility of these options before it delivers its final conclusions later in the year. I welcome these interim findings and am hopeful that the work that the review team is to continue over the summer will enable us to increase the value of assistance that FAS is able to offer without further calls on public funds.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="07071757000056"></a>The potential for any increase will, of course, depend on the value of assets available. While it is too early to say with any certainty that the review will lead to a means of improving FAS above the promised  80 per cent level (subject to the cap), it is hopeful that this is the case. In the mean time, the Government&#146;s position has always been (and remains) that trustees must act in the best interests of their members, but trustees may wish to take into account the effect that the decisions that they take about winding up their scheme may have on the amount of assets potentially available to increase assistance levels.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="07071757000057"></a>It is important that trustees continue with the processes of wind-up, including data cleansing and determination of asset share. They should also continue to pay interim pensions to members as they reach normal retirement age and co-operate with the Financial Assistance Scheme operational unit to ensure initial payments can be made from age 65.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="07071757000059"></a>The recent flooding has brought widespread damage to large areas of central and northern England.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="07071757000060"></a>The Government are very grateful to the committed staff in schools, early years and childcare settings and local authorities who have worked so hard to contain and reduce the effect of the flood waters, to get many schools and early years settings back in use and to provide places in temporary or alternative accommodation where necessary.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="07071757000061"></a>In the flood-hit regions, numbers of schools that lost teaching days included 91 in Kingston upon Hull, 72 in East Riding, 72 in Doncaster, 66 in Sheffield, 27 in Lincolnshire, six in Nottinghamshire, four in Derbyshire and two in Rotherham. Only eight of Kingston upon Hull&#146;s 99 school sites were unaffected&#151;65 primary schools, 13 secondary schools, 10 special units and three nurseries were all temporarily closed. Nine sites were still closed last week. The local authority has found temporary premises for the children affected. Kingston upon Hull calculates that the flooding resulted in losing 107,000 pupil days, but prompt action by the schools and council avoided losing up to 90,000 more. In Doncaster, six schools were damaged and closed at some point, but only one is still closed. In the east Midlands, five schools have all their pupils in temporary premises.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="07071757000062"></a>Our main aim is to help as many of these schools and early years settings as possible to reopen at permanent premises by the start of the September term and, where that is not possible, to help to ensure satisfactory alternative arrangements so that no child suffers educationally because of flood damage. There is still an immense amount of hard work to do. The immediate dangers are over, but every child and young person and their parents will rightly expect no let-up in efforts to get back to normal as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="07071757000063"></a>To that end, my department is working closely with the regional government offices and local authorities to:</p>
assess fully the extent of the damage to schools and early years and childcare provision (including children&#146;s centres), both buildings and equipment;assess the impact that the floods have had on children and young people&#146;s ability to learn and make the progress that we expect (this includes any impact on examinations or course work); andtake decisions on how best to get children back into proper permanent educational accommodation.
<a name="70717-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="07071757000064"></a>Already the Government have allocated &#163;14 million and have widened the rules on Bellwin funds to deal with flood damage. In addition, my department will make available an initial sum of &#163;10 million for flood-affected schools and children&#146;s services. My officials, with colleagues from government offices, will hold detailed discussions on an area-by-area/case-by-case basis to determine how best to provide both interim and long-term solutions. As part of these discussions, we will:</p>
 determine how best we can use and, if necessary, rephase the significant capital investment planned over the next five years to address the needs of the schools most affected;

exam boards, asking them to ensure that, where exams were disrupted, cases seeking special consideration are dealt with promptly and with due consideration; andOfsted, asking for inspections to take proper account of the disruption and loss of school days and records caused by the floods.

<a name="70717-wms0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_201"></a><a name="07071757000223"></a>I wish to inform the House that the UK intends to make a contribution of &#163;3 million to the Palestinian Authority (PA). This will go towards paying private sector arrears of around &#163;225 million accrued by the PA. Combined with a &#163;3 million contribution to the temporary international mechanism (TIM) in May, a &#163;1 million contribution to the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross and a &#163;15.6 million payment to the UN Relief and Works Agency in April, this brings the UK&#146;s total bilateral spend this financial year to &#163;22.6 million.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_202"></a><a name="07071757000224"></a>The last year has seen a deterioration of the chronic economic decline in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israel has withheld clearance revenues owed to the PA, leading to the PA having to reduce or stop entirely the payment of civil servant salaries. At the same time, the PA has run up significant debts with private sector suppliers. This has in turn reduced investment, thereby further shrinking the productive capacity of the economy.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_203"></a><a name="07071757000225"></a>Israel has now agreed to transfer the customs revenue, allowing the Government to pay salaries again. However, the large backlog of public debt remains unpaid. The Prime Minister, Salaam Fayyad, has requested international support to address this.Direct international assistance through the Palestinian Authority&#146;s central treasury account will boost the economy and make clear international approval for Fayyad&#146;s Government. It will also increase Palestinian companies&#146; ability to continue trading and so invest and employ more people.</p>

<a name="70717-wms0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_204"></a><a name="07071757000226"></a>In the past year, DfID has provided &#163;15 million out of a total of &#163;265 million committed through the TIM. This has successfully stemmed the economic decline in the Occupied Palestinian Territories from a projected 27 per cent to around 10 per cent. The quartet recently extended the TIM until the end of September. It has already been aligned with the Ministry of Finance to enable full salaries to be paid to public sector workers. Following the creation of the emergency Government in June, DfID can now resume direct financial assistance.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_205"></a><a name="07071757000227"></a>The UK is working with President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad as they seek to make the Palestinian Authority more responsive to the urgent needs of all Palestinians. But ultimately the only way

In the coming months, proposals will be developed and discussed across the Government to ensure that bulk ANPR data sharing with the police is subject to a robust regulatory regime that ensures reasonable transparency and scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_15"></a>Further to the Written Answer by Lord Truscott on 26 June (<I>WA 131</I>) (a) from what sources they sought legal advice that Article 95 of the Treaty of Rome enabled mobile phone roaming charges to be fixed throughout the European Union; (b) what tests were applied to ensure that the decision to fix roaming charges was compatible with the principles of subsidiarity; and (c) whether this decision is compatible with World Trade Organisation obligations under Article XVII of the General Agreement on Trade in Services.

The regulation, while introducing average wholesale price caps that must be met by operators when they procure roaming capacity from one another, does not fix prices as such; instead, it introduces a tariff that has to be offered to all roaming customers (the Euro tariff) with maximum rates for incoming and outgoing calls made.</p>

<a name="70717w0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_23"></a><a name="07071772000087"></a>Throughout the discussions and negotiation pertaining to this regulation, the Government have sought legal advice on all matters to the extent thought necessary and appropriate.</p>

<a name="70717w0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_24"></a><a name="07071772000088"></a>As regards subsidiarity, the national authorities responsible for regulating the telecommunications markets have found themselves unable to effect a reduction in roaming charges. This has resulted from the cross-border nature of the telecoms market in general and, in particular, the necessarily international interconnections between networks, which enable the making of roaming calls. It was also necessary to ensure that a common, Community-wide approach was adopted, so that operators could operate in a single coherent regulatory framework.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_25"></a><a name="07071772000089"></a>In these circumstances, it was considered appropriate for the EU to intervene and to act in order to procure the desired benefits. The Government are therefore satisfied that the principle of subsidiarity has been adhered to.</p>

In its covering letter on the November 2006 mission on import controls, the FVO stated that in the absence of progress on new facilities it would be recommending that Heathrow be removed from the list of border inspection posts (BIP) approved to handle products not intended for human consumption (NHC).</p>
