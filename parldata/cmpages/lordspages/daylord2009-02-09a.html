Currently, National Express East Coast is responding to approximately 94 per cent of correspondence within agreed timescales and is putting measures in place to remedy this situation.</p>

In terms of the statistics on punctuality on National Express East Coast, the proportion of trains arriving within 10 minutes of their scheduled time has increased from 81.2 per cent to 85.7 per cent in the past 12 months and the independent national passenger survey of customers&#146; overall satisfaction with the franchise for the autumn stood at 88 per cent, up from 84 per cent in the spring of 2008.

They made no request for government assistance, nor did they indicate any intention of cutting train services.</p>

I heard what the Minister said about the speed of the trains. Indeed, it is very good. However, the quality of service is also important. If the Minister did not specify in the contract that the quality of the service, on first class, certainly, was part of the franchise, that is a real defect. The service has been deeply degraded and does not now give value for money. It was an outstanding service when GNER had it, but is now third rate.</p>

If she wishes to make particular points to me about service quality, I will, of course, look at them. In terms of service punctuality, which is a key issue for passengers, punctuality on the east coast main line has improved and independent surveys of passenger satisfaction show that it is rising, not falling, on the east coast main line.</p>

Does he agree that actions of that sort bear most heavily on the infirm, the handicapped and the elderly? Is it not the case that it drives a coach and horses through the Government&#146;s avowed intention of getting people out of their cars and making a carbon-friendly gesture? I declare an interest as someone who commutes on South West Trains three or four times a week.</p>

The noble Viscount rightly refers to the position in respect of South West Trains. As he may be aware, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State and I had to make a decision recently on a request by South West Trains for a significant cut-back in the staffing of ticket offices and their opening hours. We rejected a substantial proportion of the request for reduced opening hours in ticket offices in the South West Trains franchise area for the reasons that the noble Lord gave in terms of the duty that we have to see that there is widespread, easy access to tickets and that passengers are not unduly inconvenienced.</p>

The train left on time, it arrived in London on time, and I had a very comfortable journey. But does the Minister accept that we are very concerned about the reduction in the catering facilities on National Express? It has closed the dining car, except on very limited occasions, and even the snacks are not up to standard. I am no longer able to get my usual: a tomato juice and a tuna sandwich.</p>

Until the last part of the noble Lord&#146;s question, I thought that he would be fronting our next advertising campaign for the railways. On the catering on the east coast main line, the noble Lord is correct to say that there has been a reduction in the number of restaurant cars. They have been replaced by an at-seat dining service, which makes the dining facilities more readily available to passengers than was the case when they were available only in the restaurant car.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="0902091000015"></a>I have perused the menu of the at-seat dining service, so solicitous am I for the noble Lord&#146;s welfare. He can choose between crayfish and chorizo risotto, Italian brunch, and steak sandwich served with Italian mixed leaves, not to mention the east coast fish pie. The wine list is not bad either. There is a 2006 Merlot, a Shiraz 2005, a Cabernet Sauvignon 2006 and, if the noble Lord really wants to treat himself, there is also a Laurent-Perrier, although I have to say that that comes at &#163;45.

Seven out of every 10 practices currently offer extra appointments outside normal working hours. That proportion continues to increase.</p>

I endorse the fact that GP services are improving&#151;my own service in Brighton is exemplary. However, does he acknowledge that there are some worrying regional variations in the extension of opening hours? Is he concerned that this might lead to greater inequalities in healthcare provision than already exist between deprived and affluent areas?</p>

As for inequalities, the extra &#163;100 million that the Government have invested includes provision for setting up 112 traditional primary care practices to tackle inequalities. That is in addition to our attempts to develop the quality of care provided in deprived areas through improvements in the QOF scores.</p>

I could not agree more with the noble Baroness that flexibility is an important part of that. I am delighted to report that nearly 70 per cent of patients can also book the specific general practitioner whom they wish to visit.</p>

When I was involved in running the health service in London there was a major problem in that certain areas were not safe for general practitioners to go to after certain hours.

I agree that it was an issue, and it is why 10 regions around the country have considered the acute pathway in designing services around the needs of patients out of hours, possibly including a dedicated telephone number by which a patient can be evaluated and the appropriate expertise sent in an out-of-hours visit to meet the needs of the patient.</p>

The answer is that we have negotiated contractually with the BMA to ensure that within each area there are certainly a number of practices that might offer extended opening hours. I have no doubt that collaboration at local level will allow a degree of flexibility.</p>

That is one the reasons why I am standing up now. Does that not reflect the fact that in this area of operation of the health service there is actually widespread approval of what the Government have been doing? People will quickly raise queries and complaints when they are there. It is not just in this area of the health service; as a general proposition, it holds true that while people may make generalised complaints, their own experience of the health service is one of overwhelming support for the doctors and nurses and for what the Government have been doing.</p>

Indeed, this continues to move ahead. The savings that have already been introduced have an estimated value of &#163;1.25 billion to &#163;1.5 billion per annum.

However, I share the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, about the termination of pension fund benefits and I am sure those working in the public sector would have been alarmed by the comments attributed to Mr David Cameron when he spoke to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce in November and said he proposed to phase out public sector defined benefit pension plans.</p>

Does the Minister accept that if that were applied across the whole of the economy, it would mean that something like 30 per cent of our GDP was being spent on pension contributions?

The most important factor to recognise is that the total cost of public sector pension provision is currently of the order of 1.5 per cent of public expenditure per annum and is not projected to rise above 2 per cent in the next 50 years.</p>

When my noble friend talks about cost-sharing, could he tell the House whether he has in mind the option of career-average pension contributions, which would fully protect the pensions of the lower paid but ensure that those who have very sharp increases in pay at the end of their working life do not then receive a pension that is disproportionate to the contributions they have made and put in?</p>

That is the figure on which we should focus and why we hope that the Conservatives will continue to support our proposals in the Pensions Act 2008, including the proposals for personal pensions and personal accounts.</p>

We were grateful for the Government agreeing to take issues away and to the usual channels for allowing these issues to be debated again today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="0902091000065"></a>Report concluded on the evening of Tuesday last week, and we had to table our amendments for the outstanding issues ahead of final discussions with the Government and before sight of their own amendments. This means some inevitable duplication between our own amendments and the Government&#146;s, but I hope that it does not inconvenience the House.</p>

<a name="90209-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="0902091000066"></a>Amendment 1 is one such amendment. The Government have tabled Amendment 2 in this group. An issue that I have raised throughout our consideration of this Bill is that the need to achieve continuity of banking services is absent from the objectives of the special resolution regime. This concern has been expressed largely by the British Bankers&#146; Association, but it is supported by consumer groups. Modern life is dependent on continuity of banking services; it is as simple as that.</p>

<a name="90209-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="0902091000067"></a>My Amendment 1 is to objective 3 of the special resolution regime, which is set out in Clause 4(6). Objective 3 is about the protection of depositors, which clearly overlaps with the issue of banking services. There is a link here to the separate proposals being pursued by the Financial Services Authority, which are aimed at speeding up payments to depositors via the Financial Services Compensation Scheme in the event of bank failure. However, the BBA believes that unnecessary costs may be imposed by the FSA if

<a name="90209-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="0902091000068"></a>To this extent, therefore, I am pleased that the Government have, with their Amendment 2, accepted the principle of placing the continuity of banking services in the Bill. I will, of course, let the Minister speak to his own amendment in a moment. While we understand the link between the Government&#146;s amendment and objective 1, namely the stability of financial systems, we remain concerned that the FSA will take insufficient account of the continuity of banking services when it pursues changes to the FSCS aimed at depositors alone. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure the House that the FSA will be mindful of the banking continuity requirement, which, as a result of the Government&#146;s amendment, will now be an explicit part of the special resolution regime. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s comments. In the mean time, I beg to move.</p>

Noble Lords will be aware that the Government have tabled an amendment of their own on this subject and that there is now little, if any, difference between us. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for the strength with which she has urged the case for continuity, and I am pleased that we have been able to accept the validity of her arguments and incorporate them into our amendment.</p>

<a name="90209-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="0902091000070"></a>As the noble Baroness said, the issue here relates to continuity of banking services. I spoke at length on this matter both in Committee and on Report. Noble Lords will be relieved to hear that I do not wish to return to these arguments in full, but I will summarise the Government&#146;s opinion on these points. The Bill already includes, at its heart, provisions aimed at ensuring continuity of services. The very purpose of the stabilisation tools of the special resolution regime is to ensure that banks do not fail completely, thereby maintaining full continuity of banking services. This is reflected both in the objectives set out in Clause 4 and the draft code of practice, which explains them.</p>

<a name="90209-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0902091000071"></a>That said, the Government are, as always, prepared to listen to the views of the House and to respond as constructively as possible. We have therefore tabled an amendment that meets the concerns expressed on Report. This amendment makes it expressly clear that the special resolution objective includes the concept of continuity of banking services. Noble Lords will note that this is included as part of objective 1, to protect and enhance the stability of the financial systems in the UK. As I have said, the continuity of banking systems is implied in different ways in each of the first three objectives. Therefore, in making explicit provision for the continuity of banking services, we have done so under the broadest of them. To be absolutely clear, this drafting is entirely consistent with the fact that this concept also relates to the objectives of protecting and enhancing confidence in the banking systems, and of protecting depositors.</p>

<a name="90209-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0902091000072"></a>I also make it clear that continuity of banking services is not the only element to be considered under objective 1. The amendment does not, therefore, limit  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_949"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 949</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the scope of that objective in any way. However, the amendment now makes it explicit in the Bill that this concept is at least one of the elements that needs to be considered. I hope this demonstrates, once again, the Government&#146;s commitment to listening to the views of the House and responding constructively. I will therefore, most respectfully and&#151;to take the names of two horses in the 5 o&#146;clock at Kempton this afternoon&#151;in a way that is both Faintly Hopeful and with a Straight Face, ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment. If she will do so, I will move the government amendment which I have just described.</p>

<a name="90209-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0902091000073"></a>The noble Baroness asked me one question relating to the FSA. The authorities must have regard to all the objectives. This includes objective 1, which now references continuity of service and objective 3 on protection of depositors. I believe that the introduction of the continuity of service is something that the FSA will need to take into careful consideration in framing all its policy responses to the Bill. Therefore, I hope that my answer provides the comfort that the noble Baroness sought in her question.</p>

There is a clear difference between Amendment 1 and Amendment 2. Does the Minister regard the ability of depositors to get their deposits back as part of banking services? I should have thought that that was something rather different. It is not a service, as such. The Minister&#146;s amendment does not seem to refer to the position of depositors getting their money back.</p>

With this amendment, we return to matters relating to Clause 75, which it is fair to say has occasioned some degree of controversy and which has been rather less well received by the House thus far.</p>

<a name="90209-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0902091000078"></a>We have come a long way with this debate. I believe that the Government have made the case for the power to change the law and for the particular aspect of the retrospective dimension contained in the clause, which I know causes anxiety in the House. I appreciate that concerns remain, but I hope and believe that we are reaching a point of consensus on this important clause.</p>

<a name="90209-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0902091000079"></a>I do not intend at this point to delve into the substance of Clause 75. I think that arises from the important amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, and the other noble Lords who support him. The reason why I am speaking first in this important debate, which largely revolves around the amendments in the noble Lord&#146;s name, is simply because we have a technical government amendment at the start of the group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0902091000080"></a>I shall reserve my arguments on the substantive issues until the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, and those who support him have had the chance to deploy their case and their anxieties about the Government&#146;s position, which I shall of course respond to and hope to allay, while moving a technical amendment which is likely to occasion very little controversy. I hope, in due course, that the House will see fit to support the amendment. Meanwhile, the major debate will take place on the amendment to which the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, will speak.</p>

During our consideration of Clause 75 on Report, the Minister undertook to conduct discussions on issues arising from the clause. I am most grateful to him for his characteristic courtesy in arranging those discussions on a timely and inclusive basis.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0902091000082"></a>Retrospectivity and the role of the Executive in exercising statutory powers go to the heart of constitutional government. The use of the word &#147;desirable&#148; in addition to &#147;necessary&#148;, while not unknown in law, is not easy, if indeed possible, to find in legislation with retrospective effect. I shall not reiterate at length the arguments that were rehearsed on Report. Your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the Constitution reported to the House on the matter, and I wrote to the Minister and asked for the Government&#146;s view on whether the broad wording of Clause 75(3) could be  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_951"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 951</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>limited in terms of retrospective powers, and whether they could give illustrations of circumstances in which the powers might be exercised.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0902091000083"></a>Noble Lords will await the Minister's substantive further explanation of why the Government should take powers to repeal, disapply or otherwise amend Acts of Parliament, delegated legislation or the common law, and how such action, if exercised, should be subject to parliamentary control, and the circumstances in which such potential actions are envisaged by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="0902091000084"></a><b><a name="90209-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0902091000341"></a>Lord Morris of Aberavon:</b> My Lords, I, too, am most grateful to my noble friend for giving of his time last Thursday to discuss our concerns. We appreciate his patience, and&#151;I repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, said&#151;his characteristic courtesy.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0902091000085"></a>Retrospective legislation is undoubtedly needed in this context. To envisage the extent and nature of all the facts that it might be necessary to cater for in a fast-moving situation demands retrospective legislation, much as I object to it generally. We have to prepare ourselves for such cases and be able to deal with that fast-moving situation.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0902091000086"></a>The Minister may think it is extraneous, but there is a great deal of public concern about what is happening in the banking field. It crosses my mind whether this particular retrospective power might be used for the situation that is causing that concern; namely, the payment of huge bonuses for which the Government seem to say that because there are existing contractual obligations, then nothing can be done about it. I hope that I have misinterpreted what they are saying, but it would appeal to the public if retrospective legislation may have to be used. The Minister may be able to help me on that.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0902091000087"></a>I return briefly to the arguments put by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, which we adumbrated on Report. We all understand the word &#147;necessary&#148;. There is a compelling reason for such a matter. &#147;Desirable&#148; is a wholly different matter. It may be necessary for me to do something in the course of a working day when it is desirable. Whether I desire it or whether somebody else desires it is another matter. That is the difference between ourselves and the cross-party committee, which has considered this matter in great detail and is concerned about whether the Government have gone a step too far.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0902091000088"></a>The Minister was asked, in col. 567 of <I>Hansard</I> of 3 February, to help the House by describing the type of situation that might not be covered by the word &#147;necessary&#148;. The example he gave&#151;I emphasise that it was the only example that he could give on that day&#151;was where there was a drafting error and, because of confusion or uncertainty, it would be difficult to rely on the word &#147;necessary&#148; alone. With respect to my noble friend, I found that explanation singularly unpersuasive. It is curious if that is the only example that the Government can give. They have had time now to think about the matter and I hope that they will do better. However, I would have thought that the example of a drafting error presented the strongest possible case for the use of the word &#147;necessary&#148;, because nothing else is required. In our experience of legislation, we have seen drafting errors made, and  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_952"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 952</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they have had to be corrected. In my experience, those are usually matters that Parliament is prepared to deal with on the nod, because it is obvious when a word like &#147;not&#148; or &#147;where&#148; has been left out, and easy to understand that there is no intention to legislate in that form. If that is the best example that can be given, it is the weakest that I have come across.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0902091000089"></a>Secondly, I ask the Government to give one example&#151;I know we pressed the Minister very hard and he was extremely patient&#151;of where any Government have thought it necessary to use the belt-and-braces approach of using both words, &#147;necessary&#148; and &#147;desirable&#148;. The Minister had had no warning of this and could not give such an example. He has cohorts of advisers and brought a large number with him to our meeting. There was hardly space in the room to house what seemed like the whole British labour force&#151;certainly there were British jobs for a large number of people on that Thursday afternoon. They have had the weekend to reflect&#151;the great minds of the Treasury, their huge legal resources, parliamentary counsel&#151;and I hope that they have come forward with not one but a whole host of examples of situations where they have had to use &#147;necessary&#148; and &#147;desirable&#148;. That would be a valuable precedent for us to consider in this instance.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0902091000090"></a>I believe&#151;unless I am advised to the contrary, and I am prepared to listen&#151;that the Government are breaking new ground. I will emphasise one point. In this difficult, contentious field of relying on retrospective legislation, and introducing legislation to cover retrospection, the Government need very forceful arguments that the word &#147;desirable&#148; is necessary. We suggested that, in order to avoid the open-ended nature of &#147;desirable&#148;&#151;which in my view is a blank cheque&#151;that some other words might be suggested. The words put forward in Amendment 21 are,</p>
<ul><a name="0902091000233"></a>&#147;if there are compelling reasons to do so&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0902091000200"></a>They appear to limit the open-ended nature of &#147;desirable&#148;. They certainly put the onus on the Executive when they seek to rely on this. It is very close to, if not almost the same as, &#147;necessary&#148;.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0902091000091"></a>The Government have listened. I hope that they will come forward with some proposals that meet our concerns about the fact that the word &#147;desirable&#148;, without some qualification, is not one that I am prepared to accept easily.</p>

Like the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, I see the force of the Government&#146;s argument that the Treasury needs to be able to introduce provisions with retrospective effect, because such is the speed with which complex action may be required that later retrospective orders may be necessary in order to address problems which then arise. None of that is in dispute.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0902091000093"></a>However, your Lordships&#146; Constitution Committee was not persuaded that a retrospective power of the breadth contained in the Bill is appropriate&#151;in particular, that Ministers should have the power to make orders with retrospective effect, not merely where this is thought by the Treasury to be necessary, but even if it  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_953"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 953</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is thought by the Treasury to be desirable. I emphasise that the power to act is where the Treasury considers it to be necessary; there is no question of the Treasury having to persuade a court.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0902091000094"></a>The leading textbook, <I>Craies on Legislation</I>, states at page 433 that it is,</p>
<ul><a name="0902091000234"></a>&#147;a principle accepted by successive governments that retrospectivity should be avoided except where necessary&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0902091000201"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, said, Ministers have hitherto been unable to identify any previous occasion when Ministers have been given power to make orders with retrospective effect when they did not think it necessary to do so.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0902091000095"></a>I still have considerable difficulty envisaging in what circumstances it could be appropriate to exercise the exceptional powers of the sort conferred by Clause 75(3) if the Treasury did not think it &#147;necessary&#148; to do so&#151;in other words, if there were to be a reasonable alternative. I note that Clause 75(8) is drafted in terms of necessity. I do not understand why Clause 75(3), by contrast, confers a broader power.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0902091000096"></a>This is an important matter. I ask the Minister to consider again the constitutional implications of the quite unprecedented powers which he is asking the House to confer.</p>

I spent five years in the Treasury, and I am sure that it will come up with a response that might just be suitable. I have a Question on the Order Paper tomorrow about banks, and I might be saved a lot of time on at least one aspect if I get a fuller reply now from my noble friend Lord Davies.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0902091000098"></a>No one who has who had anything to do with retrospective legislation likes it at all. I certainly do not like it. The Treasury has tried to come up with a reply, and to some extent it has managed to tell us something and to give some concession in the area. However, my noble and learned friend Lord Morris thought that it might just be that the Treasury had in mind retrospection regarding bonuses. That might be popular with the general public if the powers were even retrospective, but is that the only issue that the Treasury had in mind? Perhaps if my noble friend Lord Davies can give us some idea of where the Treasury, or some Treasury officials who are ingenious on these matters, could come up with some alternative areas of retrospection that they might wish to use, it would be helpful in reducing the length of my supplementary question tomorrow on banks. That might please my noble friend Lord Myners. So many questions arise on what banks are doing and what the Government are doing in relation to them; I could be asking such questions tomorrow although, if at all possible, I would like to limit my supplementary question. I hope that my noble friend could give us some idea of other areas that the Government had in mind and whether they might be thinking of using retrospective action. Amendment 22, the Government&#146;s proposed amendment to deal with it, simply says,</p>
<ul><a name="0902091000235"></a>&#147;but in relying on this subsection, the Treasury shall have regard to the fact that it is in the public interest to avoid retrospective legislation&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="0902091000202"></a>But that is the Treasury having it in mind. What the Treasury has or does not have in mind is not necessarily what the rest of us might have in mind.

That would be of great interest to your Lordships&#146; House. The Constitution Committee, which is now becoming much more active under the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, on important public interest issues, is clearly concerned&#151;rightly&#151;about retrospective legislation as it is important. As I say, I am interested to hear from my noble friend what the Treasury might have in mind.</p>

I will not be able to give him the response that he wanted, save in so far as to say that any variation of a director&#146;s contractual entitlements would be affected under provisions such as Clause 20, in respect of banks subject to special resolution, and not under this clause. Clause 75 will not be needed here, nor could it be used. I am prepared to wager that that will shorten my noble friend Lord Barnett&#146;s Question tomorrow, and make the task of my noble friend who replies to it that much the easier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0902091000102"></a>I looked very carefully at the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and can give him an assurance on it. I hope to spell out exactly what Clause 75(3) will do and to put it into context so that he can see why we should safeguard against the anxiety that he expressed&#151;the proper anxiety that someone might become an unintended victim of powers which we never intended to use in those terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0902091000103"></a>Throughout the debates in Committee and on Report, as well as in our meeting last Thursday, noble Lords rightly sought to ascertain exactly what the retrospective power under Clause 75 will be used for. On Report, this debate coalesced around subsection (3), which provides that the Treasury may use the power if it considers it either,</p>

<p><a name="0902091000203"></a>under Part 1. The Constitution Committee under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, had already made it clear&#151;the noble Lord reinforced the point in the Chamber both today and on Report&#151;that only by considering examples of how the Treasury intends to use the power could the House come to a reasoned view on whether the power was justified. I gave a number of examples on Report, although I am not sure that they impressed any members of the committee; my noble and learned friend Lord Morris indicated today that they certainly did not impress him.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0902091000104"></a>I said on Report that the Government could not amend the power to the extent that it would become unusable. That remains the Government&#146;s position, from which we cannot move. However, in response to the concerns that have been expressed on the several occasions when these issues have been considered, we have brought forward amendments today in order to delineate this power more carefully. In the process, it is necessary to correct some drafting problems with this clause. When I have finished dealing with the substantive arguments that have been deployed today, to which I am under an obligation to respond, I will talk about the amendments that my noble friend Lord Myners has tabled to help to solve these drafting problems. However, those are within the framework of the main case that I am about to deploy.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0902091000105"></a>Let me remind the House of the existing public law limits on the use of Clause 75(3). I will then look in detail at the amendments that have been put forward and finally I will come to the government amendments. In our debates so far, I have focused on justifying the existence of Clause 75 per se and, in particular, the presence of subsection (3), which confers the retrospective power and which has been the focus of anxieties. We have had wide-ranging debates, but I do not believe that we have yet addressed in full the existing constraints on this retrospective power or how we can enhance the safeguards around the use of the power. That is what I hope to do today.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0902091000106"></a>The constraint on the use of the power provided for in the Bill&#151;the &#147;necessary or desirable&#148; test, on which this debate is focused&#151;is not, of course, the only limit on the use of the retrospective power. There is a significant risk that the use of a retrospective power can give rise to unfairness and it must not be undertaken lightly. I want to reassure noble Lords that Ministers and the Treasury, in preparing this Bill, have been all too well aware of the anxieties of this House. I almost said, &#147;of this House in particular&#148;, but that would be grossly unfair to our colleagues in the other place. However, there was no doubt that this House would express anxieties about retrospective legislation, and so it has proven.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0902091000107"></a>We should recognise that the retrospective power in the Bill does not exist in a vacuum; it exists within a highly developed constitutional framework. It is important to recognise the range of constraints on the use of the power. Not all these appear on the face of the Bill, nor would noble Lords expect them to.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_956"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 956</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90209-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0902091000108"></a>First, there are the convention rights. Article 7 is an absolute bar on the retrospective imposition of criminal offences or the increase in penalties. The use of this particular retrospective power may also engage Article 1 of the first protocol: the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property. Retrospective interference with property rights needs particularly careful justification, where the action must be proportionate to the public interest pursued. The range of cases where it will be compatible with the convention rights to interfere retrospectively with the property rights protected by Article 1 of the first protocol is very limited.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0902091000109"></a>Secondly, the Government have a duty to act reasonably. What &#147;reasonably&#148; means in practice will, of course, depend on the context. The more unusual or potentially unfair the proposed course of action, the more it will be necessary to justify, by way of reason, any government action. I speak as a layman. Several noble Lords who spoke in the debate are distinguished lawyers, but I have no claim at all to expertise in the law. But in layman&#146;s terms: if the Government are proposing to legislate with retrospective effect they need to be especially reasonable when they do so.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0902091000110"></a>I should like to elaborate a little on how this second point relates to the amendments in front of us today. Since Report stage the Government have been involved in intensive discussions on how to put further limitations on Clause 75 in order to allay concerns expressed by noble Lords both on Report and in the work of the Constitution Committee. As part of that we have looked very seriously indeed at the form of words that the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, proposes in Amendment 21, which seeks to introduce a &#147;compelling reasons&#148; test to the retrospective power. We have gone back to our parliamentary draftsman on this point.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0902091000111"></a>In light of the intensive discussions that we have had, we consider that there are difficulties with this form of wording in the amendment. The requirement to have &#147;compelling reasons&#148; for legislating with retrospective effect in effect mirrors the effect of existing administrative law. Put differently, even as the text stands, the Treasury could enact retrospective legislation only if it had compelling reasons to do so. So adding these words to the text would not add anything of substance. In a sense, the Government&#146;s reasons have got to be compelling. A reason that is not compelling is simply no reason at all for a power of this kind, constrained in the ways that I have sought to make explicit.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0902091000112"></a>A further difficulty with the amendment is that spelling out the &#147;compelling reasons&#148; test in this legislation would in fact lead to doubt about many other cases where the rules of administrative law require&#151;as we would anticipate&#151;strong reasons for acting but where no express reference to compelling reason is found elsewhere. It would therefore be undesirable for us to introduce it into this clause.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0902091000113"></a>The third constraint on the exercise of retrospective powers is the Government&#146;s respect for the rule of law and legal certainty. Despite the rather critical&#151;I would not go so far as to say cynical&#151;comments that may  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_957"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 957</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sometimes be made in response to such statements, the Government always take very seriously their duty to act fairly and appropriately. We fully recognise the values of fairness and legal certainty, values which are the bedrock of the common law system of justice in this country.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0902091000114"></a>Therefore, in considering whether retrospective legislation is appropriate, we will reflect not just on whether legislative proposals are compatible with convention rights or are intra vires of enabling powers but also on whether the proposed exercise of the power satisfies standards of fairness and propriety. I cannot emphasise strongly enough that we do not take retrospective legislation lightly.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0902091000115"></a>As I said on Report, there are also measures in the Bill that should provide reassurance on how Clause 75 will be used. Subsection (1) of the clause requires the Treasury in exercising Clause 75 in any case, including cases where the power is exercised retrospectively, to have regard to the special resolution objectives. These are defined clearly and precisely under Clause 4, and they are another great limiting factor on the context within which this retrospective legislation might be deployed.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0902091000116"></a>Of course, the Government recognise that these public law constraints may not be enough to provide sufficient certainty. We also accept that the House has not been reassured by the restrictions implicit in the special resolution objectives to which I have alluded. We recognise that we need to go further. The Government have looked seriously at the noble Lord&#146;s Amendment 21 because we agree with the thrust of the argument that there must be &#147;compelling reasons&#148; for the use of the retrospective power. However, as I said, we cannot agree to the amendment because it simply reiterates existing public law requirements on necessity with the undesirable side-effect that it may call these requirements into question in other contexts where they have not been explicitly set out in powers enabling administrative action.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0902091000117"></a>We want to add something material to the range of existing constraints, which I have just described, and to avoid the potential for casting doubt on the existing safeguards provided by public law. We believe that Amendment 22 does just that, by positively affirming the public interest in avoiding retrospection.</p>

<a name="90209-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0902091000118"></a>Before I come on to the detail of the government amendment, I should like to comment a little further on Amendment 20. I think that it would help if I gave an account of the original drafting of the text. I am reluctant to detain the House for as long as I was obliged to do on Report, when I sought to give examples of where the Treasury might consider it necessary to use the retrospective power. However, I should like to expand briefly on why we need to retain the word &#147;desirable&#148;, given that the Treasury considers those examples &#147;necessary&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0902091000119"></a>One example that I gave on Report is the possibility that the resolution of a bank might raise issues that had never been dealt with before and that, in the process of making the order, we might miss something, running the risk that the directors of the bank or other third party could be subject to a regulatory penalty or even a criminal sanction. The prospect of a person  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_958"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 958</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>being exposed to a penalty in such cases is obviously unpalatable. The penalty may have occurred as a direct result of the transfer, rather than any action by the person subject to the penalty. He may have had no knowledge of the sanction and may not have been in a position to avoid it. I argue that under this circumstance it would be common sense and reasonable to use the retrospective power, but would it really be necessary in the strictest sense of the word? The person may be perfectly able to satisfy the penalty or be easily able to pay the fine, for example. Either way, the trouble with the word &#147;necessary&#148; in that sense is that there could be legal uncertainty, and we are anxious about any dubiety regarding how the Bill will operate when it becomes an Act. In other examples&#151;I give way to the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="0902091000120"></a><b><a name="90209-0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0902091000346"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</b> My Lords, I feel for the Minister having to reply since he is not legally qualified, as he said, but I have difficulty with what he is now saying because the European Court of Human Rights has made it clear that the test as he has outlined it under Strasbourg Convention law is a test of objective necessity, of whether there is a pressing social need or a fair balance struck in terms of proportionality. That is taken care of in the Bill as it stands by the reference to necessity. When one gets to &#147;or desirable&#148; not only does that breach legal certainty, but it flies in the face of the Strasbourg case law where the court has made it clear in cases such as the <I>Sunday Times</I> thalidomide case that the test is not one of reasonableness but of pressing social need and necessity. I wonder whether this could be thought of again because, quite apart from the other proposed amendments, it seems to me that the words &#147;or desirable&#148; are not compatible with what the convention requires. They create legal uncertainty and the example given by the Minister ought to be able to be taken care of by the test of necessity. For my part, I am very troubled by that part of the Minister&#146;s answer. I do not, of course, expect him to be able to come back right away with an answer to that.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0902091000121"></a>I should like the Minister to think about another point. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has repeatedly said that the safeguards need to be written in legislation and not left to be read in on the basis on what is in the Human Rights Act. Again, because of legal certainty, there must be adequate safeguards against abuse in the Bill and not elsewhere. It does not seem to me that what is now proposed by the Government would meet that test either. I hope I have not thrown too large a spoke in the wheel by that intervention.</p>

The more that I have heard, the more concerned I am about Amendment 22, which seems not to achieve the purpose that the Minister agrees should be achieved. If it is a matter of necessary or desirable, that is replacing &#147;necessary&#148; by &#147;desirable&#148; because if it were necessary it would be bound to be desirable. As this power would clearly not be used where it is undesirable, it means that the Minister is not merely achieving nothing but is watering down the purpose that he declares lies behind this amendment.</p>

He will also recognise that in the earlier part of my contribution I indicated that I would have to address this issue. I hope I will satisfy him on that point.

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0902091000125"></a>As I said on Report, the retrospective power might be used to correct a drafting error that had cast into doubt the legal position of parties to an agreement over a transfer. In that example, the retrospective power would be used simply to put all parties to the agreement in the position that they had thought they were in. That would obviously benefit third parties; it would restore legal certainty; it would meet every test of how the Government should act, but it would introduce an element of retrospection. It is arguable that such action taken in order to provide legal certainty to counterparties is desirable, but not absolutely necessary.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0902091000126"></a>When making law, we try to establish the greatest legal certainty. In both the illustrations that I have just given, there is absolutely no doubt that &#147;necessary or desirable&#148; provides the parameters for the Government to act. The Government could act with certainty, and third parties could safely rely on the government action. If the word &#147;desirable&#148; were removed, some of that certainty would be removed with it.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0902091000127"></a>Those risks have not gone away, even with the compromise form of wording that the Government propose in Amendment 22, but we have now a form of wording that satisfies the greatest concerns of noble Lords. We meet the concern that the retrospective power should not just be deployed on a whim. Rightly, noble Lords were concerned that not having spelled out the context in which the power would be exercised, the danger was that the Government would attribute to themselves greater power than they ought.</p>

I was grateful for the points that he expressed in our meeting on these matters. I must report to the House that we took those issues into consideration. As I said, we think that we are meeting the main issues of anxiety about how the power will be exercised. Amendment 22 puts beyond doubt the nature of the Government's capacity to act. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, will remember earlier discussions about the Bill when we discussed the significance of the legislation. Clause 75 relates to actions that are as close to emergency actions as we can envisage, when they are the subject of desperately urgent negotiations in which a deal needs to be struck, all parties need to be sure that the deal will be adhered to and the Government need legal certainty that they can give effect to the deal that is struck. That is the nature of our difficulties. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, will give the Government credit for listening to the anxieties. Nevertheless, we are determined that we have put beyond doubt the issues that have been raised in the past and I hope that he will accept our position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0902091000130"></a>I emphasise that, while retaining the words &#147;or desirable&#148;, the flexibility inherent in the desirability test is not a licence to act lightly or irresponsibly but is a recognition that it is in the public interest to avoid retrospective legislation wherever possible.

When, under Section 19 of the Human Rights Act, the Minister writes on the face of a Bill that he considers it to be compatible with the convention rights, that is what Parliament requires him to do and that is what he has done in this case. In other words, to use the phrase of the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, the Minister has written on the face of the Bill, under

He is not saying that the test of necessity is to be written in as the only test&#151;which I think is the correct approach&#151;but that it is enough, from his point of view, if the Bill states, &#147;If the Minister considers that it is in the public interest&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0902091000137"></a>On the points that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, raises about the Strasbourg position, I am hesitant to enter into a debate with him at the Dispatch Box on those issues, for all the reasons we discussed earlier, but the tests laid down by the Strasbourg court are relevant only to the use of powers that interfere with convention rights. The Government cannot make secondary legislation that is incompatible with such rights; such legislation would of course be unlawful. However, my example related to relieving a regulatory penalty triggered by a transfer. The question of ECHR compatibility would not arise in lifting a penalty, but we would need the capacity for a retrospective decision on that in circumstances where, as I indicated earlier, the third party might be subject to a penalty when he could not have anticipated the nature of the offence. Even more important, with regard to the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, we are seeking to envisage that which we cannot predict with great accuracy and give illustrations, and seeking to predict that the deal may hang on the legal certainty of what has been agreed. If there were failures with regard to that legal certainty because of a drafting error, a mistake, we would need to keep that deal in place by correcting the position.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0902091000138"></a>That is why the Government are committed to Amendment 22, which is not conjured out of thin air but is a response to the real concerns that were put forward initially by the Constitution Committee, although they were voiced early on with regard to the Bill. They were certainly voiced at Second Reading, we had intensive discussions in Committee and we had even more intensive discussions on Report, when I made a speech that was so lengthy that I was ashamed of it. I am in great danger of being in that position today so I want to encourage noble Lords by saying that I am nearly at the end. However, my noble and learned friend Lord Morris pressed me to give an example so I am going to have a shot at that as well.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0902091000139"></a>One example that we have exists in tax law. In particular, a retrospective power can be used when it is expedient to make changes in respect of national insurance contributions under sections of the 2006 Act. I mentioned that on Report. I recognise that this is a very different context. The House must decide whether this use of this power is justified, which is what I am seeking to do in the particular circumstances of the Bill. We all recognise that the Bill is trying to deal with highly particular circumstances in a very important part of our banking and financial system and indeed of the welfare of the nation. We are making it clear with our amendment that we are not establishing a precedent for retrospection&#151;we are setting out that it is in the public interest to avoid it&#151;but that there are clearly limited circumstances where we consider it to be necessary.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0902091000140"></a>I emphasise that this formulation has been arrived at after very serious consideration of the concerns of noble Lords. All noble Lords in the Chamber will appreciate that, when we had provided enough chairs for our meeting on Thursday in the room to which the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, referred, we had the benefit not only of his representation but also with great accuracy, those of the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris. So it is not as though we were not fully aware of their concerns and anxieties. This is the best that we can do in meeting those anxieties. I have no more to add.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0902091000141"></a>I do not know whether it is possible that there could be another formulation. However, I hope that noble Lords will appreciate that the Government have done their very best to meet the carefully articulated and very real concerns of noble Lords. That is why I shall press the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, to withdraw his amendment and, in due course, I shall move government Amendment 22.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0902091000142"></a>The House may rest assured that government Amendments 23 and 24 are technical. In our debates, I have repeatedly referred to using Clause 75 to correct mistakes made in transfer orders. I said that the Government, at times, make errors and when that happens we need to fix them. These technical amendments relate to a drafting error in this clause. As currently drafted, it does not allow provision to be made in relation to transfer orders and that is remedied by new government Amendments 23 and 24. I hope that the House will accept that mistake by the Government and our attempts to remedy it.</p>

I shall speak also to the other five amendments in my name in this group. They amend the termination rights provisions in Clauses 22 and 38. They do that in a common way for both share transfers and property transfers. We have now reached one of the technical areas of the Bill about which practitioners in the City are concerned. I thank the Treasury for including me in a meeting with, first, with parliamentary counsel and, secondly, various lawyers last week involved on all sides. That was indeed most useful.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0902091000145"></a>The Government have three amendments in this group to which I hope the Minister will speak in due course. They deal with slightly different issues from my amendments. My amendments deal with two separate but related issues. Amendments 4, 5, 10 and 11 amend Clauses 22 and 38 so that a default event provision is not defined to include a contract or other agreement to which the bank is a party. The purposes of this set of amendments is to ensure that contracts, such as certain credit default swaps and other derivatives which are written with the failed bank as a reference entity or an underlying share but which do not directly involve the bank, are not caught. We completely understand that the Government want Clauses 22 and 38 in order to protect against contracts in a subcontracting chain being capable of being broken, if they relate to services which are essential to the bank. But the definition also takes in financial services and therefore takes us into the highly technical area of the contracts which I have just described.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0902091000146"></a>The second set of amendments, Amendments 6 and 12, seek to make it clear that set-off, netting and similar arrangements will be outside the scope of an order under Clauses 22 and 38. That is part of the wider debate on set-off and netting, which we shall come to, but it has a very specific importance in the context of termination rights. If these clauses interfered in the operation of set-off and so on, legal certainty in those markets might well disappear.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0902091000147"></a>As I understand the position, the Government&#146;s intention is that secondary legislation under Clauses 47 and 48 will be used to ensure that set-off and netting arrangements are not affected by the termination rights clauses and that this will be predicated on an assumption that Clauses 22 and 38 will raise a problem only if a  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_964"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 964</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>partial transfer is involved. I further understand them to believe that the issue of the bank not being a party to the contracts will, in practice, arise only in connection with set-off and netting arrangements. I hope that the Minister can explain all of this for the record. On the basis that he does so, I am sure that I will be able to withdraw my amendments in due course, but I thought it was important to table them again so that the explanation of how these issues are to be dealt with was clear for all concerned. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="0902091000148"></a><b><a name="90209-0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="0902091000359"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, for the way in which she introduced her amendments, explaining that she is providing the Government with an opportunity to explain their thinking and that, if that explanation is satisfactory, she will withdraw the amendments she has tabled. As the noble Baroness said, this group of amendments relates to events of default, also known as termination rights, and refers to Clauses 22, 34 and 38. I will speak to government amendments to Clauses 22 and 38. For the benefit of the House in debating these matters, I will speak briefly to the purpose of these clauses as I believe it sets a useful context.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0902091000149"></a>Clauses 22 and 38 set out certain provisions in relation to clauses in contracts which give a specified right to a counterparty if a specified event&#151;an event of default&#151;occurs. In particular, such a clause may specify that a counterparty has a right to terminate the contract should the event of default occur. Most modern contracts make heavy use of such provisions. The exercise of property or share transfer powers under the special resolution regime may, in future, be characterised as an event of default. This would give counterparties the right to terminate or modify contractual arrangements in the event that the authorities exercise the transfer powers.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0902091000150"></a>As I explained in Committee, this could lead to a wide counterparty flight from the deposit-taker, with severe consequences for the success of the resolution. Therefore, Clauses 22 and 38 make provision to address events of default which could impede resolutions under the special resolution regime. I should make it clear that the financial collateral arrangements directive, under which the Government must allow financial collateral arrangements to take effect in accordance with their terms, including by respecting terms which permit the counterparty to close out, is a dominant feature here. In debating these provisions, we are talking about the minority of financial contracts that are not protected under that directive.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0902091000151"></a>Government Amendments 7 and 13 seek to respond to concerns which have been raised by interested parties, including at a meeting arranged between Treasury officials, parliamentary counsel and the City of London Law Society, which was attended by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. A further meeting has since taken place between tripartite officials and the City of London Law Society. We have always been clear that the purpose of these clauses is not to prevent termination rights from being exercised where the transferee defaults in the obligations it has assumed. Let me illustrate this with an example which I hope will help. A services contract to supply IT is transferred from bank X to a  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_965"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 965</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bridge bank by the property transfer powers. The services contract contains two events of default. One says the contract terminates if the contract is transferred from bank X to any other company. Another provides that the contract may be terminated if there is default in payment on three consecutive occasions.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0902091000152"></a>Clause 38 is intended to address the first event of default, which would be turned off by this provision. But it is not intended to allow the bridge bank to default in paying its obligations under the services contract on three or more occasions. If it did, the service provider would be able to exercise its right to terminate.</p>

<a name="90209-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0902091000153"></a>Interested parties have questioned the reference in subsection (8)(b) to things done,</p>
<ul><a name="0902091000238"></a>&#147;under or by virtue of&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0902091000205"></a>a transfer instrument. It has been suggested that the entire contractual relationship following a transfer flows from the fountain-head of the transfer instrument, so the clause would catch even a second event of default mentioned in my example. The Government do not believe this to be the correct construction of this provision. &#147;By virtue of&#148; is an expression used in statutory drafting to refer, for example, to things that are not done directly under the order.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90209-0005.htm"/>


<a name="90209-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0902091000154"></a>However, the Government recognise the need clearly to indicate that the purpose of these clauses is not perpetually to immunise a transferee from ordinary commercial obligations. Accordingly, we have brought forward government Amendments 7 and 13 to dispel such concerns.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0902091000155"></a>The noble Baroness has spoken to her Amendments 4 to 6 and 10 to 12, for which I thank her. I realise that these amendments flow from concerns that the default event provisions that I have described could have the effect of interfering with financial arrangements, such as set-off and netting, with negative consequences for risk management and regulatory capital. Noble Lords will recall that the Bill already provides protection for such arrangements in the context of partial transfers, and so, as I made clear in Committee, it is appropriate that similar protections be provided for in the context of default events.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0902091000156"></a>The Government also recognise that such protection should be extended to third parties where they have entered into financial contracts with a counterparty of the bank, which are relevant for set-off and netting arrangements. But we do not think that protection for third parties should be extended to non-financial or service contracts, which, if terminated, could, for example, prevent the failing bank being able to offer continuous banking services to its customers. Nor do we think that the protections are needed in the context of &#147;whole bank&#148; transfers, as the market&#146;s concerns have been expressed in the context of partial transfers.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0902091000157"></a>However, the Government believe that protection for financial contracts, such as those relevant for set-off and netting, including third-party contracts, should and can be provided under the existing structures of the Bill. Therefore, providing appropriate protection does not need any changes to the provisions of Clauses 22 and 38.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_966"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 966</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90209-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0902091000158"></a>To provide protection for the types of contracts I have described above, we intend to use the enabling power under Clause 47, which allows the Government to place certain restrictions on partial transfers. Therefore, under Clause 47, we will put in place a standing order which will protect, in the event of partial transfer, the termination rights of bank counterparties and third parties in relation, broadly speaking, to financial contracts with set-off and netting arrangements. To be clear, this will protect those who contract with the residual bank, with third parties not directly related to the failing bank, and those who would be transferred to the new company following a partial transfer. I believe that this will satisfy market concerns.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0902091000159"></a>However, for reasons that I listed in my introduction, the authorities believe that it is critical to provide the new company, be it a bridge bank or a private-sector purchaser, with certainty over what contracts are, or are not, being transferred. Otherwise, it will be difficult to ensure an effective resolution. In order to achieve this, we intend to have the flexibility to make conditional transfers. I will consider the details of these proposals when I speak to government Amendment 8. However, using conditional transfers will enable us to obtain a greater degree of certainty for the transferee, while fully respecting the safeguard that I have just set out. In short, the transferee will know what property has been transferred to it, without resort to close-out, within a period set out in the transfer order. The Government believe that this targeted protection balances the need for certainty in the financial markets with the authorities&#146; ability to effect a successful resolution. The early indication from consultation with stakeholders is that this approach will be supported.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0902091000160"></a>I turn now to government Amendment 8, which provides for the conditional transfers to which I have just alluded. Its aim is to prevent counterparties closing out against the transferee simply as a result of the transfer, while preserving their transfer rights against the residual bank. I emphasise that it does not prevent the counterparty closing out, should the transferee breach the obligations that it has assumed, as I made clear earlier. An unfettered right to close out against the transferee&#151;or new company&#151;carries potential risks for the resolution. The new company could immediately be required to pay crystallised liabilities, creating liquidity stress. Moreover, and importantly, should a counterparty close out on such a basis, it would have acquired a better right than it had in the first place, namely the right to close out not against a failing institution, but the more credit-worthy bridge bank or private-sector purchaser. This is not the same as the termination right for which the counterparty had contracted. The Government believe that the amendment to Clause 34 provides a way to overcome this concern, and is encouraged by a positive response from stakeholders.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0902091000161"></a>This amendment enables the authorities to transfer property, rights or liabilities conditionally. It could be exercised in two broad ways. First, it could provide that the transfer only ever happens if a specified condition is satisfied. Secondly, it could provide that a transfer is automatically reversed if a specified condition is satisfied. In either case, the condition could be defined as an event occurring or an event not occurring.  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_967"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 967</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Where a counterparty has protected financial contracts, the authorities could adopt either of the following approaches. They could provide that the transfer of financial contracts will only take place if a counterparty agrees to waive any rights to close out that might otherwise arise; or they could provide that a counterparty will be transferred but will be automatically returned to the residual bank should they attempt to close out. It is because the transfer can be made conditional on the waiving of termination rights that the time limit that I mentioned earlier can be contemplated. A time limit does not purport to interfere with termination rights. It merely creates a defined window in which the counterparty can elect to affirm the transfer to the new company.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0902091000162"></a>The protection that I have described, which will be put in place under Clause 47, remains fully effective. However, should the counterparty wish to close out, as a result of this amendment, the authorities can ensure that the counterparty will not be able to close out against the transferee. It will, instead, close out against the residual company with which it had originally contracted. This allows for a targeted approach. I hope noble Lords will see that it is entirely appropriate that the counterparty should not be able to acquire new and superior rights to those for which it contracted. I commend this amendment to your Lordships&#146; House as a way of achieving this result.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0902091000163"></a>Financial markets legal experts have indicated that they are satisfied that this approach meets their concerns. Therefore, the Government are proposing a package of measures that delivers protection for financial contracts with set-off and netting arrangements following a partial transfer. In addition to the broad protection already provided to financial contracts by the financial collateral directive, we believe that this will provide the legal and therefore market certainty. I can confirm that the Government intend to insert these protections in the safeguards orders that we will be laying on partial transfers at Royal Assent.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0902091000164"></a>Further, these provisions target only the precise concerns put to us by the market. Therefore, the Government can still exercise their rights to prevent default events for other contracts such as service contracts or financial contracts following a full transfer. The authorities believe that this will provide sufficient flexibility to effect a resolution and certainty for any new private sector purchaser over what property it will be receiving.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0902091000165"></a>Key stakeholders discussed the package last week at a meeting attended by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. During the meeting, we provided parties with initial drafting, which set out the protections that I have just explained. While, of course, the detail of these orders has yet to be agreed, I can report that the stakeholders appeared to believe that this broad package met their concerns.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0902091000166"></a>Balancing market certainty and confidence with appropriate powers for the authorities to effect a successful resolution has been at the core of a number of our debates. I believe that these proposals find that balance and are preferable to the alternative amendments. However, I would like to thank the noble Baroness for

<a name="0902091000169"></a><b><a name="90209-0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0902091000364"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, this group of amendments responds to concerns raised by interested parties around the definitions used in Clause 48. I want to put on record the fact that the noble Baroness made a substantial contribution in Committee on these issues and has participated in subsequent meetings with parliamentary counsel, Treasury officials and the City of London Law Society, which have all helped to resolve the matter in a way that meets the interests of all sides.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0902091000170"></a>It is important to use broad and flexible provisions in this power, as we noted in Committee. It is an enabling power, designed to ensure that adequate safeguards can be put in place. Breadth to put in place protective provisions is, indeed, a virtue. Flexibility is necessary so that orders made under the power can keep pace with developments in the law governing security interests and set-off and netting arrangements, which has proved to be innovative. We understand that the need for this flexibility in primary legislation is now appreciated by the City of London Law Society and other legal experts. I can confirm that we are considering changes to the secondary legislation to reflect some of the concerns regarding commercial definitions. A redrafted order, including revised definitions, has been sent to the expert liaison group, on which the relevant legal bodies are all represented.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0902091000171"></a>However, there are a number of issues on which the Government accept that clarification in the Bill is desirable. Amendment 14 amends the definition of &#147;title transfer collateral arrangements&#148;. These involve one party transferring to another full ownership of assets. In broad terms, such arrangements are entered into to secure the performance of obligations owed by one party to the other. Such agreements may typically provide for the return of equivalent collateral when such obligations are performed. The reference is to &#147;equivalent collateral&#148; because the assets originally transferred may no longer exist and may have been replaced with new assets. Although we thought that the original definition, in referring to new assets, reflected this, we are aware of the anxiety over this description. As a result, the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Myners removes this troublesome phrase, but leaves the scope of the enabling power sufficiently broad to achieve its purpose.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0902091000172"></a>Amendment 15 makes a change to the definition of set-off arrangements. It describes the breadth of different set-off arrangements that might exist. We consider that the broader formulation is more appropriate. Amendment 16 makes it clear that close-out netting  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_970"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 970</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arrangements can involve actual as well as theoretical debts. Although this provision was an inclusive further elaboration of the broader concept of netting arrangements, we are pleased to offer this additional clarification if it provides reassurance.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0902091000173"></a>Amendment 18 adds further provisions to the definition of arrangements, which is used as a building block for the definitions of security interests, title transfer collateral arrangements and set-off and netting arrangements. It provides broad language that makes it clear, for example, that such arrangements may operate on a bilateral or multilateral level, or involve the interposition of third parties such as clearing houses. We do not believe that the clause would have been construed to exclude these arrangements from the ambit of the power as originally drafted, but we offer reassurance through this amendment.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0902091000174"></a>We have one further reassurance that we need to give, which arises out of issues brought to our attention by legal experts, including the Law Society of Scotland. Amendment 9 signals that arrangements to be protected under Clause 48 can include trusts. Stakeholders have asked us to make it clear that interests protected under Clause 48 may be created through, or comprise in part, trusts. The Government are not convinced that the change is necessary, as the terms would be construed in their commercial context. If commercial practice does make use of trusts in this context, then trusts would fall within the definitions as they stand. However, we are told that Amendment 9 offers reassurance, and we are glad to offer this where we can.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0902091000175"></a>Amendment 17 relates to the treatment of trusts under the property transfer powers. Stakeholders have questioned whether property that a bank holds on trust for beneficiaries would fall within the definition of property, rights and liabilities under Clause 33. We believe that property held in trust would be included under the broad definition, but we are told that in Scotland there is some doubt as to whether a reference to &#147;property&#148; will be interpreted to include property that a person holds in trust. The amendment will allow us to stipulate how property held by the bank in trust is to be held after the transfer. This allows the effects of the resolution, as it relates to trust property, to be made clear in the property transfer instrument, enhancing legal certainty and allowing a more refined and proportionate approach.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0902091000176"></a>These amendments are a direct response to the concerns of stakeholders on how trusts are treated and, I believe, allow the authorities to act proportionately on a case-by-case basis by being specific on how each resolution can affect trusts. In seeking to meet the concerns of financial markets participants, I should also say a few words about the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, but it is appropriate that she should have a chance to speak to it, and I shall respond briefly after she has spoken. I beg to move.</p>

Again, I record my thanks for being allowed to participate in the meetings, including with parliamentary counsel.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0902091000178"></a>The Minister explained the way in which these modifications work and how the statutory instruments will be developed. I do not need to remind him that a lot is riding on the final version of the statutory instrument and it being made immediately after Royal Assent in order not to destroy legal certainty at that point.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0902091000179"></a>Some substantive issues raised by the market participants remain. I am sure that the Minister will be aware of a joint letter from the British Bankers&#146; Association and the London Investment Banking Association last week setting out their concerns. I hope that when speaking again to the amendment, the Minister will update the House on plans for laying the statutory instruments and, more importantly, between now and when they are laid, say what the Government plan to do to work with stakeholders to allay the remaining concerns, which are not small. Some important issues that people want dealt with remain. It would be a shame if the excellent co-operation that has characterised the way in which the Bill has been developed and the draft statutory instruments discussed were spoiled at a late stage by rushing the measure through. I say that to encourage the Government to engage in constructive dialogue.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0902091000180"></a>My Amendment 19 asks for an annual report on partial transfers. I tabled it in response to very big concerns about whether this Bill would completely disrupt market practice and the attractiveness of London for the financial services industry. To some extent those concerns have been allayed by the constructive way in which the Government have sought to ensure that the statutory instruments will do what is necessary to ensure that there are no unintended market or regulatory capital impacts from the types of transaction that have been referred to. To that extent, I shall not move my amendment. In reaching that judgment, I have been particularly encouraged by the way that the Government widened the terms of reference of the Banking Liaison Panel in Clause 10, which allows the panel a wider say in the workings of the Bill beyond the narrow definition in the earlier draft of the Bill. Wedded as I am to transparency, I can see that in this instance the Banking Liaison Panel is probably the right place to keep this matter under review, and I hope that it will.</p>

I support the government amendments, which have addressed important concerns.</p>

As I have indicated, we were not totally convinced in the early stages that these additional clarifications were necessary but we recognise the force with which they have been put&#151;not least by my noble friend and I am glad that he thinks that the amendments meet the points that he made. I am also grateful to the noble Baroness for the full part that she has played in these matters. As for her points about the necessity for additional co-operation, we will certainly publish the draft statutory instruments on Royal Assent.</p>

<a name="90209-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0902091000183"></a>One of the great advantages of the substantial consultation that was carried out throughout the drafting of this legislation and its development over the past year is that we are in a position to make commitments of promptitude on secondary legislation. We will continue to work with the Expert Liaison Group on the detail of these draft orders before they are finished and made on commencement of Part 1 on 20 February. I give the noble Baroness our assurance on that and agree with her that for the Expert Liaison Group to become the Banking Liaison Group is a proper forum for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0902091000184"></a>My honourable friend the Economic Secretary indicated that the process should be as open as possible. He said that he was committed to seeking the Expert Liaison Group&#146;s views on whether its minutes should be published. He did not meet with a totally positive response. The group did agree that high level summaries of the discussion and the conclusions could be usefully made public, so there will be openness in that respect. I hope that that is sufficient to assure the noble Baroness that we intend to proceed on the basis of openness. We intend to check with the group whether it thinks that any specific advice that it gives to the Government should be made public. If it does, we will commit the Treasury to publishing it and providing a copy to Parliament.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0902091000195"></a>The Delegated Powers Committee expressed extreme concern about the scope of these powers. I am pleased to see the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in his place, not that I ever doubted that he would be there. His committee expressed concern about the scope of the powers proposed in the clauses relating to investment banks. The committee recommended that the power, and any regulations made under it, should be sunsetted after two years. The amendment of the noble Baroness is along these lines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0902091000196"></a>We discussed these concerns with the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and indicated to her that it has not been possible to devise a suitable response to the Delegated Powers Committee&#146;s sunset recommendations that would not have what we regard as undesirable effects in market impact and policy. The Government, as indicated in earlier debates, are firm on this matter. The noble Baroness indicated that she understood some of the Government&#146;s great reluctance, because normally the Government are concerned to respond positively to the committee&#146;s proposals. She even hinted that she would consider withdrawing her amendment, subject  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_976"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 976</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the Government making a strong case and committing to holding a fully independent review within two years of any regulations being made under the power. She also suggested that the Government&#146;s case would be considerably more robust if they were able to place stakeholders&#146; concerns with the sunset provisions on the record.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0902091000197"></a>The London Investment Banking Association wrote to our officials in appropriate terms on 6 February. Accordingly, we are eager to emphasise the remarks made in Committee, with regard to the difficulties surrounding the administration of Lehman Brothers Europe. In particular, the Government are concerned that the clients of Lehman Brothers have had difficulties in securing an expeditious return on their assets, following the failure of that firm. That is no small matter. Where clients are unable to access assets that they believe they rightfully own, this has the gravest implications for market confidence and the effectiveness of the legal arrangements, including those relating to insolvency, which support the UK system.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0902091000198"></a>The House will be aware that a major source of the UK&#146;s competitive advantage in this area is the certainty that we provide by the relevant legal regimes that we have. Ineffective operation of insolvency arrangements in relation to investment banks and client assets could have obvious financial stability implications. If it impacts on the ability of clients to meet their own obligations to third parties, this may have particular relevance in the case of the hypothecated assets where recovery may be very difficult and challenging.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0902091000199"></a>It is no exaggeration to say that a single failure could then lead to further failures unless issues surrounding asset recovery can be addressed with expedition. The Government need to take action over these concerns. I was grateful that the amendments which gave rise to these provisions were accepted in Committee. The sheer complexity of the challenges that have emerged since the failure of Lehman Brothers and its UK subsidiary defy simple solutions to this issue. The House will understand that the application of insolvency procedures to an investment bank, or any other large complex financial institution, is complicated and challenging. To consider ways of revising such procedures is even more so. For this reason, the Government have sought the advice of an expert panel with regard to the concrete steps that need to be taken to address these challenges. The panel, the establishment of which was announced in the Pre-Budget Report, is to consider how regulations may best be made which enable the unencumbered return of client assets without creating substantive externalities or negative consequences. The provisions of Clauses 232 to 235 provide the Treasury with the powers necessary to make any changes that may be required as a result of this review. They are necessarily broad for the simple reason that it would be impossible for the Government to prejudge the conclusions of the expert panel, particularly in a complex case.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0902099000001"></a>It may reassure the House if I clarify a few points regarding the powers that the Government are taking in these clauses. The powers are precautionary in so far as they will not be used without a clearly identified need   


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_977"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 977</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to do so, and, notwithstanding the concern which noble Lords articulated in previous discussions on the Bill about their scope, they will be targeted if deployed.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0902099000002"></a>However, the breadth of the powers that the Government are taking has of course attracted the attention of the Delegated Powers Committee, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. It would have been far preferable if I had been able to come to the House with more detailed proposals, as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, will soon emphasise in debate on the matter, and I agree with many of the committee&#146;s concerns about the wide scope of this provision.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="0902099000003"></a>I should have preferred to have been in a position to present for scrutiny to this House a detailed set of legislative provisions, rather than simply the powers outlined in the clauses. However, I have not been able to do so, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, has tabled an amendment which seeks to implement the recommendation of the Delegated Powers Committee. She has proposed a sunset clause which provides that any regulations will cease to have effect after two years. I welcome the amendment because it gives me the chance to explain the Government&#146;s purpose.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="0902099000004"></a>As I indicated, we respect the work of the Delegated Powers Committee and we have great difficulty when we are not in accord with it. However, a sunset clause would simply not work; worse, it might do even greater damage than if the Government took no action at all. The inclusion of a sunset clause of the sort proposed would have major policy implications, all of them totally undesirable. It would create legal uncertainty as to the type of insolvency procedure which would be applied to any client asset. If Firm A were to commit assets to Firm B under the new regulations, it would know that the regulations would expire in the very near future. It would therefore have no knowledge of the insolvency procedure that would be applied in future should the firm holding its assets fall into insolvency.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="0902099000005"></a>Firms would find it unacceptable to face that kind of major uncertainty over what would happen to their assets in the event of a default. They would have no way of accurately gauging their counterparty risk, and their potential exposure would most likely be a multiple of their equity capital. The House will recognise that this could result in a substantial increase in the cost of funding as firms&#146; creditworthiness declined as a result of the ambiguity that would arise. These cost and risk implications would almost certainly prove unacceptable to the great majority of financial firms for as long as other jurisdictions offered any form of legal certainty with regard to the recovery of assets.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="0902099000006"></a>Those are not just the views of the Government. We recently received a letter from the London Investment Banking Association, which indicated that there are grave concerns in the City with regard to this amendment. I start by pointing out that it was in response to concerns expressed by LIBA that the Government inserted the sunset provision in Clause 235(4), which provides for the lapse of the enabling powers if they have not been used after two years.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_978"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 978</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90209-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="0902099000007"></a>Perhaps I may quote from the letter that we received from the London Investment Banking Association:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="0902099000062"></a>&#147;One of the points that we stressed at the outset was that a sunset clause should be included in the order-making power so as to make clear that the power would lapse if, in the event, it was determined that investment bank insolvency regulations were not needed. Our reason for this was that our Members considered it to be essential not to give the impression to counterparties that the UK framework is now in a permanent state of transition&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0902099000059"></a>We have addressed this concern with the provisions in Clause 235(4). However, LIBA goes on to note in respect of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="0902099000063"></a>&#147;Our concern about proposed paragraph (4A)&#151;which would appear to require that any insolvency regulations made would automatically lapse (except in the case where they applied to an ongoing insolvency)&#151;is that it would have the same result that we were trying to avoid. And since, under Clause 235(4), a sunset clause has been included requiring the 233 powers to lapse if they have not been exercised, we can see no advantage in including the paragraph that the amendment would introduce&#148;.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="0902099000008"></a>Even if all these problems could somehow be avoided, the proposed sunset amendment could still cause harm. I have grave concerns about the effect on international perceptions of the predictability and dependability of UK law, which is one of the City of London&#146;s key advantages, and the reputation of the UK as a financial services centre. That could lead to substantial damage to the City in a period when it is already facing serious challenges. I do not need to spell out the dangers for the UK economy more widely.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="0902099000009"></a>Even if these broad economic costs were acceptable, we should have regard to the potential implications for firms, including those that these provisions are intended to benefit. If we adopted a sunset clause as proposed, firms would be required to adapt to a new regime when the regulations laid under this Bill came into force and again when they are sunsetted, when firms would be required to adapt to whatever replaced them. This would increase the adaptation costs for investment firms. The Government&#146;s objections to a sunset clause would, unfortunately, apply regardless of the time period attached to it, since the issue of legal uncertainty would continue to apply irrespective of the time horizon. Any proposals for a five-year, or even a 10-year, sunset clause would therefore also be subject to the grave difficulties I have described.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="0902099000010"></a>I say with regret that the Government feel strongly that the proposed sunset provision cannot be accepted. However, the Government are nevertheless committed to addressing the concerns of the Delegated Powers Committee and of the House. First, we are making changes to the scope of the provisions, as laid out in Amendments 28 and 29. The amendments are designed to reduce the extent of the order-making power provided for in Clauses 232 to 235. They limit the power in such a way that the Treasury may bring only institutions that already hold Financial Services and Markets Act Part IV permissions into the scope of any new insolvency regime. Noble Lords will be aware that firms to which the Financial Services Authority has granted FSMA Part IV permission are all authorised financial firms. In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, expressed particular concern about the breadth of the definition of investment banks included in the Government&#146;s original provision on this point. This amendment seeks to address her concerns directly. As  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_979"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 979</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a result of the amendment, there is no possibility of the Government applying the regulations more widely than is necessary with regard to non-financial business, for example.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="0902099000011"></a>Secondly, in lieu of a sunset provision, we have also tabled amendments to ensure that this House and the other place shall have the opportunity to consider expert views on any regulations the Treasury may lay under these powers. I think it only right and proper that the Government take all possible steps to ensure appropriate scrutiny of these provisions. Therefore, Amendment 31 requires that within two years of the Treasury making any investment bank insolvency regulations, the Government must establish an independent review of any regulations that have been made. This review shall be independent, expert, and impartial. The review will consider whether the regulations have been effective in identifying, protecting and facilitating the return of client assets. It will look at whether, in drafting the regulations, the Treasury has paid due attention to protecting creditors&#146; rights and ensuring legal certainty for all relevant stakeholders: creditors, clients, administrators and the investment banks themselves. That is critically important, and we will ensure that the impact on the firms and persons who may be affected by the regulations is subject to full consideration.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="0902099000012"></a>The review will also consider how effective the regulation has been in minimising any disruption of business and the markets and maintaining the UK as a global centre for financial services. The review will produce a report which must be laid before this House and the other place, and noble Lords and Members of the other place can then determine whether they want to deliberate on its findings. The review may also consider whether it is appropriate for the regulations to stand or whether the Government should return to Parliament with necessary primary legislation. The reviewer, in his or her consideration of those matters, may feel it helpful to engage with noble Lords or Members of the other place, as well as insolvency experts and other market practitioners.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="0902099000013"></a>I hope that the establishment of that review will go some way to addressing the concerns identified by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and of this House in earlier discussion of the Bill. In the current circumstances, I hope that the House can appreciate why the Government are unable on this occasion to proceed along the lines suggested by the committee and in the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness. I hope that the new provisions that the Government have proposed will alleviate the concerns raised; that I have justified the reasons for the Government's action; that the noble Baroness will feel able in due course to withdraw her amendment; and that the House will feel able to support the government amendments.</p>

<a name="90209-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="0902099000015"></a>We must remember that this is highly complex law dealing with important issues of rights in insolvency. I am sure that the general feeling of the House is that the right way to scrutinise that is through primary legislation, because it is only through primary legislation that we have the opportunity to scrutinise on a line-by-line basis. As the Minister is aware, secondary legislation is fundamentally non-amendable.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90209-0007.htm"/>


<a name="90209-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="0902099000016"></a>Nevertheless, we have listened carefully to the arguments that the Government have made, and to the arguments that the London Investment Banking Association relayed to me in its letter of 6 February. I have taken the liberty of sharing that letter with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, because I was aware of his concern about the issue. I must say that I think that the difficulties about the uncertainty that would have been introduced have been overstated, and that it would have been possible within a two-year period to have had both a statutory instrument for the short-term and at the same time to have tracked legislation, subject to proper scrutiny, for the long-term.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="0902099000017"></a>However, in accepting the government amendments and welcoming the review&#151;I genuinely welcome that review&#151;I just remark that it places a great onus on the Government to carry out the most detailed consultation and to exercise their rights to propose such legislation very wisely. I think that it is unprecedented to produce such significant legislation by statutory instrument. The onus will clearly be on the Government to be careful in how they use the powers which the House has granted them without any complications of sunsetting. Once they have exercised their powers the review will be especially welcome, especially given the way that it is phrased.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="0902099000018"></a>On balance, and with a somewhat heavy heart, we are prepared to accept the government amendments and I will not be moving Amendment 30.</p>

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="0902099000019"></a><b><a name="90209-0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0902099000083"></a>Lord Goodhart:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may start with a very small point. The name of the company to which the Minister referred is not Layman Brothers but Lehman Brothers. I am in a position to know that because I am a member of the Lehman family. I have not declared an interest because my family ceased to have any involvement in Lehman Brothers some 25 or 30 years ago.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="0902099000020"></a>I can move on now to the serious business. It is a matter for the Delegated Powers Committee to advise your Lordships&#146; House on matters such as the question whether certain material should be on the face of the Bill rather than in the form of regulations. The Government are proposing here a potentially fundamental change in the law of insolvency as it relates to investment banks, and investment banks are a very important feature of our financial system. We could end up with investment banks being subject solely to regulations made by the Government&#151;with parliamentary involvement, in the form of affirmative resolutions,  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_981"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 981</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but with no chance to amend them or seriously to debate them&#151;while the whole of the rest of the economy will be subject to the very detailed provisions of the Insolvency Act.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="0902099000021"></a>The changes that the Government could make are, therefore, potentially fundamental; and not only are they fundamental, they are of a totally uncertain kind. I repeat the quote from &#147;King Lear&#148; which I gave at Report stage. The Government&#146;s position is much the same as his when he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="0902099000064"></a>&#147;I shall do such things ... what they are yet I know not, but they shall be the terrors of the earth&#148;.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="0902099000022"></a>It would certainly be normal practice to put legislation of this kind, in relation to investment banks, on to the face of the Bill. We accepted in Committee that there was a possibility that when a Government were in a position to decide what they wanted to do, they should be able to do it very quickly. We therefore accepted that there could well be a necessity for regulations to take effect quickly. But we saw no reason why this should be anything other than a temporary arrangement, and we considered that the regulations should be replaced as soon as possible by primary legislation which could, of course, be in exactly the same form as the regulations.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="0902099000023"></a>There would be no question of any additional uncertainty arising from this. Indeed, the uncertainty would be weakened rather than strengthened because the potential existence of a sunset clause would not affect any bank that became insolvent before the sunset clause came into effect. That is our view; we did not quite understand why such provision should be necessary. As it is, there will be a great deal of uncertainty anyway over the two-year stretch. The Government will be at liberty at any time to change the regulations with the benefit of an affirmative resolution. That would be substantially easier than changing primary legislation and could&#151;and probably would and should&#151;urgently introduce the necessary regulations and then follow them with primary legislation which would put the regulations on to the face of a statute. We believe that that would strengthen the certainty of the matter rather than weaken it, and that it would have been a much more effective way of dealing with this than what the Government now propose.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="0902099000024"></a>Therefore, in the circumstances, the committee had total agreement on the point. I still believe that it would have been more appropriate to accept what the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, proposed: a totally unconditional sunset clause which came into effect in two years, but not requiring it to be left until the end of that two-year period; and either in the mean time or at the end of that period for the Government then to bring forward primary legislation that could have had a proper debate and would have ended up with the rules governing investment being in primary legislation in the same way as all other insolvencies are in legislation. That would have been better.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="0902099000025"></a>I am not in a position to move any amendments but I want to say, as I still believe, that it would have been better had the Government accepted the recommendations of the Delegated Powers Committee.</p>

As I have indicated to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, the Government do not lightly pursue a course that they know is not in accord with the committee&#146;s recommendations. He will, however, appreciate from the amendments that we have tabled that we have taken on board the thrust of the argument that underlay the recommendations his committee made. We have not followed them in quite the terms that he would have wished, but we clearly expect the review to produce an analysis of how these regulations are working. If the review says that the issue is significant enough for primary legislation, the Government will have to respond accordingly.</p>

I hope he will accept that in the Government&#146;s approach to these matters we are all too aware of the anxieties that he has expressed and those of his committee, but we are also well aware of the significance of this for the banking community&#151;for investment banks in particular, but for the City of London as a whole and its financial role.</p>

<a name="0902099000029"></a><b><a name="90209-0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0902099000088"></a>Baroness Cohen of Pimlico:</b> My Lords, I am pleased to have this opportunity to debate the report on the future of EU regional policy, produced in July by Sub-Committee A of the European Union Committee. Thanks are due to my committee, to my special adviser, Dr John McCombie, of Downing College, Cambridge, to my clerk, Simon Blackburn, who has now moved on to greater things than me, and the committee specialist, Petros Fassoulas.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="0902099000030"></a>I welcome my noble friend the Minister who may possibly not have thought that his maiden speech would be made on EU regional funding. I am sure that we will all welcome it cordially, even if he makes it in Welsh.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="0902099000031"></a>We produced this report in July and the Government responded in October, which is about the average speed. It was the product of our consideration of the EU budget for 2009. In fact, the delay in getting to this debate has worked to advantage. In the current financial and economic crisis, there is huge pressure on EU regional policy and sometimes it seems to me that not a week passes without us being required to scrutinise and pronounce on an EU proposal to extend, increase, widen and generally tweak some part of regional policy.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="0902099000032"></a>European regional policy is important to us all. In 2008, 36 per cent of the EU budget was spent on regional policy. The policy has its basis in Article 158 of the European treaty which states that the Community will aim to reduce,</p>
<ul><a name="0902099000076"></a>&#147;disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands, including rural areas&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0902099000060"></a>So economic cohesion&#151;that is what it is&#151;the idea that no part of the Community should drag very far behind the other, has been a policy consideration for the European Community for half a century. It has become increasingly important; it has risen from 17 per cent of the European Union budget in 1988 to 36 per cent today. If the Lisbon treaty is ratified, Article 3 will state that the Union,</p>
<ul><a name="0902099000077"></a>&#147;shall work for the sustainable development of Europe based on balanced economic growth and ... shall promote economic, social and territorial cohesion, and solidarity among Member States&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_984"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 984</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90209-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="0902099000033"></a>The aims are quite clear, but the administrative structures are extremely complex. There are three funds: the European regional development fund, which provides direct finance for companies, infrastructure and financial instruments; the European social fund, which finances projects to improve skills and access to employment; and the cohesion fund, which finances transport, energy and environment infrastructure projects.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="0902099000034"></a>Three objectives underlie those policies, which do not match perfectly the way the funds are divided. The first and most important policy is convergence, which takes 81.5 per cent of our spending on regional policy. It aims to speed convergence between regions and is aimed at the poorest regions. The second is regional competitiveness and employment, which takes 16 per cent of the spending, and strengthens competitiveness and the attractiveness of regions not eligible for convergence funds. The third is the European territorial co-operation, which strengthens cross-border co-operation through joint projects, such as railways.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="0902099000035"></a>The question of who is eligible for these funds is not wholly straightforward. It is based on a measurement of gross domestic product per head, which has the advantage of being easily understood and widely used in international comparisons of standards of living. There is a very wide range between member states, a range which has widened with the most recent introductions, the poorest regions being found in Romania and Bulgaria, as I think we would expect. For example, the Nord Est region in Romania has an index of 24, as against Hamburg which is 202 or inner London which, when the report was written, was 303, although it may not be quite as high at the moment.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="0902099000036"></a>To be eligible for assistance from any of the regional funds, a region has to be below 75 per cent of the average index figure, or below 90 per cent for some. Other considerations also apply, such as relative prosperity, the number of employed and the number of jobs. When you add to these complications the fact that any money distributed is sensibly limited by a formula that takes into account the particular country&#146;s or region&#146;s ability to absorb the funds, you get the unsurprising result that there is no particularly clear relationship between the value of funds received per head and GDP per head. The result is that regions in some of the wealthier member states receive more funding per inhabitant than eligible regions in the poorer member states. To give an idea of how the indicative financial allocations for 2007 to 2013 work, Poland, as a very large, very poor country, will get around &#8364;60 billion, 19.4 per cent of the total funds for those years, and the UK will get 3.1 per cent of the funds, being much richer.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="0902099000037"></a>When thinking about all of this, we found ourselves able to agree not only with the previous report of the committee but also with the Government&#146;s thinking. We were strongly in agreement with the aims of regional policy; we agreed that it was important to reduce disparities between regions by encouraging economic and knowledge transfer from richer to poorer regions. As economic development is not even, we supported intervention in the market to counter underemployment and the use of resources in the poorer regions. We were also glad to be able to agree that, along with  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_985"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 985</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these ideas, the funds had helped to reduce regional disparities across Europe. We were given the examples that of the four countries originally eligible for cohesion funds, Spain, Greece and Ireland had all seen above-average increases in GDP as a result, and with 15 out of 50 regions in the EU having a GDP below 75 per cent of the EU average, by 2004 12 of these regions had moved above 75 per cent. So it actually works. The committee also agreed, perhaps more controversially, that there was no need for an increase in the total size of the EU budget and any extra money for regional policy should be reallocated from other budget headings. We had our eyes very clearly on the budget heading covering the common agricultural policy.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="0902099000038"></a>Perhaps one of the most important conclusions is that we should change the way these funds are targeted. At present, about 20 per cent of the total regional policy budget is available to all regions, wherever they are. We concluded that funding should be concentrated in the poorest regions and reflect the principle of subsidiarity. This would result in a substantial loss of funding to richer member states, specifically to the United Kingdom. But the principle of subsidiarity&#151;that action should be taken at European Union level only where it adds value to the reaction&#151;can be used to justify richer member states taking responsibility for their own regional funding. Arguments against this conclusion, mostly deployed by the Commission, focused around the idea that regional policy should enhance member states&#146; co-operation and knowledge-sharing and that it was not acceptable to divide member states into donor and recipient countries. We saw the force of this argument but in the end we discarded it and we were very glad that the Government were able to endorse our conclusion, despite the fact that, on present distribution, an annual loss of &#163;1.6 billion to the UK could be involved. However, in their response the Government said that this view depended rather on a rebalancing of the European budget generally, specifically rebalancing the funds allocated to the common agricultural policy. We were none the less glad that the Government were able to support our conclusion.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="0902099000039"></a>There are various other aspects of the report. I am sure everybody is familiar with the fact that, in many cases, member states cannot use their full funding. For this reason, all member states have an absorption cap based on their gross national income which limits the funds available to them by on average around 50 per cent. For example, the region of Lubelskie in Poland, from where we took evidence, was able to use only 80 per cent of its funds between 2004 and 2006. This led many witnesses to argue that increasing regional funding made available to member states, as we recommend, will not necessarily raise their economic performance. We found that much of this problem was caused by inexperienced fund management structures in new member states and that, to help remedy this, the older member states were advising newer member states on fund management, which the committee supports in its report. For instance, the Office for National Statistics has advised eastern European countries on the collection of statistics. This has particular relevance in the current economic downturn, as many are citing regional funding as a way to inject cash into the economy. However, as many member states are  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_986"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 986</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>currently unable to spend their current allocation, it may be seen as counterproductive. Pumping money into a system that is unable to spend its current allocation will not achieve a proportional benefit in the economy. We hoped that member states would be able to catch up and train their people fairly quickly.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="0902099000040"></a>We also welcomed the integration of the funds with the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs. Under the financial perspective 2007-2013, regional policy spending is linked with the Lisbon agenda, which means that money needs to be spent on competitiveness and employment objective spending. This enables member states to develop a more forward-thinking spending plan, linking spending on infrastructure with the development of employment, rather than just building roads.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="0902099000041"></a>The committee welcomes the approach of the Commission that one policy does not fit all<b>. </b>As such, it agrees that regions should continue to draw up their own regional spending plans, rather than policies being decided on a centralised basis.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="0902099000042"></a>We also agreed with the Government that spending should not be used other than to reduce regional disparities;<b></b>for instance, it would be unwise to divert any spending to major issues such as climate change, which should be addressed on its own. This will help prevent projects funded by the funds conflicting with other European Union policies.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="0902099000043"></a>Since we wrote the report, there have been several other developments. In September 2007, the European Commission published the <I>Fourth </I><I>R</I><I>eport on </I><I>E</I><I>conomic and </I><I>S</I><I>ocial </I><I>C</I><I>ohesion</I>, which presented the basic data and key assumptions with a view to debating the future after 2013. As listed in the report, the EU will face new threats and important challenges such as population ageing, rising energy prices and immigration pressure. A concrete presentation of cohesion policy after 2014 is not expected until the fifth report on economic and social cohesion is published around 2010, but the committee will probably take a look at it at that stage.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="0902099000044"></a>The debate on the future reform of cohesion policy appears to revolve on two different views: on the one hand, that cohesion policy needs to keep its traditional role of reducing disparities and ensuring convergence for regions; on the other hand, that the priorities of cohesion policy should closely be linked to the Lisbon agenda and that improving competitiveness and innovation must be the main objective for future cohesion policy. The most important debate is coming up in the budget review 2009, which provides the opportunity to recommend an overhaul of the budget and the possibility of reforming the CAP and reducing the funds that richer members receive. We look forward to that debate.</p>

I would suggest that &#147;competitiveness&#148; is put there as an attractive label; the real purpose is to have some money going to the areas that are not poor. This is irrational; it would be much better to focus purely on the poorer areas.</p>

<a name="90209-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="0902099000047"></a>I have a little anecdote which I shared with the committee and which I propose to share with the House, relating to my time as First Minister in Northern Ireland. When I was talking about regional policy with a senior official from our finance department, he observed that regional policy was sometimes more trouble than it was worth. That might seem to be a strange comment, but it is not. The money that, notionally, is spent by various agencies and regions in the United Kingdom under regional policy does not go directly to them from the European Union. European Union money goes to the United Kingdom. My interlocutor told me that the Northern Ireland Department of Finance then found that it was under pressure from the Treasury to arrange its capital expenditure in such a way that would draw down the largest amount of regional policy money. This meant that its capital expenditure programmes did not prioritise, and were not based solely on, what the department thought were the key priorities for Northern Ireland. Those priorities were distorted to increase the amount of money that was drawn down. He found that a disadvantage. To this disadvantage is added the fact that money has to be provided to match the money that comes from the regional fund. There is always an element of matching, which varies from around 50 per cent to 85 per cent, depending on the circumstances. Matching money has to come in, which can also be a problem in running regional policy.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="0902099000048"></a>This is reinforced by a story in today&#146;s <I>Financial Times</I>. It reports that the Treasury has decided not to draw down some &#163;671 million of EU money under regional funding. This applies only to regional funding that would have been for England. The Treasury has decided to take up the option for the devolved regions, so sums of money will go to them, ranging from &#163;60 million for Wales to &#163;25 million for Northern Ireland. However, the &#163;671 million for England is not being drawn down. This may seem as though it is a loss for the Treasury and for England, but the unspent money will instead be recouped by the Treasury, which can deduct it from future contributions to the European Union budget.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="0902099000049"></a>It seems that the Treasury has repatriated to itself this aspect of regional funding and regional fund policy. Instead of being spent on projects that come within the definition of the regional fund and are approved by Brussels, that &#163;671 million will now be available to the Treasury to spend as it chooses. It may mean that it is not spent on the sort of developments that the regional fund is promoting, but is spent elsewhere. No doubt people will pursue that matter. It reinforces my earlier point that regional fund money is not always as desirable as one might think.</p>

It could be argued that some other criteria could be used, but a criterion, whatever it is, has to be adopted and that one has been used throughout on this. If it becomes the sole criterion, there will be greater pressure&#151;or, at least, greater focus&#151;on the consequences of coming above or below that 75 per cent figure. We think that there should be greater concern about, or focus on, transitional arrangements.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="0902099000051"></a>There are two elements for the regional policy as it operates in the current phase, from 2007 to 2013. One is phasing out and the other is phasing in. Phasing in relates to those regions to which the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, referred, which are now above 75 per cent of GDP and are no longer entitled to European fund money under the convergence criteria. There is an expenditure on those areas of 3.4 per cent of the total budget. These areas have over 75 per cent of the GDP figure for the 15 member states that were in the Union at the beginning of the period.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="0902099000052"></a>If the threshold had remained at 75 per cent of the EU 15 GDP, a further group of regions, the so-called phasing out ones, would have qualified by being below that figure, but, because of the enlargement of the European Union to 25 countries, and those countries being generally poor, the 75 per cent figure has gone down. Therefore, these countries find themselves over the new 75 per cent figure, but they would have been below the old 75 per cent figure. Consequently, they are getting transitional support under the heading of phasing out, and 4.1 per cent of the budget is spent on them.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="0902099000053"></a>The point that occurs to us is that there would need to be some arrangement for transitional relief or support, if one prefers that term, for the next financial period, which is 2014 to 2020. I observe, parenthetically, that in the previous period, that between 2000 and 2006, my recollection is that there was transitional relief. My recollection is that Northern Ireland had been below 75 per cent before that period but had gone over 75 per cent and so was no longer entitled to what was then called Objective 1 status, and did receive quite generous transitional relief during the period 2000 to 2006. Currently there is no provision with regard to the financial perspective from 2014 to 2020.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="0902099000054"></a>The Government&#146;s response to our report did not really clarify their position with regard to this matter. Consequently, the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, the chairman of the Select Committee wrote to the Government. They replied in November 2008 by letter from Mr Pat McFadden. As regards the changes that one would like to see in regional policy, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="0902099000075"></a>&#147;We also acknowledged that the consequences of significant changes to funding patterns would need to be considered. This would include what the shape of appropriate transitional arrangements would be. However, those arrangements would have to be considered within the context of the available EU Budget resources and priorities that had been agreed&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0902099000061"></a>One welcomes the fact the Government see that there is a need for transitional arrangements. That would have to be negotiated within the new budgetary arrangements.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="0902099000055"></a>Regional policy involves particular areas within member states. The classification of those areas comes from something that rejoices in the name of NUTS&#151;the NUTS regional classification. It stands for the  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_989"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 989</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nomenclature of territorial units for statistics. Within this classification, there are various levels, NUTS1, NUTS2 and NUTS3. Regional policy is classified as NUTS2. By way of illustration, the United Kingdom has 12 NUTS1 regions, 37 NUTS2 regions and 133 NUTS3 regions.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="0902099000056"></a>There are some problems with regard to the operation of these regions. One is that there can be pockets of deprivation within an otherwise wealthy region. For example, Hastings and Thanet were cited as examples of urban deprivation in an otherwise wealthy NUTS2 region. The NUTS2 region is the south-east of England. Both are also relatively poorer than their NUTS3 regions, which are East Sussex County Council and Kent County Council respectively. Consequently, moving from a NUTS2 to a NUTS3 region would not help in that situation.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="0902099000057"></a>Another problem drawn to our attention is that the classification can be misleading where people have their homes in one area but work outside that area. This effect becomes quite significant in the environs of wealthy cities. People live in the countryside but work in the city, so the wealth that they produce is attributed to the city and not to the surrounding territory in which they live. Apparently that is particularly marked for the area south of Hamburg, which is in a &#147;phasing-out area&#148;, if I have caught that right. It would be very good if better methods could be developed for measuring the prosperity of a region, so that regions could be defined in such a way that we could have greater targeting of regional development expenditure.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="0902099000058"></a>Clearly, regional policy is a major policy in the European Union. Expenditure on it has been growing and is likely to continue to grow as a proportion of the overall budget, particularly in so far as reform takes place elsewhere&#151;I refer, of course, to reform of the CAP. The work of this policy will become more important in the future.</p>

One of the big challenges is understanding anything about it, what with the nomenclature, the acronyms and the things that you expect to mean one thing that actually mean something completely different.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09020917000002"></a>In 1994, when the 1994-99 programme started, there were Objective 1, Objective 2 and Objective 3, which was in two parts, one national and one regional. There was Objective 4, which I do not think anybody understood and which did not apply to the United Kingdom. There was Objective 5A, which was national, and Objective 5B, which was regional. That was divided into the European Social Fund, the regional development fund ERDF, and EAGGF, which was the regional part of the agricultural programme, but not all the agricultural programme. Once we had got used to that, there were the community initiatives, of which there were about 20 at the time, and for which they invented great names. Pesca covered fishing, but had nothing to do with FIFG, which was the common fisheries policy part of regional development. There were also Leader 1, Leader 2, Urban&#151;which was urban&#151;and 18 others.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09020917000003"></a>I am pleased to say that, through two more seven-year periods, we have managed to rationalise these down to just the cohesion programme for whole member states, the structural funding that is known as convergence instead of Objective 1, and competition, which was similar to Objective 2. However, it is now difficult to understand where the agricultural part fits. In the statistics, we read that regional funding is something like 36 per cent of the EU budget and agriculture is 47 per cent, but this does not explain where the agricultural part of regional policy lies. I would be interested to have this clarified by the Minister, who I am sure is completely up to speed on these matters.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09020917000004"></a>I congratulate the Committee because, as well as understanding these issues, it called as a witness Mr Graham Meadows. He was a great friend of the United Kingdom in the Commission when he headed up the DG Regio, a particular friend to Cornwall in the south-west and also to various initiatives in Ireland, to which he was very committed.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09020917000005"></a>&#147;Should all of this exist?&#148; is the question in my mind. I strongly favour these funds, but should they be a part of the European programme, or should they be pushed down as part of subsidiarity? That is an important question that the report looked at. The logic is good: there was the Single European Act and the single market, which was expected, through market forces, to make regional differences even more pronounced. The two fit well together; they showed that cohesion funds were important for all member states and for European monetary union.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09020917000006"></a>What sprung out at me from the report were the variations in the GDP levels of different regions. Seeing the figure for Nord-Est in Romania of 24 per cent of EU GDP was staggering. However much you might be committed to total subsidiarity and repatriation as a member state, there is no way that the European Union should not be involved in trying to help that degree of disparity between different regions.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09020917000007"></a>The other particularly important area for me is that regional policy should work. It can be very important; it does not always work, but it gives regions a chance to get it to work. We have seen that regarding cohesion policy in the Republic of Ireland; one of the league tables in the report shows has a GDP per head second only to Luxembourg, yet it was originally one of the poorest member states, certainly under EU12. Regarding Cornwall, where I live, the witness, Graham Meadows, states in the report that there was a point at which the region was able to use an important part of funding, although not a huge part of the county&#146;s GDP, as a hook to start development, new thinking and getting together.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09020917000008"></a>A good thing about regional policy in the European Union is that it produces a reasonably independent view of which regions need assistance and which do not. In the past in the UK there has been a far more political agenda&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, will probably disagree&#151;whereby the north has been looked after and some of the poor bits of the south have been forgotten. Not until Cornwall became an Objective 1 region was it recognised within the United Kingdom as requiring help.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_991"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 991</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90209-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09020917000009"></a>Is the NUTS system completely objective? It is to a degree; there are a lot of question marks regarding the GDP measure, but it is stated in the legislation that regions are in if they are under 75 per cent, but if they are over 75 per cent they are out. That is very objective. Of course, that does not recognise&#151;perhaps it is not mentioned in the report&#151;all the lobbying that goes into changing the boundaries and how a lot of regions in the UK lobbied really hard, not for Objectives 1 or 2 or convergence funding, but to change the NUTS2 boundaries, whereby NUTS3 regions could be reclassified as NUTS2.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09020917000010"></a>The system also provides seven years of certainty; very few national programmes are able to do that in this country or elsewhere. That is a big plus for regional planning, although obviously in non eurozone states, such as the UK, you do not know what the exchange rate will do; therefore your funding increases and decreases. One thing that is particularly impressive in the UK, although it is true of other members states, is that the system forces partnerships, not just between national and regional government, but between private sector organisations and many third-sector organisations, which come together to decide how the programmes will work. That factor was not there previously. The partnerships work around real money and real programmes, and they can be very effective. That is true of co-funding as well.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09020917000011"></a>The system also gives a much broader perspective to European regions which often, perhaps, do not think more broadly. Hence, there is an ability to innovate; certain schemes which have worked in some member states are able to work in others. There is a sharing of experience. One of those schemes, which is mentioned in the report, is the provision of revolving funds, rather than grants, in terms of financial assistance to the private sector. That idea was innovated in Merseyside and has been used as a model right across Europe; it has been imitated particularly by the European Investment Fund. That is important, and I wish to come back to that issue in my questions to the Minister.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09020917000012"></a>Concentration is also good, as is the fact that 82 per cent of these funds go into particular convergence areas. That gives many of those regions a basis for hope that their problems are understood, that a much broader Europe recognises that they have issues and needs to be solved and that there are real resources there to help. It will not be the full solution, but at least if the regions want to make the most of it, there is a set period of seven years in which that will happen.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09020917000013"></a>What are the bad things? I cannot see that the competitive area, at 16 per cent, covering more or less the rest of the European Union, can work. There is still some question about whether additionality happens. That is one of the words that I had to learn when I first got involved in this area&#151;the idea that national governments should not start taking away money when European money comes in. Then there is the area of underspend. Although I understand that the EU put on these very clever capacity caps, I presume that that is a political argument for making sure that new member states did not get a much larger area, so the EU budget overall could take the capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09020917000014"></a>In the evidence, a Commission witness said that a senior bureaucrat from one region said that he hoped that his campaign for Objective 1 did not succeed because they did not have the capacity for it. He might have thought that but he was wrong. That region took on the challenge and was successful, so even some people who are involved do not always realise that.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09020917000015"></a>Time-consuming bureaucracy, also mentioned in the report, is a real problem. Lots of bureaucracy does not mean that the control is any better. In this area it often means that the control is worse. The biggest problem within the UK programmes is not the bureaucracy of filling in forms but the inability of bureaucrats to make decisions. They would rather not make a decision; they justify that by asking more questions, when really the answer is, or should be, no, but they do not want to say so. The real challenge is to ensure transparent decision-making, honesty, and that decisions are made in reasonable time.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09020917000016"></a>The biggest condemnation, from a practical point of view, is of the funding gaps between these programmes. Because they last for seven years, we know when they are going to end. We know that the 2007-13 programme will end on 31 December 2013. For those regions that are carrying on&#151;we have figures reasonably far ahead for the ones that do not&#151;we expect some continuity and reasonable planning. However, there are large gaps. Much of the convergence programme money and projects are starting to be approved only now, when the money&#151;or certainly the project approval&#151;ended at the end of 2006. Therefore, will there be greater planning by the Commission and the Government for these gaps so that good programmes do not die between one ending and the next one being approved, with the loss of all skilled staff and the things that result in a lack of continuity?</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09020917000017"></a>I notice that the Government did not respond to the important question of revolving funds. Are they in favour of continuing revolving funds within the structural funding? They have set up a number of organisations in Objective 1 regions. Yet, interestingly, the money being made available through the EIB or EIF into helping SMEs is not being channelled by the Government through their own organisations. They are putting it through the banks. Will they reconsider that? Will they, as they did the last time, try to renationalise the funds the next time these programmes are considered?</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09020917000018"></a>Decision-making bodies have moved from government offices to regional development agencies. In the previous programme, finally, the government offices were pretty good at implementing the programmes, although they were not previously. Then we change bureaucracies and, again, there is a slow-up. I should be interested in the Minister&#146;s view as to whether the RDAs are starting to perform rather better than they did at the beginning of the programme to get these funds moving and into the places that can use them.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09020917000019"></a>My final question is one raised by the noble Lord, Lord Trimble. Will the Government resist the temptation of repatriating the tranches of money and putting them back into the Treasury?</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09020917000020"></a>This is an excellent report. It raises a lot of questions but I hope that this round of regional policy, will move from strength to strength.</p>

I also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, on the enthusiasm that he brought to acronyms and linking past programmes to present ones. If people view this debate, they will be full of admiration not only for the enthusiasm with which he embraced all that but for the deep experience that he brought to the subject. I, for one, learnt a number of things from his contribution.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09020917000022"></a>Like many Members of the House, I am pleased that, at the start of its report, the committee sets out with clarity what the various funds and objectives are and what they mean for the different countries of Europe, including our own. In the United Kingdom, only Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, the Welsh valleys and west Wales are full members of the convergence funding programme. The highlands, Merseyside and South Yorkshire are at various stages of phasing in and phasing out. Therefore, we are talking about only a limited number of areas of the United Kingdom where this remains a live issue. However, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, that these programmes have been enormously important, not only in Yorkshire, where I live, but in Cornwall and other parts of the country.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09020917000023"></a>In his evidence, the current director-general of regional policy, Mr Ahner, reminded us that convergence policy and regional policy are not just about levelling up and getting rid of great inequalities. In parts of Europe, more than in the UK, people have a deep sense of wishing to avoid the domination of the European Union by a small number of powerful conurbations and centres of influence. That desire to do more than just level up and get rid of the great inequalities and to have policies that strengthen the whole of Europe and not just two or three heartland areas is never captured in any discussion in the UK about how European regional policy is seen elsewhere in Europe.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09020917000024"></a>These objectives are ambitious, but we should keep in mind the fact that the total amount of European funding devoted to all this is around a third of 1 per cent of the gross national product of the European Union. To keep things in proportion when we talk with enthusiasm about these things, we must remember that what can be achieved through these programmes is modest, although not insignificant, compared to what Governments in member states can and should be doing to address the same issues. It is easy to get carried away with what these policies will achieve across the whole of Europe, given that the funds amount to only a third of 1 per cent of gross national product.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09020917000025"></a>I was struck many times by the enormous number&#151;276, I think&#151;of regions and subregions, of which 70 receive assistance through these programmes. There is an enormous amount of detail and almost micromanagement at the European level. There is a question mark over this, on which I shall comment when I speak about Yorkshire. We should also remember that the European Union funds provide match funding. There has to be match funding as well as European  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_994"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 994</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>funding. It is not just a question of money coming out of Europe; the various agencies have to work to get match funding. In general, I would not overestimate what can be achieved across the whole of Europe on these funds, important though they are for some parts of our own country. I do not say that these are insignificant. For example, in South Yorkshire, in the past six-year or seven-year programme, around &#8364;1 billion was received from European regional funding programmes. That did have a real effect. In the past seven or eight years, the centre of Sheffield has been transformed, recast and regenerated. Overwhelmingly, that has been sparked off by European funding. Although I express a word of caution about the effect that one third of 1 per cent of national income can achieve across the whole of Europe, where it is concentrated on significant projects, as opposed to spread over too many projects&#151;the point I think the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, was getting at, saying no much more firmly and earlier&#151;then it can make a difference.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09020917000026"></a>In the next seven-year programme, the regional development agency is concentrating on a major project to bring high-speed broadband to the whole of South Yorkshire. That would be truly important and helpful. So I accept that there is a limit to what can be achieved in these programmes but where it is concentrated it can make a substantial difference.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09020917000027"></a>In considering whether these funds should continue throughout the whole of Europe, the committee came to the view that where funds are in support of not levelling up but general competitiveness, as opposed to convergence, richer countries such as the United Kingdom should not receive those funds. The Government, in response, confirmed their position. Not only did they agree with that, but they felt that, in principle, they would be willing not to have any regional funding coming to the United Kingdom and that should apply to all the richer countries. The committee, in a previous inquiry and report, had come to a similar conclusion.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09020917000028"></a>I agree with that but there are one or two provisos. First, what that is really saying is that it should be for those richer countries that can afford it, such as the United Kingdom, Germany and so on, to decide whether they want to have a regional policy. It is for the Government, political parties and the electorate to decide whether a strong regional policy is a priority. If the Government were to withdraw from regional funding from Europe but did not replace those funds by having strong regional policies, there would be a pretty adverse reaction in Yorkshire, Merseyside, Cornwall, the Highlands and so on. I want to hear from the Minister that the policy of being willing to negotiate over the future of regional funding coming into the United Kingdom would not mean a weakening of resolve of regional policy in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90209-0008.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09020917000029"></a>Secondly, as the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said, there is a great deal of value in the European approach of seven-year programmes. It provides a certainty and continuity that is lacking in UK government funded programmes. I should be most grateful if the Minister would reflect on that and say whether, in looking ahead, the Government see some merits in longer-term certainty in regional funding programmes and

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09020917000030"></a>I should like to comment on the article in the <I>Financial Times</I> to which the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, referred. It states that some &#163;670 million will have been underspent in the English regions in the 2000-06 programmes, which actually ended at the end of last year for the spillover period. The Government have decided not to ask for an extension period for English regions, although they have supported an extension period for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. It would be extremely interesting to know what the difference is&#151;that is, why the Government have decided not to press for an extension in the English regions but have supported an extension elsewhere in the United Kingdom. What is the Government&#146;s view of the apparent underspend of some &#163;600 million or &#163;700 million in English regions over that period, which I work out to be about 12 per cent of available European Union funding programmes? Secondly, it seems that something is awry when there is no apparent capacity problem, although there is an absorption problem, in England. Why has there been such an underspend in English regions?</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09020917000031"></a>I turn to two other matters. One is the greater use of loans. I endorse all that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said on this; it is an important issue. When Graham Meadows, the former director-general referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, met the committee, he remarked that in 1989, when he was overseeing German regional development programmes in the European Union, he found that Marshall aid programmes were still going in revolving loan schemes. He was struck by the fact that targeted loan schemes can provide an ongoing contribution to economic development and so on long after the initial grants have emerged on the scene. That was a powerful reminder of the value of loan schemes. In their response to our report, the Government told us that they are actively promoting the use of loans as an alternative to grants. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us more. They said that several UK European regional development fund programmes in the next period, 2007-13, will set aside some of the allocation to loan funds. It would be helpful to have additional detail on that.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09020917000032"></a>I turn to the question of the cost of administration. Some critics of European regional policies have alleged that they involve huge administrative costs. One witness to the committee, Open Europe, suggested in written evidence that the cost of administering European regional funds in the UK totals some &#163;670 million a year, which is more than 4 per cent of the funds available. As noble Lords would expect, the committee looked at that with care, because it would obviously be a substantial apparent waste of taxpayers&#146; money. The Government&#146;s estimate of the cost to central government of administering these programmes is &#163;28 million a year out of the total UK allocation of European funds of &#163;1.5 billion. The regional development agencies told us in written evidence that the annual cost to English RDAs is around &#163;11 million. Therefore, including the figures for the  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_996"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 996</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Welsh and Scottish RDAs and so on, the official data indicate that the total administrative costs to the public sector are no more than &#163;40 million to &#163;50 million, as opposed to the very much larger figure of &#163;670 million suggested to us by Open Europe. The official data indicate a cost of about one-third of 1 per cent.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09020917000033"></a>The committee accepted that administration in the UK is not a significant cost or burden when compared with total funds. However, that is not to say that there are no issues. Administration, bureaucracy and delays impact on private sector applicants for funds. In my experience, there are bureaucracies and unnecessary delays. Again, I endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said about the need for a much clearer decision-making process and the need to be much firmer and to say no earlier. I would also suggest that too many small schemes are encouraged, whereas it would be better to concentrate on significant schemes that make a real difference.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09020917000034"></a>Finally, there is tension between the need for audit control and the burdensome administration that it can produce. A number of our witnesses, including the director-general, commented that the audit requirements on UK regional programmes involving European funds are much more onerous than our internal public expenditure audits. There is something awry here, and the Commission issued a general invitation to applicants from the private sector as well as the public sector to give evidence on where there is unnecessary bureaucracy and administrative costs. I hope that that challenge will be taken up as a result of this debate and the report. There are unnecessary costs and bureaucracy. They are not significant in proportional terms, but if you are caught up in them, they are terribly frustrating and put people off applying. It would be a great shame if good projects were put off for that reason.</p>

I also compliment the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, who is also on the committee, and my noble friend Lord Trimble. I was also enthused by what the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said from an earlier date.

They are anchored in the stability and growth pact and the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs. Sub-Committee A scrutinised that document at its meeting on 13 January 2009. In its communication entitled <I>Cohesion Policy</I><I> I</I><I>nvesting in the </I><I>R</I><I>eal </I><I>E</I><I>conomy</I>, the Commission proposed a set of legislative and non-legislative measures to strengthen

This is in the light of the current situation with the ultimate objective of accelerating payments to member states and facilitating access to the structural funds and other cohesion policy instruments.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09020917000037"></a>The EU cohesion policy is the largest source of investment in the real economy and provides a stable and targeted source of financing that can be used to stimulate recovery in the present climate. One thing about speaking fifth in a debate is that previous speakers have already mentioned that the cohesion policy represents about a third of the EU budget. It amounts to&#151;I do not think I heard this figure correctly and will be corrected if I am wrong&#151;&#8364;347 billion for the period 2007 to 2013.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09020917000038"></a>More than 65 per cent&#151;or &#8364;230 billion, if my arithmetic is correct&#151;of those funds are earmarked for investment in the four priority areas in the EU's renewed Lisbon strategy. Number one is people; number two is business; number three is infrastructure and energy; and number four is research and innovation. Under those headings, the communication structures specific recommendations on how to make a preferred use of cohesion policy instruments under the current economic circumstances.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09020917000039"></a>Some of the ways in which those funds can be disbursed and allocated have been considered, and the acceleration of payments of fund allocations have already been earmarked for specific regions. That will not lead to any overall increase in the budget, but it is intended to lead to an injection of cash into the economy. It also provides for broader use of flat rates and lump-sum costs to enable most authorities to implement projects at a faster rate. It will also extend certain funds to allow greater eligibility for rich member states to use them to fund energy efficiency and housing. The richer countries include France and Germany, and the poorer countries include Romania, Bulgaria and Greece. The United Kingdom fits in somewhere between, but opinions vary as to our position in the league table.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09020917000040"></a>The overwhelming objective is to accelerate payments to member states and to facilitate action through the structural funds and other cohesion policy instruments. Amendments to the European regional development funds to support investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy in housing in favour of low-income households in all member states is within the framework of all state aid schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09020917000041"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, will be pleased to hear another acronym. He mentioned several, but I have a couple more. It is a common complaint about the European Union that its regulatory provisions are overly complicated. Part of the plans are to simplify the financial engineering instruments, such as&#151;wait for it&#151;the Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas, known by the lovely women's name of JESSICA. From 2009, an increase of 25 per cent is proposed for the technical assistance capacity of&#151;here is another&#151;the Joint Assistance in Supporting Projects in European Regions, JASPERs, which sounds more like the name of a nightclub. That initiative will help new member states to develop infrastructure projects. There is a case to be made that only poor countries

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09020917000042"></a>The British Government are anxious to retain the focus on the Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth, although one must say that this objective, worthy though it is, will not produce much in the current climate while the future is so uncertain. I hope that those few comments, complicated as they may seem, show a desire by the EU to improve the economic plight of weak countries, now and in future. Only time will tell whether those objectives will be achieved. Thank you for listening to me and I just hope that you do not meet JESSICA very soon and do not take her to JASPERs nightclub.</p>

She has brought firmness and clarity to the chairing of that sub-committee and Tuesday mornings are a rare pleasure as a consequence.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09020917000045"></a>When the Economic and Financial Affairs, and International Trade Sub-Committee, to give it its full title, took evidence for this report in the early months of 2008, of course the economy of the European Union&#151;its finances and trade&#151;was very different from now. I agree with the noble Baroness, who pointed out at the start of her speech how the context for regional policy has dramatically altered during the period of this report and the Government&#146;s response. As we all know, the truth today is that the European Union is in the grip of recession and, indeed, some people would say, I am afraid, that it is teetering on the brink of depression. Industrial production in the biggest economy of the European Union, Germany, has fallen quite significantly in the last quarter; central and eastern European countries are all under growing pressure, and they are, of course, the principal recipients of much of the regional aid; the euro currency has fallen from its all time high against the dollar; and, of course, as you might expect, in Paris and in London , President Sarkozy and the Prime Minister are both claiming that their solutions are better than the other&#146;s, while a somewhat sceptical public on both sides of the Channel brace themselves for something worse. It is a rather unedifying picture. The future looks bleaker than 12 months ago when our sub-committee put together this report.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09020917000046"></a>I have two questions. First, how relevant a future does the European Union regional policy have in the context of this recession, which we must expect will last at least for the remainder of this year and possibly for all of next year as well? Secondly, how do our recommendations and the Government&#146;s response hold up in the light of these developments?</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09020917000047"></a>Some very important statistics have been given in the debate and I want to return to a few of them. In absolute terms, structural funds&#151;which is the name that links the Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and the European Cohesion Fund,  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_999"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 999</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the so called triumvirate&#151;equal 36 per cent of the European budget. That is an interesting figure because it has risen while the percentage on the common agricultural policy has fallen. The Government clearly see a balance&#151;to which I shall come later&#151;between the future of the agricultural policy and the future of the regional policy and, in response to our sub-committee&#146;s recommendation, they have made that concept explicit. That is quite important.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09020917000048"></a>Article 1.58 is the original article behind European Union regional funding and it is worth reminding ourselves of the objective specified in that article. It is:</p>
<ul><a name="09020917000071"></a>&#147;to reduce disparities between the levels of development of the various regions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020917000069"></a>The Lisbon treaty speaks of a slightly more elaborate objective of,</p>
<ul><a name="09020917000072"></a>&#147;promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion and solidarity among member states&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020917000070"></a>I want to share with the House a recollection of the meaning of the word &#147;solidarity&#148; in European Union parlance; it is rather specific. Some years ago, at the behest of the late Lord Jenkins, I participated in a committee chaired by Jacques Delors to identify a motto for Europe and possibly even a motto for the currency. One proposal much favoured by Jacques Delors was quite snappy: &#147;Europe, the future: science, development, progress and solidarity&#148;&#151;the kind of thing that trips off the tongue easily and would look very good on the coinage. It was thrown out mainly as a result of an intervention by a German MEP who said, &#147;Solidarity? We Germans know what solidarity means; it means what you want and what we pay for&#148;. &#147;Solidarity&#148; fell, I am afraid, and we ended up with &#147;Unity and diversity&#148;, which has at least the benefit of ambiguity, I suppose.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09020917000049"></a>The truth is that, faced with recession, too much diversity in the European Union is not going to be very helpful. On the test of solidarity, against the stated aims of EU regional policy that I have quoted, there is indeed some evidence of progress but not very much. In recent years, I remind the House, EU enlargement has involved Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, Slovakia, Estonia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Malta, Slovenia and Cyprus. That enlargement took place in 2004, Bulgaria and Romania in 2007. The point has already been made in this debate that the poorest regions of all are indeed in the east of Romania. They make for a rather shocking figure: below one-third of the average GDP per head in the European Union.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09020917000050"></a>The point is this: during the period 2004-07, the dates of enlargement, the policy that has as its main objective the reduction of disparity has risen by only two percentage points within the EU budget. By 2013, the end of the phasing of the present policies, the figure will be 38.1 per cent, compared with 43 per cent on the common agricultural policy, which, incidentally, will have come down from 47 per cent. But, as has already been pointed out, the total EU budget is, and will be in 2013, less than one per cent&#151;so we are talking about one-third of 1 per cent. The figure is not insignificant. In certain areas&#151;we have heard of some of them tonight&#151;it can be relatively dramatic and   


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1000"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 1000</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>indeed visually evident. The truth, though, is that in overall budgetary terms these are relatively small figures and we cannot expect too much from them.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09020917000051"></a>The European Union, the Council of Ministers and indeed Her Majesty&#146;s Government have placed their trust for the achievement of the diminution of disparity between rich and poor in the future of Lisbon. In their Government&#146;s response to the committee&#146;s report they say they believe that the economic and social disparities across the European Union can best be tackled by focusing on the drivers of growth set out in the Lisbon integrated guidelines. Let us remind ourselves what they are. As relaunched in 2005, the guidelines are to increase European Union public and private investment in research and development to 3 per cent of GDP, and to secure 70 per cent employment rates by 2010. Given this recessionary context, the likelihood of either of those objectives being achieved in Lisbon is marginal and to rest our hope on that is, frankly, a cop-out&#151;that is really what it boils down to. We have to be realistic about this.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09020917000052"></a>I come back to my first question: how relevant a future has European Union regional policy got, given this recession? As that policy is constituted at present, and given its dependence for its achievement on Lisbon, the answer is: not very much. That does not mean it is not important, but it is not very much.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09020917000053"></a>What about our proposals and the Government&#146;s response? Again, the answers are rather uncertain. I have already referred to the uncertainty about Lisbon, but there are some positive things. I thought the clarity of the Government&#146;s response on the move from grants and loans is absolutely right; it is clearly on the record and it is where we should all be going. Most controversially, the Government picked up our proposal, or suggestion, that the distribution of EU funds within net contributing states, which includes the United Kingdom, should give way in favour of focusing on the European Union&#146;s poorest regions&#151;in other words, solidarity. That is clearly right and fair and, dare I say, even somewhat noble.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09020917000054"></a>I remember in our committee the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, pointing out that one would have to be very careful about how this is expressed if one does not wish to invite a headline in the <I>Mail on Sunday</I><I></I>accusing Her Majesty&#146;s Government of allowing this country to be robbed. Earlier, the Minister was asked why we are forgoing the &#163;700 million for England&#151;I think that was the question. I look forward to the answer as I look forward, very warmly indeed, to his maiden speech. The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Abersoch, has demonstrated alacrity in his career in the House of Lords, which must be the envy of everyone.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09020917000055"></a>If we and the other net contributors are to forgo, in effect, the moneys which might otherwise be distributed as a result of these policies, the way in which that is expressed and explained will have to be very clear; otherwise it will invite a knee-jerk response: why are we not getting more out of it? One will have to deal with that. The answer is not simple; the answer is in the future tense about a concession made in the present tense; namely, we hope that the funding of the CAP will be further reduced and we hope that the balance  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1001"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 1001</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of spending within the European Union will be refocused. I totally agree with that, but how it is expressed will be important.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09020917000056"></a>As we took evidence in the first half of last year, members of the committee had the strong feeling that this was an extremely important area and that the objective which the European Union had set itself, which is not overtly a redistributionist objective but, nevertheless, is one which has a commitment to fairness as regards the attack on disparities of wealth, growth and economic development, was very important. However, the actual scale of the budgets concerned was such that the real balance of impact was always going to be, first, with national policies for regional development and, secondly, that the enlargement of the European Union&#151;the most dramatic development of the European Union of recent decades&#151;is not really reflected in the commitments of regional policy. So the time will come, particularly if the recession severely damages or distorts growth prospects in the new member states, when that will have to be revisited.</p>

I congratulate her on her sub-committee&#146;s report, which is well researched and full of interesting and very important information. Before I talk further about this and EU regional policy, I hope that your Lordships and the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, in particular, will forgive me if I devote a few words to welcoming the Minister. Fortunately, I have a sound basis for doing so, as I worked for him for several years in the 1990s when I ran Standard Chartered&#146;s merchant bank in south-east Asia and got to know him very well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09020917000058"></a>The Minister&#146;s reputation is widely known. Suffice it to say that when he joined Standard Chartered in 1993, it was emerging from one of several damaging crises&#151;this time, I think, in India. Long before he left it, he had taken it, by dint of his rare combination of energy, enthusiasm, leadership, inspiration, intellectual horsepower, decisiveness and sheer hard work, to the position of one of the leading emerging-markets banking organisations in the world. A champion of charitable work, especially in sight restoration and breast cancer, he is a fundamentally good person. He is indeed a very big man in a small package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09020917000059"></a>With considerable foresight, the Minister seems to have kept Standard Chartered away from the businesses and products that have so deeply damaged so many other banks. In my view few people are as well qualified to give a Government of this country, of whatever political hue, the benefit of their advice. That he has chosen to join the Benches of a Labour Government is a matter of passing regret for me personally, but I will get over it, because I know that he has taken this step in the sincere hope that he will be able to help our country.</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1002"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 1002</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and we will not disappoint him. He is a keen supporter of Spurs, a club which is consistent with the Prime Minister in its plans to spend its way out of the recession, reportedly spending &#163;45 million in the transfer window, including on buying back Robbie Keane. We look forward to the Minister&#146;s speech and indeed to many future speeches.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09020917000061"></a>I turn now to the future of EU regional policy. Matters relating to the EU are well known for their complexity&#151;several noble Lords have already referred to that. It is therefore to the sub-committee&#146;s credit that it has produced a report of such clarity on the subject. I thank all noble Lords who served on the sub-committee for their hard work. There is a great deal in the report with which we would agree, and I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure your Lordships that the Government will study and  study again the sub-committee&#146;s recommendations. The support for the report this evening will perhaps go some way towards encouraging the Government to press unrelentingly in Europe for its important recommendations to be implemented.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09020917000062"></a>Both the sub-committee and the Government appear to recognise that, in the words of my noble friend Lord Trimble, it is irrational for the more developed EU countries to receive funds intended to redress economic inequalities across the EU. The circular system of sending money to Brussels only to see a portion of the sum returned is neither sensible nor effective. It involves wasting resources on administrative bureaucracy, as several noble Lords&#151;my noble friend Lord Steinberg and the noble Lords, Lord Woolmer and Lord Teverson, among others&#151;said. Although the report says that such spending might not be hugely significant for a richer country such as ours, I am sure that noble Lords will agree that any waste of taxpayers&#146; money on bureaucracy is particularly unacceptable in the current economic climate.</p>

<a name="90209-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09020917000063"></a>The sub-committee noted that a reduction in contributions from these funds would be unpopular in some circles. However, the sub-committee was also quite right to note, as the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, said, that a reform of the CAP&#151;I must declare an interest as a beneficiary of various of its schemes&#151;would more than offset any displeasure felt. I hope the Minister will ensure that the Government do everything in their power to secure a sensible result from the imminent review of the EU budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09020917000064"></a>The committee&#146;s recommendation in paragraph 64, that the 2008-09 budget review should result in reduced spending on agricultural price support, is welcome, and I hope that it is fully shared by the Minister. The committee&#146;s recommendation that richer member states should remain responsible for the majority, if not all, of their own regional funding is also one that the Government should pay heed to. Indeed, the Prime Minister himself called a few years ago for the repatriation of regional funding. It is regrettable that he did not pursue it more vigorously. We agree with the conclusion that regional policy will never be the primary vehicle for encouraging economic competitiveness. Many of the poorer EU countries&#146; inefficiencies, especially of those which have recently joined, are the consequence of national problems. Although these EU funds can of  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1003"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 1003</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>course be very useful, they must complement national policies if any real improvement is to be seen.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09020917000065"></a>There needs to be better control of funds at national level. It would be very helpful if the Minister could tell your Lordships, first, what level of auditing and ex post assessment has taken place and does take place; and, secondly, whether any UK local authorities have been censured by the EU Court of Auditors over the handling of EU money, and if so, which ones. I will understand if he cannot answer me today, but if he could able to write to me afterwards it would be appreciated.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09020917000066"></a>Many of the other recommendations in the report are sensible, too. Using loans instead of grants&#151;to which the noble Lord, Lord Watson, referred&#151;as a vehicle for encouraging development would not only ensure that the projects concerned were viable without permanent public funding but would also, over time, allow limited funds to go much further.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09020917000067"></a>Similarly, we would echo the sub-committee&#146;s support for co-financing. If a national Government retain a financial interest in the success of a project which they are considering funding with EU money, there is less likely to be any lowering of standards at the end of the year as a result of having to spend the money to avoid returning it.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09020917000068"></a>The committee has made a considerable number of recommendations, of which I have mentioned only a few. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response. I again thank the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, and her sub-committee for this report, and your Lordships for an interesting debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09020927000002"></a>Regional policy is of importance to everyone in this country, not least for a newly ennobled Welsh Peer. With your Lordships&#146; permission, I should like to put the EU debate on the future of EU regional policy post 2013 into its wider context to set out the Government&#146;s thinking on where we want regional policy in Europe to be, and to inform the House of how the current cohesion policy is reacting to the global financial crisis that we are facing.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09020927000003"></a>However, I should like first to say a few words about myself and my role. I begin by extending my thanks to noble Lords for the warm welcome that I have received from all sides of the House over the past few weeks. I genuinely appreciate the convention and sincerity in the welcoming remarks made this evening&#151;with the exception of the comments on Tottenham Hotspur. I thank particularly my noble friend Lady Cohen for her kind words and welcome. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, for his comments about the glossary of terms, which genuinely drove me nuts this weekend, most of which I indeed spent with JESSICA and JASPERS.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09020927000004"></a>As I took my oath, or <I>y llw</I> in Welsh, I reflected on the fact that I did not really speak a foreign language&#151;namely, English&#151;until I was six or seven, so I apologise in advance for my future performances in English in the House. When under pressure, as I struggle to master the latest trade statistics, may I reserve the right to mutter the odd word in Welsh? Indeed, paragraph 4.47 of the <I>Companion to the Standing Orders</I> specifically mentions that languages other than English should not be used in debate, except where necessary. I might also utter one or two words in Cantonese, as I lived in Hong Kong and Singapore for many years. I am also a Minister and, as civil servants now refer to me in that way, I just cannot get the image of the chapel, Sunday school and my mother&#146;s Sunday hat out of my mind. That is what a &#147;Minister&#148; meant to me.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09020927000005"></a>Only one or two years ago, being a bank chairman would have seemed an ideal background for somebody joining this House. How times have changed. Bankers now keep a very low profile. The past 12 or 18 months have been extraordinary for the industry that I have worked in for over 30 years. The industry has lost credibility, trust and respect, but we must be balanced in our reaction and our criticism. Not all banks were caught. However, it is critical that lessons are learnt and that banking regains credibility and stability, since it is an industry that is critical to the future of a thriving global economy. It is a complex and international industry, which has allowed me and my wonderful family to live in different places. It has made me realise, simplistically, that the citizens of the world, irrespective of colour, religion and background, get on well together. In my one Kate Winslet Oscar/BAFTA moment, I should also like to thank my wife of 29 years for her support.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09020927000006"></a>Living in Asia changed my view of the world and made me realise the huge potential of China and India. It also made me realise the huge potential that those two large markets and countries offer the UK. Until recently I was the chairman of Standard Chartered, a bank which is proud to be British and yet operates in 70 countries with over 70,000 staff. I was on the board of that bank for 12 years. I notice that several noble Lords were, as has already been mentioned, either board members or worked with me in the bank. I should like to put on record my hope that I did not upset them during my time there. This afternoon, as I had a cup of tea, I spoke to my noble friend Lord Faulkner, and I discovered that his father was the Chartered Bank company secretary in the 1960s. So I am phasing in to the House of Lords and phasing out of another life. That is what &#147;phasing in&#148; and &#147;phasing out&#148; mean to me.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09020927000007"></a>My entry to government clearly has come at an interesting time, to say the least. When the opportunity came to do public service, I felt compelled to do it. The privilege of being a Member of this House, with its huge variety of talent, is indeed just that: a privilege. Recent accusations have undoubtedly affected the standing and image of the House. I will do my very best to uphold the high standards of integrity and tradition in this House, which are evident for all to see. Although I have had to give up my outside interests, with the exception of the Royal Academy and being chair of

I hope that I will feel the same about politics in due course. My role as Minister for Trade and Investment is an exciting and challenging one. Britain&#146;s industrial position needs talking up, not talking down. I do not agree that we have no manufacturing, no industrial capability and no innovation in the UK. My role is to prove the cynics wrong and assist British business.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09020927000008"></a>I turn now to the EU debate. I am obviously a newcomer to this whole question. However, having studied the committee&#146;s report and the evidence, I was struck by how the report has rightly looked at distribution management and the impact of the funds. It is very pleasing that the committee found that the funds are effective and, in general, fit for purpose. It has to be right that, through Article 158 of the treaty, the EU aims to reduce the disparities between levels of prosperity in some of the countries. We have to make sure that we help the least favoured regions. After all, elements of regional policy are designed to counter any negative repercussions of a single market. Clearly, supporting the use of economic and knowledge transfer from rich to poor regions, and interventions to counter both unemployment and underutilisation of resources, is the right way forward. The aim of structural and cohesion funds has to be not just the reduction of income inequality but also sustaining growth rates in the poorer member states.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09020927000009"></a>On reading the report, I was struck by the evidence of Professor Bachtler from the University of Strathclyde that it is difficult to determine effectiveness. We must always strive for efficiency. Finding the balance between strong financial management and avoiding bureaucracy is one of the most difficult and challenging aspects of EU funding.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09020927000010"></a>It is clear that regions need flexibility and strong social institutions to take advantage of these opportunities. It is also clear that the debate will be a long one. We are considering a policy that will not be in place until 2014. All interested parties need to participate actively. As the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, pointed out, transitional arrangements will be key.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09020927000011"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, spoke about gaps between funding periods. I listened with interest to this issue. The situation is not as stark as presented. The &#147;n+2&#148; rule&#151;another piece of structural fund language that I am getting used to&#151;means that spending is continuing on the 2000 to 2006 programmes. The rule helps ensure that the change from one programme period to another is relatively smooth.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09020927000012"></a>As this is a long-running debate, we do not expect to have an outline of Commission proposals for the future before 2010. It also needs to be seen, as pointed out by my noble friend Lady Cohen, in the wider context of the EU budget and its ongoing review. Some have asked for the debate to be considered free of financial constraints.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09020927000013"></a>However, the European Union&#146;s financial instruments for addressing its cohesion policy are the structural and cohesion funds. Any expansion of the cohesion policy is likely to lead to additional demands on the European Union budget. As was pointed out, the debate is also linked to the Lisbon treaty and its  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1006"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 1006</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>introduction of the European Union aim of territorial cohesion. Some see this introduction as a rationale for expanding the scope of cohesion policy.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09020927000014"></a>Recent Commission consultation has been launched on territorial cohesion to try to get a better idea of what that means. The Government will be responding in the next few weeks on that aspect. I will respond to the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, on the auditing point. I do not have the answer.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09020927000015"></a>The Government have set out their position on the future of regional policy several times over the past year in responses to community consultations as well as at meetings and conferences at both official and ministerial level. I would like to take this opportunity to set out briefly the main points of our position. The primary aim of cohesion policy should be addressing disparities in economic development and, in particular, should be focused on supporting the Lisbon jobs and growth agenda in conjunction with the Gothenburg sustainable development agenda. The UK also wants to see a significant increase in the proportion of the funds allocated to poorer member states as this is seen to bring the highest level of what we consider to be EU added value. I spent my career banning the words &#147;added value&#148; because I never knew quite what they meant in the corporate world, and here I am in my maiden speech talking about EU added value.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09020927000016"></a>Where member states have the institutional structures and financial strength to develop and pursue their own regional policies, they should be enabled to do so within a common EU strategic framework. I was struck by the points made by my noble friend Lady Cohen on the need to help poorer countries that do not have that infrastructure. Consequently, structural funds in the richer member states should be phased out. Given that aim, the priority should be that standard competitiveness and employment funding should no longer be available to richer member states.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09020927000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, raised a number of issues, including that of continuity. I agree that continuity is crucial. However, as I get into the role, I also believe that the role of RDAs has developed in the UK. This morning, I joined the meeting of the executive board of UKTI, and it is clear that the RDAs play a pivotal role. I am very keen to get involved in understanding them and making sure that they play the right role.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09020927000018"></a>I turn to the impact of the current global financial crisis on EU regional policy. The focus of EU debate has moved to how current policy can be adapted to these extraordinary times. As the noble Lord, Lord Watson, mentioned, it is a critical issue. It is important that we do not lose sight of the fact that we are trying to create employment across Europe, particularly in the poorer states. The Government welcome changes to the funds that increase liquidity, and changes that simplify and improve the effective management of the funds. At a time of economic crisis across many countries, it is important that money moves quickly and efficiently. There is now increased activity on simplification of the current funds. The Commission has formed a simplification working group. I always believe that simplification working groups can, on occasion, make life more complicated, so we will have to make sure  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1007"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 1007</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that, through our active participation, we have high-impact, low-cost and efficiently delivered money. That is the Government&#146;s aim and we need to make sure that that happens.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09020927000019"></a>Noble Lords have had the opportunity to see the Government&#146;s response to the report. It has been mentioned a few times and I will not use the time to reiterate it. I will mention that the Czech presidency aims to hold an international conference in March on the future of cohesion policy, and an informal ministerial meeting in April. We need to make sure that a number of points raised today are fed in to these meetings, and also through other channels.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09020927000020"></a>At the informal ministerial meeting we are expecting a political debate on the main principles of the future of cohesion policy post-2013. We also expect a presentation from the European Commission on the preliminary findings of the Green Paper on territorial cohesion, and an orientation paper that we believe to be a summary of the debate to date.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09020927000021"></a>There have been a number of questions and, as this is my maiden speech, I am going to take them at the end, rather than insert them into the speech&#151;I hope to become more expert at that in due course. The noble Lord, Lord Trimble, and other noble Lords, mentioned a very important point about NUTS and allocation methodology. The Government will consider these issues; they are important and we need to carry  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1008"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column 1008</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on the debate about whether we have the right methodology and allocation. The only other question I will answer concerns the overall relevance of cohesion policy in the general debate. I believe that EU regional policy and EU aid is more rather than less important at a time of economic crisis.</p>

<a name="90209-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09020927000022"></a>Noble Lords have raised a number of issues. We will take those points away, feed them into the debate and carry on the discussion.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000004"></a>When the Government first raised the idea of a sub-national review, most of us welcomed it. When the initial discussions were going on, it seemed that the Government were devolving powers from the RDAs to more local systems, which is certainly preferable. But now we see the proof of the pudding in the legislation. As we have discussed over the past few days, so much is set by the Secretary of State. We are now going through a series of amendments and discussions where the Secretary of State has this or that power and there is not much localism in it at all. It is even further away from local government than we are now. That will come out in a lot of the amendments proposed to this clause.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000005"></a>I have been involved in several pieces of related legislation as they have gone through this House, as have most of my colleagues on this side. I think that the Minister has not been involved for so long, as most of the earlier legislation was taken through the House by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. We had many discussions about a lot of this. I was never very keen on the RDAs when they were set up. The legislation that set them up also created the regional assemblies to scrutinise them. That has not really worked at all. Since then, the regional assemblies have been given different powers of their own and will do different things. They have never been an effective scrutiny committee for the RDAs. Some RDAs work better than others, when there is a grouping of authorities that work together anyway. The RDA that I know in the eastern region has not really worked at all. That is nothing against the individuals, but it has been a grouping of authorities that do not have very much in common, and it has not achieved very much at all. In fact, it has been a big waste of money, and the money could have been much better spent at a local level.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000006"></a>I hoped when we saw a sub-national review that we were going to get some sense of it. I do not like to keep quoting Essex, but obviously I know it very well. The county that I am leader of has Thames Gateway, which relates to London and Kent, which is in the south-east region. We have Haven Gateway. At least we are in the same region, but it is across two counties of Suffolk and Essex. They are the sort of things that make sense. It would have been much better to have given more autonomy and more help to things like that, than it would to give it to this legislation.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000007"></a>As the Minister knows, I am a great supporter of LAAs&#151;they work well in my county&#151;and I am now a great supporter of MAAs. Much of the future could have been in MAAs instead of setting up the machinery which the Government are going to set up. This series of amendments from me probes what the Government expect to get out of this. We all carry out economic assessments now; we ought to do so. Any large authority does work on them, and I do not see much point in making them statutory. On the other hand, I am not that against making them statutory, because we are all doing quite a lot of work, particularly in the current situation, to support the economy in our own area. That is often done very much better at a local level than through a wider body such as an RDA.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000008"></a>However, we see from the Government&#146;s suggestions that the economic assessments will not even feed into the regional strategy, which I simply do not understand. It is complete nonsense that an Essex strategy carried out in conjunction with our two unitaries or our two Gateway areas has no power to feed into the regional strategy. The Government do not describe what an area is or say whether it is small or big. Obviously a county such as Essex would work with the areas that I have just talked about. I am sure that we will have a lot of debate about what the Government expect from these economic assessments and who will participate in them. Will they be directed by the Secretary of State, which I would be totally against, or will they come up from local initiatives, which is what happens in my county now and is much more powerful and important, particularly at this time and when the recession is likely to go on for some time? This is also true of times of prosperity. We know locally what we want, so we should be able to help and get on with it. If we are going to have regional strategies, we should be able to feed our bit into them.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000009"></a>The thing that has been set up now does not work at all. I am not talking about housing numbers; we can talk about that later. During consideration of the planning legislation some three years ago, I said that we would revisit the subject because I never thought that the RDAs would deliver houses, and we are revisiting it because the RDAs did not deliver them before this legislation: not that anyone is delivering houses at the moment because of the recession.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000010"></a>We will have a whole series of debates and questions about this. As I said, these amendments are probing, and are designed to hear what the Government have to say at the initial part of this discussion. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC253"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC253</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will put on the record a comment that I made in response to the suggested groupings that we received on Friday; there were so many amendments and such long groupings because all this amounts to the fact that we really do not like this.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000012"></a>My Amendment 160E deals with subsequent parts of the Bill that we like even less than the economic assessment provisions, and would provide that the local authorities should prepare assessments in accordance with their own criteria. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has used the term &#147;autonomy&#148;, which is the first word that I wrote down in my notes on this amendment. The assessment should not be top down. Most authorities, after all, do not need to be told that they need to assess the economic situation of their own area. The two clauses in this part of the Bill do not explain the purpose of economic assessments. It is common sense that one would carry them out. In many different ways, they provide for the Secretary of State to direct the process, so central government will tell local authorities what to do but not why.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000013"></a>Amendment 160F would provide that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020920000129"></a>&#147;In preparing the assessment, the authority shall have regard to social and environmental matters&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000120"></a>We are really concerned that the economic focus of the previous three or four parts of the Bill will undermine, and possibly even edge on driving out, the other facets of sustainable development. The three facets&#151;social and environmental as well as economic&#151;together with other matters which are perhaps of a second order rank but which are now generally accepted as going along with them, such as the sensible use of science, should be inseparable. I accept that economic and environmental issues may need to be balanced but they should all remain within the same part of the consideration. They cannot be separated in practice anyway because, for instance, economic problems may well lead to an increase in social needs. To focus so rigidly on economic matters carries with it very great danger.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000014"></a>My Amendment 161A is consequential on the other two amendments. We support the Conservative&#146;s Amendments 160D and 161. I do not see the point or the necessity for these clauses. That would not matter except that central Government are requiring local authorities to carry out yet another function, and will probably require them to do it a bit differently from the way it has been done&#151;this is not a new point on the Bill&#151;which will result in a waste of resources, officer time, member time and money.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000015"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09020920000154"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I very much go along with what the two previous speakers have said. I have tabled Amendment 160G in this group. I also oppose the Question that Clause 63 stand part of the Bill in order to ask one or two fairly fundamental questions, some of which were touched on by my noble friend. Amendment 160G questions whether, in making this economic assessment, local authorities really are starting from scratch and with an empty sheet, and whether many of them have not already met the requirements of the clause. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, suggested that Essex had spent a lot of time carrying out an economic assessment, conducting a survey of its area for the  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC254"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC254</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>purposes of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, which we discussed not long ago, and collecting wider economic information. There is a real danger that setting out a whole series of detailed requirements on how a council has to go about collecting this information will result in duplication and with no new information being collected that would not have been collected anyway. A lot of time and energy could be taken up unnecessarily. Therefore, Amendment 160G says that the duty to carry out the economic assessment,</p>
<ul><a name="09020920000142"></a>&#147;is fulfilled if, on the day this section commences&#151;</ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020920000130"></a>(a) such an assessment has been prepared within the previous five years by the principal local authority, another principal local authority, a partner authority, any other appropriate body, or a combination of any of these&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000121"></a>In other words, if the information that is being sought already exists and there are great piles of paper with it all written down and many sites on the council&#146;s computers are storing it, probably rather more tidily, it is ridiculous for a local authority to have to start again and collect it from scratch under this part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000016"></a>The second part suggests that it does not all have to be done at once, but in stages for different areas. It may be that work is required only on certain parts of a large unitary or county authority, perhaps because of a particular problem such as declining industry, unemployment or other economic problems and opportunities. There might be an opportunity to make improvements to the transport infrastructure which leads to the possibility for development and thus economic progress. That is common sense.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000017"></a>As regards whether Clause 63 should stand part of the Bill, like the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and my noble friend, I question whether there is any lack of information. In relation to Part 4, the <I>Briefing Pack for Peers</I> dated 5 December last states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020920000131"></a>&#147;Local authorities are to have a well-informed, robust assessment of economic conditions to inform local and regional strategies&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000122"></a>The argument is that in many cases they will already have it. The briefing goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020920000132"></a>&#147;Although some local authorities take their economic role very seriously and have made real progress, evidence shows that the quality, depth and scope of local economic assessments vary considerably&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000123"></a>We know, of course, that local variation is something this Government do not like. It continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020920000133"></a>&#147;The failure of some authorities to develop a robust, accurate economic evidence base has hampered their development of coherent economic strategies&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000124"></a>Before we are satisfied that this clause is needed, which at the moment we do not think it is, what is the evidence that the failure of some authorities to do this has hampered their development of coherent economic strategies? Which authorities does it concern? Are we going to have some authorities named and shamed, or is it more a general view that, &#147;Well, there&#146;s too much variation. Everything is being done in different ways. We don&#146;t like it and we want to set out detailed rules and regulations&#148;?</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000018"></a>Will carrying out all this extra work, in many cases duplicated work, change anything on the ground? Will it change policies or will it be just another way to

My next question is this: what is the purpose of local elections if everything has to be controlled from above in the technocratic way implied by these provisions? Lastly, do the Government have any idea of what sort of document they are talking about? How big should it be? The impact assessment sets out how much it will or will not cost to produce, and as usual I have tried to understand it, but I cannot. Essentially, though, the Government are saying that it will not cost much, if anything. I have no feeling for what kind of document is envisaged. Should it be a 10-page report, one of 50 pages or of 2,000 pages giving a detailed economic assessment of a widespread county like Lancashire, or a big city such as Manchester or Liverpool? I hope that we can be given answers to these questions.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has also given notice of his intention to oppose the Question that Clause 63 shall stand part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000020"></a>Before I address this amendment and the others in the group, it might help if I explain specifically why we believe that a duty should be placed on local authorities. I shall restrict my comments to the economic duty in Clauses 63 and 64, and the wider issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, about the RDAs will be addressed by my noble friend in later amendments.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000021"></a>In July 2007, we published our review of sub-national economic development and regeneration. This was a joint Treasury, DTI and CLG review that looked at how regions and localities can respond more effectively to future economic challenges. This review concluded that there are considerable opportunities for local authorities to play a stronger role in economic development and regeneration. It added that as local place-shapers, authorities are well placed to lead and facilitate the delivery of economic growth and regeneration.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000022"></a>To increase its focus on economic development, the review concluded that all county councils and unitary authorities should have a new duty to assess the economic circumstances of their area. Such a duty would help local authorities and their partners to work more effectively, supported by a comprehensive and robust economic evidence base. The review proposed that local economic assessments should form part of the evidence base for the sustainable community strategy, local area agreements and the regional strategy.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000023"></a>In March last year we consulted on the key proposals set out in the SNR, including the local economic assessment duty. The consultation revealed broad support for the duty across all sectors, including local government and business. Local government welcomed the duty as a helpful addition to local authority functions. It sees it as vital in underpinning a much stronger role for councils and groups of councils working together at a sub-regional level in economic development. The proposed duty would help to ensure that all local authorities have a clear understanding of the conditions required  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC256"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC256</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for business to flourish in their area and for people to take advantage of economic opportunities. It will also help to ensure that all future economic and regeneration interventions by local authorities and their partners are informed by a thorough and robust assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of their area. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that that duty is particularly important in the current economic climate.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000024"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, of course, many local authorities already carry out local economic assessments and the duty would build on existing good practice. But we believe that it is important that all areas should be covered by an economic assessment and that they should be done to a high standard. Our own research&#151;<I>Review of economic assessment and strategy activity at the local and sub-regional level</I>, undertaken in March 2008&#151;clearly shows that local assessments vary considerably in quality and are often limited in extent. That research also shows that local strategies are not always underpinned by a strong evidence base. The proposed new duty would help to ensure that local authorities deliver high quality assessments.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000025"></a>As noble Lords may be aware, we have published a policy statement entitled <I>Local Economic Assessments</I><I>&#151;</I><I>Policy Statemen</I><I>t</I>. This sets out how we believe local economic assessments should be taken forward and the principles that should shape them. We have worked closely with a number of stakeholders in putting together this policy statement, including local government representatives, the RDAs, regional observatories and the Improvement and Development Agency. As the statement makes clear, we believe that local authorities should determine for themselves how best to carry out their assessment. After all they know their economy best. However, we also believe that there are some core principles that should be common to all assessments if local authorities are to get a comprehensive picture of the economic conditions of their area. Our intention is to include these principles in guidance.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000026"></a>For instance, we believe that the assessments should have a strong spatial focus and identify economic conditions at all spatial levels. Assessments should, wherever possible, mirror functional economic areas. Where economic areas transcend administrative boundaries, local authorities should undertake joint assessments. We also believe that assessments should review the regeneration challenges of their area. In that context they should improve understanding of how economic development can support regeneration priorities.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000027"></a>It is not our intention to prescribe what data and methodologies local authorities should use. However, given that the new assessments should feed into sustainable community strategies, LAAs, local development frameworks and the single regional strategy and that they will inevitably be a factor in the development of sub-regional arrangements between neighbouring authorities, there needs to be some consistency in the scope and use of data and methodology across each region. This is more likely to be achieved if local authorities and regional partners work together to agree a framework for taking forward the assessments by making the best use of the knowledge and expertise held across the region.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC257"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC257</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000028"></a>We continue to work closely with the local government sector in helping local authorities to prepare for the new duty. The Improvement and Development Agency is putting together a sector-led package of support and guidance on local economic assessments, funded through the planning advisory service. Partnerships are organising a series of regional events for local authorities and other regional partners to explore how collectively they can make best use of knowledge and expertise. The events that have taken place so far have been particularly well attended and there is already a good deal of enthusiasm among local authorities for getting to grips with the new duty.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000125"></a>This evidence will complement our own guidance and build on the messages that we set out. I hope that the context that I have set out has been helpful and that Members of the Committee will agree that Clause 63 should stand part of the Bill and the amendment should be rejected.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000029"></a>Amendment 161 would take away the requirement for principal local authorities to revise an assessment, or any part of it, if the Secretary of State directs. I assure Members of the Committee that the power to direct a local authority to revise its assessment, or any part of it, is not something that the Secretary of State would use lightly. We fully expect most local authorities to ensure that their assessments are current and fit for purpose. For example, there is much to be gained from keeping up to date. So the power of direction is merely there as a safeguard.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000030"></a>On Amendments 164 and 160E, Amendment 164 would take away the requirement for principle local authorities to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State; and Amendment 160E would enable principal local authorities to prepare an economic assessment in accordance with their own criteria. The Members of the Committee who have tabled these amendments believe that local authorities should decide for themselves the criteria for taking forward the economic assessments. I can assure them that our aim is to publish only light-touch guidance that helps local authorities to make best use of the opportunities presented by the duty and provides the level of consistency needed.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000031"></a>As I explained earlier, some common principles should apply to all assessments. We do not think it unreasonable to ask authorities to have regard to these in developing their assessments. For example, our aim would be to help local authorities by clarifying how the new duty links up with other duties and responsibilities, such as the sustainable community strategy, LAAs and the local development framework. It would also explain how the assessments fit in with the proposed regional strategy.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000032"></a>We should not forget that, as we have discussed before, to &#147;have regard&#148; means just that. Of course local authorities must consider the issues raised in the guidance, but that does not mean that they must slavishly adhere to them if they have good reasons not to. This strikes the best balance between having restrictive government direction and leaving local authorities to go off and do whatever they wish in undertaking their assessment. Indeed, many local authority practitioners  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC258"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC258</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>welcome government guidance, as they believe it will help them to prepare for the new duty. Of course, as always, we would consult widely on draft guidance before issuing it in final form. Although we expect local variation and welcome both it and innovation, we also expect this to be within a framework, set out in guidance that ensures that the assessments achieve the aims that I have outlined.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000033"></a>Amendment 160F, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Tope, would require a principal local authority to have regard to social and environmental issues in preparing its economic assessment. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, expressed her concerns that the new duty would possibly give too great a prominence to economic issues at the expense of social and environmental matters. Again, I reassure Members of the Committee that this is absolutely not the case. As the local economic assessments policy statement makes clear, local economic assessments should contribute to the overall aim of delivering sustainable development. Ultimately, the assessments should inform the sustainable community strategy, which should set out the long-term vision for the economic, social and environmental well-being of a local area.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000034"></a>We believe that the assessments should, among other things, address the social factors that impede economic growth and the causes of labour market exclusion. So the evidence gained through the assessments should also support the Government&#146;s broad aims of tackling barriers to economic growth, creating accessible jobs and giving people the skills to progress, and empowering communities.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000035"></a>The policy statement also encourages local authorities to consider the impact of local economic development on the environment, and how the local economy will be affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy. On top of this, local authorities already undertake a number of other surveys and assessments that would have a bearing on social and environmental issues. It is important that there is interaction between the economic assessment and these other assessments, a point that we make in our policy statement.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000036"></a>Our view is that any thorough assessment will give sufficient prominence to social and environmental issues. The issues raised by this amendment are best addressed through guidance. Any guidance issued by the Secretary of State would indeed stress the need for local authorities to have due regard to social and environmental matters. Placing the matters that should be addressed in assessments in the Bill would, in our view, unnecessarily constrain local authorities. It would also be more difficult for us to respond to changing economic circumstances and changing priorities as any change to the elements that should be included in any assessment would require a further Bill. For example, priorities during an economic upturn may be very different from the priorities in a recession.</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC259"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC259</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>five years by it or even by another body and the principal local authority believes that the assessment meets the general purposes of this clause. Understandably, the noble Lord seeks to ensure that that previous work does not go to waste, which is commendable.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000038"></a>The important point is that an assessment is fit for purpose and gives an accurate and up-to-date assessment of local economic conditions. This is a point we stress in our policy paper. Therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate to place an arbitrary cut off point in the Bill, and certainly not one of five years. I doubt very much that an assessment carried out five years ago would fit the bill, given the economic changes that will have occurred in that time. As our policy statement states, a principal local authority that has already carried out an assessment prior to this duty coming into force will need to consider it in the light of the new duty and any government guidance. While they may need to make some changes and will need to ensure that they meet their obligations to consult, the work they have already done will not go to waste.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000039"></a>The noble Lord also proposes that a principal authority should be able to prepare the assessment for different parts of the area covered by the assessment at different times. We do not agree that local authorities should prepare the initial assessment for different parts of the principal local authority&#146;s area at different times. The aim of an assessment is to get a comprehensive and holistic picture of the current economic conditions of the local economy. If local authorities were encouraged to assess different parts of the area covered at different times, they would not be able to get that holistic picture. You could have the situation where different parts of the area covered would be assessed against inconsistent data sets. However, authorities may revise the assessment or part of it at any time. This allows sufficient flexibility to ensure changes that in local circumstances can be taken into account.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000040"></a>I hope that these assurances address the Committee&#146;s concerns and that Members will understand why I do not think these amendments are necessary. I also ask that Clause 63 stand part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000041"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09020920000156"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I should like to ask two questions, having drawn a number of conclusions; namely, that there is to be a duty because a few local authorities are not undertaking assessments and that local authorities should decide for themselves how to do it, provided the Secretary of State agrees. On the second point, I would ask the Government, as I have asked every Government in office since I joined your Lordships' House, how they would feel if the Secretary of State were not from their own party but was someone whom they might regard as less benign. I have also drawn the conclusion that the comments about acknowledging the social and environmental aspects of sustainable development might jeopardise the economic matters at difficult economic times, which makes my point for me.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000042"></a>Will the Government confirm that all this is within the powers of local authorities and that it is within the power of the Secretary of State to give the guidance, which seems to be the basis for all this, and to make the policy statement? The answers to those questions are clearly yes. Therefore, to that extent they are rhetorical, which, again makes our point.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000043"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09020920000157"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> The Minister referred to the policy statement, which, in my view, is full of top-down rules and regulations. The longer I listened to the Minister speaking, the more I saw a whole series of top-down guidance, rather than regulations, which everyone seems to have to carry out. He said that practitioners welcome new guidance to prepare for new duties. However, if you are provided with a load of new duties but you do not quite understand what they mean or understand the legislation, of course you will welcome guidance telling you how to do it. Otherwise, you may be very worried that you are not doing your job properly.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000044"></a>The Minister said that he detected a lot of enthusiasm among local authorities. I should like to know where that is to be found. I detect little or no enthusiasm among local authorities for most of the contents of the Bill. Although this is one of the more benign parts of it compared with some of the others, nevertheless it is all utterly unnecessary. It is legislation that does not need to be enacted. One of the basic principles of legislation always used to be that the state had no right to involve itself in the liberties of the citizen unless it was necessary. Now the Government seem to think that they can involve themselves in legislation, all of which affects the liberties of citizens or organisations, not if it is necessary but if they feel like it or it is convenient, or expedient, or for whatever reasons.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000045"></a>I asked about evidence of failure among local authorities which are not carrying out this provision, but have been given none. However, we should be prepared to believe that some will be judged not to be doing it properly. What the Government have to understand is that some will not be doing it properly after this legislation is enacted because some poor local authorities do not do things well or do not do particular things well. Enacting legislation like this, saying that they must be good boys and girls, does not mean to say that they will be good boys and girls. This legislation will change little except that some people will be employed to carry out unnecessary work, which will result in duplication. It is not simply a question of saying&#151;as my amendment does&#151;that previous work should not be wasted, but rather that new work should not be done if it is unnecessary. There is no evidence at all that if you want to get a comprehensive and holistic picture, to quote the Minister, of local authorities&#146; economic situation, you cannot get it from them or be referred to someone else who has that information. That is the existing situation in most places and is why I think this clause ought to be removed from the Bill.</p>

Every other word was about guidance, which is what we are concerned about. I thought he said that guidance might be applied on a different basis. Clearly, what happens in my county is very different from what might happen in Lancashire, Northumberland or Cornwall. Therefore, guidance will need to be applied differently. If guidance is to be applied to processes, it will result in much more bureaucracy, which is one of the things we are all concerned about. I hope that the noble Lord is not thinking that there will be so much detailed national guidance that we will stop what we are doing now and start all over again. Local authorities are doing their

If they are encumbered with national guidance, it might make the situation much worse. I hope that the noble Lord will reflect on that. He said that the national guidance would be light touch, but successive Secretaries of State can view &#147;light touch&#148; differently. We are very concerned about this issue.</p>

It does but we need to provide a consistent framework within which it can happen. This is not just about identifying a handful of criteria but achieving consistency across the country as regards how the measure is carried out. We have had fruitful events which local authorities have attended. Many local authorities attended events in the south-west and found them useful. I take the point that Secretaries of State change but we will consult on the guidance. We are discussing with IDeA its sector-led guidance on best practice. This is about providing a consistent framework and ensuring that things are joined-up. In certain areas measures are not feeding into the regional strategy. This is what we are trying to join up. The guidance would direct people to that.</p>

I hope that we can persuade the Government to revisit this area, otherwise we will have complicated further processes in the passage of the Bill through Report stage and Third Reading. Clearly there is a lot of unhappiness with the Bill.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000050"></a>When local authorities are consulted on whether they want a new duty the only reason they say yes is that they think they might get a bit more money. They do not say yes because they will be getting guidance from the Secretary of State. If we have a duty, we usually get money. That is why they said yes last year, rather than saying yes to a lot of involvement by the Secretary of State. Local authorities already do it and they thought that if they had a duty to do so they would get a few more millions to help them with regeneration and so on. That is why they said yes. They wanted a bit more money for regeneration and help with their economies. If the Government said that, they would have no problems with their proposals. We will have a series of discussions round this issue this afternoon. I beg leave to withdraw the amendments.</p>

I shall be referring later to the very successful Essex partnership involving the county and district councils, the health authorities, the police, and so on.

As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, they are simple amendments. He has more experience in working with district councils than me, and if the leader of a county council says that it makes sense, it must be right. The Local Government Association supports the amendments. It points out, correctly, that district councils have the housing responsibility. They are the local planning authority, so it makes no sense to exclude them from the Bill. I hesitate to say that because in reality, of course, they cannot and will not be excluded; they have to, and will continue to, work with county councils. We share the view of the LGA that a straightforward joint duty in two-tier areas would be preferable and would remove the central role of the districts. The noble Lord said that it was a simple amendment, which it is. It is clear in its intention and purpose, but it is also an important amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000053"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09020920000165"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Amendments 163A and 163B are also in this group, referring to the involvement of district councils in two-tier areas and their relationship with the county council. I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and I support everything he and my noble friend said.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000054"></a>Amendment 163A refers to Clause 63(6)(b), which refers back to the duty on the local planning authority under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, of which as I said, we all have fond memories. Clause 13(1) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020920000135"></a>&#147;The local planning authority must keep under review the matters which may be expected to affect the development of their area or the planning of its development&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000126"></a>Clearly, the duty refers to the district council as a planning authority and to its functions in development and planning. As regards the economic assessment of an area, as opposed to land use or spatial planning&#151;functions wider than those merely of a planning authority are involved. One of the things that a lot of district councils have done over the past 30 years is taken on new roles in the economic development of their area. That may be in town centres or industry, or working through their local strategic partnership in job creation and training, and economic stimulation. There are all kinds of areas that are not specifically related to district council functions, but districts have become involved in them because of the need and the because of what they can obviously do.</p>
<h5><a name="09020920000146"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000055"></a>Much of this Bill, particularly this clause, implies that districts really do not do that kind of thing. It implies that the county does it and that districts just do the planning and function as a housing or leisure authority, or whatever. But even in that, districts have important functions in the wider economic development and prosperity of their area. I am therefore proposing  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC263"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC263</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that rather than restricting the measure to this narrow interpretation of what districts may contribute as planning authorities, it should apply to anything that they think is useful&#151;anything to do with the rest of their functions. In two-tier areas of the country&#151;the districts at a town level and the borough level&#151;the districts are more important than the counties as regards economic development functions.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000056"></a>Finally, some parts of the country are getting these new strange things called &#147;multi-area agreements&#148;&#151;I declare an interest in an authority which has just signed up to one. MAAs exist specifically to promote economic development and the economic regeneration of areas. That is their single most important function and it is why they have been set up. Districts in areas such as Pennine Lancashire are playing a major part in that, alongside the unitary authorities and the county councils in their own two-tier areas. To omit them from this proposal seems silly. Nowadays, districts do far more than the Government understand and realise, going by much of what is in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000057"></a>Amendment 163B is fairly simple. The Bill states that the district council must co-operate with the county council. I merely want it to state that the county council must be reasonable in what it wants the district council to co-operate in, and to insist that it must co-operate when the county council makes a reasonable request, and not any old request that might have nothing to do with the issue in hand&#151;or more likely is onerous.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000058"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09020920000166"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> Amendment 162 would have the effect of making non-unitary district councils principal local authorities in respect of the duty, as well as unitary district councils and county councils. Amendment 163 would require a county council to act jointly with the district council for that area in preparing an economic assessment. These amendments would in effect place a joint duty on the county council and district councils in its area.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000059"></a>We believe that there are clear advantages in having one body in the lead. This makes it easier for local authorities and partners to engage and decide on the scope and use of data and methodology, and to provide clearer lines of accountability.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000060"></a>County councils are already the responsible authorities for developing local area agreements in two-tier areas, working closely with partner authorities, including district councils. Given that local economic assessments will be expected to inform LAAs&#146; negotiations, it is appropriate for the county council also to lead the preparation of the economic assessment. It is also our view that local economic assessments should reflect the local economic geography as closely as possible. For example, in shire areas economic areas tend to match county boundaries more closely than district council boundaries, which tend to be too small. In that context, it makes greater sense to place the duty on the county council. Devon would be a good example of where the wider functional economy is matched closely to the county boundary. Here the county council leads on sub-regional economic development across the county.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000061"></a>I can assure Members of the Committee that we do not, in any way, under-estimate the vital role districts play in supporting local economic development and  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC264"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regeneration. It is true that the Bill, as drafted, places the duty to prepare an economic assessment on county councils in two-tier areas. However, it also includes a requirement on those councils to consult and seek the participation of district councils within its area and to take account of the evidence gathered by the district council in the course of its role as planning authority that may affect the development of the area. It also includes a requirement for district councils to co-operate with the county council.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000062"></a>The Bill requires both tiers to work closely together in preparing their local economic assessment. It strikes the right balance between ensuring that district councils are fully involved and the need to avoid unnecessary burdens. It also provides district councils with an enhanced role in recognition of their important contribution to the assessment. To place a joint duty on district councils and county councils would potentially increase the costs for district councils, which would be an inefficient use of local authority resources. Also, many district councils are not as well resourced as county councils to carry out this type of function.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000063"></a>Amendment 163A tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would require the county council to have regard to any other material that the district council decides to provide beyond the material produced by it in pursuit of its local planning role. There well may be other material held by the district council that would be of use to the county council in preparing its economic assessment. However, it is neither desirable nor necessary to place an open-ended requirement for the county council to have regard to any material that the district council decides to provide. Beyond the planning function, it is better to leave it to the county council and the district councils to sort out what material may be of use to the county council in preparing its economic assessment.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000064"></a>Amendment 163B would require the district council to co-operate with &#147;reasonable requests&#148; from the county council. We do not believe that this amendment is necessary, as the obligation to co-operate does not require the district council to do anything unreasonable. We are not suggesting that the county council has the power to direct the district council to do anything. We are confident that the county council and district councils can decide between themselves how they could best work together, as they already do in many other spheres. We do not believe that it is necessary for the Government to further prescribe on this issue.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000065"></a>I hope that these assurances I have given&#151;about the requirement on county councils to seek the participation of district councils, on the duty for districts to co-operate, and on our valuing the important role that districts play&#151;address the concerns of Members of the Committee, and that they will understand why I do not think that these amendments are necessary.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000066"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09020920000167"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> On my first amendment, the Minister said that we can leave it to the county and district councils to sort out. I would be perfectly happy with that. It is not what the Bill says. It says that the district council gets involved as a planning authority. I accept that planning functions impinge on everything else, but it should get involved as a local authority with all  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC265"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC265</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>its functions in so far as they are relevant. An enormous number, perhaps most, of district functions are relevant to economic development, prosperity and regeneration. It would therefore be better to put a statement that the district council will co-operate with the county council as an authority, not as a planning authority, in the Bill. That is a fairly simple thing that the Government might think about, rather than just saying that I am wrong. I am not in this instance.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000067"></a>The Minister also said that boundaries should be based on economic geography, and there is a lot of sense in that. Very often the county is the economic unit, but it can also be a group of smaller unitary authorities. But it is also true, and here I admit that my experience is very much coloured by my own county of Lancashire, that the economic unit is smaller than a large county. That must be the case for some of the bigger counties in the south as well. For example, in Lancashire it is generally accepted and understood that our economic units are central Lancashire, the Fylde coast in west Lancashire and east Lancashire, now known as Pennine Lancashire. In these areas the districts are traditionally strong because they used to be boroughs or county boroughs and have played a large part in driving economic development. In Burnley, which the noble Lord knows well, the borough council is as important as the county council in the attempt to rescue the local economy from the decline of the past decades. The borough council is the driver behind local projects, not the county council. It is a fact of life in areas like Burnley, and I do not think the Government understand that as well as people on the ground might.</p>

I tend to agree with much of what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has said. We may revisit this issue because it does not seem to me that it would take much to give way on it. The present wording is a bit of an insult to districts because it has to be a partnership between the county and the districts, and as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, pointed out, virtually every county runs a different system. In Essex we have areas closely adjacent to London as well as very rural parts in the north of the county. One has to work with the different circumstances of each part of the county.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000069"></a>There is some strong feeling about this, particularly from the LGA. I think that the Government could reconsider the point, and I hope that they might do so before the next stage. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000071"></a>Amendment 162ZA makes the requirement to consult permissive rather than prescriptive in subsection (5) so that the principal local authority &#147;may&#148; consult whomsoever it wishes. Of course, it already does so and will continue to do so, but rather than say that it must consult, and then go on at some length about who it must consult&#151;no doubt to be prescribed in guidance&#151;and how it must be done, this should be a permissive measure. If the Government are serious about their light-touch approach, they should accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000072"></a>Amendment 162AA would include parish councils specifically in the Bill. Again, at an earlier stage in our debates we all agreed about the importance of parish councils. This amendment recognises that and ensures that they are included. Either they &#147;must&#148; be consulted or, possibly, they &#147;may&#148; be consulted. Amendment 164A gets into the lists. We went through all this at considerable length on Chapter 2, and here we are again. Amendment 164A specifically adds a police authority, a crime and disorder reduction partnership, a local probation board and a youth offending team.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000073"></a>The purpose of the amendment at this stage is to probe why they are not there. They are obviously partner authorities, and they will obviously continue to be consulted in the preparation of economic assessments. No doubt, the Minister will shortly tell us why they are not there.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000074"></a>Amendment 164B adds the Health and Safety Executive. Again, it is not on the list, and we probe and wonder why not. Amendment 165ZA removes the right of the Secretary of State to remove by order any person&#151;person is defined in the Bill&#151;he or she may wish to. Again, I return to the point made earlier by my noble friend Lady Hamwee. It may just possibly be that one day we shall have a Secretary of State who thinks that she or he would like to run every local authority in the country. That is an inconceivable thought to some of us, but it is not necessarily going to be the same Secretary of State who we have known and loved in the past. It will not necessarily for ever be the same benign Government, so well disposed towards local government, as we have now. The Government are determined to legislate for the worst councils; it is fair enough that we should consider the possibility of having the worst Governments at some time in the future.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000075"></a>It is as likely as having bad councils that we will one day have bad Governments. The last of my amendments in the group, Amendment 165ZB, speaks for itself. I beg to move.</p>

I endorse everything that the noble Lord, Lord Tope, said. To have the list of people who one should consult is ridiculous. It should be left to local circumstances,

I have just said that we have bodies such as the Haven Gateway and the Thames Gateway, and obviously they should be consulted, but they should not be in the legislation.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000077"></a>My two amendments have been suggested by the Association of Colleges, and I agree with its point. The Learning and Skills Council is mentioned in two parts of the legislation. However, legislation has just been given a Second Reading in the other place that abolishes the Learning and Skills Council and sets up a skills funding agency, if I have it right, and a young people&#146;s learning agency. There is already something in the Bill that is going to be abolished in the coming months, with two new bodies set up in its place. That highlights the ridiculous nature of listing all these various bodies as the Government have done.</p>

I apologise.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000080"></a>I shall speak to Amendment 162AZA, which is grouped. It goes back to what I have been trying to put forward throughout the Bill, and no doubt will continue to do so. You cannot seriously set up systems to involve and consult&#151;to deal with the real world on the ground, however you do it&#151;without considering and including local strategic partnerships.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000081"></a>I do not understand the Government&#146;s desire for local strategic partnerships to play an important role in local governance and economic matters without appearing in legislation. It is quite extraordinary and denies the world as it is. As I always say as a caveat, I would be happy if local strategic partnerships disappeared and their functions were simply put with local authorities, to do all the consultation, working groups and involvement with other bodies that LSPs do when they are working well. But they exist and are not going to disappear. We therefore ought to accept in legislation that they are just as important as all the other bodies that are listed.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000082"></a>In many cases, LSPs are certainly more important at a local level than the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England, important though that is for particular historic buildings and monuments. They are often a fundamental part of how a local authority tackles local economic issues. They tackle social, environmental, transport and educational issues and all sorts of others, but their role of trying to produce, and provide training for, local jobs, investing in local business and improving local transport infrastructure and so on is at their heart. All of that is crucial to the local economy. The LSPs currently often commission the economic assessments that the Government are talking about and want councils to be responsible for. LSPs are currently doing this on behalf of the council and their other partners. To leave them out of legislation is crazy.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000083"></a>Finally, I remind the Government that LSPs exist not only for the principal local authorities at the top tier or unitary level, but also for district councils. In  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC268"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some districts, the LSP is an important and effective body in stimulating the development of the local economy. To miss them out is just crackers. They have a wealth of information that the principal local authority can draw on.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000084"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09020920000174"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> Clause 64 sets out a list of partner authorities in respect of the local authority economic assessment duty. Clause 63 requires principal local authorities to consult those partner authorities listed in Clause 64 and other such persons, if any, they consider appropriate in carrying out local economic assessments. Members of the Committee have notified us of their intention to oppose Clause 64 standing part of the Bill. Amendment 162A would take away the requirement for principal local authorities to consult partner authorities listed in Clause 64. Amendment 162ZA is in a similar vein.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000085"></a>We have included Clause 64 in the Bill as there are partners that local authorities should be required to consult in carrying out their assessments. The listed authorities are already working closely with local authorities and co-operating with them in agreeing targets aimed at improving local economic outcomes. It is important that responsible local authorities engage with these partners in identifying the economic conditions of the area.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000086"></a>The list of partner authorities broadly follows the list of partner authorities set out in Part 5 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 for the purpose of agreeing local area agreements and which responsible authorities must consult when developing their sustainable community strategies. We have, however, restricted the list of named partners set out in Clause 64 to those bodies that have a significant economic locus&#151;that is to say, local economic development and regeneration activity is likely to impact on their core business. It is therefore shorter than the list of named partners for LAAs. The likelihood is that local authorities will want to engage most, if not all, of their partners in preparing their economic assessments. However, we do not believe that there should be a statutory duty to consult all of them. This strikes a balance between ensuring that their major economic partners have an opportunity to comment on economic assessments and limiting the burdens placed on local authorities. It also strikes a balance between prescription and local flexibility.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000087"></a>We have taken this approach because local economic assessments are expected to form part of the evidence-base for the sustainable community strategy and for LAA negotiations. Any evidence revealed in local economic assessments will have implications for an area&#146;s long-term vision set out in the sustainable community strategy, and its delivery through the targets set out in the LAA, in respect of which partner authorities have a duty to co-operate. In view of this, we believe it is important that these partner authorities should have an opportunity to comment on a local economic assessment.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000088"></a>Beyond the list of partners set out in this clause, local authorities are free to choose who they consult. The Bill requires responsible authorities to consult other such persons, if any, whom they consider to be appropriate. If local authorities believe that there is a strong case for consulting other bodies or partnerships,  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC269"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they should do so. However, we believe it is important that local authorities consult the partners listed in Clause 64, as they will have an important role in determining any economic outcome-related targets in local area agreements. Involving these partners at an early stage in identifying the economic strengths and weaknesses of the local economy will help to strengthen the impact and effectiveness of targets that are agreed through local area agreements further down the line.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000089"></a>Under Amendment 162AZA, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would like us to go further and apply the duty to consult to all local strategic partnerships. He would have us replace the requirement to consult named partner authorities with a requirement to consult the local strategic partnerships for the area. As we have said before, we do not think that it is appropriate to frame such duties by reference to local strategic partnerships due to their lack of a separate legal identity. This could lead to uncertainty and inconsistency. As I have already said, we, of course, recognise the reality of LSPs, and the central role they play, which is why we have drawn our list of partners from those set out in Part 5 of the 2007 Act. We would expect consultation with partner authorities in relation to local economic assessments to build on existing dialogues established through the LSP framework. But, although most partners are likely to have an interest in any conclusions reached in any economic assessment, we do not believe that there should be a duty to consult all of them. As I said before, we have sought to strike a balance between ensuring that local authorities consult their major economic partners and avoiding any unnecessary burdens on local authorities and between prescription and local flexibility.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000090"></a>Amendments 165, 164A, 164B and 162AA propose changes to the list of partner authorities for the local economic assessment duty. We have restricted the partner status to existing LAA partners with a strong economic locus, as I have already said. Our aim has been to keep the list of partner authorities as short as possible in order to reduce the potential burden on local authorities and potential consultees.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000091"></a>Amendment 165 would remove the Learning and Skills Council from the list of partners for the local economic assessment duty and replace it with the managing or governing body of a further education institution in the principal local authority&#146;s area. Amendment 198 would have a similar effect in relation to MAAs with duties. The LSC is already a partner in local area agreements and the existing non-statutory multi-area agreements, and is working with local partners across the country to identify the education and skills needs of an area and to ensure that sufficient high-quality opportunities are available to meet those needs. We believe, therefore, that the LSC should remain on the list.</p>

These changes are subject to legislation, which we propose to bring forward through the forthcoming Children, Skills and Learning Bill. I am sure that Members of the Committee will agree, however, that it would not be appropriate to act as though these changes have already occurred. I can reassure them, however, that we intend at the appropriate time to make the necessary amendments to the lists of partner authorities for economic assessments and multi-area agreements with duties to ensure that they remain up to date and relevant. We recognise that further education institutions have a vital role to play in providing the education and skills training needed within local communities. I hope that that answers the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000094"></a>Amendment 164A would add police authorities, crime and disorder reduction partnerships, local probation boards and youth offending teams to the list, while Amendment 164B would add the Health and Safety Executive to the list. We are not disputing that these bodies would have an interest in any local economic assessment. But, as I said earlier, we do not believe that there should be a duty on local authorities to consult all partners. Local authorities should be given the scope to decide for themselves which other bodies they should consult in preparing their assessments beyond the core list in Clause 64. We should give local authorities some local flexibility to decide which bodies to consult, depending on local circumstances.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000095"></a>Amendment 162AA would require principal local authorities to consult parish councils in carrying out their local economic assessments. We accept that parish councils have an important role to play in supporting their local communities and are able to provide a particularly local perspective. We certainly believe that there is value in principal local authorities consulting parishes, and this a point we stress in our policy paper. Indeed, our statutory guidance, <I>Creating Strong, Safe and Prosperous Communities</I><I>,</I> suggests that local authorities should consider consulting parish councils in preparing their sustainable community strategy and LAA. However, given the large number of parishes&#151;about 8,500 across England&#151;we do not believe there should be a duty to consult them. We believe that this would place an unnecessary burden on local authorities and potentially on parish councils.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000096"></a>Amendment 165ZB would require partner authorities to provide a principal local authority all requested information and to co-operate fully with the principal local authority. We have tried to avoid making the arrangements too burdensome for both partner authorities and local authorities. It is true to say that the same partners have a duty to co-operate in determining LAA targets. However, we should draw a distinction between what is required from partner authorities in relation to LAAs and what is required of them in relation to economic assessments. With LAAs, partners need to make hard decisions affecting the social, environmental and economic well-being of an area, and this may have implications for funding programmes. The same does not apply to local economic assessments. The economic assessment is not an end in itself, but  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC271"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>part of a continuous process of planned engagement in shaping the future of a place. Engagement with partner authorities in relation to economic assessments should build on existing dialogues that I set out earlier. In that context, we do not believe that a duty to co-operate on economic assessments is necessary.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000097"></a>We are also concerned that an open-ended requirement for partner authorities to provide all requested information to principal authorities would place an unnecessary burden on partner authorities, particularly those whose activities are not confined to one principal authority&#146;s area. There may also be issues of confidentiality or privacy that should be taken account of, and a duty to share all requested information may compromise those. A partner authority should be allowed to determine which data it should provide rather than face a requirement to share all data.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000098"></a>Finally, Amendment 165ZA would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s power to remove a body from the list of partner authorities. We believe it is important to retain this provision in case the functions of a body change or it is abolished. I should also stress that such a revision would not be used lightly and is subject to consultation and parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000099"></a>I hope that these assurances address Members&#146; concerns and that they will understand why we are rejecting these amendments. I also ask that Clause 64 shall stand part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000100"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09020920000177"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I have one brief comment to make about LSPs. The Government need to sort out their status in a sensible way sooner or later. I do not suggest that they should be made into fully fledged alternative local authorities, which we fear is a course the Government may take with the economic prosperity boards later in the Bill. They have a purely spectral status, where they exist but they do not exist, and they float around in the clouds but do not have any real status in law&#151;indeed, the Minister said that they have no legal identity. Yet, these are the bodies that the Government have used as a conduit of preference for vast amounts of investment in the past few years. How does money come for this or that project, whether economic, social or whatever? It comes via the LSP. It is extraordinary that on the one hand the Government give them such a huge status but, on the other, deny their existence. Some kind of status that can be defined in legislation needs to be sorted out for them, if they are to continue to exist. One sometimes thinks that the Government are happy with them at the moment because they can abolish them overnight on the whim of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000101"></a>I want to pick up the Minister&#146;s point about the onerous burden in having to consult too many people. He referred to the fact that there are thousands of parish councils. Every principal local authority knows which its parish councils are. It almost certainly has an e-mail distribution list for those councils because it will be communicating with them. If not, it ought to have such a list. Communicating and consulting&#151;sending things out&#151;is simply a matter of sending things once to an e-mail distribution list and perhaps having stuff on your website that people can consult. The idea that there is a huge onerous burden in writing to 25 or 200 parish councils, however many there are in a particular local authority, is a myth.</p>

Again, we are on the same issue. As my noble friend said, they exist but they do not exist. Was his wonderful phrase, &#147;a conduit of preference&#148;? Whether we like it or not, they are increasingly important in the local scene in their role and funding, yet because they are not recognised as a legal entity, they do not exist, so they are an obvious omission from the Bill.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000103"></a>I thank the Minister for his reply. He made the case for what we are saying. If they are prescriptive, as the Government wish to be, albeit with a light touch, inevitably and logically they start down a road that gets them into more and more difficulty. I wrote down a few phrases that the Minister used. The Government want the list to be as short as possible. So do we; we want it to be extremely short. Later, the Minister said that local authorities should have the scope to decide for themselves. If that were the case, it would be an extremely short list; maybe that is the answer.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000104"></a>It may be a view that the police authority, the CDRP and the other bodies are not listed because they are not major economic players. It puzzles me that a fire and rescue authority is considered a major economic player in the Bill, but a police authority is not. I do not understand that logic. The Minister says, rightly, that a local authority can and certainly will consult the police authority, the CDRP and so on. Indeed, they will be represented on the local strategic partnership, which is probably the issue on which most of this debate will take place, except that it does not exist in law.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000105"></a>I am sure that we will return to this issue. I hope that before we do so the Government will consider further the difficulties they are getting into, which are similar to those on Chapter 2. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Reading the Act, I realised that I was unclear whether the first arrangements were the arrangements for the first authorities, the first arrangements for all authorities, or quite what. It is appropriate to ask, first, how the Government see that admirably short legislation fitting with the Bill, because they must have much ground in common, and, secondly, what progress is being made.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000108"></a>I had understood that the Government were intending to make the first arrangements last autumn, well ahead of the April 2009 deadline, and that local authorities have until 31 July to make proposals via the Local Government Association, which is the selector under the Bill. The directors&#146; letter to local authorities, which supplements the Secretary of State&#146;s and which was on the website this morning, said that the Government cannot be precise about how quickly decisions will be made, so I am using this opportunity to ask, importantly, how the two pieces of legislation fit together and for a brief progress report. I beg to move.</p>

It had all-party support, and I hoped that it would offer local government opportunities to do things rather differently or to think of new things. It would have been particularly appropriate to use it in this difficult time of recession. Like the noble Baroness, I would like the Minister to clarify exactly where we are with that legislation and with the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09020920000111"></a>Shorter legislation is not necessarily easier to implement. I shall exemplify this by explaining why we have had to take our time over the process that was generated by the Act. As the noble Baroness says, a Secretary of State is required under Section 6 of the Act to make the first arrangements for the production of local spending reports before 23 April 2009. She asked how this fits in with the Bill. I thought about this as she asked the question.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000112"></a>There is an overlap in building up an evidence base for the way in which local economies&#151;which involve a whole range of sustainable provisions for housing, transport and so on&#151;fit into the sustainable economy, society and community of the local area. We will see what will help and what will hinder. All this will overlap directly with the economic assessment and reinforces

That underpins the necessity of having an enabling framework around the economic assessment. That will all feed from the bottom up into the regional strategy. It will become part of that bedrock and that platform of information about the nature of sustainability, the priorities and the emphasis that we give to different part of the policy. It very much has a synergy with the whole process that we will be talking about from now on.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000113"></a>A local spending report is a report on expenditure by such authorities, in such areas, and over such a period as are determined in accordance with arrangements made by the Secretary of State. The duty was put on the Secretary of State to provide the information. The authorities may be a local authority, a government department or any other person exercising public functions. The area must be one or more local authority areas, one or more parts of a local authority area, or a combination of those.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000114"></a>Providing information about these things in this way is a major, new challenge, and it is complex. We were very keen to see some discretion in the Act as it went through because of that complexity and the need to be flexible. We have been working across the department and with key stakeholders from other departments, such as the Audit Commission and the LGA, to map out what information is currently available. I shall be frank that this has taken longer than we thought. We had originally planned to consult in 2008, but it has proved more complex than we initially expected. We are now at the point where we are preparing to run a consultation on what it is proposed will be provided in the first tranche of information about expenditure about local authorities. The idea is that the first arrangements will be the first tranche of information about expenditure, which will go to every local authority, which the Secretary of State is required to do. The consultation will be on whether we have got it right, whether it is the right sort of information and so on.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000115"></a>That is the first stage. We are planning to do it in two stages. There will be one document, and we will try to bring that forward as fast as possible. We will certainly do that before 23 April. Then there will be a longer stage, when we will consult on the longer-term arrangements.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000116"></a>That brings me to the amendment. The intention behind local spending reports, as the noble Baroness knows, because she was heavily involved in the passage of the Act&#151;I was not involved, for reasons that escape me at the moment; maybe I was doing the Housing Bill or something&#151;is to promote the sustainability of local communities by providing access to information about the public funding that is available in local areas. The aim is to inform local authorities&#146; consultations with local people and to enhance the operation of the new LAAs by ensuring that there is greater accountability and transparency, so that local authorities, their partners and communities can take more informed decisions about priorities and sustainability.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000117"></a>We need to ensure that local spending reports are closely linked with the regular and accessible information on local services that we have committed to providing.

It is iterative. The amendment suggests that we should bring this forward and make sure that it is secured in 24 months, but the Act intentionally provided flexibility on what local spending reports must contain. We do not want this to be a snapshot; we want it to be an evolving document. Putting in dates and timetables would not be appropriate.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09020920000118"></a>The important thing is that the documents reflect a true picture of what is going on and can anticipate what is likely to happen; so they have got to be able to adapt to future policy. We want to make sure that they can do that over time. I hope that is sufficient to update noble Lords about where we are, what they can expect in the next few months and how we see the documents evolving over time.</p>

It may be that we will want to come back to knitting the Sustainable Communities Act more closely into this legislation. The noble Baroness said that a short statute is not necessarily easy to implement. I cannot resist saying that a long one is not necessarily easy either. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We have talked a lot about consultation on economic strategy, but these amendments concern how the RDA would consult on the regional strategy. I shall go back to several points I made at the beginning of the Committee sitting today. We have had these debates before, and on the last occasion planning powers were given to regional assemblies. They are now being removed from those bodies, which at least had elected members, and given to the RDAs, which might have one or two elected members, but even then they will have been appointed to the agency. Given that, we want it to be absolutely clear who the RDAs are going to consult with and take notice of in constructing the regional strategies.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000002"></a>We are not sure where the economic assessments we considered earlier relate to all this, but every type of authority within each region has a particular type of power. We talked about how district councils have a local government framework structure that includes planning and housing powers, while county councils have highway powers, some responsibility for education, care for the elderly, park authorities and particularly environmental concerns. It is not clear, but this provision might remove county councils from consultation on the regional strategy.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000003"></a>We went through much of this when we considered the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill in 2004, led by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. In fact, we defeated the Government several times in the House on the list of people to be consulted, and county councils were returned to the list. It seems ridiculous not to consult county councils when they have the powers I have just outlined.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000004"></a>We have talked at length about not building too much into the Bill, and I endorse that again. However, this is something that should be in the legislation. If a non-elected body is going to draw up the regional strategy, even in partnership with leaders&#146; boards, which we shall talk about later, we should make certain that the regional authority consults with the right people&#151;the democratically elected people in the region&#151;to ensure that they have a real input into creating the regional strategy. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000005"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09020926000255"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> This is the first debate on the implications of the regional structures, but I will save my longer contextual speaking note until we come to the later group because that will allow us to have something of a clause stand part debate. However, I have not forgotten the main points the noble Lord made in his remarks earlier this afternoon. I shall deal specifically with the two amendments before us.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000006"></a>Amendment 165A specifies that the regional strategy is established by the responsible regional authorities. I think that the meaning of the word &#147;establish&#148; is unclear. A key part of our proposals is to embed stronger democratic accountability throughout the entire process of preparing the regional strategy. That is why the Bill establishes a genuinely collaborative approach between RDAs and local authorities in the drafting of regional strategies to achieve the objectives. It has buy-in from local authorities, communities, business and other stakeholders. The leaders&#146; board will be comprised of local authority leaders with sufficient authority to act on behalf of all local government in the region. Together with the RDA they will have joint responsibility for the regional strategy: drafting, implementation and monitoring.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000007"></a>However, there will obviously be others who also have a key role. The whole set of professional staff employed by the RDA and leaders&#146; boards will lead the process, but the reality is that local authorities, and particularly planning and economic development departments, hold much of the evidence and local knowledge that will go into the development of the strategy. Communities and stakeholders will therefore be vital contributors, including business, community groups and so on. Government agencies will be vital, because government make such a major investment in major infrastructure, such as transport or flood defence. Of course, the Government are responsible for much of the investment underpinning the delivery of these strategies. Many of these roles are set out in subsequent clauses, and we will debate them as we come to them. The effect of the probing amendment would essentially be to duplicate that.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000008"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield did not speak to Amendment 172. I do not know if it is listed in this group.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC277"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC277</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09020926000009"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09020926000256"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I would be grateful if you would speak to it.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000010"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09020926000257"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I shall give the noble Lord the answer that I would have given. This is the proposition that the leaders&#146; board must approve the regional strategy. We will come on to a discussion of the powers of the Secretary of State, how they are positioned in the Bill and why they are there.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000011"></a>We have established a model in the Bill, based on extensive consultation over the past two years. The leaders&#146; board and RDA must jointly agree a draft regional strategy, which then has to be approved by the Secretary of State. In practice, the RDA and leaders&#146; board each have a joint veto because they each have to agree with each other. The amendment would give the leaders&#146; board a veto over the Secretary of State if they chose not to approve the strategy with amendments from the Secretary of State. As I will say later, however, the Secretary of State has a responsibility to ensure that the regional strategies in place reflect regional priorities but are in line with national government policy and deliverable&#151;for example, that they reflect the resources available. Ultimately, if something is not deliverable, it is meaningless and there is no point in having a &#147;strategy&#148;. If the amendment is included, therefore, there is a high risk of regional strategies simply ending in deadlock. We cannot afford that situation, which this arrangement is designed to avoid.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000012"></a>On the important point of consultation, Amendment 165B requires the responsible regional authorities to consult all local authorities in a region before establishing the regional strategy. Amendment 175B, which, again, has not been spoken to, but which I shall address&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09020926000013"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09020926000258"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I apologise. I was confused by the last-minute changes in groupings. However, what the noble Lord said on 165B was probably quite an adequate introduction.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000014"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09020926000259"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I appreciate the confusion over groupings. We are handling some complex groupings in this part of the Bill, so I quite understand.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000015"></a>Both amendments ask the Government to give assurances that local authorities will be properly included. Amendment 175B would require every local authority in the region to be included in the statement of community involvement, which sets out policies on those who need to be involved in the preparation of the regional strategy. I reassure the noble Lord and noble Baroness that I have total sympathy with what they are seeking to establish. It is important that the right people are consulted, and that they have the maximum opportunity to inform the strategies. It is inconceivable that the list of those who have an interest in the development of a regional strategy would not include local authorities, not least because their plans will have to be in general conformity with the strategy.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000016"></a>Secondly, we set out in the policy document that we published a few weeks ago that, as well as a general requirement to consult and engage, we will set out in regulations a more detailed list of specific bodies that must be consulted. Clearly, I am happy that we will  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC278"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC278</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consult on this and make sure that noble Lords are aware of those regulations before time. The annexe to that policy document sets out the range of bodies that we expect to be covered in the regulations. It includes,</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000229"></a>&#147;a relevant authority any part of whose area is in or adjoins the area&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09020926000191"></a>of the region in the case of the regional strategy. I hope that gives sufficient clarity and assurance.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000017"></a>I also emphasise again that, by giving the joint duty to develop the regional strategy to the LA leaders&#146; board, we have really put local authorities into the driving seat. When we debate this, I will be able to provide evidence for noble Lords about the way in which local authorities in the regions are responding positively to that. For all those reasons, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000018"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09020926000260"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> Perhaps I should ask a question first, because we are going to have a long discussion on regional strategy. What do the Government expect to get out of a regional strategy? In London it is difficult, but you can have a London strategy. You can have a strategy around Manchester or Birmingham. In the large regions, such as the eastern region, which I am part of, or the south-east region, the strategies that we have been trying to work out over the past few years have not worked at all. If the Government want housing numbers, they have gone about it totally the wrong way. It would be much better to involve smaller groups of authorities, as we talked about earlier.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000019"></a>This seems to be a whole bureaucratic nightmare, and nothing is ever going to be achieved out of it, because the regions are so disparate and have such different problems. At this stage, will the noble Baroness tell us why the Government are doing it? It seems totally unnecessary, it will create a lot of bureaucracy and it will cost a lot of money. RDAs spend a lot of that money now, but they have a lot of staff. I am not talking against the staff of the eastern region. They have around &#163;200 million to spend and around 200 members of staff. If you shared that around the local authorities, we could spend that money rather better on economic development and regeneration for about 10 members of staff. That is honestly true.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000020"></a>What do the Government expect to achieve out of this? We will go through the debate later about regional strategies, leaders&#146; boards and everything else. It would be better to leave it to elected members in elected authorities to work together to solve these problems, rather than creating this tremendous bureaucratic nightmare of having strategies all over the place. Are they going to deliver anything?</p>

When we debate the clause standing part, I will be able to answer the question at more length than I can at the moment. I will draw on some of the words that have been put to me by both regional and local leaders about why the current system&#151;he has said so frankly this afternoon&#151;is not working.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000022"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09020926000262"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> Could the Minister think about how it will have to be different? The old county structure plan actually delivered things. Everything

Counties are quite big. They work out logistics with partners and they have LAAs. A modern version of a county structure might deliver more houses for the Government, a better economic strategy and some of the things that we want, that they want and that the public might like, rather than creating bureaucratic nightmares of unelected boards and unelected people trying to tell elected people what they think they want. Obviously, the noble Baroness wants to give a fuller reply. Why can we not go back a bit and examine what was better in the old days rather than what we have now?</p>

The point is that Essex sits within a region that is now as much the victim and the master of globalisation as every other region in the country. There are choices to be made. Housing is a particularly sensitive area&#151;it is a particular issue in Essex for different reasons&#151;but all our regions are facing different challenges from the ones that they faced when the old counties were so triumphant. One issue is climate change, which affects how we plan for transport, the movement of people, where people work as well as where they live, how we manage our environment and the balance between rural and urban areas. All those issues, and many more, cannot be contained within the most efficient authority in the world. The regions have a much more important role to play.</p>

I hate taking Essex as an example all the time, but it must work with London and the London boroughs, particularly those that were part of Essex such as Havering, Redbridge and even Enfield. It must also work with the ring road authorities around the M25, so we have to work with Buckinghamshire and Surrey because of the expansion of the M25. As I said earlier, there is also the Thames Gateway, which means Kent and London, and the Haven gateway, which means Suffolk. We also have the M11 corridor, which means Hertfordshire.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000031"></a>We must address the potential inequalities in the regions and manage and avoid failure as well as mobilise success.

However, we also need a regional vision and a process to ensure that we can address the inequalities across regions as well as mobilise potential. These are long-term plans; they are not plans that will suffice for the next five years.</p>

I am sure that we will have lots of debates on this area before we finish. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC281"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC281</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>objections to Part 5. Although other Members of the Committee may not think so, they already have made the arguments very effectively for the case that all these clauses stand part.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000035"></a>Amendment 165C concerns spatial planning. The objective of Part 5 is to move spatial and economic strategies closer. I am concerned about the diminishing role of spatial planning at a regional or sub-regional level. We have heard that this is intended for the long term, but the 2004 Act was only five years ago and the sections in that Act on spatial strategic planning are to be repealed. In a separate group, we will debate the terms &#147;sustainable development&#148;, &#147;sustainable economic growth&#148; and so on. But I understood regional spatial strategies to have been designed to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in all its aspects and to be the balance to which we always refer.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000036"></a>Under Clause 65(2) spatial policies are listed second. Clause 65(2)(b) uses the same terminology as the 2004 Act, so the word &#147;spatial&#148; does not appear. Members of the Committee will understand what I mean. &#147;Sustainable economic growth&#148; is the first objective under Clause 65(2)(a). Clause 65(6) reverses the order, but it gives no clue as to whether it is intended that only the parts of the regional spatial strategy which promote economic growth are to be retained.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000037"></a>Spatial planning concerns matters such as character and identity. I have seen the term &#147;legibility&#148; used, as well as the quality of the public realm, the use of movement, diversity and so on. On other occasions, Members of the Committee have talked much of place shaping, which does not stop at the boundary of the principal local authority. Planning and urban policy should facilitate sustainable development through detailed understanding of the characteristics of different places and economic centres within economic regions and the sub-regions.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000038"></a>I have tabled this amendment because I would like the Government to justify what I see as a move from the balance inherent in sustainable development to economic growth. I accept that we are not in a good state economically, but I do not believe that that justifies a focus on economic growth, possibly to the exclusion in all practical terms of all other considerations. Does it justify the role that regional development agencies will have in planning, rather than there being a separate regional spatial strategy? Combining the spatial and economic pieces of work carries the danger that the two will be conflated. I do not see that it will be possible to keep them separate, but I am concerned about there being an expectation that economic considerations will override all others. That would be bad in the long term, bad environmentally, bad socially and, indeed, bad economically.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000039"></a>Amendment 165E seeks to insert &#147;development&#148; instead of &#147;growth&#148; on the basis that change for the better is not necessarily growth. Amendments 166B and 182ZB seek to change &#147;contribute to&#148; to &#147;further&#148; in the context of contributing to the,</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000230"></a>&#147;mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020926000192"></a>We believe that &#147;further&#148; is stronger than &#147;contribute to&#148;. This argument was made in the context of the  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC282"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC282</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Marine and Coastal Access Bill&#151;that is running almost exactly concurrently with this Bill&#151;in an amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Greaves. This morning I had a look at the Minister&#146;s reply to the group of amendments that proposed this change of terminology. The Government&#146;s resistance to it did not seem justified. The issue was not addressed. The concepts of sustainable development were addressed but not the particular point that was made. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on it in this Bill.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000040"></a>Amendment 177F would provide for publication of the work that had been prepared. I assume that if a report of a sustainability appraisal&#151;of the draft revision in this case&#151;is prepared, it will be published. However, I do not really want to assume anything.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000041"></a>I have deliberately not tabled amendments seeking to define &#147;sustainable development&#148;. We all know about the dangers of starting to list items. Further, I think it is better that this legislation is consistent with other legislation. I have avoided detail not least because &#147;sustainability&#148; and &#147;sustainable development&#148; cover a concept that is continuing to develop. Accepted thinking is gradually changing and growing. Last year, during the passage of the Planning Act, there was some fancy footwork which inserted references to climate change and design. There is a reference to climate change in Clause 65(4), and to design in Clause 78(2). I do not seek to delete the latter reference but I question whether it should be such a particular aspect of sustainable development. Clause 78(2) states that for the purposes of sustainable development authorities,</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000231"></a>&#147;must (in particular) have regard to the desirability of achieving good design&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020926000193"></a>Before somebody challenges me on this, I accept that good design extends beyond the aesthetic and includes, for instance, design which would achieve a low or nil carbon footprint. Nevertheless, to say that it has such a status distorts the whole of the picture.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000042"></a>Finally, Amendment 182ZA would insert in the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 a sustainable economic development duty. As I have said, thinking moves on, and I would like to see the regional development agencies&#151;if one has to have regional development agencies, as they are not our favourite quango&#151;in line with what is happening and the duties imposed on other organisations. Perhaps I am misguided in this, but what the Government say they are doing in this part of the Bill is undermined. It would certainly leave a very big gap in policy. The role of the RDAs in the Bill and beyond the Bill is important and growing. We do not support these quangos&#151;we do not support quangos generally&#151;but if we are to have them, they should apply sustainability to economic development and should have wider considerations than what is relevant to their own different areas. That is in the third paragraph of my amendment.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000043"></a>More than 10 years ago, we debated the phrase, &#147;where it is relevant to its area to do so&#148; and we were told that there had to be a limit on what RDAs should take into consideration. There, thinking has moved on as well. Each RDA should be thinking outside its own boundaries as well as within them. I beg to move.</p>

I agree with all that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, just said. Our first amendment inserts the word &#147;sustainable&#148;, and the second inserts,</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000232"></a>&#147;policies in relation to the preservation of greenbelt land&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000045"></a>We have talked a lot today about economic development, but we have to make certain&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said&#151;that it is sustainable. Therefore, we must particularly talk about the environment and the consequences of the social side of it. Unfortunately, we live with some of the problems of the rush for economic development and housing after the world war and even into the 1960s. We must consider the social side of all that we are doing and not put the economic crisis right at the forefront. All these things must be taken together, so one can have concerns about that, particularly the arguments about the greenbelt.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000046"></a>I do not like to refer to my county again, but areas around London are particularly conscious of the greenbelt and the way in which it protects all the counties from the encroachment of London. The greenbelt is a very valuable part of that. I would like to hear the noble Baroness comment on how some parts of the country are losing their greenbelt, which is very precious to most of the population.</p>

Unfortunately, she has damaged her knee and is confined to her home. She sends her apologies, and I have pleasure in speaking to the amendments on her behalf. Amendment 166A requires each regional strategy to make specific provision for meeting housing need in the region. Amendments 175A and 176A require the authorities involved in a regional strategy to consult relevant housing bodies.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000048"></a>Had the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, been with us, she would have made the following remarks. The Bill will mark a major shift in regional strategy and decision-making for all regions outside London. Regional assemblies currently have responsibility for housing and planning at regional levels and oversee the development of regional spatial strategies, regional housing strategies and regional housing investment advice to Ministers. However, under the Bill, assemblies will cease to exist and these responsibilities will pass jointly to regional development agencies and local authority leaders&#146; forums. These bodies will be required to produce a single regional strategy that must include elements for economic development and planning, but will not include important stakeholders&#151;housing providers and trades unions&#151;which the forerunner regional assemblies did. There is a risk that if this wider strategy is developed without specific housing objectives and with no input from housing experts such as the Homes and Communities Agency, housing providers or other stakeholders, there will be no clear mechanism or accountability for delivering the homes which this country desperately needs. Whereas the regional assemblies specifically address wider housing objectives, such as meeting housing need through regional housing strategies, the new structure will place an overwhelming emphasis on the economy from RDAs, and on planning, transport and the economy from  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC284"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>second-tier local authorities. Housing, however, is a key element of economic success, yet there is a real danger that the focus on housing will be lost in the transition to new regional governance arrangements.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000049"></a>Shelter and the National Housing Federation support these amendments, pointing out that more than 4 million people are on waiting lists for social housing in England&#151;1.6 million households, which represents around one in every 13 households in the country. The Local Government Association expects the figure to rise to 5 million by 2010. There is a desperate need to build more homes in order to meet growing needs, and this should be a priority that is reflected in the regional structure. If she had been in her place, the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, would have said, &#147;If my noble friend accepts these amendments, each regional strategy will then include specific measures to address housing need and the relevant housing organisations will be able to influence the strategy at an early stage. These changes to the Bill would surely be highly desirable&#148;. On behalf of the noble Baroness, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000050"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09020926000275"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> This is a large and important group of amendments and is one of the two groups that are the meat of our discussions today. I am assuming that the Marshalled List I have before me is correct, so I shall speak to Amendments 165D, 177A, 177B, 177E and 177F, and to the question of whether the clause should stand part. First, however, we extend our sympathies to the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker. It is no criticism of the noble Lord to say that we would rather that she had been in her place to move her amendment. We look forward to her coming back.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000051"></a>These are the proposals for a new system of regional planning that will be called the regional strategy. If I have understood them, the strategy will be two plans or strategies in one. The regional spatial strategy, which my noble friend pointed out we have had for only three or four years, is to be abolished or subsumed into the new regional strategy. In addition, we are to have the regional economic strategy, which until now has been produced by the regional development agencies and is one of a number of strategies that informs the regional spatial strategy. We have to understand how the new system is going to work in relation to these two quite different functions. They are closely related, but they are different. The RDA is not mainly a strategy-producing body, but an investing body. It is a means by which funds from the Government, the private sector and other public bodies are channelled into particular projects in a region, which is what their economic strategy and planning is about.</p>
<h5><a name="09020926000245"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000052"></a>We also have the regional spatial strategy. When we were dealing with the Bill four years ago, we wrestled with the change from pure land-use planning into spatial planning and the difference between them. The truth is that it is a gradation. There had been a lot of spatial planning for a long time, but the emphasis was put on something more than simply land-use planning. It was indicative and an attempt to be proactive. Nevertheless, it was still part of the planning system.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC285"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC285</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000053"></a>The regional spatial strategy is part of the development plan, which allows authorities to judge the merits of development proposals as they come forward. It consists of the regional spatial strategy, the local development framework and the local development documents, which are all being rolled into one. Is there a conflict in rolling into one document the policies, which are to be carried out actively to produce development, with the development plan, which judges those policies in which planning authorities&#151;at whatever level, from the local planning authority to the Secretary of State&#151;will have to judge policies when they come out? No doubt there will be a relationship with the national policy statements produced by the Infrastructure Planning Commission as they relate to that region. There is a difficulty here and I do not understand why the Government want to do it.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000054"></a>I have the first part of the regional spatial strategy for the north-west, which has been adopted. For a few months, we have had this document, which will now be put on one side. Part of its title is &#147;Regional Spatial Strategy to 2021&#148;. If only Governments could think in that sort of timescale, the whole system would be a lot better. I have brought this document because under the part entitled &#147;Policy Context&#148;, in which this RSS has been put together for the north-west, a number of important strategies are listed: the regional economic strategy; the regional housing strategy and a lot of other strategies, including the regional rural delivery framework, the north-west waste strategy, the sustainable energy strategy; the climate change action plan; the freight strategy; the regional health investment plan; the north-west tourism strategy; and the vision for coastal resorts, which would include Blackpool.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000055"></a>It is interesting that the regional economic strategy is at the top of the list, has a paragraph of its own and is obviously the most important. This strategy provides a regional framework as part of the policy context for the RSS. On the regional economic strategy it states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020926000215"></a>&#147;The RES provides a regional framework for economic development, skills and regeneration ... It identifies five priority areas&#151;business; skills and employment; regeneration; infrastructure; and quality of life&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000194"></a>There is no harm in that. It,</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000233"></a>&#147;sets out key aims and objectives for each&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09020926000195"></a>I repeat, key aims and objectives&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000234"></a>&#147;and highlights the activities that the NWDA&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09020926000196"></a>the regional development association&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000235"></a>&#147;believes will promote the change necessary to transform the North West economy&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020926000197"></a>It is very much a proactive document, which is full of activity for carrying out policies.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000056"></a>Clearly, planning documents guide development. They should guide what should happen, what should be stopped in some places and what should be promoted in others, but it has a different function from that of spending other people&#146;s money to achieve things. Putting them together in one regional strategy is fraught with difficulties. That is the general stuff for the clause stand part debate.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000057"></a>I shall speak briefly to the amendments that I have tabled. Amendment 165D seeks to disentangle sustainable economic growth and sustainable development or  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC286"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC286</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>economic development in the two categories. It relates to amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, I think. There is a muddle here: confusion, or potential conflict, between the two aims of the regional strategy. Amendments 177A and 177B relate to the list of matters that are to be taken account of in a revision of the regional strategy. Everyone in this Committee knows that &#147;revision of regional strategy&#148; means putting together the first regional strategy, because in the interim period the RSS will be the regional strategy. It is what you do for the regional strategy.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000058"></a>The matters to be taken into account in the revision in Clause 71 are quite interesting, because they relate closely to the matters set out in Part 1 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, which is about the RSS. As my noble friend said, it is to be repealed. However, the matters are slightly different and relate to slightly different things. When the Bill refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000236"></a>&#147;national policies and advice contained in guidance which has been given by the Secretary of State&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09020926000198"></a>as something to which the responsible regional authorities must have regard, that is the same wording as in the previous Act, which is being repealed. As far as the RSS is concerned, there is no difference. However, the economic development side of it&#151;the part that is coming from the RDA&#151;is new. The question is how far it represents a greater degree of dirigiste economic planning from the centre. It clearly says &#147;national policies&#148; on development. There is an issue here that needs resolving.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000059"></a>Amendment 177B is about the resources that are available. The wording is again lifted from the 2004 Act, which referred to the planning process: the creation of the regional spatial strategy. The implication is that the resources are the resources available for putting that plan together. The implication of what is now going in is that the resources that are available are the investment resources that will be available for carrying out projects in the region. That is quite different and separate, and something that we need to ask the Government to allow us to understand. They need to explain why the same wording is appropriate for economic development activity rather than simply for planning activities.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000060"></a>The next amendment has been moved to another group. Amendment 177E is about the appraisal of the sustainability of the regional strategy when it is being put together. There has to be an appraisal of sustainability. I propose to insert the words &#147;economic, social and environmental&#148; before &#147;sustainability&#148;. The amendment is designed to probe just how far this new regional strategy is a shift of emphasis away from spatial planning and land-use planning towards proactive economic planning where the investment decisions will determine the planning decisions that come from them, how far it will be economic, and how far social, and particularly environmental, aspects will be taken into account at that stage. Is this what it looks like: a shift towards a purely economic emphasis in the regional strategy compared with the present regional spatial strategy? If it is not, why is it not?</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000061"></a>I think that that covers the amendments in my group, but I want to add a final brief comment. Because the football match was snowed up this weekend  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC287"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC287</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and I had nothing to do yesterday, I spent some time foraging on the internet. To my surprise, I discovered that a regional strategy in the north-west is already in the process of being put together. I was somewhat surprised about that because I thought that in our debates on the Bill we were discussing whether this was a good idea, but I now discover that it is happening. The first consultation on the principles-of-disuse paper started on 3 February for 12 weeks, so we are now into what people say they are looking forward to: a vibrant debate around the region on this document. That produced a wry smile.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000062"></a>It is all there on the internet in something called RS2010. The process has gone as far as commissioning people to produce a fancy logo, but I do not know how much that has cost. There is a <I>Principles and Issues Paper</I>, which I have not yet had time to read. Then there is a &#147;think&#148; piece on moving towards a north-west single regional strategy, produced by SQW Consulting. It is about 50 or 60 pages long, and I have not had time to read that either. Then I discovered that there is a standard letter&#151;I am not sure to whom&#151;signed by the chairman of the regional development agency, the NWDA, and the chairman of the new leaders&#146; forum, which is a proto-leaders&#146; board in the north-west. He is someone called Lord Peter Smith, which I think is an alias for the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh. I was hoping that he would be here today to explain it all to me, but he is not. Perhaps he is too busy with all the north-west organisations, for which he no doubt does an excellent job.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000063"></a>I am a little concerned that this process is rushing off apace in the north-west. It is at the stage of the initial consultation on principles and policies, and it will be a few weeks at least before this legislation gets through Parliament. However, although this performs a useful function in that it shows us what it might be like for everyone in the future, I am not sure that this is how to go about things.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000064"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09020926000276"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> The snow brought many blessings, but clearly it brought its downsides as well. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Smith, is not here to answer those questions, but I shall do my best to say what he might have said.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000065"></a>I do not want to spend too long on this, but it is important that I contextualise this debate because many issues have been raised. I genuinely think that noble Lords opposite are struggling with some misapprehensions about what might happen and what is, and was always, intended. This takes us forward from the brief debate that we had on the previous group.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000066"></a>The problem with which we are struggling&#151;in a way, it was described by the noble Lord when he asked whether we are imposing a conflict between the people who design the strategy and those who implement it&#151;is that quite simply huge challenges face the regions in which the architecture is not sufficiently joined up. I shall go on to talk about how the spatial strategy and spatial dimensions will inform the regional strategy.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000067"></a>In essence, we all know that we have very different regions in this country. They proceed at different paces on all sorts of different things, and they are rich in  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC288"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>diversity. For the future, we have to ensure that we address inequalities as well as strengths and that we give every region the best chance to get the investment, the skills for jobs, the business and the sustainable environment that they need.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000068"></a>A false dichotomy between growth and development has surfaced in some of these amendments. There is also an unnecessary fear that economic development will somehow triumph over and destroy our ability to protect, enhance, preserve and make the most of our environment, which we are trying to do in this country in many ways, not only in policy and legislation but in behaviour.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000069"></a>The growth that we are now talking about has to be driven to meet the challenge of globalisation, which we have seen so graphically in the past six months, and has to be sustained within environmental limits. We have said so in all our documents and arguments. But growth also enhances the environment and social welfare, and avoids catastrophic extremes in future economic cycles. Frankly, the economic health of our economy will be dependent on how proactive our regional authorities&#146; capacity for accommodating and promoting sustainable economic development is. However, it is not growth at all costs; this is about sustainable growth.</p>
<h5><a name="09020926000246"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000070"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, described in his inimitable way what was wrong with the present system. One way of addressing this issue is to recognise that, yes, we have in the past few years had the development of a challenging and different notion of planning&#151;spatial planning. This has certainly taken us forward. The regional spatial strategies, many of which are now nearing completion, have done extraordinary service in bringing forward understanding and a view of future development that is different from anything we have ever done before. It has been a struggle. Part of the response has been to try to reduce the opportunity for confusion and contention in the next stage of the regional economic strategy by building a much better process into the Bill.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000071"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether this meant that the spatial strategy is somehow lost or diminished. The answer is absolutely not. We have been developing our spatial strategies, taking into account such intelligence as we have had at our disposal in the regions. I say &#147;our spatial strategies&#148;, but of course the regions have been doing that. At the same time, RDAs&#146; regional economic strategies for skills, investment, business support, manufacturing support and the observatories for people applying for skills and work have been developed separately. Many of these strategies are related to spatial planning but they have not been sufficiently joined up.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000072"></a>People who are trying to deal with this problem have said to me that, despite the successes at regional level, we could be more effective. Previously, organisations in each region have had to deal with a muddled set of strategic plans: one for economics planning, one for spatial planning, and one for housing. This has meant that businesses, individuals and communities have often been confused about who was responsible for what and what the priorities were. Duplication of effort,  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC289"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC289</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>endless consultation and inefficiencies have led to us being diverted from delivering change. So when the noble Lord asks what this is about, it is about a better capacity to deliver the social change that will really benefit our communities no matter where they are. That can now only be done through a single and integrated strategy where we bring the spatial dimensions and spatial plans to work on and with the economic, intelligence, expectations and investment plans.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000073"></a>At the moment, when we consider integrating spatial and economic elements, for example, in relation to land-use planning, we might allocate housing numbers in a particular region. But in a spatial regional strategy we would make sure that housing allocations were underpinned by other sound strategies&#151;for example, in the areas of transport, skills and jobs for settlements, the provision of public services and so on. We have done as much as we can in the spatial strategies to make sure that they are informed, but they are not strong enough or close enough to make a real difference to outcomes.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000074"></a>We have to get greater synergy and greater alignment. The benefits of this will be the creation of a less complex, less divergent and less time consuming system for everyone. The noble Lord is not right to describe this as more bureaucracy. The benefits will be greater co-operation and synergy between local government and the regional agency, instead of how the assemblies were not able to get purchases on those processes. They will have an opportunity to do so now because they will have to work together to produce a coherent plan for the development of the region. They will have to relate to the spatial elements of the strategy for economic development, housing, planning, energy supplies and transport in the context of generating sustainable development and growth. That will focus the funding for infrastructure regeneration.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000075"></a>The regional strategy will map out the kind of skills that are needed and the things that we will need to anticipate and plan ahead for. All this will help with managing climate change and mitigating it. It strengthens our ability to plan effectively and collectively for the future; it helps us to be more strategic and makes for a clearer framework, which everyone can recognise, of where the conversation takes place. It also means that we will have the benefits of transparency. This is an important point. At the moment, the examination in public of the spatial strategy kicks in at the final stages of the process. The examination in public in the process of making the RES will be at the formative stage, at the start of the drafting of the strategy, so that it can advise on the evidence base and issues of principle, and can flag up where the contentious issues are likely to arise. It will not all come at the end in a cliff-edge finale.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90209-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000076"></a>There will also be benefits&#151;these will be driven in part through the assessment duty&#151;of a common evidence base: one contestation and testing process and a single sustainability process. The examination in public panel report goes to the leaders&#146; board and the RDA, enabling them to make any required changes. The aim will be to ensure that they agree as far as they can but, where they cannot agree, points of contention can be negotiated. There should be little or no need for central government  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC290"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC290</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to add any other changes and add to the time taken. We want to work out a process which keeps central government out of the picture. There will be a stronger democratic accountability throughout the process of preparing the regional strategy. It is a genuinely collaborative approach with local authorities which have sufficient authority to act on behalf of all having a joint responsibility for the regional strategy, including drafting, implementation and monitoring.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000077"></a>There will be greater public engagement because we have drawn not only on the experience of the RSS but also on the consultative arrangements that were built in to the local development framework process. There will be crucial requirements to consult and engage on the formulae that we have worked out for the local development frameworks and statements of community interest. However, this is not prescriptive, because regions are different; they will have to develop their own arrangements to suit their own circumstances. We are not interested in blanket policies.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000078"></a>These proposals have been widely supported. We have held consultations over the past two years and found a strong endorsement for a single, integrated regional strategy as a way of prioritising a region&#146;s needs and aspirations, driving forward economic development and regeneration. The joint duty on RDAs and local authorities has wide support from the LGA and the other RDAs. Since publishing our proposals the regions have taken the initiative and have made remarkable progress in putting these new arrangements in place. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has pointed out what is happening in the north-west. Many regions have gone a long way towards producing and agreeing the strategy, establishing the leaders&#146; boards and agreeing how they will work.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000079"></a>The drafting of the regional strategy will be jointly undertaken by the RDA and the leaders&#146; board in collaboration. They will work to a project plan which, through regulations, will become the agreed timetable for the strategy revision. Working with local authorities, they will develop a shared evidence base, engage with stakeholders and appraise the key issues and the options through a robust sustainability appraisal. Once it is drafted there will be rigorous testing through a full statutory public consultation and the EiP. That is important to build confidence. Any modification to the strategy following the panel will be undertaken collaboratively between the responsible regional authorities and the Secretary of State. The responsible regional authorities will be able to refine their strategy in the light of EiP and submit it to the Secretary of State for sign-off.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000080"></a>Currently in the regional spatial strategy, the legislation provides for the Secretary of State to make further changes, if needed, to ensure that the strategy reflects the imperatives of national policy and principles. However, such changes would be subject to further consultation, after which the Secretary of State will publish the agreed regional strategy that then becomes part of the single statutory development plan. That is what we aim to achieve and those are the purposes for which we have brought the Bill forward. I hope that that will help to clarify some of the key issues.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC291"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC291</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000081"></a>I am very sorry that the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, is not here. I do not know whether that is because of snow again, but she would be pleased by the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Best, introduced her amendments. In essence, her Amendment 166A would require each regional strategy to make specific provision for meeting housing need in the region, making explicit an element of what is already implied by Clause 65 and Clause 71(1)(a). It is therefore a duplication. It would give prominence to one topic in primary legislation over others, which would be rather unfortunate. I reassure her that Clause 71(1)(a) requires the responsible regional authorities to take into account national policy that includes Planning Policy Statement 3 on housing and the housing Green Paper and all other statements that are relevant to housing. Significantly, housing was one of the three key areas where government will set clear expectations of outcomes, alongside the economy and climate change. That was set out in our policy document in January.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000082"></a>Amendments 175A and 176A would require the responsible regional authorities to consult housing interests when drawing up the strategy. Again, our policy document makes clear the importance of involving housing interests, and we expect to designate the Homes and Communities Agency as a statutory consultee. We have made it abundantly clear in successive policy statements that the regional strategy is a vital mechanism for addressing the long-term housing supply and affordability across the regions. The Bill&#146;s approach is similar to the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, which established regional spatial strategies. The term &#147;housing&#148; does not appear in that Act, but housing is obviously a key element of the spatial strategy. With that on the record, I hope that the noble Baroness will be satisfied.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000083"></a>The amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, refer to the definition of sustainable development, which is the subject of many amendments by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, to which I shall turn in a moment. Sustainable development is at the heart of this policy and part of the architecture of our planning policy. It is set out in PPS1, &#147;Delivering Sustainable Development&#148;, and is the cornerstone of all our planning policies. The basic idea is that sustainable development is the only way of ensuring a better quality of life. Spatial planning, which is what we expect the regional strategy to deliver, is vital in bringing together and integrating policies for the development and use of land with other policies and programmes that influence the nature of places and how they function. This spatial planning approach provides the framework for delivering sustainable development. As I have said, that means not only protecting the environment but providing access to jobs and services, reducing the need to travel and enhancing biodiversity and natural resources.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000084"></a>Clause 65 provides that each region is to have a regional strategy with policies on sustainable economic growth and the development and use of land. Clause 78 explicitly requires regional authorities and the Secretary of State to exercise their functions in relation to the regional strategy with the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC292"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC292</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000085"></a>Amendment 166ZA would replace &#147;development&#148; with &#147;sustainable development&#148;. However, it should be clear from what I am saying that the regional strategies contribute to sustainable development in a way that meets the noble Lord&#146;s main concerns. I am not minded to accept the amendment because Clause 78 already requires such a strategy to be produced in a way that contributes to sustainable development. We have to be very careful about the language, because &#147;development&#148; has a specific meaning in planning law. Under Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, it means building, engineering, making a material change in the use of any buildings or other land, and so on. We cannot simply replace &#147;development&#148; with &#147;sustainable development&#148; in that context. But I reassure the noble Lord that his concerns about this issue are very well taken. Regional strategies, like all other planning strategies, must be geared to sustainable development.</p>
<h5><a name="09020926000247"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000086"></a>On Amendment 166ZB and the green belt, Planning Policy Guidance note 2 sets out strong national policies about the protection of the green belt. The Government continue to attach great importance to the green belt, the fundamental aim of which is to prevent urban sprawl. It has a positive role to play in the future in shaping patterns of urban development at sub-regional and regional level and we are firm in our determination to protect it. Clause 71 requires the responsible regional authorities, the RDAs and the leaders&#146; boards, to have regard, when preparing a regional strategy, to national policy and to guidance. We have published policy on the green belt. That means that the criteria have to be observed and sustained. As with the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, on housing, if we elevate the concept of the green belt as one issue, we do a disservice to other elements of policy and open up the prospect of adding renewable energy and transport to the list. I understand the concern to promote sustainable development and to protect green-belt land; they are fundamental to our policies on plan making and development management, and I hope that I have provided reassurance.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000087"></a>On the broad grouping of amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Tope, I hope that I have reassured them about the importance we attach to the spatial plan&#151;we propose no diminution, no loss or compromise in that regard&#151;and that we have our priorities right in terms of sustainable development, which sits as an envelope around growth. I believe that I have dealt with the spatial strategy. The relevant amendment would add little because our policy document made clear the need for high-quality assessment of the spatial characteristics and needs of the region against which the overview of the key regional and sub-regional opportunities and challenges can be assessed.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000088"></a>Amendment 166B seeks to change the scope of the requirement for regional strategy policy to deal with climate change by replacing &#147;contribute to&#148; with &#147;further&#148;, thereby making the relevant phrase read,</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000237"></a>&#147;further the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020926000199"></a>I understand that in most of the Bills that we have introduced recently, the noble Baroness has been a  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC293"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>great champion of our belief in the need to adopt an aggressive policy towards mitigating climate change. I do not think that in this context the proposed change of wording will make any difference. I argue that to contribute to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change is, indeed, to further the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. However, she may have identified an additional problem&#151;namely, that the wording would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Planning Act 2008, of blessed memory, which amended the 2004 Act. Section 182 of the 2008 Act said that regional spatial strategies must include policies that,</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000238"></a>&#147;contribute to the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020926000200"></a>It would also be inconsistent with the way local authorities address these important issues because the LDFs have to follow the planning framework. I am afraid that if we were to change the wording, we might add considerable confusion.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000089"></a>Amendment 182ZB sought to institute a requirement for the responsible regional authorities and the Secretary of State to further the achievement of sustainable development rather than contribute to it. This change would make the legislation inconsistent with Section 39(2) of the planning Act 2004 and would add to confusion about the duties in this regard in connection with regional strategy and local development documents.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000090"></a>As regards Amendment 182ZA and the general arguments about sustainability, although I understand the concern here I am afraid that the amendment is not needed because Section 4(1)(e) of the relevant legislation already gives the RDAs a duty to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development alongside their economic development duty. Our Bill also provides in Clause 78 for the RDAs to exercise their functions in relation to the regional strategy with the objective of contributing to sustainable development, and it requires regional strategies to have policies in relation to sustainable economic development. We are very clear about that. That is in Clause 65.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000091"></a>The amendment also removes,</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000239"></a>&#147;where it is relevant to do so&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09020926000201"></a>in Section 41E of the RDA Act. That would increase the scope of the RDA&#146;s sustainable development purpose, but in such a way that the purpose would be to contribute to sustainable development everywhere else in the UK, as well as in the RDA areas. This is not the first time that Parliament has debated the issue, but if we remove that phrase, each RDA would end up having a duty to take actions contributing to sustainable development that would not be relevant to the area. The complication enables sustainable development to be relevant to an RDA area, but not restricted geographically to it. That is the best legal ground to capture what we want the RDAs to do; it is a difficult balance, but the right one.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000092"></a>On Amendment 165E, as I said in my opening remarks, sustainable economic growth means economic growth that can be sustained and is within environmental limits, but which also enhances environmental and social welfare. Sustainability is a key factor to apply   


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC294"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when planning for growth. Therefore, I obviously cannot accept the amendment. We have set clear objectives through the regional economic performance PSA which requires regions to increase prosperity and enhance competitiveness. We want to ensure that we get the right economic outcomes for regional strategy. Watering down the economic outcomes of the strategy is not the solution; making sure that they are consistent with sustainable economic development is.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000093"></a>On design considerations, I take the point that it is proposed to change Clause 78(2), which relates to the need to have regard to the desirability of achieving good design, by removing the words &#147;in particular&#148;. This would make the legislation incompatible with the 2008 Planning Act which includes &#147;in particular&#148;. I remember that we had a major debate on that during the passage of that legislation, and again the amendment would cause confusion and alter the scope. As the noble Baroness said, good design is about social, environmental and economic considerations, not just aesthetics.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000094"></a>Finally, I turn to the specific amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. In Amendment 177A he proposes to remove the requirement for responsible regional authorities to take into account national policy, and available resources, in relation to Amendment 177B, when preparing a regional strategy. In Amendment 177E he proposes additional wording to Clause 71(2)(a), whereby a sustainability appraisal should deal with</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000240"></a>&#147;economic, social and environmental issues&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020926000202"></a>Such a clarification, although well intentioned, is unnecessary, as policy, regulations and European law already require sustainability appraisals to consider economic, social and environmental issues. Amendment 177F changes Clause 71(2)(b) so that regional authorities must publish the sustainability report. Again, this is unnecessary as regulations and European law already require this.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000095"></a>I am very conscious that this debate has lasted almost an hour, but it has touched on many fundamental points about why we have constructed the Bill in this way and the intentions behind it. I hope that noble Lords will feel reassured by the way that I have approached this and the detail that I have provided, and that they will think more kindly in terms of the intentions and the benefits.</p>

We shall have to read carefully what she said before we decide whether she has answered the point satisfactorily, so I shall retreat on that one.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000097"></a>On the question of national policy, I clearly was not trying to remove the national policy because planning policy statements exist and they are a part of the regional spatial strategies and the planning system. What I perhaps did not make clear in my probing for clarity here is what national documents will be produced in respect of the economic development side; that is, what the regional development agencies are doing at the moment. I assume that planning policy statements will remain and that they will be the national policy in relation to the spatial planning side. But what do the Government intend to call in evidence in relation to the economic side?</p>

<p><a name="09020926000098"></a>On housing, are we to understand that the existing regional housing strategies will remain, and to that extent the joining up is not taking place?</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000099"></a>The Minister said that she hopes that these proposals will bring about the sort of change that will deliver for local communities. In a sense that is our real concern. Every time the Government introduce changes to the planning system, it becomes more top-down, and is more like something from the old-fashioned eastern European central planning command economies. The point about bureaucracy was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, because we feel that the Government are trying to do too much. For the best of reasons, they are trying to plan and invest in too top-down a way&#151;I am trying to prevent myself saying &#147;social democratic&#148;, but noble Lords will understand what I am saying.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000100"></a>Who is to put this together? One bit about the new regional strategy for the north-west which I did not read out concerns a new regional strategy advisory group that will be brought together to help the RDA and the leaders&#146; group put the new regional strategy together. A list of some 43 organisations is set out, one of which is the Government Office for the North West, but I do not see one that represents ordinary people who might want to get involved in the planning process. The Minister helpfully confirmed that the regional strategy will be part of the development plan. If it includes the RDA&#146;s investment proposals, what possible confidence will people at the local level have in the planning system when they are told that the development plan itself, within which planning applications have to be determined, actually includes the detailed development plan for the region put together by the responsible regional authorities and which includes a detailed economic investment plan? They will have no confidence in it at all. If they say something is not right and they want it changed, they will be told, &#147;Sorry, it&#146;s in the document&#148;.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000101"></a>This is not going to be just a planning document by which a development proposal or planning application has to be judged; the planning application itself will be for a development proposal which is in the development plan. That is where all this is becoming more centralised and more top-down, making it more difficult for anyone on the ground to make changes. No doubt we will have to consider these issues further.</p>

I accept that any Government must have a strategy and that ways have to be found to build houses. I come at this from a different angle because we might be involved in it in a year or two. One has to make these things work.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000103"></a>I think that the Government have got it wrong. I agree with the noble Lord that it should be much more from the bottom up, wherever it ends up. I see how districts operate and the difficulties in the local framework. I wish that the Government had done it in a more bottom-up way. Telling people what to do the whole time will not work so well. Community people need to be involved. I tend to agree with bringing the strategies together for environmental, economic and social reasons. I wish the Government had thought of letting it grow from the bottom up, rather than trying to create

That has not worked before with previous legislation and I do not think that it will work this time. The issue will have to be revisited. As I said, everyone has to have houses and homes must be created, so we need to think about how to do that.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000104"></a>I am sorry to say to the Minister that it will still not work. Thames Gateway, for example, involves three RDAs. The system has not worked in the past and it will not work in the future. I know that Thames Gateway has its own government systems but it is still dependent on working with the RDAs. There are plenty of other such examples around the country, which would be better organised from the bottom up. The Minister has not given us the answers that we wanted to hear.</p>

I was not entirely sure whether the interpretation of her remarks by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, was correct. He suggested that a housing strategy will remain a separate exercise and undertaking at regional level, as now, but I understood the Minister to say that housing would be subsumed into a wider economic statement, which sounds as if it is downgrading it. Her remarks made it clear that if it were so subsumed it would have a prominent place within that economic plan.</p>

Obviously a huge amount of work has gone into the regional spatial strategies in determining housing growth, where housing is needed. The figures change because of more demographic information but, like everything else, housing will be part of the regional economic strategy. All the intelligence and work that has gone into housing plans will be addressed within the RES. As it evolves, it will be easier to link the pressures for housing with the provision of infrastructure, skills and jobs. We will have a much more coherent picture of why housing is where it is and the other implications.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000109"></a>Amendment 166ZC is intended to probe the difference in the wording between the original Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and that which now appears in the Bill. Clause 65(3) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020926000217"></a>&#147;In subsection (2)(a) and (b) references to the region include any part of the region&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000203"></a>The legislation that it is more or less re-enacting, Clause 1(3) of the 2004 Act, says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020926000218"></a>&#147;In subsection (2) the references to a region include references to any area within a region which includes the area or part of the area of more than one local planning authority&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000204"></a>I do not understand the reason for the change and what practical effect it might have.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000110"></a>I think that there is a more general point, which will perhaps stop me saying more today. A great deal of Part 1 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act is being re-enacted in Part 5 of the Bill, but there are quite a few changes. It would be helpful if those changes could be listed and explanations given for why they are taking place. It is only five years since we struggled over that Act, and if changes are now necessary we need to know why the wording has changed. Words matter in legislation.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000111"></a>Amendment 168B refers to a national park that crosses two or more regions. As it stands, the Bill says in effect that the Secretary of State may allocate that national park to one region. The amendment is probing to find out if that would be the normal case. I have been trying to think of national parks that will cross regional boundaries. The North York Moors probably does, and certainly the Peak District will; it will probably be in four different regions. If that is the case, it is not clear to me why the national park, which is such an important area, should not have a toe in the water in each of those regions and why it should have to be allocated to one of them, on whatever basis. If national parks are important, as they are, and part of a park is in a region, it ought to be part and parcel of the system for producing the regional plan in that region.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000112"></a>Amendment 177C probes what that little bit of the Bill means. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000113"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09020926000284"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> In the interests of speed, perhaps the noble Lord will allow me to read <I>Hansard</I> in detail tomorrow. The amendments would restrict the ability of responsible regional authorities to have sub-regional policies, and I know that that is not what he is concerned about.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000114"></a>As I understand it, there are no substantive differences from the 2004 Act, but I will take his invitation to reply in writing about that so he can be clear. We can then pick up the question he raises in Amendment 177C as well.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000115"></a>With regard to Amendment 168B, the ability to specify which region should consider the issue in respect of a national park that crosses regional boundaries&#151;and many do, such as the New Forest&#151;is, frankly, common sense. National parks all need to be considered as a whole. It is wasteful for the south-east and the south-west region to duplicate work. A regional strategy that does not comply with national policy to take account of the level of resources available is going to lack all credibility, so it would be a waste of time to produce those

<p><a name="09020926000117"></a>I am grateful for her reply. Am I to understand, therefore, that the intention is that in every case the whole of the national park will be allocated to one region for this purpose? That is probably sensible in most cases, but I am not sure that it is sensible in the case of the Peak District. That might be thought about. I am grateful for that clarification and for the promise of sending us even more correspondence; I look forward to it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000121"></a>The amendments are spread throughout this part, but they are all intended to make the same point: to either remove or qualify and restrict the powers that the Bill would give to the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000122"></a>The Local Government Association states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020926000220"></a>&#147;As one of the central tenets of this piece of legislation is that authorities are empowered to work together to come up with a strategy best suiting to the local area, then it does not follow that the Secretary of State should have the power to amend or scrap the work that has been done and enforce an alternative Regional Strategy&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000205"></a>Earlier, the Minister said that the Government want to keep central Government out of the process as much as possible. I have no doubt that she will assure us again of the Government&#146;s good intentions, that these are reserve powers to be used only as a last resort, and so on.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000123"></a>However, the Bill gives the Secretary of State considerable powers&#151;not just the present Secretary of State and not just the present Government, but any Secretary of State and any Government&#151;for as long as it remains on the statute book. Therefore, I ask the Minister not simply to assure us of the Government&#146;s good intentions, which we all readily accept, but to explain what safeguards local authorities have should we have a future Secretary of State and Government  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC299"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who wish to centralise or control rather more; it is hard to think that that may happen. If we pass the Bill as drafted, future Secretaries of State will have considerable powers to intervene if they should so wish or deem it necessary, with very little qualification or control to prevent their doing so.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000124"></a>As I have said in relation to so much local government legislation, we legislate for the worst councils&#151;we have been debating that at great length throughout the Committee. I want some reassurance about how we prevent legislating for bad Governments. That is what I want to hear from the Minister: not the good intentions of this Government, which I happily accept, but how we safeguard local authorities from the bad intentions of future Governments. I beg to move.</p>

They are on very similar lines to those which the noble Lord, Lord Tope, just set out. I very much support his amendments, but ours specifically remove &#147;Secretary of State&#148; and insert, &#147;regional development agency and Leaders&#146; Board&#148;. Whatever we think of the new arrangements, at least that takes the powers away from the Secretary of State and leaves them more locally. Throughout the Bill, we have talked the whole time about the powers of the Secretary of State. I have done that during discussion of several pieces of legislation, but this time more than with others. I commend the amendments.</p>

I know that noble Lords have raised these issues because they fear that the Secretary of State is going to use the powers to ride roughshod over the wishes of regional authorities. The amendments reflect that concern. I shall do my best to reassure noble Lords that this is not the case and to answer the questions posed by the noble Lord, Lord Tope, about how we can be sure that a bad Government would not do these things; rather like bad King John. I am not entirely certain that there will ever be such a bad Government.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000127"></a>The most important thing that I want to stress is that there is nothing new in these powers. With the exception of the powers attached to the leaders&#146; board, which are new, they are all powers that exist in broad terms under the PCPA. They are sometimes expressed in different language, but they are the same powers that cover the present regional spatial strategies. For example, the Secretary of State publishes the RSS, incorporating any changes she has made, and she puts it out to consultation. She can prepare an RSS if the regional planning body fails to do so; she can revoke all or part of an RSS if it is necessary and expedient to do so&#151;which is exactly the same language&#151;and she was given the power to prescribe how much of the pre-existing regional planning guidance would become the first RSS. These powers have not only not been abused&#151;they are there as a last resort&#151;but powers such as taking over the drafting of the RSS or revoking it, which is the most draconian power, have never been used, and we do not expect them to be used for the regional strategy. That is not to say it is not prudent to have them as a fall-back for the worst scenario.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC300"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000128"></a>The powers in the Bill are minimal, but are included to deal with two significant risks that might arise. First, despite all the good will and preparation for joint responsibility and duties between local and regional government, there is a real difficulty about what the strategy and the long-term vision should be. There could be disagreement between local authorities, RDAs and business, or there could be disagreement between urban and rural authorities. We have to ensure that there is an optimal strategy and, in the last resort, we need to have the power to arbitrate.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000129"></a>The second risk is that the regional strategy does not reflect government policy, by which I mean the imperatives that as a Government, we have to make sure that we have enough houses, a robust economy, the best education and skills policy and so on. In circumstances where somehow the regional strategy is reluctant to accept those broad imperatives and does not take account of the funding available, it is unlikely that it could be implemented. To be effective, this has to be a collective endeavour, and there must be partnership not only between local authorities, which will have so much more purchase and possibility under the new arrangements than they did under regional assemblies, but also between regional authorities and the Government. For example, if a strategy included the need for a new motorway to improve transport links, but no funding was available, there would be no point in having it in the strategy because it would not be deliverable. The Government have a responsibility to ensure that solutions can be found and strategies are thus effective.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000130"></a>In different ways, the amendments address all those concerns. This is not about some centralising agenda. These powers are based on arrangements currently in place for regional spatial strategies. The first reserve power to revise a regional strategy spells out the circumstances in which this power would apply: where the responsible regional authorities had failed to revise the strategy at the time specified in regulations or by a direction. In such unlikely circumstances, the Secretary of State could arrange for an EIP, must consult such persons as are considered appropriate and must take account of the EIP report and representations. The second power is the power to revoke, which has never been used. Both of the powers replicate existing reserve powers under Section 10 of the 2004 Act. We have had no reason to resort to either power.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000131"></a>If we did not have the power to revoke&#151;the &#147;necessary and expedient&#148; power&#151;the strategy could be revoked only through a further revision. There may be circumstances where a further revision would not be appropriate, so that is a practical reason. The Government, or some future Government, might want to move on from regional strategies as a policy tool, but they would be unable to do so without this power and they would remain in place. So there is a practical reason for this. Our expectation is that the partnership arrangements we put in place, the embedding of the local democratic conscience in local authorities and the leaders&#146; boards, will anticipate and deal with any problems, which is one reason why we have the EIP at the front end of the process. However, there must be a fall-back position. Amendment 180E would remove the power of the Secretary of State to make regulations on the single strategy. I know it is a probing amendment,  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC301"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC301</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but I can see that the noble Lord would agree that regulations are important when dealing with something as fundamental as this; for example, the arrangements for examination in public or the listing of statutory consultees. That is why we need the regulations there.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000132"></a>Amendments 167, 168, 166C, 166D, 177A and 177B all address the ability of the Secretary of State to resolve, if necessary, any significant contradictions between the existing strategies when they become the regional strategy. It is obvious that we want a smooth transition and this, again, is a fall-back power. We would expect that in almost every case the RES and RSS would, in combination, form the regional strategy without modification. A great deal of effort has gone into aligning the RES and the RSS. However, if there were differences, the RDA and local authority leaders&#146; boards would agree how they should be resolved and make recommendations to the Secretary of State. It is only at that point that the Secretary of State could make a direction to resolve those differences. As I say, this is a fall-back power.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000133"></a>There are amendments to remove the requirement for a direction and instead leave it to the RDA and local authorities to slog it out and decide which elements of the existing strategies would form the regional strategy. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Tope, agree that the Secretary of State should not be involved, but feel instead that the existing regional economic and spatial strategies should stand as they are and that we should rely on the responsible regional authorities to work around any policy conflicts. I think we are all agreed that responsibility should rest with the RDA and the local authorities to sort out any contradictions, if they exist. However, it would not be right for the regional authorities to be able to amend the RSS without clearance from the Secretary of State, given that the RSS is published by the Secretary of State, having gone through a rigorous process to become part of the statutory development plan. It has been a partnership.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000134"></a>It is important that, as we move towards a single strategy as quickly as possible, there should be no unnecessary delays. We also have to consider that there may not be a leaders&#146; board in all regions at that point. The procedure set out in the Bill is designed to deal with that. I hope this reassures noble Lords that the existing strategies will normally become the regional strategy without modification and that only where there are serious differences of substance would any change be considered. In such cases, the process for resolving them should normally be bottom up.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000135"></a>Amendment 168A is on the same subsection, but has a different purpose. It seeks to resolve a perceived inconsistency in that changes to the RSS require a direction, while changes to the RES do not. That is because the RES has always had a different status; it is not signed off by the Secretary of State and is not part of the statutory development plan. Amendment 175ZA is closely related and requires the Secretary of State to prepare and publish a statement of her reasons for a direction under Clause 65(6) to specify which parts of the RSS and RES should become the regional strategy. This amendment was placed against the wrong clause, but reading it attached to this clause, while I sympathise

I hope that satisfies noble Lords.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000136"></a>Amendment 177D amends Clause 71 on matters to be taken into account when preparing draft regional strategy revisions. This adds a requirement for the Secretary of State to consult before making regulations specifying other matters that should be taken into account under Clause 71(1)(j). I have no issues with that. Transparency is very important, but the Secretary of State would normally consult on any draft regulations in this group. Finally, Amendment 179A would require the Secretary of State to consult the responsible regional authorities and so on as appropriate. The noble Lord seeks to ensure that regional authorities are consulted, and I have no quarrel with that, but it is rather counterproductive to the spirit of consultation as it would make the clause more specific about which persons the Secretary of State needs to consult before finalising further changes to the draft regional strategy. The current provision in Clause 72(3) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020926000221"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State must consult such persons (if any) as the Secretary of State considers appropriate&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09020926000206"></a>in line with requirements under existing legislation, for example environmental assessment. It is a probing amendment, but I hope that that has been taken into account in my general response.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000137"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09020926000292"></a>Lord Tope:</b> I am once again grateful to the Minister for her full reply, but she has not managed to reassure me about misuse by a less benevolent future Government. The fact that all these powers already exist and have never been used is not a reassurance that they will never be used, nor a reassurance regarding the circumstances in which they might be used. We are talking about a future Secretary of State and what he may or may not want to do. Clause 73(2) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020926000222"></a>&#147;Before revising a regional strategy ... the Secretary of State ... may arrange for an examination in public to be held&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09020926000207"></a>&#147;may&#148; but not &#147;must&#148;. That is inconsistent with what was in the Bill earlier. I would not have it there at all so I am not advocating that it should say &#147;must&#148;. I just ask where the reassurance is made in that provision. Subsection (2)(b) states that the Secretary of State,</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000241"></a>&#147;must consult such persons (if any)&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09020926000208"></a>we do not have a long list of the persons to be consulted, as in other parts of the Bill. I seem to remember moving an amendment to include the words &#147;if any&#148; and having it roundly rubbished. The paragraph continues,</p>
<ul><a name="09020926000242"></a>&#147;as the Secretary of State considers appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020926000209"></a>A malignant Secretary of State in some inconceivable future world may not have an examination in public. He may conclude that nobody is worth consulting and just rewrite the regional strategy. These may sound like far-fetched circumstances, and I hope that they are. I keep saying that we are legislating for worst-case scenarios, and I want to turn the tables and consider such scenarios from a local authority point of view. I am grateful to the Minister and not in the least surprised that she has failed to reassure me. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Further amendments have been tabled by my noble friend Lady Hamwee and from the Conservative Benches.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000139"></a>This group is about leaders&#146; boards, which is the new invention that we have to understand and perhaps love in Clause 66. They had not been dreamt up at the time of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, but are nevertheless now thought to be essential to maintain the system and prevent it collapsing.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000140"></a>As I understand it, leaders&#146; boards are a response to complaints about the democratic deficit that was threatened with the abolition of regional assemblies and the power to produce regional plans going to the regional development agencies. That would have allowed the RDAs to carry out their own investment proposals. At least we now have some balancing element in the form of the leaders&#146; boards. However, for a lot of people in the regions and their local authorities, it will be seen to entrench a remote, regional elite that has little connection with them, and hence some of my amendments.</p>
<h5><a name="09020926000250"></a>7 pm</h5>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000141"></a>We now have a leaders&#146; board in the north-west, which goes under the exciting name of 4NW. No doubt the person who dreamt this up had spent too much time texting and came up with this rather dismal name. Nevertheless, there it is. It is chaired, no doubt admirably, by the person they describe as &#147;Lord Peter Smith&#148;: the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh. We are perhaps ahead of the game in the north-west. We have this thing, although we do not yet have much experience of how it may work.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000142"></a>The amendment would remove &#147;must&#148; and insert &#147;may&#148; in setting up leaders&#146; boards. It would provide that leaders&#146; boards may be set up if local authorities in the region want them, but if they do not want them, they do not have to set them up. The Government say that they are forced to have leaders&#146; boards whether they like it or not. Amendment 168D questions whether a leaders&#146; board should ever be an incorporated body. I understand that it is intended&#151;this is certainly mainly the case in the north-west, although there is some non-local authority representation on them&#151;that a leaders&#146; board is a representative body of local authorities. As such, it is not clear to me why it should ever be a corporate body. It might be dangerous if it was. It is a step towards a new regional assembly-type body, but of a small and elite kind. The question is in what circumstances a leaders&#146; board might need to be   


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC304"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>incorporated. What might it need to do, given the other bodies in the region such as the regional development agency, the Government office and many more?</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000143"></a>Amendments 168E, 168G, 170A, 170B and 170D would remove &#147;participating&#148;&#151;perhaps I should have done it in other places, too&#151;and insert &#147;qualifying&#148;. This is because most local authorities in big regions will never participate in this body; they qualify to participate. They are rather like people who are qualified to stand for local authorities. They do not participate in those local authorities unless they get elected. The Bill suggests that all local authorities are participating when they are instead only qualifying to be on the body, should they be chosen by whatever system there might be. Approximately two-thirds of local authorities in the north-west are not members of 4NW, and most of them are not likely to be.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000144"></a>Amendment 168F would define the membership. The Bill talks about leaders&#146; boards, and there is an assumption that it consists of leaders of local authorities, but it never says so. It does not say whether people who are not leaders can represent a local authority on a leaders&#146; board rather than the leader. If these bodies are going to exist, the membership should be clearly defined.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000145"></a>Amendment 170C probes the leaders&#146; boards&#146; funding. Clause 66(7) says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020926000224"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may give such sums as the Secretary of State considers appropriate&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000210"></a>Well, the Secretary of State may be generous in wanting to give out lots of cash to these bodies, but apart from that it is not clear how these bodies will raise whatever money they need.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000146"></a>This is a probing amendment to ask what scale of budget the Government anticipate these bodies will have. Amendment 170E probes whether the bodies will be able to put a levy on their participating or qualifying local authorities. Will they be able to impose a precept? I presume not, as that would require other legislation. However, will they be able to impose a compulsory levy on the councils in their region, or will councils be able to wash their hands and say, &#147;We have no influence here, they&#146;re going to do what they want, so we won&#146;t have anything to do with it and we&#146;ll save our money&#148;? Those are important questions about the financing of leaders&#146; boards. I have no idea how the leaders&#146; board in the north-west is being funded. Presumably it is being paid for out of funds that were available for the regional assembly, by donations from the government office or by&#151;</p>

However, these are important questions, which I do not think have been answered.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000149"></a>Amendment 172AA probes what responsibility the leaders&#146; boards will have to communicate with and get feedback from their constituent local authorities. If the system is going to work properly, it is vital that there is a good system of communication back to local authorities, so that local authority members have the opportunity to put forward their views through their  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC305"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC305</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>representatives. In the north-west, this is done on a sub-regional basis, with five county areas each having three representatives but with different votes, so that, for example, Greater Manchester has more votes than Cumbria. That is a slightly odd system but, whatever the system is, we want proper communication both ways.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000150"></a>Finally, on the last group of amendments, the noble Baroness said that the reason why the Secretary of State has to have all this power is that he or she publishes the document. I tabled Amendment 180A to turn that the other way round. I believe that the regional authorities should publish the document, because they should own it. However, that goes with a different view of the development plan; I do not believe that the Secretary of State should have the power to approve or disapprove almost every element in the development plan right down to local level. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000151"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0007.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09020926000297"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I have several amendments in this group, including Amendments 169 to 171, 182A and 182B. I do not want to go into enormous detail&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has put some of the arguments well&#151;but the amendments all probe questions about the leaders&#146; boards. I am sure that the Minister will tell us a lot about this in a moment, but we have not yet heard much about how the Government see leaders&#146; boards. In the eastern region, given that there are something like 50 authorities, there is a lot of discussion and argument about who will be on the board. I would like some clarification about whether the person has to be the leader or whether they could be the deputy leader. Exactly how do the Government see the arrangements to create the leaders&#146; boards?</p>

<a name="90209-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000152"></a>Again, we have this sinister power of the Secretary of State, who will be able to sack leaders&#146; boards or rearrange them if he or she does not like them or thinks that they are not operating very well. If we are to have leaders&#146; boards, I do not think that the Secretary of State should be that involved with them once a decision has been made through the democratic process.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000153"></a>There will be problems in areas where there are lots of elections. London has elections every four years, as do counties, but many unitaries and districts have yearly elections, so there may be a change of leadership every year, especially in marginal authorities. That would mean that leaders&#146; boards would need to be reconstituted virtually every year. There must be some way of reflecting the political changes every time there are elections, and I hope that that has been taken into account. That is the gist of my amendments.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000154"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09020926000298"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> We have two amendments in this group: Amendments 169ZA and 169B. The first follows on from points made by my noble friend Lord Greaves. I have been concerned for some time that the Government&#146;s concept of strong leadership carries with it weak everyone else. There is a danger that individual councillors who are not leaders may be squeezed out of, above all, information.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000155"></a>My Amendment 169ZA takes us on one stage from that, in that I fear that the leaders&#146; boards may squeeze out some parties. In the local government world&#151;this is referred to in one of the amendments of the noble  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC306"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC306</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord, Lord Hanningfield&#151;we are used to the arrangement that provides for the proportionality of political parties on any given council across its committees. I realise that I show my age, in political terms at any rate, in thinking in committee terms. Proportionality is important; it recognises the role that representatives of all political parties, not just those of the Administration, have to play. Amendment 169ZA would provide for the representation of all parties in participating authorities, including some sort of device to include independent members.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000156"></a>Amendment 169B continues the theme and would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s role in approving the scheme for setting up the leaders&#146; boards. We make it perfectly clear that we think that it is a matter for the authorities. I probably need say no more about that.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000157"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09020926000299"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> This is an important group of amendments to which I shall try to do justice. The amendments fall into two main groups. The first concerns the rationale for the creation of the leaders&#146; boards, their viability, composition and the different roles of different partners. The second concerns the role of the Secretary of State. I shall deal with the amendments in their two groups and in the context of the clause stand part debate raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000158"></a>The consultation on the SNR made it quite clear that leaders&#146; boards would be the key body representing the collective views of local government in a region, but the way in which they work and what they will look like will depend on each board. All that we have done is to set up some basic criteria which we expect to see met. They need to be streamlined and manageable to make strategic decisions, but to be representative of local government in the region and made up of leaders with the authority to act on behalf of the region. They are not leaders in the sense that we use for leaders of the council; they can be from the council, acting on behalf of the authority. It will be entirely up to the local authority to decide. That approach has been welcomed by the LGA.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000159"></a>The fall-back power, which allows the Secretary of State to agree the scheme produced in the region, is just that: a fall-back power, reflecting the ultimate responsibility that she has to ensure that leaders&#146; boards are effective and meet the basic criteria. It is very satisfying that most regions are getting on with establishing leaders&#146; boards. The chances of the Secretary of State not approving a scheme that has wide support are remote. One leaders&#146; board is already in place, the famous 4NW. Our latest information is that leaders&#146; boards will be established in the next two or three months in at least four more regions, which is excellent news. Rather than take noble Lords through the detail, I shall write to them to update them on what progress has been made and in which regions.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000160"></a>In probing this provision, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has to take into account the reality of the fact that leaders&#146; boards are already in place and in process, so he will not be surprised when I say that I cannot accept Amendment 168C, which would require that they should be optional. I will, however, answer his point about funding. We have already said that we will fund leaders&#146; boards to the order of &#163;20 million a year  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC307"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC307</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to allow them to undertake their statutory responsibilities, just as we currently fund regional assemblies to carry out their functions on a regional planning body. They will not be allowed to levy a precept. Nor do we expect leaders&#146; boards to charge competent authorities for their work. I want to put on record the fact that, having established why we need leaders&#146; boards, we must accept that they need the resources to do the job.</p>
<h5><a name="09020926000251"></a>7.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000161"></a>I turn now to Amendment 168D, which seeks to remove the phrase &#147;(whether or not incorporated)&#148; from Clause 66(1). In line with our flexible approach, we have left it to the participating local authorities to decide the legal status of their leaders&#146; board so that it can best meet their requirements. The phrase clarifies that intention. If incorporated, for example, a leaders&#146; board would have a legal personality and could enter into contracts on its own behalf as well as employ staff. They would otherwise draw on staff employed by the participating authorities in the region.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000162"></a>Amendments 168E, 168G, 178A, 178B and 178D seek to replace &#147;participating&#148; authority with &#147;qualifying&#148; authority when referring to local authorities. Subsection (3) makes it clear that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020926000225"></a>&#147;For the purposes of this section, &#145;participating authority&#146; means&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09020926000211"></a>district and county councils, including unitaries, as well as national park authorities and the Broads Authority. I take the point he made, and I have an additional note from my officials saying that &#147;participating authorities&#148; would make the scheme to establish leaders&#146; boards, so this must anticipate any question of who qualifies, which will be determined by the scheme drawn up by the local authorities.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000163"></a>Let me remind noble Lords of some of the criteria set out in the SNR document. One is that leaders&#146; boards should be streamlined, manageable, representative and composed of local authority leaders with sufficient authority to act on behalf of local areas. Amendment 168F could undermine those criteria by allowing leaders&#146; boards to include members from all local authorities and to allow non-leaders to be appointed as substitutes. The issue is how much detail about the composition of these boards should be included in primary legislation. The boards have to be effective and of a manageable size. In the north-east, it might be possible to include all the authorities, but there are 76 local authorities in the south-east. It is up to the boards how they manage functions. That does not rule out substitutes or even external stakeholders, but boards must be credible and have authority. I am afraid that if we were to accept the amendment, we might get bogged down in having to deal with detailed membership rules. We are aiming for flexibility.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000164"></a>Amendment 172AA also risks burdening leaders with blanket rules to require board members to consult local authorities that are not directly represented. Of course they should be able to do so, but we look to their schemes to see how they will achieve that. Consultation may be the answer. However, there may be other ways to do this.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000165"></a>I have spoken about the ability of boards to determine their own composition and how they work, which covers the provision suggested in Amendment 169ZA  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC308"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in relation to all political parties. The amendment would provide for all political parties to be represented on the boards, as well as a reasonable number of independent members. Many of my arguments about the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, apply here, but it is in essence for participating authorities to agree among themselves how they will allocate seats. What we expect to see and what is set out in the policy document is that leaders&#146; boards should reflect the political balance of leaders in the region.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000166"></a>On the Secretary of State&#146;s powers in Amendments 169 to 170 and 169B, noble Lords have argued that it is not necessary to have the Secretary of State&#146;s approval here because local authorities can be relied on to take a responsible and inclusive approach, and I agree. Therefore, I revert to the arguments that I made previously. The powers here are to be used in the event of a worst-case scenario. They are there as a fallback position, and it would be irresponsible not to allow for such powers. They are particularly relevant in order for everyone to be satisfied that the leaders&#146; board will be representative of the whole region.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000167"></a>Our final reason for believing that the leaders&#146; board needs to be formally signed off by the Secretary of State is that it will be a statutory body and a responsible regional authority. It will be in receipt of public funds, and it is only right and proper that it should be formally recognised as such by the Secretary of State. This is not a precedent. The power to approve the leaders&#146; board is the same as the current power of the Secretary of State to appoint a regional planning body under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000168"></a>Amendment 171 would remove the ability of the Secretary of State, by direction, to withdraw approval for the leaders&#146; board scheme in a region where it was not operating effectively. We would expect that power to be used extremely exceptionally where the operation of the board was significantly at variance with its approved scheme. I have just made clear the value that the Government place on the scheme, and it would not be consistent for the Secretary of State to approve it and then not to be able to ensure that it was subsequently adhered to.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000169"></a>Finally, I turn to Clauses 72 and 79. Clause 72 concerns what happens when the responsible regional authorities have prepared and published a draft revision of the regional strategy and submitted it to the Secretary of State. Amendment 180A to Clause 72 seeks to remove the requirement for the Secretary of State to publish any revisions and places this duty with the responsible regional authorities. I have just explained the importance of the Secretary of State&#146;s approval role, and this applies equally to the publication of the document, which acts as the final sign-off.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000170"></a>None of these powers is new. A power for direction for regional development agencies already exists in Section 7(2) of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. In addition, as I said, there is a power of direction in relation to the revision of strategy in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000171"></a>I have gone through that at a fair place, for which I apologise. However, I am anxious to address the   


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC309"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC309</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>amendments and to make progress, and I hope that my response has been sufficiently clear for noble Lords to feel that their questions have been answered.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000172"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09020926000300"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I am going to withdraw Amendment 168C, although I should like to be satisfied that leaders&#146; boards will be representative of the whole region. Of course, it all depends on what you mean by the whole region. You could put the region into big areas and say that there was someone from there and therefore the boards were representative, but they will not really be representative. There will be a lot of councils. Most people will never have heard of the boards and will have no idea what is going on in their name until they discover what decisions they make.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000173"></a>I still do not understand why leaders&#146; boards need to be incorporated. 4NW has a staff structure chart on the internet and appears to employ 37 people. I am not sure how that works, as I am certain that it is not incorporated. I assume that they are the people who previously worked for the regional assembly, but I ask who employed them because that was not an incorporated body. Therefore, I do not know how it works, but perhaps someone can find out.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000174"></a>We will read with great care what the Minister said and see whether we want to bring back some of these issues. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment 168C.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000176"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09020926000303"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> As my noble friend said, Amendment 173B is grouped with Amendment 172AB. He said that he would say what he said, even though he did not know when we would reach it. I am grateful for his compliments, but I fully expect to hear from the Government that my amendment is not as full as it should be if I am to achieve what I am obviously setting out to achieve, because it should have referred to Schedule 12A as well as to Part VA of the Local Government Act 1972.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000177"></a>The objective of this not-quite-correct amendment is to require regional development agencies, leaders&#146; boards, and the two of them acting jointly, which is  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC310"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC310</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>how responsible regional authorities are defined in Clause 67, to be subject to the same provisions as local authorities on access to information, agendas and meetings. I propose the application of this to regional development agencies outside as well as within the context of the Bill. The provisions of Part VA of the Local Government Act 1972 allow for certain matters to be exempt, which all three entities could take advantage of as local authorities do. However, one should start from the premise that all the business of the three types of entity should be open, subject to exclusions where the legislation provides for that.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000178"></a>I feel particularly strongly about this, having gone through experiences in London where the London Development Agency, which is a regional development agency, designed its agendas&#151;this is my interpretation, having looked at how they were constructed&#151;in such a way that all the confidential business happened at the start of the meeting. The meetings took place at 8 am because of the large number of business people who were contributing to the work of the LDA, and the non-confidential business was taken at the end. My guess was that, by that point, a number of main players would have gone on to their day jobs. I am not seeking to rubbish its contribution for a moment, but I do seek to argue that that is not the way to run public authorities.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000179"></a>What applies to local authorities should apply to leaders&#146; boards, which I hope is completely uncontentious. Their business will be of major importance to their areas, and the same goes for responsible regional authorities: the RDAs and the leaders&#146; boards acting jointly. The situation is a little better in London, but we started in 2000 with a number of members of the London Assembly sitting outside an LDA meeting to make the point that they were not admitted. That is absolutely wrong, but it creates quite a vivid picture, which I would not like to be replicated in the future. I would like all these bodies to be subject to the perfectly proper rules that local councillors have lived with for years.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000180"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0008.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09020926000304"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I know how strongly the noble Baroness feels about these amendments, and based on her experience, I understand more. Amendment 172AB, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would insert:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020926000228"></a>&#147;Section 100 of the Local Government Act 1972 ... applies to meetings of the Leaders&#146; Boards as if it were a committee of a local authority&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000212"></a>That would mean that all such meetings must be open to the public.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000181"></a>Amendment 173B is further reaching in its effect in two important respects. It refers to all the provisions of Part VA of the 1972 Act rather than to Section 100. As a consequence not only all meetings would need to be public but all papers, reports and minutes, as well as details relating to individual members of the board. It applies not only to leaders&#146; boards but to RDAs and responsible regional authorities.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000182"></a>It is important to recognise that we are not trying to create additional bureaucracy with leaders&#146; boards. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has been keen to ensure that we know his feelings on that. It is about  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC311"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>representing local authorities working with RDAs, and we want those strategies to be developed in a way that is open, inclusive and appropriate. That is why we require the responsible regional authorities: to publish a statement of their policies for the involvement of all those who have an interest in the regional strategy; to comply with it; and to have an examination to test it publicly and rigorously. Those provisions have been built into the process for producing the regional strategy, which are as inclusive as for the RSS but which go further than for regional economic strategies and line up with the local development framework.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000183"></a>Because this is a new process, the leaders&#146; boards will work in different ways. They will be tasked specifically with hard work, much of which will be about analysis and negotiation with the RDAs on priorities. This is a very different situation and it would not be appropriate to apply the provisions of the 1972 Act to the leaders&#146; boards or the RDAs. Leaders&#146; boards will be established through an open process. A scheme will be made to establish them and they will be consulted on. While we do not intend to prescribe how that consultation will be done, the Secretary of State will consider whether it has been consistent with the Cabinet Office code. I expect them to conduct their business openly.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000184"></a>Regional assemblies generally meet in public. They include information of past and future meetings and papers and minutes on their websites. Leaders&#146; boards will also act transparently. The 4NW&#151;the famous one&#151;is already following similar procedures for public access to information to the former north-west regional assembly. The nature and detail of each of the boards&#146; constitution and governance will be for the participating local authorities to decide. That may vary between regions. Therefore, we do not feel that it would be right to prescribe detailed arrangements. Nevertheless, local authorities and their leaders will be subject to Part VA of the 1972 Act and the Freedom of Information Act. The activities of the leaders&#146; boards and members of the participating authorities will be subject to the relevant provisions.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000185"></a>RDAs are committed to openness and are subject to the Freedom of Information Act. They follow the model publication scheme produced for the information commissioner. Yorkshire Forward, for example, publishes the agenda for each board meeting as well as board  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC312"></a><b>9 Feb 2009 : Column GC312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>minutes on its website. RDAs are not authorities for the purpose of the Local Government Act. As the noble Baroness knows, Part VA would not be appropriate.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000186"></a>In summary, my argument is that they are different animals and will work in different ways. While I accept the noble Baroness&#146;s concern, rather than imposing a detailed and possibly inappropriate process on all the responsibilities, we want to ensure that the process is inclusive and transparent. We have done that in the ways I have suggested. That approach has worked well in the past in involving communities. If we went further, I believe that we would end up with more bureaucracy. We would have inflexibility and not necessarily greater transparency.</p>

<p><a name="09020926000187"></a><b><a name="90209-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09020926000305"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> The Minister used the phrases, &#147;open, inclusive and appropriate&#148; and &#147;inclusive and transparent&#148; but I cannot make the conceptual leap from what she said to the resistance to this amendment. Admitting the public and ensuring that papers are open to them becomes bureaucratic when one has to put in a lot of Freedom of Information Act requests. They should be the last not the first resort. They are new arrangements, so to my mind we should get them right from the beginning.</p>

<a name="90209-gc0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09020926000188"></a>I will have to read what the noble Baroness said about leaders&#146; boards to understand what happens when a leaders&#146; board which applies these rules and an RDA which does not do so join together as a responsible regional authority. That would be a separate entity. However, I feel an amendment on Report coming on.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0902092000013"></a>Today my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I are announcing the final outcomes of the UK&#146;s first global review of its visa regimes.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="0902092000014"></a>Britain thrives as a society and economy which is open for business, education, culture and tourism to people from around the world, but we want to do that in a way that enables us to distinguish clearly and effectively legitimate from illegitimate travellers. We are completing some of the biggest ever changes to strengthen Britain&#146;s border security by implementing a system of triple checks: stronger overseas checks including fingerprint visas and wider pre-arrival screening; tougher checks at the UK border itself; and strong new measures within the UK: against illegal immigration, organised crime and other threats.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0902092000015"></a>The visa waiver test process, announced in March 2007, further strengthens the UK border by ensuring that our visa regimes are properly targeted. A visa regime is a simple but very effective immigration, crime and security control measure.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="0902092000016"></a>The visa waiver test measured travel from every country and region beyond the European economic area and Switzerland against a range of criteria including illegal immigration, crime and security concerns.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="0902092000017"></a>As part of the test we also considered whether any countries or regions posed a sufficiently low risk such as to warrant the lifting of an existing visitor visa requirement, so as to facilitate legitimate travel.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="0902092000018"></a>In the final stage of the test we worked closely with 11 countries whose nationals had been identified as posing a sufficiently high risk as to warrant, in principle, the introduction of a visa requirement for all travellers. We worked with the countries concerned over a six-month period to find ways to reduce the risks posed to the UK without the need for a visa requirement.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="0902092000019"></a>We have been able to make real progress with a number of countries through a combination of advice, training and improved working relations on migration matters. As a result some of the 11 countries have made concrete improvements to the immigration, border control and identity systems which would not have happened without the test. Even where a visa regime is the final outcome, we have improved co-operation on migration matters with the countries concerned. At

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="0902092000020"></a>We will not be introducing new visa requirements at this time for certain countries involved in the final stage of the test: Botswana, Brazil, Malaysia, Mauritius, Namibia, and Trinidad and Tobago. We will continue to work with these countries on migration matters and assess the effectiveness of the actions taken. Should circumstances warrant it, we will re-examine the situation and take prompt action.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="0902092000021"></a>We have also concluded that Taiwan presents a low migration risk and we will be lifting the visitor visa requirement for Taiwan passport holders coming to the UK for less than six months, and who are not seeking to work. This will take effect from 3 March.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="0902092000022"></a>We have decided to introduce new visa requirements for Bolivia, Lesotho, South Africa, Swaziland and Venezuela. This means that short-term visitors from these countries will need to apply for a six-month visa and provide their fingerprints, before travelling to the UK. Nationals of these countries seeking to travel via the UK en route to another country will also need a transit visa. This is in addition to the existing requirement for a visa in order to live, work, study or marry in the UK.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="0902092000023"></a>In the case of South Africa, we will introduce the visa requirement in two stages. The first stage, beginning on 3 March, will require only first-time visitors to the UK from South Africa to obtain a visa. Those who can show a satisfactory previous travel history to the UK will initially be exempt from the visa requirement. This exemption must be evidenced by a UK entry stamp in their current passport. We will introduce the full visa regime by the middle of 2009.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="0902092000024"></a>In the case of Venezuela we will require visas from its nationals but we will waive this requirement for all those travelling on biometric, machine-readable passports. This is because our main concern related to the ease with which old-style Venezuelan passports could be forged or fraudulently obtained. Our assessment is that their new-style passports are secure and that the new visa requirement is proportionate to the remaining risk posed by the old-style passports.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="0902092000025"></a>We will announce implementation dates for the full visa regime for South Africa, and the visa regimes for Bolivia, Lesotho, Swaziland and Venezuela, in due course. Implementation for all these countries will be by the middle of 2009. We will announce the final dates at least 21 days before imposition.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="0902092000026"></a>All the new visa regimes will be implemented to the high standard of the UK&#146;s current visa operations.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="0902092000027"></a>Separately to the visa waiver test, we have also decided to introduce a transit visa requirement for nationals of Jamaica. In January 2003 a visa requirement was introduced for Jamaican nationals visiting the United Kingdom. It did not include a requirement to obtain a transit visa when passing through the UK to another destination. We have been monitoring the situation and have found evidence that some Jamaican nationals have attempted to exploit the visa-free transit concession to enter and remain in the UK illegally. The requirement for a transit visa will take effect from 3 March.</p>

<a name="90209-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="0902092000028"></a>The visa waiver test is ongoing. We will conduct a full review in due course to ensure that benefits are fully realised and costs understood. In the mean time we will continue to work with all these countries and regions to build on the excellent working relationships we have developed during the visa waiver test process to make sure we effectively secure the UK border.</p>

Currently, the Public Prosecution Service requires the police to submit a file in every case in which an investigation has produced evidence that an identifiable person has committed a criminal offence. What is required to be included in the file depends upon the nature of the police recommendation and a full file is required only where that recommendation is for prosecution. These arrangements are currently under review and consideration is being given to a number of options that may improve delivery of criminal justice without undermining the integrity and fairness of the process that is essential for public confidence to be maintained.</p>

The reduction in VAT produced a small increase in the net toll revenues in December. This means that the total revenue defined under the concession agreement will be met slightly earlier than anticipated. As such SRC has not gained any additional revenue. Revised toll levels for 2009 have now been set below the level of annual inflation to reflect the recent reduction in the rate of VAT.</p>
