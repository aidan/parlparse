<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What proposals they have to establish a defence exports scrutiny committee.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, during the passage of the then Export Control Bill, the Government were unable to accept my noble friend's proposal for a defence exports scrutiny committee to undertake prior scrutiny of export licence application. The Secretary of State has therefore not put forward any proposals, but inter-departmental discussions are taking place to see whether we can take additional steps to achieve greater accountability and transparency in the export licensing process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, the discussions have gone on for 12 months and nothing has happened. Does my noble friend recall that 311 elected Members of Parliament in another place supported the Motion calling for the committee to be set up? Why can we not have more rapid decision-taking on such matters?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the discussions have been taken forward by the Cabinet Office. We should be able to report on them in the summer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, do the Government believe that there should be wider scrutiny of the global defence trade? Do they have any policy on the offset trade that is part of most arms deals today?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, as I said, we are keen to see greater transparency and accountability in the process. That is why we are having the discussions. Offset is a different issue that needs to be considered in a different way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, the Minister talked about greater transparency, which I am sure that everyone wants in all kinds of deals. However, does he agree that there would be a risk to the commercial confidentiality of potential purchasers as <P>


<a name="column_118"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 118</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>well as of exporters? It would need to be handled very carefully to make sure that they did not take their business elsewhere.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, when we turned the proposal for a defence exports scrutiny committee down during our discussions on the then Export Control Bill, we gave three main reasons why we did not think it appropriate. The third was that there was a danger that it would give rise to legal difficulties, cause delay and possibly compromise confidentiality without necessarily improving the quality of decisions. That was a key consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, do the Government accept that the record is somewhat depressing? Have we not seen too often weapons and ammunition that we have exported used against either civilian populations or even our own military forces?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, everyone agrees that the control of arms is extremely difficult. However, I do not think that our record is depressing. On the whole, there has been very close control in what are difficult circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, are any defence export orders outstanding for Indonesia? In view of the fact that the Indonesian Government have refused to give an undertaking that it will not use the Hawks and Scorpions with which we supplied them in the past in the civil conflict in Aceh, will the Government not consider some means whereby Parliament can scrutinise the orders outstanding for that country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I am not aware of what discussions are taking place, and I will write to the noble Lord on that point. However, I should point out that the discussions are confidential until an export licence is given or not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend will know that the Quadripartite Select Committee in another place, which has a great interest in such matters, recently produced a further report. What does he think of its latest findings on the recommendation that was made last year?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid to say that I have not read the report in great detail. I will go back and read it very carefully and give my noble friend an answer.


<a name="30610-01_head1"></a><H3><center>National Service Framework for Children </center></H3>
<P>

<a name="30610-01_time0"></a><H5>2.41 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spopq1"></A><B> Baroness Massey of Darwen </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What progress they have made on developing the National Service Framework for Children.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, the first set of children's national service framework documents was <P>


<a name="column_119"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>published on 10th April. It includes the standard for hospital services&#151;the first standard of the NSF&#151;which emphasises the importance of shaping hospital services around the child, and an emerging-findings consultation document setting out the direction of travel for the NSF. A draft standard for child protection was included with the documents for consultation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Massey of Darwen: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that encouraging reply. Will she expand on it by saying when the rest of the framework will be published and how it will fit into the overall NHS Plan?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   Yes, my Lords. The full NSF will be published in 2004. It is the most complex of the national service frameworks. It includes eight working groups covering health and ill-health of children and all aspects of care. More than 300 different stakeholders are involved, and a great deal of hard work has already gone into producing the first standard.
<P>

<a name="30610-01_para0"></a>Essentially, the framework offers a new way of looking at not only services, but children, and will mean that NHS and care staff are looking for new ways of approaching their working, and even for new attitudes towards children. It fits into the NHS Plan&#151;it is central to it&#151;and will benefit from other measures such as emergency care and improving patient access, which will also lift the NHS.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, how do these proposals fit in with the Laming conclusions and the establishment of multi-agency children's trusts at local level?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, it is important that we get all this together and that it is consistent. The NSF has a working party which is looking at vulnerable children. That includes children in care. As regards the Laming report, certain action has already been taken. I refer, for example, to improved guidance. The response to the report will be published soon. We are waiting for that in relation to the Green Paper on children at risk to help inform the NSF. Therefore, it is extremely important that all this works together.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, there has been an increase in the incidence of diabetes in children, especially diabetes number two. Will such children fall under the NSF for children, or that for diabetes, or both?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, the beauty of the NSF for children is that it covers all conditions in all children, including the wellbeing of children. We are therefore looking at healthy children, too. They will certainly fall under the external working group that is looking at ill health in children and also under the diabetes framework.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister be clearer about the parameters of the <P>


<a name="column_120"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 120</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>national service framework? She hinted that it involves not just the NHS but many other issues, too. Does not that cross over into education and so forth? Can she be clearer about that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, as the framework deals with wellbeing as well as health, it involves the care of children. Of the eight external working groups, some are looking at vulnerable children. That involves children in care and young carers. Obviously, a good deal of work is being done on ways of improving care services to those young people and that means working closely with the Department for Education and Science as well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   My Lords, how will the framework address the needs of children with disabilities? Will it be focused on the needs of the children or will there be cost constraints?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, an external working group is dealing with children with disabilities. It has already made its report and it is on the website. That is informing the standard for improvement which will emerge.
<P>

<a name="30610-01_para1"></a>Furthermore, the hospital standard, which was published in April, contains a good section on children with disabilities. The particularly impressive aspect of it is that it uses accessible language to express the importance of treating the child as a human being and of treating the whole child. It is also important to involve the parents in becoming the carers and the experts around the child.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-01_spnew23"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, in case other noble Lords are as ignorant as I am, will the Minister tell the House precisely what is wrong with the National Health Service treatment of children that is making this provision necessary? What will the overall cost be and what is currently happening?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030610/text/30610-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that there is much wrong with the way we are treating children. We have expert and excellent services for children in the NHS, but the national service frameworks enable us to look across the whole provision of care and see how we can improve joint working, co-ordination and processes and investigate the organisation of staffing and the development of staff roles. They enable us to look at improving and raising standards so that they are more effective and coherent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister recognise in what she has said that while there are many good services for children there are huge gaps in provision as regards, for instance, children's mental health and the workforce needed to provide that service? Does she agree that the national service framework is an opportunity for us to think more strategically and carefully in the long term about how to ensure that our children receive the vital input from good quality mental health services?
<P>


<a name="column_121"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-02_para0"></a>Will she also explain to the House what progress has been made in mapping mental health services for children? Can she confirm that that mapping will be a continuing process so that we can be well advised on the availability of and access to child and adolescent mental health services?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl put it very well. Of course we can do much better, and mental health services for children is one such area. It is a relatively neglected area, which is why we are investing £250 million in it over the next three years. The crucial issue in improving the service is to improve the manpower. The noble Earl is right in indicating that we need to develop a new approach to planning the workforce. We are mapping mental health services and will continue to do so as part of our national strategy. But we need also to find new ways for staff to work, earlier identification and more effective services. We have set up a group of experts specifically to look at those issues and the practical measures that can be taken in terms of training and recruitment at all levels.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, how does this National Framework Service for Children fit in with other initiatives which are already under way? The Minister mentioned the Green Paper on children at risk.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, April 10th was a good day for children and it shows how much we are doing. Apart from the Green Paper, we have all kinds of separate initiatives; for example, Sure Start, a children's taskforce looking at a great deal across health and the action programme on inequalities in health, which is extremely important in terms of improving services for children. Much is therefore happening and I hope that we shall see it all coming together.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, during our recent debate on the trafficking of children, the Minister's noble friend admitted that more than 70 children have disappeared from the care of West Sussex social services. Can she tell us any more about the fate of those children? In the national framework, are the Government looking at this most vulnerable group of children to ensure that the existing inadequate provision is not further weakened?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I shall have to write to the noble Lord on the follow-up to the trafficking of children. Unaccompanied asylum seeking children will certainly be covered by the external working group that is looking at vulnerable children and children in special circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Harrison: </B>   My Lords, in the light of my noble friend's antepenultimate answer, will she be good enough to say what additional resources and funding will be provided to implement the NSF?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I believe that my noble friend is asking about mental health services. If I <P>


<a name="column_122"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>am wrong, perhaps he will correct me. Yes, additional money is being put into mental health services; £250 million is being provided for child and adolescent mental health services which will be used to develop, for example, early intervention programmes and improved training. We hope that we shall be able to shorten some of the delays that are problematic in terms of the provision of psychiatric services for adolescents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that what she said about the wishes of parents in regard to the education and future of their children being respected will be very welcome to the parents of many mentally handicapped children who find that their wishes are totally overridden by local social services, local authorities and others? Often when parents want special schools for their children they are directed towards mainstream schooling against the wishes of those parents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, throughout the NSF great effort is being made to consult children and parents; for example, the National Children's Bureau has set up 14 consultative opportunities to listen to children.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Barnett </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Further to the answer by the Baroness Scotland of Asthal on 19th May (HL Deb, col. 495), whether the Prime Minister's future statement will include the issue of whether there will be a House of Lords reform Bill in this Parliament.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  My Lords, as I said in answer to the noble Lord's previous Question, the Government are now considering their response to the report from the Joint Committee of both Houses on the way forward on reform of your Lordships' House. We shall have to address the question and timing of any further reform Bill as part of our deliberations. We hope to be able to publish our response within the normal two-month deadline.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to my noble friend for having tabled this Question again. She did not answer, I am sure inadvertently, some of the points put to her. At the time she told the House that the Prime Minister was to make a statement shortly&#151;that was three weeks ago. Perhaps she could define "shortly". Is it fair to assume that we shall not have a House of Lords reform Bill this Session, or even the next? In those circumstances, when can we expect to see a list of new working Peers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I note that the noble Lord now asks me four questions. As on the previous occasion, he seeks to tempt me into error. Let <P>


<a name="column_123"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>me answer as directly as I am able. First, "shortly" is, as "shortly" says, as soon as reasonably practicable. Secondly, whether it will be in this Session or next I am not able to say. All I can say is that these matters are being given anxious consideration. They will be addressed in the response that I know that your Lordships anxiously await.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, will the Government bear in mind that your Lordships' House contains many Peers and Peeresses accustomed to various kinds of responsibility such that cannot be found in another place and that, if we were to be democratised, we would become a mere microcosm of another place?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, first, it is our view that this House forms a very important part of the democracy. We are already democratised to that extent. Secondly, it is right that the Peers in this House perform a very wonderful function. We have the advantage of Peeresses visiting the House at certain times, but currently none of them sits on any of the Benches of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether I shall have any greater chance of tempting the noble Baroness than the silver-tongued noble Lord, Lord Barnett. Does the Minister accept that at least we all agreed on one matter in the reform committee and in debates both in this Chamber and in another place; namely, that this House has too many Members?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew16"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   My Lords, what would be the point of fattening us up further and making additional appointments at this stage in defiance of the clearly expressed opposition of the House of Commons to an all-appointed upper House?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I hear what the noble Lord says about there being too many Members. There are those who say that this House is a lean, mean working machine and not one Member will be lost to us. Of course, we have to see what the final resolution will be and the recommendations that will be made. But a tragedy for this House is that in the past two years we have lost 49 of our Members who sat on all Benches. They are sorely missed and there are many who say that they should be replaced.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </B>   My Lords, if the Government are genuinely considering the report from the Joint Committee, particularly in respect of the recommendation that a statutory appointments commission of some kind should be established, why have the Government recently renewed the appointment of the chairman of the present appointments commission?

<P>
<A NAME="30610-02_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I have no confirmation of that matter. I shall repeat what I have said on a number of occasions. The Government are obliged, in the normal way, to give a response to the committee's report within the average time of two months. We shall use our very best endeavours to do just that. I am afraid that we shall all have to await the outcome of that response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, given the weight of legislation that now arrives in this House from another place completely unscrutinised and very often even undebated, is it not time for the Government to consider seriously a reform of the House of Commons, particularly as regards the number of Members of Parliament and whether it can still be justified to have over 650 Members sitting in that House?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, thankfully, I can say that that is not a matter for me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Weatherill: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the Minister is aware that earlier in the year I introduced a Bill that was&#151;I am sure she will agree&#151;designed to be helpful to the Government. Will that Bill have the Government's support?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I have to reply in the way in which I have replied the whole afternoon. Those are matters that the Government will take into account. We shall take those matters into account and respond when we respond&#151;shortly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Boston of Faversham: </B>   My Lords, as the Minister has told your Lordships that Her Majesty's Government are giving these matters anxious consideration, can she say what is the nature of that anxiety?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, to do that which is right for this country. We hope that we shall discharge our duty in the exemplary manner in which we have done so far.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes: </B>   My Lords, if the Government still do not know the way forward, can the noble Baroness say why they started down the road in the first place?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, we have known the way forward. It is right to say that this House is now in good order. An argument has raged backwards and forwards in this House and elsewhere as to what the next step is. That matter is under consideration. The committee has helped us and we are deliberating on our response, which, as is quite clear from the debate today, your Lordships' House is most anxious to hear. I am sure that all those responsible will take keen note of this debate.

<P>

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister for Trade   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, there is no decision in principle about all European Union matters. That the next European treaty will be dealt with through our system of parliamentary democracy is entirely consistent with the way in which all previous EU treaties have been laid before Parliament and subjected to vigorous scrutiny and debate by Parliament before ratification. I look forward to that debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Renton of Mount Harry: </B>   Yes, my Lords, quite. I think that noble Lords will share my view that it will be difficult to forget the pained look on the Prime Minister's face yesterday and his anxious consideration as he listened to the Chancellor put pro-euro trimmings on to an anti-euro speech.
<P>

<a name="30610-03_para0"></a>In that context, does the Minister accept that, whatever happened in the past, the new European convention to be announced this Friday potentially has greater political implications for this country than the debate on the five economic tests? On that basis, does she accept the view that we need an extensive public debate on the issue, not just a lot of propaganda from either side or phobic fury? Because of that, will the Minister at least keep an open mind about the possibility, if there is to be a paving Bill for a referendum, that the referendum should first be on the new European convention and then on joining the euro?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I cannot agree that the political implications of the discussions going on at the convention are of greater moment for us than a decision about the euro. The euro is a once-in-a-lifetime decision. The discussions in the convention at present have not yet been completed. We hope that they will be completed towards the end of next week and that the convention findings will then be published at the end of next week. But, as the noble Lord will know, thereafter there will be an IGC, at which a unanimous decision will have to be taken about the way forward, and, after that, the drafting of any treaty.
<P>

<a name="30610-03_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, has got rather ahead of himself on the issue. We cannot judge what the implications will be, first, until the convention reports, secondly, until an IGC unanimously decides the way forward, and, thirdly, until there is ratification on a treaty. It would be sensible to look at the issues then.

<FONT SIZE=3>Government's reluctance to commit themselves to a referendum on the convention and its proposals at this stage. But why has the door to a referendum on possible constitutional developments been closed completely for all time? I would be grateful if the noble Baroness could explain that mystery. Why is it being closed when it is almost certain that there will be constitutional implications of some kind from the convention, when eight other member states will have referenda, and when Brussels officials say that the forthcoming constitutional treaty will be more important than Amsterdam, Nice and Maastricht combined? Why is the door being closed so soon?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I deliberately did not close the door on all possible changes ever. That is why I said in the first sentence of my Answer that there was no decision in principle about all European Union matters. But I must say to the noble Lord that this Government today are as reluctant as the party opposite was when it was in government to have a referendum on the Single European Act or the Maastricht Treaty.
<P>

<a name="30610-03_para2"></a>I have been subject to a little insomnia recently, and I have done some very interesting night-time reading. I was reading a biography, from which I shall quote:

<a name="30610-03_para4"></a> The Prime Minister or the Foreign Secretary did not say that; it was the former Deputy Prime Minister, Michael Heseltine, now the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, leaving aside the fact that the Oxford English Dictionary states that the correct plural of "referendum" is "referendums" and not "referenda", which is a gerundive rather than a gerund, did my noble friend hear the interview given by Kenneth Clarke on "The World at One" on 27th May? He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If parliament can't analyse the ultimate version of this treaty, which we all knew was going to come once we enlarged the union, then parliament isn't much use for anything".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-03_para5"></a> Is that not entirely consistent with what the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, said in his interview in the Financial Times a couple of days later? He said:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Referendums should be a rare exception if we are not to weaken still further our system of parliamentary democracy".

</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="30610-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to my noble friend for his guidance on the use of "referenda" and "referendums". I did not hear "The World at One" on 27th May. I suspect that I was preparing for Questions in your Lordships' House on that occasion. I agree with what Mr Clarke and the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, said. We have a sophisticated system of parliamentary democracy in this country. It has been my experience, when debating in your Lordships' House the treaties that have gone <P>


<a name="column_127"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>through&#151;the Nice Treaty and, before that, the Amsterdam Treaty&#151;that they attract a great deal of very knowledgeable discussion. I believe that it is through that parliamentary debate that we shall find a way forward on any possible future treaty coming out of an IGC.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it is no longer satisfactory to contemplate the prospect of a referendum vis-a-vis the convention in isolation, and that it must be considered in context? Is it not true that the political context in this country of matters relating to sovereignty in the European Union is of profound public mistrust about the manner in which Parliament has dealt, and continues to deal, with those matters? Is it not fair to say that there is a constant sniping match, a partisan battle, going on between the Conservative and Labour parties about who has done worst vis-a-vis the holding of referendums? Will not the Government please seriously contemplate how public trust in government in this country can be restored, perhaps by having a referendum on the convention, in view of the crucial importance of the issues to the future of this country in Europe?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I am bound to say that, if the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, thinks that a debate on a referendum would of itself stop parties arguing about who has done better and worst, I am afraid that we live in very different political worlds. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, was right in saying that there must be a public debate. There should be a public debate about all matters European. Indeed, that is what the convention is being designed to do. It is why we have had parliamentary representatives as well as government ones. We have been well represented in this House in that respect. Doing this through our parliamentary democracy on the basis, in the other House, of those who are elected, and, in this House, of people with considerable experience, is the right way forward for this country.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister help me by saying what are the political tests that the Government decided to apply when considering whether the British people have their say on any question? We know that referenda will be allowed for local mayors and regional assemblies. The Minister said that the EMU was a once-in-a-lifetime change. Can we take it, therefore, that if the European convention's work results in a once-in-a-lifetime change, there will then be a referendum? What are the criteria? For some of us, it is beginning to look as if there is a political test of whether the Government get the voters to say what they want to hear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   No, my Lords. The question is whether the issues that we are confronting significantly change how the people of this country are governed. That is the political test. It is appropriate that the resulting new treaty is scrutinised vigorously by Parliament in the way that I have <P>


<a name="column_128"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>indicated. In contrast, the noble Lord raises the issues of devolution for Scotland and Wales, or perhaps the creation of regional elected assemblies or mayors. Those are changes in how this country is governed by putting in an extra layer of government; therefore, it was deemed appropriate that there should be regional or local referenda about whether that was appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30610-04_para0"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, pointed out last week, on the question of the euro, the Conservative Party also said that, had it been in government when the euro question would have been considered, that is the view that it would have taken and there would have been a referendum then. On this question, we do not believe that the outcome of an IGC will fundamentally affect how the people of this country are governed. It will certainly have no more effect than any of the other treaties on which the other side of the House did not hold a referendum.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Tomlinson: </B>   My Lords, would my noble friend not find it much more helpful if, rather than call for a referendum on an outcome that is as yet unknown because the IGC has not yet begun, those with so many views to express on the process of ratification said something about the substance once in a while?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I believe that that would be enormously helpful. I would point out that, of the many opportunities that have been put forward in order to allow Members to do so, not all Members have been as enthusiastic as they might have been to take up those opportunities.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, the restructuring plan announced on 28th November last year is British Energy's plan, not the Government's. The bulk of British Energy's reported loss announced on 3rd June is made up of write-downs in the value of its generation plants. The write-downs are based by the company on the expected future cash flows of the business and consequently have already been taken into account when considering the ongoing viability of the business. Significant progress has been made but the proposed restructuring remains subject to uncertainties, and, therefore, the Government remain prepared for administration.

<P>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>and the Conservative Benches expressed concern that the liabilities taken over by the Government from British Energy should be, as far as possible, limited, and that the provision of other support should be used for the purposes defined. As the noble Lord gave certain assurances during the passage of the Bill, will he confirm that they still stand in spite of the recent worsened results?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I give that assurance. As these are essentially write-downs of fixed assets, they do not affect the liabilities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, reminds us that it is only two months since we took the Bill through this House. The Government were at the time quite confident that the sums they were prepared to lend to the company would be sufficient to see it through, provided that a restructuring was approved by the competition authorities and the European Union. Is it not now looking much less likely that the competition authorities will smile upon that help as an acceptable state aid given the enormous opposition from many other people active in the electricity market?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, no. The situation on state aid is no different from that which we expected, namely, that the Commission would formally investigate and that it would probably take nearly to the 18-month time limit. That is proceeding as we expected.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-04_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister concede that one of the difficulties in the sale of Amergen, which was required in the restructuring, is that potential purchasers are aware from numerous government statements that that is a key part of the financial support scheme? British Energy in that respect is at an enormous negotiating disadvantage. Do the Government see any way around that? Do they have any ideas about what should be done given that that company was always going to be required to be sold?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness makes an important point. That is why, even though the deadline of 30th June when the company thought it would sell Amergen has passed&#151;well, it has not passed but it looks unlikely at this point that British Energy will enter into an agreement by that time&#151;we have not insisted on it. That makes for a different situation where the company is not being required to sell under any conditions but has some latitude which will strengthen its bargaining power.

<P>

<a name="30610-04_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I apologise as I have pulled off the sticker where it said "speech" in my file, just as I was clipping the file to find where I am starting. We need a better quality of sticker in the department. We have obviously been economising with government money.
<P>

<a name="30610-04_para9"></a>I am satisfied that the draft regulations are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. They form a small, but nonetheless essential, part of the legislative framework for pension credit.
<P>

<a name="30610-04_para10"></a>Regulation 2 amends the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 to provide, in relation to pension credit, that there shall be no right of appeal against decisions made pursuant to Regulations 4D, 4E and 26B of the Claims and Payments Regulations. Regulation 4D specifies that a claim for pension credit need not be made in writing but if it is, the claim must be made on an authorised form or in such other written form as the Secretary of State accepts as sufficient in any particular case; and, <P>


<a name="column_131"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is not valid unless a written statement of the claimant's circumstances, provided by the Secretary of State, is approved by the claimant.
<P>

<a name="30610-04_para11"></a>Regulation 4E provides that a person may make a claim for pension credit at any time within the period of four months before the reaching the age of 60.
<P>

<a name="30610-04_para12"></a>Regulation 26B prescribes the time and manner of payments of state pension credit.
<P>

<a name="30610-04_para13"></a>The requirements as to what constitutes a valid claim for pension credit purposes are less prescriptive than those which currently apply to income support under Regulation 4 of the Claims and Payments Regulations. Most notably, Regulation 4D does not include a requirement that supporting information and evidence must be included with the claim before it can be considered to be valid. The absence of a right of appeal against decisions regarding the validity of claims for pension credit is in line with the position regarding appeals against decisions concerning the validity of claims for other for benefits across the benefit system.
<P>

<a name="30610-04_para14"></a>I emphasise that the decisions in question do not concern the amount of money to which a person is entitled&#151;that remains subject to appeal, or the valid date. A claimant's income or capital and the amount that they receive and from when remain open to appeal. However, if a person failed to send in the form, or to leave substantial areas of questions unanswered, they would not have a valid claim, and that would not be an appealable decision.
<P>

<a name="30610-04_para15"></a>Regulation 3 amends the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 2001 to preclude a second right of appeal where a local authority uses the Pension Service's calculation or estimate of income for housing or council tax Benefit purposes. That would not, of course, affect the original right of appeal against the original pension credit decision. The rationale is that it would be simply unfair to allow people who claim housing benefit or council tax benefit a second right of appeal against the original pension credit decision regarding their income. As your Lordships will know, the decision for pension credit purposes for income is passported, so to speak, over to the housing authorities. That is why we do not need two parallel paths of appeal.
<P>

<a name="30610-04_para16"></a>The regulations are essentially technical, and I commend them to the House. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30610-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Baroness on this occasion, as on many others, for a clear exposition&#151;despite being initially lost for words&#151;of the issues involved in the regulations. More generally, as far as concerns work and pensions matters, it is extraordinary that the Minister for Pensions, who was whisked away into a Labour Party job, has, months afterwards, still not been replaced. One can assume only that the Prime <P>


<a name="column_132"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister can think of no one in the House of Commons who might reasonably fulfil that task. That being so, there is a strong case, given the noble Baroness's enormous expertise in these matters and the helpful attitude that she always adopts, for moving the job to this House.
<P>

<a name="30610-05_para0"></a>I have one or two questions for the noble Baroness. The first is about consultation on the regulations. We are told that consultation has taken place with organisations appearing to the Secretary of State to be representative of the authorities concerned, but we are not given a clear indication of how widespread it has been. Similarly, we are told that there has been consultation with regard to the Council on Tribunals. The explanatory memorandum explains why that was necessary, but we are not told which issues were referred or what conclusions were reached as a result of the consultation with the Council on Tribunals. Is the council now satisfied that the regulations are appropriate?
<P>

<a name="30610-05_para1"></a>We are told that the Government have agreed with the Social Security Advisory Committee that the proposals need not be referred to the committee for further consultation. Every time that the issue of the Social Security Advisory Committee comes up, it seems to be the case that it or the Government&#151;or both&#151;have decided that it need not consider the matter. I have great difficulty in remembering any occasion since I have been in this post on which it has been consulted on anything. The committee seems to have an uncertain role in such matters. Perhaps I misjudge the situation.
<P>

<a name="30610-05_para2"></a>Other than that, I have only one or two points to make, and I would be grateful if the noble Baroness could explain them to us. We are told that Regulation 2 does not contain a right of appeal because that is the case for regulations in other parts of the social security framework. That does not explain, in the first place, why there is no such appropriate arrangement.
<P>

<a name="30610-05_para3"></a>With regard to Regulation 3, we are told that there is no right of appeal at the stage at which housing benefits and other benefits are considered because the decision on the amount of income and the amount of capital that is applicable in the case has already been made by the Secretary of State at the stage at which the claim was made for council tax benefit. To what extent would it be clear to the claimant that, if he wished to dispute the income or capital assessment, he must do so at the stage at which the claim is initially made and will not be able to do at the stage at which the local authority is concerned with the housing benefit situation? There seems to be a case for not necessarily saying that someone could not come back at the latter stage, when the housing benefit was being considered. The individual concerned may not fully understand the procedures, which are not as simple for claimants as one might wish.
<P>


<a name="column_133"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-05_para4"></a>Other than that, I think that the noble Baroness made things clear, and I have nothing to add. On balance, the amendments are, as she says, technical and sensible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   My Lords, I join the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, in his assessment of the position in the Cabinet and in his comments about the noble Baroness. I add my weight to her campaign for a better quality of stationery in the future.
<P>

<a name="30610-05_para5"></a>I shall concentrate on many of the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, but shall deal with them slightly differently. My questions are coloured by the fact that, as part of my work&#151;I declare an interest as an employee of Age Concern&#151;I see information and advice officers struggling to get to grips with the forthcoming introduction of the pension credit. Therefore, I was particularly interested in what the noble Baroness said about the lack of a right of appeal with regard to what is widely acknowledged to be a complex form.
<P>

<a name="30610-05_para6"></a>I recall that we deliberated at some length on the original legislation, and the noble Baroness said that she was confident that a great deal of the uptake would be electronic. I had some concerns about that at the time, and I spoke accordingly. In view of what has been said of late about the department's computers, I was right then. I am even more concerned about it now. Can the noble Baroness shed some light on the extent to which computerisation and training of claimants for computerisation has been taken forward?
<P>

<a name="30610-05_para7"></a>The noble Baroness was right about Regulation 3 and the fact that there should be no right to appeal twice. However, like the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, I would like to know what will be done to ensure that users know at the point at which a pension credit decision is made that there will almost certainly be implications for housing benefit and council tax benefit and what they will be able to dispute.
<P>

<a name="30610-05_para8"></a>As usual, I was interested in the issue of consultation. According to the Library notes, there was no consultation on Regulation 2. In view of some of the issues that I mentioned, I would like to know what consultation there has been with prospective users on the matters. Finally, can the noble Baroness, in her pitch for a new job, go slightly further than the dry matter of regulations and say something about the training programme for the administration of the pension credit forms? It seems to be causing widespread concern among practitioners.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am glad that the regulations have been welcomed today. As the comments made have been finely honed, I shall respond to them directly.
<P>

<a name="30610-05_para9"></a>It would be fair to say that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, basically raised two questions: one about the consultation exercise and one about the provision of information to claimants for housing benefit under Regulation 3. On the question of consultation, I can say that the Council on Tribunals was content with our <P>


<a name="column_134"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regulations and had no comment. The noble Lord also raised a general point about how often the Social Security Advisory Committee was consulted. It is required to be involved if regulations are coming into the public domain at least six months after the legislative procedure has completed. Partly as a result of pressure from the noble Lord, I have been able, on behalf of my department, to bring regulations before the House while legislation was going through. That has obviated some of what the committee has done in the past, and it could be said that previous administrations may have been more dilatory about bringing forward regulations for scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="30610-05_para10"></a>There was a substantive point about the Social Security Advisory Committee. It shared the noble Lord's concern that claimants might not appreciate that the Pension Service's assessment of income and capital could have an effect on their entitlement to HB and CTB. That concern was rightly emphasised today by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. He is right to say that it is important that pensioners know that that is where the decision has been taken that, for example, having capital of £16,500 might rule them out for HB purposes. The department has undertaken to include warning of that and full information about it in the pension credit notification as soon as is practicable. Obviously, I will do my best to keep an eye on it and make sure that the information is clear and unambiguous, so that people realise that it is a passported statement of information for the next set of regulations.
<P>

<a name="30610-05_para11"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, made various points, but the substantive point, I think, related to our degree of confidence about the introduction of the pension credit system in October. She was worried about the word "electronic". I believe that "electronic" includes telephone. We are expecting people to apply originally by telephone. We do not expect there to be&#151;I hope that I am not wrong&#151;any particular issues that we have not foreseen as regards the introduction of pension credit. First, we are not using a new computer; we are using a tried and tested existing computer. Secondly, we are having a graduated take-on approach. Thirdly, the pension credit is a simple system; it is not a more complex system. Given all of that, we believe that we have anticipated where there may be the inevitable problems associated with the development and extension of an important service to many people.
<P>

<a name="30610-05_para12"></a>As regards the telephone service, we are expecting that up until October people will apply by telephone. They will still then receive a written confirmation of that exchange which they then sign. So there is written confirmation. We found from research that elderly people, in particular if they do not have family members to support them, prefer discussion over the phone. It is the best way of ensuring that one has the relevant information on the form. In the past, MIG forms which have been filled out on paper have had to go to and fro because the elderly person has not understood the import of a specific question. The system is designed to be helpful. We have no reason to think that it is not. However, if the organisation with <P>

Is it proposed that the individual will be told by telephone the calculation of their income and capital which will then go on the form? It will be difficult for many people to understand that.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I understand that the information will be discussed with the elderly person on the telephone. That will come through to the department which will then send it out. It may be able to give immediate guidance on whether someone obviously is or is not eligible. But the claim will come when the person has received a written statement of the agreed circumstances. That will constitute the claim. However, the first step is by telephone.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para0"></a>From October, pensioners need not go through that telephone stage if they do not wish to do so. Anyone currently on MIG will go through automatically. The steps for the savings credit will be strange because they are new. People will have had an opportunity for discussion on whether or not they may be eligible and to understand concepts such as income, capital and so on. I have no reason to think that it is not the most supportive way to reduce the hassle factor and extend the reach of what I think will be an important benefit.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para1"></a>The noble Baroness pressed me about staff training. Again, if she has any worries, I ask her to let me know. I have had no suggestion&#151;but it is early days&#151;that staff training is inadequate or incomplete. Nor have I any worries at present about the adequacy or otherwise of the computer system or the forms. We are working closely with Age Concern, Help the Aged, CAB and other organisations. We have a fairly long lead-in period between now and October. If problems begin to emerge, I trust that we will have in place the proper responses to overcome those difficulties. I hope that your Lordships will accept the regulations.

<P>

<a name="30610-06_para4"></a>I move these draft regulations which implement provisions of the European Community's Employment Directive 2000/78 so far as it deals with disability discrimination. The regulations would <P>


<a name="column_136"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amend and extend provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 concerning discrimination against disabled people in the fields of work and vocational training. I emphasise that that is what the directive is concerned with. They also make consequential amendments to the Disability Rights Commission Act 1999 and other legislation.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para5"></a>As I explain what the regulations do, it may be helpful if I cross-refer back to the original text. Unlike the previous measure where there just two regulations, we have 30 here. Noble Lords may have to turn many pages. It will sound more technical than it need but I thought that that might be the most helpful approach.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para6"></a>While the draft regulations implement the disability provisions of a European directive, I remind the House that many of the main requirements were foreshadowed by the Disability Rights Task Force. The task force's work assisted the Government during negotiations on the directive. It helped us to identify those elements of the DDA, such as reasonable adjustments, that worked and needed to be retained; and those elements, such as current employment exemptions, which needed to change.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para7"></a>The draft regulations implement the majority of the disability provisions of the directive. I shall later state what is not included. If approved, they will bring into force those provisions in October 2004, more than two years in advance of the final date required by the directive. By going through this procedure, we are ensuring that a major swathe is securely banked in our legislative system by October 2004. It is good news in terms of employment and vocational training for disabled people.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para8"></a>I can also confirm that in my view the draft regulations are compatible with the UK's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para9"></a>The draft regulations make a number of significant and far-reaching changes to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 which will have a marked effect on society and disabled people. They repeal Section 7 of the DDA so as to end the current exemption of small employers. That is the biggest single change in the regulations. Over 1 million small employers will be brought into coverage of the DDA. Employees and people seeking work in those firms will be protected if they have, or have had, a disability. That is Regulation 7.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para10"></a>Secondly, the regulations bring within the scope of the DDA excluded occupations. Groups of occupations which have not so far enjoyed the protection of the DDA come in. We are covering many occupations such as the police, barristers and Scottish advocates, partners in business partnerships and persons who are not technically employees because they hold an office, including people whom the Government appoint to public offices. Regulation 5 deals with office holders. Regulation 6 deals with partnership. Regulation 8 deals with barristers and advocates. Regulation 24 relates to non-Home Department police forces, prison officers and fire-fighters. Regulation 25 relates to national police force. Regulation 27 deals with employment on board ships, <P>


<a name="column_137"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>aircraft or hovercraft. If any noble Lord wishes, I can give the cross-references back to the DDA legislation but I do not wish to complicate matters further.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para11"></a>Those are the two major changes: the extension of the DDA so that all employers are covered; and the extension to a range of occupations. The only significant exclusion now is the Armed Forces&#151;an issue raised by your Lordships on several occasions.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para12"></a>The draft regulations make other significant changes. They outlaw direct discrimination, including prejudicial treatment of disabled people and most blanket bans. But employers need not employ anyone who is not competent, capable or available to perform the essential functions of the job in question after any necessary reasonable adjustment has been made. Obviously, we are not talking about the usual criticisms relating to blind bus drivers, and so forth. We are talking about people being able, competent and capable of performing the essential functions of the job.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para13"></a>Regulation 4 defines discrimination. Regulation 5 applies it to employers, contract workers and office holders. Later regulations apply it to other areas of employment and training. The regulations also end the current DDA approach that allows an employer to justify a failure to make a reasonable adjustment. Those are Regulations 4 and 5. What is new is that they bring practical work experience placements within the scope of the DDA. This is an important constituent, for example, of the New Deal for younger and older people&#151;that is, practical work experience. Under Regulation 13, it now comes within the scope of the DDA.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para14"></a>Regulation 15 extends the DDA's protection to claims by former employees about discrimination arising from former employment. The point about that is that someone may be seeking to appeal against what in popular language we might consider to be constructive dismissal. Equally, if his employment has finished, it would be absurd if his right of appeal terminated with that employment. Therefore, there is a shadow effect that issues relating to previous employment may still be available and covered. Hence, we have Regulation 15.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para15"></a>The regulations ensure that advertisements that indicate an intention to discriminate against disabled people are unlawful. They also ensure that the DRC will be able to bring an action against those who place the advertisements for publication. That is the effect of Regulations 15 and 16. The regulations also introduce into the DDA specific provisions to ensure that harassment against disabled people is unlawful&#151;again, this is new. Regulation 4 defines harassment and subsequent regulations dealing with specific types of occupation make it unlawful; for example, Regulation 5 applies to employment, contract workers and office holders.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para16"></a>The regulations also extend Part 2 of the DDA to "qualifications bodies"&#151;namely, those which can confer a professional or trade qualification, such as the General Medical Council and the Law Society. In earlier discussions with, I believe, DRC, the phrase <P>


<a name="column_138"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>"qualifying bodies" was often used. We have now replaced that with "qualifications bodies" in order to make it more clear.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para17"></a>Given that description, I turn now to what the draft regulations do not do. The draft regulations are not a poor man's disability Bill. They are a further step towards meeting our manifesto commitment to extend rights and opportunities for disabled people. Because they are made under Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, they have the same status as primary legislation. They deliver the same outcomes, but they are securely bound in our law with effect from October 2004.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para18"></a>As I say, there are two important issues that the draft regulations do not cover. First, they do not implement the directive in so far as it applies to disability discrimination in occupational pensions schemes by trustees or managers of those schemes. It does not apply to occupational pensions. Adverse selection or even, in commercial terms, positive selection in terms of determining annuity rates would be an obvious example. We will lay separate regulations later this year on that issue after we have had further discussions with the Disability Rights Commission and the pensions industry. Both sides&#151;the DRC and the pensions industry&#151;accept that these are complicated measures which require a great deal of additional work. As far as I am aware, there appears to be no criticism of the Government for exempting that area of coverage&#151;yet.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para19"></a>Secondly, Ministers in the Department for Education and Skills intend to bring forward separate proposals for regulations to implement any changes required by the directive in relation to Part 4 of the Disability Discrimination Act. These would be brought into place after the duties placed on educational institutions by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 have been fully implemented in September 2005. The second exclusion is those areas that overlap with and need to be contextualised by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001. Again, I think that your Lordships will understand the point of that.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para20"></a>In conclusion, the draft regulations introduce meaningful and worthwhile changes to the employment provisions of the DDA. Every small employer in the country will be covered. More than 1 million more employers will be included in the DDA. Seven million additional jobs and 600,000 disabled people in those jobs will be protected. This is a major advance in rights at work for disabled people.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para21"></a>The draft regulations are the next step towards meeting our manifesto commitment to extend rights and opportunities for disabled people. Further significant changes should flow from our draft disability Bill that we expect to publish later this year. As I said at the start, we have discussed the need to improve civil rights&#151;above all, in the field of employment&#151;for disabled people on many occasions. These draft regulations do precisely that. I hope that they will be warmly welcomed by the House today. I commend the order to the House. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for the helpful and wonderfully clear way in which she has introduced these regulations, and taken us through the detail. I welcome them enormously, although, as the noble Baroness has already said, I fear that they are not as comprehensive in scope as they need to be to implement the EU employment directive in full. I understand that the Disability Rights Commission says that the occupational pension scheme is a very complicated area. I welcome the assurance that the noble Baroness will try to sort something out in that respect. I look forward, with anticipation, to the DfES regulations.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para23"></a>The removal of the small employers exemption&#151;Regulation 7&#151;and extension of the DDA to a much wider range of employment situations by October 2004 is to be very strongly welcomed. I shall confine my remarks to two areas that have been of particular interest to me&#151;namely, the qualifications bodies and arrangements for disabled people in work placement schemes.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para24"></a>I am delighted to see that the regulations extend the coverage to qualifications bodies. Disabled students may currently be denied the opportunity to undertake a particular course of study by education institutions because of hurdles erected by some professional bodies. That is quite wrong, as the noble Baroness said. It is absolutely right that these qualification bodies should be required to facilitate opportunities for disabled students and to justify objectively any competence standards they may set. The provisions are complex and would almost warrant their own code of practice as SKILL&#151;the National Bureau for Students with Disabilities, of which I am president&#151;proposed in its response to the first draft of the regulations. I believe that I saw the noble Baroness almost nodding her head in agreement at the complication of the matter.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para25"></a>The wide definition of "qualifications body" seems to suggest that examining boards will be covered by the provisions when awarding a GCSE in maths, for example, which is an essential qualification for so many different professions, particularly teaching. Can the Minister confirm that this is the case? I should like to ask a further question for clarification on the extremely welcome extension of the DDA to disabled people on work placements. Can the Minister explain why new Sections 14C and 14D of the DDA specify that the work placement must be part of a vocational training scheme to be covered by the DDA? The Disability Rights Commission believes this to be too narrow an interpretation of the directive which applies to occupation and vocational training in the broadest sense.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para26"></a>I am concerned that the wording used in the regulations would exclude disabled people undertaking work experience placements, as part of <P>


<a name="column_140"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the New Deal, from the protection of the DDA. Can the Minister explain why the provisions have been cast so narrowly and clarify what types of vocational training programmes will be covered? For example, would a two-week placement as part of a life skills course for people with learning disabilities be included in the provision? The Minister will remember that this House previously expressed the view that all work placements should be covered by the DDA&#151;indeed, we passed an amendment to that effect last year to the Disability Discrimination (Amendment) Bill, introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke.
<P>

<a name="30610-06_para27"></a>In conclusion, in many respects these regulations cannot come soon enough, but there remain the one or two issues that the noble Baroness mentioned in relation to employment protection and equal career opportunities which I look forward to being satisfactorily addressed in the near future. In the mean time, I warmly welcome the regulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, I have one regret to express about these regulations&#151;that is, that it has taken so long for the Government to get around to them. It was always scandalous that millions of workers should be excluded from the protection of the Disability Discrimination Act. One million employers and some 7 million workers were excluded from such protection. The Conservative government made a great mistake when they made the provision for any firm employing fewer than 20 workers to be excluded from the provisions of the Act. The Labour Government brought that figure down to 15, missing a great chance. They acted too timidly by making it 15 instead of zero. All this time has been wasted. It has been perfectly legal to discriminate against vulnerable workers. There is no excuse for that and no reason why the Government should not have acted before.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para0"></a>Having said that, they have now acted, and I congratulate my noble friend because we have been at cross purposes on this issue for a very long time. I suggested changing the regulations. I am not saying that we are clashing on this, but the Government did not do what we wanted in good time. The All-Party Disability Group will be delighted that these provisions have now been brought forward by my noble friend.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para1"></a>I warmly congratulate the Government. The regulations will be a great relief to millions of workers and they will have an enormous beneficial effect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I, too, very much welcome these regulations. Within the limits of the powers conferred by Section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972, to which I shall return in a moment, they are exceptionally well drafted.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para2"></a>The Minister will know of my main criticism, in which I am not alone. I was the sponsor of the single Equality Bill, which went through the House, and which received commendation from more than 220 Members of Parliament in an Early-Day Motion. It brought together the most modern, coherent and accessible legislation on disability discrimination as one Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_141"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para3"></a>I shall continue to believe that the Government made an important strategic mistake in deciding to proceed using subordinate legislation under the European Communities Act 1972, instead of introducing a primary Bill that could have dealt in one go with the imperfections in the Disability Discrimination Act. Unfortunately, the Government did not take that decision. There was a poverty of ambition and perhaps a lack of basic skill in the decision-taking process.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para4"></a>Although the regulations are very well conceived within the tightly boned corset of European Community law, the Government will have to legislate again and again in this and other areas of discrimination law. We shall be treated tomorrow to regulations on race discrimination, and next week to religion and sexual orientation discrimination, all of which will be under different regulations, and all of which will add to the incoherence and opaqueness of the overall scheme. One needs to be almost a rocket scientist to appreciate the law, but it does not have to be that way.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para5"></a>I very much believe&#151;and hope&#151;that in two or three years a future Government will clear up the mess that Parliament is being compelled to make by passing incremental legislation by delegated legislation.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para6"></a>Having said all that, I do not take away from what I said at the beginning. The regulations in their own terms are most welcome. I hope that when the Government produce a draft Bill to reform the Disability Discrimination Act, they may take a leaf from the Equality Bill that was included as a result of suggestions made by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, and others. I am referring to the very narrow definition of disability, especially when dealing with mental disability. I was persuaded that that definition needs to be widened.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para7"></a>I understand why that cannot be done in these regulations, as it would affect areas that are not covered by EU law. But it is a good example of why we need to have either a Disability Discrimination Act, which deals with all of this in one place, or an Equality Act that includes disability discrimination within it. We should not have this kind of creeping mess of legislation, for which the Minister is not responsible, as I am sure that it is not her decision to proceed in a piecemeal way.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para8"></a>I hope that my remarks do not take away from my welcome of the regulations and the expertise involved. The drafter of the regulations must be outstanding&#151;I believe that she was a member of my chambers. I very much hope that she will be employed in drafting a single Equality Bill sooner rather than later.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Wilkins: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her clear explanation of the regulations, which will be widely welcomed, including by many employers. They will extend civil rights to some 600,000 disabled people who are working in jobs that are currently excluded from the DDA and will strengthen the career and employment opportunities for all disabled people.
<P>


<a name="column_142"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 142</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para9"></a>However, it is argued by the Disability Rights Commission and others that the regulations do not go far enough towards full implementation of the EU employment directive, nor do they do enough to tackle systemic discrimination. Moreover, many key changes required in the employment field, including numerous outstanding recommendations of the disability rights task force, will need to be made by primary legislation, as pointed out by the commission. Disabled people are anxious that the Government press on with those, too. There is growing unease at the delay in bringing forward the promised draft disability Bill and a desire not to lose momentum on civil rights, especially in view of moves towards a single equality body.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para10"></a>One of the undoubted benefits of the regulations is the introduction of the concept of direct discrimination in the Disability Discrimination Act. This means that there will be no possible justification when a disabled person with similar abilities to a non-disabled person receives less favourable treatment by an employer on grounds of disability. It will clearly outlaw prejudicial treatment imposed simply because a person is disabled, such as a blanket ban on employing people with a particular disability.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para11"></a>However, an equally pressing issue is discrimination against disabled job applicants and employees on the basis of medical reports that are tainted by prejudicial assumptions. Recent case law has demonstrated how assumptions made by health professionals about disabled people can be used to justify discriminatory treatment. Can the Minister assure the House that it will no longer be justifiable to refuse employment to a disabled person because of reliance on a medical report, which is based on assumptions about a disabled person, without adequate consideration of the individual's abilities or the impact of the impairment in that particular case?
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para12"></a>Finally, one area of concern that appears not to have been addressed by the regulations is the lack of protection for those who face discrimination because they are falsely perceived to be disabled, or because of an association with a disabled person. A recent example of this involved a secretary whose child had cerebral palsy and who felt pressured into leaving her job because of her employer's attitude.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para13"></a>Under the employment directive the right to equal treatment is not limited to the person who is disabled. Rather, discrimination occurs when someone is treated less favourably than another on grounds of disability. Surely the DDA must be extended to cover discrimination by association, or on the basis of perceived disability to comply with the directive.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para14"></a>Can the Minister assure the House that this matter will be addressed alongside other much needed changes to the definition of disability, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said, in the forthcoming disability Bill?
<P>

<a name="30610-07_time0"></a><H5>4 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, my comments on these regulations can be summed up as an excellent refit of an obsolete ship. We all said that the Disability <P>


<a name="column_143"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Discrimination Act 1995 did not go far enough, but that it broke new ground. It was much more important that the Act stated that discimination was something that we should not have, rather than what the Act did.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para15"></a>There was the appalling provision that the Act did not cover an employer with 20 or fewer employees. The noble Baroness can certainly take some credit as being the person who eventually removed that provision, but it meant that vast sections of the workplace were not touched by the legislation. The appallingly long run-in time and so on has meant that many of the intended effects of the Bill have not worked. But it was a first step and, effectively, this very limited framework is now, for the first time, reasonably coherent.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para16"></a>But there are still holes. I wonder why the Armed Forces have to be excluded. The defence of reasonableness and the fact that a person has to be competent to do a job means that the Armed Forces would not have to take someone who could not fulfil a basic function. But those are battles for another day. The Bill is now as it should have been originally&#151;a limited vessel in the field of disability. But we have still not gone far enough.
<P>

<a name="30610-07_para17"></a>The Minister is on very good form. Another analogy that comes to mind is that she is someone who has come with a good hand and played it very well. She is now saying that a draft Bill is coming along through which we shall be able to address many of the points raised by my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-07_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, to be clear, I said that we expect to publish a draft Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, well played and well defended. But the Government are at least saying, "We must look wider and go further. We are addressing the problem".
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para0"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, said, since we started off this process it has taken a long time to get here. I have always had one ambition in regard to disability rights&#151;that is, to be able to put up my feet and say, "Well, that is that dealt with for at least the foreseeable future". That dream comes a little closer with the passing of the regulations and the tone of what the Minister said today. I hope that my crystal ball gazing will prove to be correct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, as has been shown by the short debate, we are all extremely grateful to the Minister for her introduction of these incredibly complicated regulations. They are so complicated that it took me many hours with a cold towel to achieve even a modest appreciation of what they are getting at.
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para1"></a>I was, as always, pleased to see the copious commentary memorandum that the Minister's department invariably provides on these occasions. Those noble Lords who have not seen it will perhaps <P>


<a name="column_144"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not be surprised to learn, after the Minister's introduction and the debates we have had, that it runs to 66 pages of A4 paper&#151;almost twice as long as the regulations themselves.
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para2"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lester, that the regulations are a masterpiece of the draftsman's art. As the noble Baroness said, they implement a part, and only a part&#151;the subject of some of your Lordships' moans today&#151;of the EU directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. The Minister says that two more orders flowing from that directive are to come. She did not say when. It may be that she does not know, but, if she does, perhaps she will let the House know.
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para3"></a>The regulations today are concerned solely with disabled people and are made, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said, under paragraph 2 of Schedule 2 to the European Communities Act 1972. Indeed, I do not believe that the Disability Discrimination Act permits the kind of wholesale revision encompassed by the regulations. A quick glance reveals that we have, in effect, a completely new Act. Part 1 remains the same but Part 2 is now to start with two new sections defining what is meant by "discrimination" and "harassments". Sections 4, 5 and 6 disappear and are replaced by new Sections 4 and 6. In passing, what on earth has happened to Section 5? I am sure it is buried in there somewhere and that I will come to it.
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para4"></a>The new Section 4 extends the provisions of the Act to agencies providing contract workers, which is clearly an overdue reform. The CBI was consulted a few months ago and raised no objection to this, to the new coverage of policemen, fire fighters, partners, barristers and advocates, or to the reformation&#151;reformulation, perhaps I should say&#151;of Sections 13 to 15 regarding trade and professional bodies, qualifications bodies and organisations carrying out practical work experience.
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para5"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy, said, this matter seems to be only partially covered in the regulations&#151;for example, when the trainee is the direct employee of the firm providing the training&#151;but if agencies can be covered so far as concerns contract workers and part-time workers, surely educational institutes, colleges of further education and so on could also be covered.
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para6"></a>The Minister rightly highlighted the fact that the regulations will also apply the Act to small businesses&#151;to those, as the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, pointed out, with fewer than 15 employees&#151;for the first time. This derogation, I believe, was invented because of affordability so far as small businesses are concerned. It was contained in Section 7 of the original Act, which is now swept away. Can the Minister tell us how she expects this to work in practice; about the employer's duty to make practical adjustments for disabled people; and at what cost?
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para7"></a>I know that the Federation of Small Businesses has been lobbying the Treasury for tax credits to help small employers make the necessary adjustments for disabled employees and has received a dusty answer. I confess that I am not surprised. If the Government <P>


<a name="column_145"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 145</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>want the provision to work, as I do, being involved in a small business myself&#151; and, indeed, as we all do&#151;they must provide some kind of help. If tax credits are not the answer, will the Inland Revenue allow a 100 per cent write-off of the necessary expenditure in the annual accounts?
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para8"></a>Why was Section 9, which pertains to the validity of certain agreements, repealed? It is a provision which strengthens the Act, not weakens it. The Explanatory Memorandum states that it has been replaced&#151;but where? I said this was complicated, but I have totally failed to find it. That exemplifies my criticism of the regulations.
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para9"></a>In my examination of what the regulations do, I have reached only the middle. I shall not weary the House by describing the other changes and additions that have been made. But that is not all: the regulations also renumber and move around those parts of the Act that remain. How are firms and lawyers&#151;even officials&#151;now to refer quickly to what they require? It is a nightmare of legislation by reference.
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para10"></a>We desperately need a Keeling schedule for the whole Act, as it will be. It does not need to be statutory but I challenge the Minister to produce one. This is very important legislation. Reference has been made to the fact that the Secretary of State said earlier this year&#151;as did the Minister today&#151;that the department would publish a draft disability Bill later this year. We are now half-way through the year and it has become a fairly long promise. Can the Minister tell the House what progress has been made? Will it include the Disability Discrimination Act as amended? If a Keeling schedule is not appropriate, that most certainly would be.
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para11"></a>We have no objections to the regulations in principle. Disabled people are people first, disabled second. We who are fortunate to be able bodied, should, as far as humanly possible, bend over backwards to allow them, according to their abilities, to enjoy the same rights and privileges that we enjoy. They are, for example, twice as likely as the able bodied to be unemployed, which is not a satisfactory arrangement. That inevitably means helping them to enjoy the dignity of work and not putting obstacles in their way. With a little thought and care, this can be overcome. Alas, we still in live a society that requires the law to enforce what needs to be done. It is too tempting for employers to discriminate against disabled people. Their very disabilities are discriminatory enough. I commend the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, for presenting the regulations to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted that the regulations have received such a warm welcome from all sides of the House. I am very grateful. Even with the reservations expressed, which I shall address, I am delighted that everyone has recognised the decency of the Government's response in incorporating into British law two years ahead of the statutory requirement such a major extension of disability rights. It gives me particular pleasure for <P>


<a name="column_146"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>once to have the uncritical&#151;although I know it will continue to be demanding&#151;support of my noble friend Lord Ashley.
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para12"></a>I shall seek to address some of the comments. I may need to reply in writing on technical points about why some matters are in the regulations and some are not. The noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, raised first qualification bodies. She was concerned that the DDA protection would not extend to bodies associated with GCSEs and A-levels. Our view is that examining bodies such as those for accountancy, law, the Bar Council, and accredited examination bodies that test competencies such as those for gas fitters under the Corgi principles are qualification bodies within the meaning of the regulations.
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para13"></a>However, GCSEs and A-levels are not professional or trade qualifications within the meaning of the regulations. The regulations are work-related and employment focused. Examining bodies will not be covered by the qualification bodies provision when awarding those qualifications. Those qualifications represent a general standard of achievement in secondary education and do not themselves qualify for a particular trade or profession. The test already laid down by the court of appeal in case law under similar provisions in the Race Relations Act is whether the body is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"similar to authorities which are empowered to grant qualifications or recognition for the purpose of practising a profession, calling, trade or activity".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-08_para14"></a><P>

<a name="30610-08_para15"></a>While GSCE or A-levels may be the means, they are not part of the qualification under the regulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   My Lords, I gave the example of GCSE maths because one would need it in order to qualify for the professional qualification. It is part of it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes, my Lords, but I do not see how we could make a distinction between those people taking GSCE maths because it might subsequently be a qualification for a job and those for whom it would not be. It is clear that the regulations are focused on work-related and professional qualifications. I shall turn to work placements in a moment.
<P>

<a name="30610-08_para16"></a>If the noble Baroness has any reason to believe that areas of GCSEs or A-levels systematically discriminate against disabled people, let us have a look at that; I shall draw it to the attention of my colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills. That may be a more practical way. The regulations are about employment criteria, which is why, within the meaning of the law as I understand it, GCSEs and A-levels would not be covered.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   My Lords, I will communicate with Skill and see if we can progress on the issue. I thank the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness's second point, about work placement and vocational training, was related. She felt, as did the <P>


<a name="column_147"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, that the description of work placements was possibly too narrowly drawn. I accept that these are difficult lines to draw and I am not saying that we have necessarily got it absolutely right&#151;the provision may in future have to be revisited&#151;but we are again trying to get placements that relate directly to work and work experience.
<P>

<a name="30610-09_para0"></a>That would mean that we are not, in this context, covering placements about enlarging life skills. For example, someone volunteering to work in a charity shop would not necessarily be covered under the regulations where it was part of getting them back into the ordinary life-flow of mixing with other people and so on. It would not be work-related. We are focusing on work placements that are directly work-related by analogy with our previous discussion about professional qualifications.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister leaves that point I wonder whether she will help me. We all know that the employers carrying out the training are not at fault because, due to their normal activities, they are already covered by the DDA. The gap appears to be for those people who seek out employers to create placements for training. I am advised, like the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, that such organisations are not covered by the regulations. Is that correct?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-09_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, it depends on the example the noble Lord has in mind. In some cases it would not be reasonable in terms of the push of the regulations&#151;as opposed to the wider framework of a disability Bill. I am thinking on my feet so if I am misleading the House I apologise in advance. Say that someone had suffered from agoraphobia and had difficulties in leaving the house, but with a great deal of support and encouragement was able to do a couple of hours' placement in a charity shop, not because they were acquiring work skills, but because they were beginning to address some of the issues associated with their general health.
<P>

<a name="30610-09_para1"></a>My understanding is that such a life-skills situation&#151;which might be preparatory for a subsequent appropriate work-skills placement, perhaps involving learning IT skills and so on&#151;would not be covered; nor is it intended to be covered. That would make the regulations too widely drawn. I am not saying that this is the last word on the matter, but that is our current distinction: whether something is directly related to work preparation or work placement as opposed to more general life experience activity, which would not be covered by employment focused regulations.
<P>

<a name="30610-09_para2"></a>If the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, wishes to come back with specific examples I shall check with our lawyers our understanding of whether they would be covered. That might be the most helpful way forward. It is difficult for me to speculate in advance on how the regulations will come into effect.
<P>

<a name="30610-09_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester, complimented our lawyer on the drafting of the regulations. I am sure that that is completely unconnected with the fact that the <P>


<a name="column_148"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>person concerned served in the noble Lord's chambers. I agree that it is a model of drafting that will be of help to us all. However, I disagree with his general approach of wanting a "big bang". I understand the arguments about Keeling schedules and the like. Having been involved in disability issues for some 15 years, from my experience perception issues change over time and there needs to be an incremental response.
<P>

<a name="30610-09_para4"></a>The noble Lord went on to say that this should be part of a big bang single equality Bill, brigaded with issues of discrimination on the grounds of age, sex and race, for example. I am not sure that I accept that intellectually. Disability is very different. All of us are one sex or the other; all of us have an age, for which we may experience discrimination in one area or the other; all of us have a race, for which we may be discriminated against. That is not true for disability. Only some people experience discrimination by virtue of their disability. The rest of us would not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, of course I recognise that one-solution-fits-all makes no sense for different kinds of discrimination, but that does not mean that one cannot have accessible, user-friendly and intelligible legislation. Does the Minister agree that the problem of using Section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 is that it is a tight corset that prevents the Government using subordinate legislation to tackle the wider problems of disability discrimination raised by noble Lords today? Would she also therefore agree that we must aim for a single disability discrimination Act? That is not a Utopian aim. It does not matter whether it is part of an equality Act or not, but in the words of the Labour Party's 1997 manifesto it should tackle,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unjustifiable discrimination wherever it exists".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-09_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30610-09_para6"></a>Can we therefore take the sensible suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and do what a Labour government did with the Equal Pay Act 1970 when we amended it in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975? In future disability discrimination legislation, we should have something like a Keeling schedule, stating the whole of disability discrimination law in one place. In that way, lawyers such as myself would not unjustly enrich ourselves by having to deal with complicated problems that do not need to be complicated and are complicated only because of the way in which the Government choose to legislate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I do not seek to engage the noble Lord about the "corset" European Communities Act 1972. He has far more experience than I do on the matter, and I would not wish to use such words about something that is beyond my reach.
<P>

<a name="30610-09_para7"></a>As for bringing together these regulations, the DDA and any possible subsequent Bill or rewriting in a Keeling schedule, I must take advice on the matter. I have not been advised on it and do not know about the practicalities. If it involved parliamentary counsel, as such things tend to, we could arrive at a situation <P>


<a name="column_149"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>where parliamentary counsel's time was displaced from primary legislation to pursue the matter. Therefore, there is a resource implication.
<P>

<a name="30610-09_para8"></a>I take the point that we need to make the law clear and accessible, but I need to take advice on the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I realise that it would take primary legislation, that it could not be done otherwise and that Ministers have no power to do it under Section 2 of the European Communities Act. I am simply saying that I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. In a future Act, we should have one Act and not a whole series.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-09_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I understood that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, was agreeing with the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale.
<P>

<a name="30610-09_para9"></a>On the more general point about discrimination, I find it hard to conceive of a situation in which race was a relevant consideration in terms of an employment field. I can conceive, following the arguments we have had, of the acceptance we all share that competence must be relevant, and the ability to do the job is relevant to someone who has a disability. That is why the broad-brush approach would not necessarily be appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30610-09_para10"></a>I turn to the points raised by my noble friend Lady Wilkins. She raised the question about direct discrimination regulations and asked what might happen if an employer sought to discriminate on grounds of stereotype rather than the merits of the individual. We believe that that is covered by the direct discrimination rules we have already discussed. Our regulations ensure that direct disability discrimination and failure to make reasonable adjustments cannot be justified. It is for the tribunal courts to decide whether discrimination has occurred in a particular situation.
<P>

<a name="30610-09_para11"></a>The changes we are making will ensure that a disabled person, faced with the situation that my noble friend described, could bring a successful DDA case. I refer to situations in which an employer refuses to employ someone simply because of prejudiced and generalised assumptions. If, for example, someone had a history of depression and it was said that they could not do their job because it meant engaging with the public, that might well be a case of prima facie direct discrimination. The employer might rely on a statement by an occupational health adviser, who would have no knowledge of the person's individual circumstances. The adviser might decide that all people with clinical depression have terrible mood swings and therefore they cannot deal with the public and should not be employed in a call centre, for example. That would count as direct discrimination and would be covered in that situation.
<P>

<a name="30610-09_para12"></a>I do not know whether that sufficiently answers the point made by my noble friend Lady Wilkins. Obviously, such a case would have to be tested at law, but our understanding is that the proposals on direct discrimination should cover the situations put to us by the DRC and those put by my noble friend today. If we need to qualify that, I shall come back to her.
<P>


<a name="column_150"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-09_para13"></a>My noble friend also raised the question of false perception. The problem is that we are trying to deal with an objective assessment, not the employer's state of mind. The example that she gave was covered more by her situation as a carer for a disabled person than as a disabled person herself. Therefore, as things currently stand, that would not come within the framework of the legislation or the directive. If, however, someone discriminated against another person because they believed falsely that that person had a disability that rendered them incapable, that would not be covered. Such a situation would relate to the employer's state of mind, and we have to deal with the objective facts of disability.
<P>

<a name="30610-09_para14"></a>That brings us into the area of perception, which has been discussed under previous disability Bills. We have tried to stay in the territory that the person carrying the disability has to have the disability for the discrimination to be valid. It cannot rest on the assumption that the employer has false information in his mind. The classic example is when employers assume that a person must have HIV because he is living in a gay relationship and that therefore they can discriminate against that person. The individual involved might not have HIV, but he would be able to deal with the discrimination through other means, such as sexual orientation. That is the distinction we make in such situations.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030610/text/30610-10.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I do not agree with that distinction. I do not agree that one can confine disability discrimination in a narrow way to whether a person is in fact disabled rather than whether there is a false assumption that he is disabled. That is why it is sensible to have a single equality Act&#151;because, in relation to sexual or race discrimination, arguments of that kind would not pass muster. I want to make it clear that I do not agree with the Government in that respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I do not quite see how a false perception of sexuality could influence and come into dispute in a situation of employment. There is an issue for disability. I gave the example of HIV of a false assumption associated with a person's lifestyle. If an employer objected to that and had that false perception, that person would not have protection under DDA because he would not be disabled. We are operating not within the field of the state of mind of the employer but on the disability that the person discriminated against actually has. It would be difficult for us to test the employer's state of mind in such a situation.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para0"></a>We have had these debates for many years. I took part in similar debates in 1975. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, disagrees, but I do not see a read-across with sex or race legislation, because the sex or race of a person is somewhat unambiguous&#151;even if it were relevant to employment situations, which for the most part it is not.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para1"></a>Finally, I turn to the point about costs raised by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. My understanding is that the overall costs to employers will be of the order <P>


<a name="column_151"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of £6.7 million. The average business costs will be £6 per business and, in addition, there will be costs to the taxpayer of some £500,000 through the costs of employment tribunals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, it would help if the Minister could tell me whether those are ongoing or start-up costs in that adaptations to workplaces have to be made to employ disabled people. On the whole, that would be a one-off cost.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, there is a one-off cost of £4 million in terms of awareness and guidance for employers, with some additional costs for recruiting and advertising. The overall costs include that, and we expect that to be around £6.7 million. Much of the cost of adaptation and so on is already covered by the current access to work funding. It has tripled in real terms to about £47 million a year since 1997. My best advice is that we expect the ongoing costs to employers to be about £6 per unit.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para2"></a>Employers are not being asked to adapt premises and so on in advance of any disabled person seeking employment with them. There is no general duty, for example, to produce the ramp in a building in advance. In that case, the noble Lord would be absolutely right that there would be fairly high, up-front, one-off costs.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para3"></a>The costs&#151;and many benefits, obviously&#151;come with the arrival of the disabled person. That is why the distinction between one-off and ongoing costs is not necessarily a real one. There will be modest one-off costs for advertising, disability awareness and so on, but the building costs are part of the ongoing and adaptation costs, because they come with the arrival of the disabled person. My experience has been that very often help with those moneys is available from the access to work fund, which is why the costs seem as low as they do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, with regard to the implication of excessive costs for employers, does my noble friend agree that all that the Act says is that employers should not discriminate against disabled people? It also says that costs must be reasonable&#151;that only reasonable action must be taken. So the question of unreasonable costs is quite out of order, according to the Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-10_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is right. Obviously, such adjustments may involve no cost at all. A classic example is adjusting the hours of work. Another is moving the filing cabinets around. In the United States the average adjustment for small businesses was minute, which is why the figures are as low as they are. As my noble friend says, this is simply to look at one side of the equation and to ignore the benefits, particularly in the workplace and subsequently in other areas not covered by the directives&#151;disabled people being able to access goods and services and thus expand the country's economic base.
<P>


<a name="column_152"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 152</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked me about the Keeling schedule. I shall write to him about that, because it is an important issue and we have the legal resources of the department. I understand where the noble Lord is coming from.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para5"></a>The noble Lord also asked what we are doing about the two areas of exemption that are not being carried forward in the regulations. One concerns pensions and the other the special education needs educational material. We expect&#151;with health warnings attached&#151;that we may be able to come forward with provisions concerning disabled people in occupational pensions in the autumn. That is the best advice that I have; I cannot be more specific.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para6"></a>I cannot tell the noble Lord about the education matter, because that is still being worked on within the Department for Education and Skills. Given the directives, we are required by Europe to have these provisions in place by 2006. That is the broad brush description of the situation. I hope that we can advance on that timetable.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para7"></a>I apologise for the complexity of the regulations. I accept that they are extremely difficult. I am grateful that your Lordships thought that the explanation was as helpful as we could make it. Above all, I am delighted, as I am sure all of your Lordships are, that the regulations will represent a sizeable advance in the rights at work for disabled people. The numbers&#151;a million businesses, 600,000 disabled people and 7 million jobs&#151;are huge. This is probably the biggest single advance for disabled people, many of whom find the best employment situations in the small family-run firms. This will rightly be a major extension of opportunities for disabled people, from which not just they but all of us will benefit.

<a name="30610-10_para9"></a>The noble Earl said: The emphasis of the report is very much on "external implications", because the committee looked specifically at the implications that this rather unexpectedly massive reform of the common agricultural policy will have on trade liberalisation, the applicant countries to the European Union and developing countries&#151;and, indeed, on our commitment to the Doha development round.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para10"></a>I start by declaring an interest as a farmer and by saying how grateful Sub-Committee D was to its specialist adviser, Mr Brian Gardner, who has been involved for many years with tracking the common agricultural policy and matters agricultural in Brussels. As always, we are also deeply grateful to our Clerk, Mr Tom Radice.

<P>

<a name="30610-10_para11"></a>The common agricultural policy has been in existence since the early 1960s. It is recognised that its focus for much of its existence has been on achieving a fair standard of living for agricultural producers, and of course also achieving food security. Basically, in so far as the subsidies over many years were to try to obtain a fair standard of living for agricultural producers, the CAP was singularly ineffective. Subsidies have failed to stop farm incomes from declining relative to those of the rest of the population. Price support is a relatively inefficient way of bolstering farm incomes. The OECD estimates that for every 4 dollars spent on subsidies, farm incomes go up by only 1 dollar. Therefore, it is not surprising that farm incomes seem not to have benefited from the considerable costs of the common agricultural policy.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para12"></a>That fact was recognised by MacSharry in the early 1990s, in that the reforms of 1992 cost more: they cost 13 billion euros for direct subsidies to compensate for 6 billion euros of market intervention costs. Nevertheless, it was a helpful introduction. It was seen as a way of establishing a programme, which it was hoped would continue for some years, for scaling down support, increasing the competitiveness of European agriculture and targeting state subvention on income support for the less-favoured sectors of the rural population.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para13"></a>The Berlin Council of March 1999 was part of this progression; the Agenda 2000 reforms of the CAP came out of the Berlin Council. This introduced the rural development regulation, which was widely welcomed and which is known as the second pillar of the CAP. The Berlin Council further lowered market support.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para14"></a>Nevertheless, the outcome was deeply disappointing to many countries, particularly to the UK Government and others. The reformists recognised that the Commission's objectives had been railroaded, the reforms being nothing like as far-reaching as had been hoped.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para15"></a>One concession was that there should be a mid-term review, and that is precisely what we are now conducting. The debate comes on the eve of the critical meeting of the Council of Ministers; it meets tomorrow, I think, and I have no doubt that it will be meeting for several days afterwards, because this is indeed, unlike what was expected at the time the concession was made in Berlin, turning out to be a major reform. For that, Commissioner Fischler and other commissioners deserve congratulations on the radical nature of the original proposals of June 2002, which was the subject of our report.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para16"></a>By January 2003 seven draft Council regulations had been published by the Commission, which retained the thrust of the original proposals but also embraced significant changes, partly in modulation and partly in dairy reform and other aspects. Nevertheless, it can be seen that the pressure exerted on the Commission has been, as in Berlin, to reduce the effectiveness of its radical proposals. If there is any doubt about the strength of the opposition from the majority of the Council of Ministers, I would refer the <P>


<a name="column_154"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>House to box 4 of our report, a letter to the Financial Times from a number of Ministers. I shall quote one sentence which is apposite to our report:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Some also claim that the CAP is responsible for causing hunger in developing countries. Nothing could be further from the truth".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para17"></a>That is breathtaking complacency. Certainly, that bald assertion is not borne out by the evidence that we took.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para18"></a>As I said, the mid-term review is much more ambitious in its programme of changes. I remind the House that it introduced decoupling&#151;the single income payment based on crop subsidy payments received over a period in the past. That is, indeed, a truly radical step and very important as it removes the incentive to produce more in order to get more grant. It gives hope that we can reconcile the common agricultural policy with something which might be compatible with the Doha development round and with other free trade movements.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para19"></a>Although decoupling is widely to be welcomed, I am very nervous of the concept of partial decoupling, which may well be the sort of fudge that comes out of the Council this week. We shall have to see whether that materialises. While the CAP continues to offer support&#151;the amount of money that continues to be offered to the existing 15 member states is by no means insignificant at 40 billion euros or more&#151;there will be higher production as a result, but, as I say, farmers are no longer incentivised to produce more.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para20"></a>We have to recognise that European farmers are doing astonishingly well out of the proposal. It is a long way from the sort of proposal that MacSharry might have expected to come forward at this stage of the reform. I have seen one analysis which suggests that United Kingdom farm income might benefit significantly from the total package, possibly by up to half a billion pounds a year. Economists can run those figures in all sorts of directions, and I do not wish to be held to that, but I nevertheless make the point that once you get a single payment without having to produce any more or any less, you are in a position of much greater flexibility. We have to bear in mind that European farmers are lucky to get that very generous support.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para21"></a>The support is to be modulated, which is European Union jargon for saying that it will be cut over a period. But, again, the more recent proposals have slightly modified those degressive cuts, and they will effectively not start for three years. It will take up to 10 years for them finally to hit.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para22"></a>As regards cross-compliance, one may think that it is not an unreasonable proposal that if one is going to get these massive payments there should be a degree of environmental and other compliance. However, it is fair to say that while it is extremely important to audit these payments, there is a danger that a bureaucratic nightmare may emerge. It is by no means clear whether there will be robust, simple proposals which would prevent that happening.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para23"></a>I believe that noble Lords would agree that, building on the Berlin initiative of the second pillar rural development budget, the measures that we are <P>


<a name="column_155"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discussing should be grabbed immediately as it gives an opportunity to use the CAP to benefit the rural economy and widen the base of support. As I say, it disentangles us from the difficulties we have with the WTO and others.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para24"></a>I refer to changes in the dairy policy, some of which are extremely unhelpful. One of the latest proposals in January this year was that the quotas should continue until 2014. Try to reconcile that with the message to European farmers to be more competitive. Quotas are a way of providing a pension for people who have given up producing. You have to buy or lease someone else's quota if you want to expand or if you are a new entrant. That is highly unhelpful and, so far as I am concerned, unexpected.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para25"></a>There is a reduction in EC skimmed milk prices. It is calculated in the Government's response that by 2008&#150;09 skimmed milk prices might be consistent with world market prices, although butter prices still remain 12 per cent higher. That step must be welcomed, if not the speed with which it is being implemented. Paragraph 67 of the report states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Jamaica's skim milk powder imports from the EU have almost quadrupled during the past 10 years . . . These imports have been used largely to replace fresh milk originally supplied from local farms".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para26"></a>That is an example of how the European Union's subsidised exports undermine the local economies of countries with a far lower standard of living than our own. I am absolutely clear in my own mind that European farmers do not want and do not expect to have a form of support which undermines others who are far less capable of coping with this unfair competition.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para27"></a>I say again that Commissioner Fischler is to be congratulated on having put forward ambitious proposals, which were certainly not expected by the majority of Council members, particularly on decoupling most of the support from production.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para28"></a>Having said all that, it would be churlish to say that that is not good enough, but that is effectively what our report says. I recognise that the following proposal is totally unrealistic given that the majority of the Council of Ministers is so traditionalist and defensive of the support that has been provided for so long, but nevertheless it is important that we look at the remaining dairy export subsidies so far as impacts on the third world are concerned. Reform of the sugar regime will also have to be tackled.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para29"></a>We considered the accession countries and recognised that, had the reform been completed before they joined the Union, there would not have been any need to compensate them for support that they never had in the first place. But that is effectively what will happen. It would be far more appropriate for the rural development budget of pillar two to tackle such problems as rural social cohesion. We regret that the reform has taken so long to be determined and that some of the applicant countries are already putting in place all the worst aspects of the CAP. I fear that the <P>


<a name="column_156"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>lobby in the Council of Ministers which supports the traditional CAP will be strengthened in part by the stance taken by the applicant countries.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para30"></a>But the wider issue is the need to reconcile support for European agriculture with our responsibilities to developing countries and trade liberalisation. I quote from the recent report on globalisation of your Lordships' Select Committee on Economic Affairs, which states at paragraph 76:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We consider that developed countries' protectionism (mainly in the United States and the European Union) with regard to agricultural and textile products in particular is wholly objectionable and unjustifiable: developed countries' protectionism places an unfair burden on developing countries and is in stark contrast to the protestations of the leaders of the rich nations that they are committed to helping the world's poor".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para31"></a>We were particularly concerned at the level of import duty on processed food, for example, chocolate.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para32"></a>Let us make no mistake. European farmers are entitled to a common agricultural policy which assists them to move progressively from a heavily protected to a more competitive environment. The case for rewarding farmers' contributions to food security, countryside stewardship, food safety, the rural economy and much else is self-evident, but the question is how one has a policy which makes good sense to the taxpayer and which fulfils our obligations to the developing world and, for that matter, to the applicant countries. In recognising that the CAP reform is very much more generous than would have been expected some years ago, it is perfectly possible to take out its objectionable elements and to leave in place support which will reward European farmers justly for what they deliver.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para33"></a>Logically, once you have moved funds from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2, you will not need to have import tariffs or to subsidise exports. The trouble is that we see a very modest movement of funds to Pillar 2, and that is really the burden of our report. Having come up with the strategy of Pillar 2 in Berlin some years ago, let us now have the courage to fund it properly. Relying on modulation&#151;effectively cutting support that would otherwise have gone to production support, via Pillar 1, and using that for Pillar 2&#151;is not enough. There needs to be a much more imaginative switch of funds. That will prevent agriculture being criticised by the rest of industry in Europe for causing a blockage in trade liberalisation, and preventing all the benefits in terms of employment and national wealth that might accrue from it.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para34"></a>We therefore suggest that payments to farmers should be capped&#151;not a proposal which will go down well in the United Kingdom, because the farmers in the United Kingdom are larger than the average and this impacts on the larger farmers. Equally, if you are to try to distribute money widely and you are relying on modulation only, it will eventually mean that you are short of funds for Pillar 2. Were it possible to do a massive switch without relying on modulation, then perhaps capping would not be necessary either.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para35"></a>The present anachronistic formula of determining what country gets what for Pillar 2 is one of these problems we suffer from in this country where, lacking <P>


<a name="column_157"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matching funding, we do not by any means get what might be considered a due proportion of Pillar 2 funds. I think that we get 9.8 per cent of the EU modulation pot. Clearly this is a further grievance that British farmers rightly have. If they could see more money coming into Pillar 2, which they would bid for competitively, then this would be very much more satisfactory.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para36"></a>European farmers cannot expect their income to be shored up at the expense of third world producers. The mid-term review was a brave, ambitious programme of overdue reform, already diluted and in great danger, I suspect, of being diluted still further this week. The message coming from this debate today to our own Ministers, and to those who support the minority on the Council of Ministers, must at all costs be to ensure that we do not have what happened in Berlin, which was pressure from heads of government and others to dilute very sensible measures coming from the Commission.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para37"></a>I say again, these are measures which are radical, but they are overdue and they deserve our support. They cannot be diluted any further.

<A NAME="30610-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, it is a genuine pleasure to say that I very much welcome this report. I do believe, as we have often thought in the past, that publications by your Lordships' House are so good that they ought to be much more widely disseminated. If the powers-that-be could make it possible to have the 30 pages of the main report issued separately, it would become a very good and informative textbook on how the CAP&#151;I should not say "works", because it does not&#151;affects both the European economy and other economies.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para39"></a>I confess that I find it very hard to speak on the CAP without foaming at the mouth. It makes me angry just to think that it exists, so I shall try to be restrained if I can. The report is a very well-balanced account of all the major defects that the CAP has, and the committee is to be congratulated on the restraint it has shown in telling us what those defects are.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para40"></a>It is a policy which is inefficient in terms of production. It is regressive both among the farmers of Europe and also internationally, as between Europe and the third world. Whenever attempts have been made to reform it, the reforms have been blunted by all sorts of pressures from Ministers in the Council of Ministers.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para41"></a>My noble friend Lord Barnett, speaking in the globalisation debate last week, said that he wished that developed countries could do better regarding subsidies and so on, but he was very pessimistic. He said that democracy is a problem. I do not think that democracy is a problem. After all, farmers do not form a large proportion of the electorate. In terms of its contribution to the total economy, agriculture is not a <P>


<a name="column_158"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>large sector in most of the 15 European economies. Poland is another matter. However, here in Europe and in America agriculture exercises a disproportionate influence on decision-making. It is very hard to understand why that is so. Why we urban consumers tolerate this I do not know. Maybe, after all the subsidy, food is so cheap for us that we cannot be bothered.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para42"></a>The cost of the CAP, as shown in the report&#151; 41 billion euros now, 46 billion euros in 2006, and so on&#151;is a very large cost. Think of it. It more or less equals the total overseas development aid from OECD countries to third world countries. It is about 50 billion dollars. Given the way the exchange rate is moving, there is not much between 45  billion euros and 50 billion dollars. CAP alone costs as much as all of the OECD countries give to the third world.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para43"></a>I am very grateful to the committee for two things: for publishing a glossary of technical terms and also for re-publishing in Box 4 that splendid letter from agriculture Ministers across Europe. It only costs 1 per cent of GDP and they think that is not very much. It is quite a lot.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para44"></a>The logic of the CAP is very clear from the letter. It starts by saying that in the 1960s Europe was not self-sufficient in food. It could have been imported. The whole logic is so opposed to trade&#151;which is a very efficient way of satisfying consumption&#151;that the CAP was constructed as a massive obstacle to liberal trade. It continues to be a massive obstacle to liberal trade, not only in preventing more efficient entrants from exporting to the European Union but also in its dumping effects, again very nicely detailed by the report. In its dumping effects it positively harms the economies of the third world by ruining their chances of entering a liberal, or at least a substantially freer, trade regime.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para45"></a>In a sense, it represents quite a large damaging force in international affairs. I have been quoted as saying that the CAP is a crime against humanity, and I do not mind repeating that. It is the least that one can say about it.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para46"></a>There is a very interesting problem with the reform which is now emerging, as the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, said very succinctly. The Fischler reforms, welcome as they were, have been blunted. Even the blunted reforms are worth having, but they have been greatly blunted. If the Fischler reforms had been put through, we would not have had a complete solution to the bad effects of the CAP, but at least it would have been a beginning.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para47"></a>Decoupling is absolutely essential. It is at the heart of these reforms. It is ironic that, if decoupling happened, UK agriculture would go back to the nice situation we had before we joined the EEC, as it was then, whereby farmers are supported through an income support scheme and not through a scheme tied to production.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para48"></a>I am not sure whether this cross-compliance and Pillar 2 are not seen outside as excuses which the EU has thrown up in order not to reform the CAP. I hope that it is sincere in saying that it will give money for <P>


<a name="column_159"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>environmental improvement, rural development and so on. However, I think that measures on those were thought up to give Mr Pascal Lamy a better case to present at the WTO round in Doha. I am not at all hopeful that good environmental effects will follow, because the measures do not seem as though they will be implemented.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para49"></a>Those are barriers to reform, as the committee says very well in paragraph 74. People trying to export agricultural products to Europe have to meet certain production standards, which are non-tariff barriers. There are non-tariff barriers to entry of products, and barriers, whatever we call them, to reform of the CAP. Those two types of barriers make it very difficult to know which way we will go.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para50"></a>The UK Government have tried very hard to reform the CAP. I hope that our debate and the report itself will strengthen the hand of the Minister. We will have to unite with all the other reforming countries and try once again very hard. As the report states, we should have reform of the CAP before enlargement. We should certainly have not given the newly-entering countries the hope that they would get compensation of anything like the extent of that of the existing CAP. The horse has now bolted, as countries such as Poland very much depend on getting substantial support payments. That will distort their agriculture so much that, when it comes to real reform later, they will say, "We cannot afford reform because that will ruin our agriculture".
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para51"></a>We are in a vicious circle of bad situations. I wish my noble friend, if he is going to Brussels tomorrow, all strength to his elbows and every other part of his body to see that the CAP is reformed. I very much welcome the report.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-10_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </B>   My Lords, the words "reform of the common agricultural policy" tend to elicit from the average British commentator, whether pro-European or Euro-sceptic, a mixture of despair, anger and weary cynicism in about equal measure. Let us hope that those not very useful emotions will be absent from this debate on a report that seems to be calm, rational, compelling in its conclusions, and exceptionally timely as the European Union prepares to enlarge substantially and to engage in the critical phase of the Doha development round of world trade negotiations. The sub-committee and the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, are to be congratulated on their work, as, for the most part, are the Government for their response.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para52"></a>The heart of the report and of the Commission's mid-term review proposals, as others have said, is the breaking of the link between the level of subsidy and the level of agricultural production. It is, after all, that link that has led to the distortion of world agricultural markets, the failure to allow market forces to have any impact on the supply side of the equation, and the undercutting of third world farmers in their own and their prospective export markets by European Union <P>


<a name="column_160"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>producers. It is that link that even now results in the European farm industry, alone among Europe's industries, being protected from the impact of the rising value of the euro against other currencies.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para53"></a>If I may be forgiven for digressing for a moment, I recall that it was a former Leader of the House, Lord Soames who, when he got to the Commission in Brussels in 1973 and was put in charge of the Tokyo round of trade negotiations&#151;I worked for him at the time&#151;first pointed out the urgent need to decouple the subsidisation of farmers from the level of production, thus avoiding the encouragement of surpluses that had to be sold expensively overseas and many of the other trade-distorting effects of the common agricultural policy. He was quite simply laughed to scorn. How could he, a newcomer, be so naive as to suppose that European farmers and their political backers in the Council of Ministers would ever countenance such a revolutionary idea?
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para54"></a>Well, it is an idea whose time has come&#151;better late than never. No doubt attempts will be made in the negotiations that lie ahead, within both the European Union and the World Trade Organisation, to water down the proposals. I hope that the Government will commit themselves to resisting that with all the means at their disposal.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para55"></a>It is surely correct, as the report points out, that the decoupling of production and subsidy is also crucial if the new member states are not to become hooked on the present system, which will then become even more difficult to reform. We must be careful to avoid mixing up the budgetary and trade implications of the Commission's proposals. As others have pointed out, the proposals will not save the European Union's budget much money&#151;perhaps not any at all, at least in the short and medium term. Does that discredit them? I do not believe so.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para56"></a>We must be careful of squeezing the budgetary pips so hard that support for the proposals in the new member states in particular erodes, and we must be aware of budgetary arguments related to the proportion of the EU budget that goes on agriculture. Those arguments have always been pretty spurious given how few major spending policies in Europe are financed out of the European Union budget. After all, we are talking about a proportion of European revenue capped at 1.25 per cent of gross domestic product, and that at a time when each member state is nationally spending a lot more than that on health, education and even, although reluctantly, their armed forces. We will not get common agricultural policy reform on the cheap, but we need it.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para57"></a>If I have a doubt about the Government's approach to the Commission's proposals, it lies in their answer to paragraph 78 of the committee's report, which is on the desirability of capping the amount of income subsidy to individual holdings. I think that I can detect in the Government's negative reaction a flaw that has so often undermined Britain's support for CAP reform in the past; namely, a determination to fight against any distinction between small and large farmers. In my view, that makes neither economic nor tactical sense. <P>


<a name="column_161"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>After all, we do not refuse to make a distinction in many aspects of our fiscal and state-support systems between small and large economic operators. Why not in this case, too?
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para58"></a>The tactical argument is even more compelling. If we devote our efforts and energy to removing what we see as discrimination against large producers, we end up weakening our support for the Commission's reform efforts overall. Alas, that has happened all too often in the past. I hope that the Minister will assure the House that we will not allow it to happen on this occasion.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para59"></a>If I have a doubt about the committee's approach, it lies in the somewhat cursory way in which it handled the issue of sugar, in particular in so far as it affects developing countries. Of course the report is right to underline the need to reform the European Union's internal sugar regime and to reduce the excessive production from beet sugar that results in exports damaging exporters of cane sugar in developing countries.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para60"></a>Another aspect is not touched on in the report much, and is merely hinted at in the testimony offered by the representative of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Secretariat in Brussels, who gave evidence to the committee. That is the very significant contribution that the European Union makes through its purchases of ACP sugar at prices linked to the EU price, and not to the world market price, to the economies of a whole range of developing countries, many of them members of the Commonwealth.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para61"></a>Great care is needed in handling the issue. Not long ago, we saw how abrupt change to free market rules could damage the economy of developing-country banana producers who had relied on privileged access to the European Union market. We should not repeat that experience. Perhaps the Minister will say how the Government propose to reconcile our support for reform of the European Union's internal sugar regime with our commitment to developing-country sugar producers in the ACP, which was a cornerstone of our own terms of accession to the European Union.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para62"></a>The topicality of the debate relates to the decisions to be taken later this week by the EU Council of Ministers on the negotiating mandate in the run-up to the World Trade Organisation's Cancun meeting in the autumn. It is of the greatest importance that that mandate gives the European Union negotiators more flexibility than does the present one. The present one is more of a straitjacket than a mandate. It would be good to hear from the Minister what he thinks the prospects are for a reasonable outcome later this week. Surely one thing needs to be avoided: a botched and inadequate compromise which leaves the European Union unable to provide the World Trade Organisation with the leadership that the European Union's position as the largest world trading power requires of it. Deadlock in the European Union would be regrettable, but surely less so than getting locked in an unnegotiable position. A period of tension between European Union member states is not something we <P>


<a name="column_162"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should work for or welcome, but is surely a price we should be prepared to pay in order to get a decent mandate.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para63"></a>Why does this matter so much? Quite simply because if we cannot sharply improve the development content of the Doha round, if we cannot thereby convince developing countries that trade liberalisation is in their interest and not just ours, then there will not be a successful Doha round and we will all be the poorer for it.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para64"></a>In previous rounds we have marginalised developing countries, we have offered concessions on agriculture and textiles that have then not materialised. We have spoken loudly of our commitment to their well-being and not put our money where our mouth was. But that will not work again, nor should it. If we are to offer the developing countries the open markets that they desperately need if they are to make their way up the development ladder, which in the long term will be of far greater value to them than any amount of aid, and if we are to answer the more defensible of the criticisms of those who are disenchanted with the consequences of globalisation, the European Union is going to have to make a major effort and put its global responsibilities before the narrowly defined self-interest of its farming communities.

<A NAME="30610-10_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Plumb: </B>   My Lords, I begin by declaring an interest as a farmer, but a farmer who welcomes this report. I join with others in congratulating the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, on getting together his committee, taking the views of the various witnesses and putting them together so well and so constructively in the report that we have before us. This follows the Commission's proposals, and the views on them that have been expressed by those witnesses. The proposals were set out fully in Box 2 of the report, on which, as we well know, Ministers are due to deliver, starting their proceedings tomorrow. It is therefore timely that we give an opinion on the report. It is a mid-term review report, and some of the views expressed seem to be outdated because of the updating of some of the proposals that the Ministers are currently considering.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para65"></a>The proposals have therefore moved quite a long way since last year. In that sense, my noble friend's committee may well have to meet again to review its findings after Ministers have debated and deliberated. If they follow the pattern of history in an endeavour to reach a compromise and offer each country something, we face all kinds of difficulties. The evidence is based on a mid-term review which now becomes a CAP reform. Some of the proposals have changed: one concerning farmers in this country is that the notion of a cap on payments of 300,000 euros has fallen by the wayside. The future is by no means clear. Many current proposals are being considered for withdrawal or have been withdrawn. Whatever the outcome, ultimately, as I see it there are three guiding principles for which we should aim. The first, which everyone would welcome, is a significant <P>


<a name="column_163"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>simplification of the existing support arrangements and the removal of a large proportion of the regulatory bureaucracy which they produce in an attempt to police the current complex systems of support. Policing is seen to be more flexible in some countries than in others. How often do we hear it said that we obey while others have not heard of the rules? That is not strictly true, but nevertheless that is a feeling that many people have. This should be done to minimise the redistribution of funds between those who currently receive support and those who may be beneficiaries in the future.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para66"></a>At the same time, reforms should be carried out with the key objectives of allowing the farmer or the grower of products to focus clearly on the needs of the marketplace and respond clearly to the signals of demand coming from consumers and customers. That point is set out clearly in the report.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para67"></a>I believe there are encouraging signs. Farmers' markets are developing, farm shops are being created and anyone who visited, for instance, the Royal Cornwall Show last week would have seen in the food hall a fine example of a taste of the West: good quality food and in great demand. Therefore the example is already set, small though it is.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para68"></a>In so doing, the primary producer will benefit from the removal of all the inefficiencies in the chain that have been built up and built into the machine by successive adaptations and changes in the common agricultural policy which have added significant additional costs or price penalties. Many of those costs and increases, and the input that goes into the total funding&#151;which has understandably been severely criticised today&#151;do not reach the farmer. How is that we hear that some £2.40 per head of every cow in Europe is an on-cost? The farmer reacts when he is receiving 15p a litre from his milk and the cost in the shop is 75p. You cannot say that that is "coming from Europe"; it is properly market-oriented.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para69"></a>I am pleased that the report makes it clear that the revised CAP should be less complicated, less bureaucratic and less centralised. The principle of decoupling, of removing direct support payments from production, and concentrating policy on more environmentally friendly farming is welcome. Ministers will have a tough time in persuading their European colleagues to support the full Commission proposals. I would be very concerned if we accept partial decoupling, as my noble friend Lord Selborne said. It is all or nothing and that is the way we have to go. If we had a flat rate decoupling option of between, say, 70 and 90 per cent across all sections, with the remaining funds allocated to a national envelope, that could then be used at the discretion of each member state or region to target specific sectors.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para70"></a>I could spend, as others could, the few minutes that I have in this debate on the proposals for further decoupling, for cross-compliance, for the Pillar 2 policies and for modulation, on all of which I agree entirely with what my noble friend Lord Selborne has stated in his report. The problem to which I always return is to make them simple and workable.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para71"></a>The CAP is accused of encouraging over-production, as it has. Yet agri-environment measures are working. Many are taking advantage of the countryside stewardship schemes and marketing groups are increasing. Since the last full reform in 1992, the changeover to more sustainable farming has been steady. Therefore substantial surpluses are a thing of the past. There is an ever-increasing level of imports, mostly from countries where labour is cheap.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para72"></a>Now, as we move towards a more tariff-free and less subsidised trading world in food, incorporating many developing countries, we cannot ignore the proposals and the rules that will apply under WTO. Yet, as we see it, most of our trade is with the European Union, bringing greater risks for competition, as we have seen in the past two or three years as the European Union expands.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para73"></a>When the Minister replies he may consider some of the points of concern about that where exports have fallen from 58 per cent to 53 per cent since 1999, mainly due to the monetary disadvantage of the pound and the euro. The output loss shows a staggering effect of over £800 million a year since 1999 through that issue alone.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para74"></a>The controversial area of debate relates to land that has changed hands since the beginning of the reference period and which has been perceived as totally unfair. I hope that Ministers in their deliberations can agree a solution whereby the calculation of payment entitlements can be adjusted in cases where permanent transfer of land has taken place in order for future payments to reflect the size of holding at a time when a new scheme comes into force. I hope that is an issue that can be dealt with here because the landlord/tenant system that applies in many other European countries is totally different from ours. Therefore, member states need some discretion on how to tackle those consequential issues.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para75"></a>The report endeavours to cover a very wide range of complex issues and rightly highlights the importance of enlargement of the EU and the significance of WTO and the Doha round. If we are to help or to see help given to developing countries so that they can help themselves in the form of production, the areas of concern are import access and export subsidies. Replacing a tariff regime in the grains sector with tariff quotas will make WTO negotiations more, not less, difficult and will not necessarily help more developing countries to help themselves and to improve their position or their standard of living.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para76"></a>Generally my views support the report. I thank the committee and, in particular, its chairman for presenting it to us.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para77"></a>There are some very important moral and environmental considerations to which I shall refer briefly and which are brought out very clearly indeed in the evidence given by the assistant secretary general of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States on pages 23 to 27 of the minutes of evidence. That contains some very worrying material indeed and a great deal of uncertainty is also expressed on the part of those states.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para78"></a>Basically, I agree strongly with the approach of the committee. Decoupling is essential; modulation needs to be at higher levels than is presently proposed; and degressivity is right. All such changes must be carried through if the European Union is to have a credible negotiating position with the WTO. I would like to see written clearly on the bottle, "Do not dilute".
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para79"></a>What do we want to see? As far as I am concerned, we do not want to see unbridled free trade; certainly not the dumping of EU or US products on fragile agricultural economies in the developing world with catastrophic results for local producers. Reference has already been made to some examples. It is truly shocking that Ministers could write the letter in Box 4 on page 14. It shows quite remarkable dishonesty and complacency about the dire effects of EU subsidised food dumped on developing countries, especially wheat, dairy products, sugar and, from the United States in particular, rice with devastating effects on the rice production of Ghana and Haiti. As referred to in the NFU evidence, that is US hypocrisy, although, as the NFU points out, that is partly because of the separation of legislature and executive in the United States. If that is the reason given in the United States, what is the reason for the European Union dumping?
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para80"></a>I have to admit that I have a sneaking sympathy, here and there, with some of the points made later in the letter in Box 4 about sufficient numbers of contented producers with confidence in the future maintaining the diversity of our landscape. I would not argue entirely with what Ministers are saying, but in particular with what they say about the effects of European Union policies on the poorer countries.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para81"></a>The moral maze of the trade justice debate is utterly bewildering. Some of the NGOs urge more opportunities for poor countries to gain access to our markets with their primary products. Some of that trade is highly desirable; some of it is essential if such countries are to earn the wherewithal to buy from the developed world the technology that they need to raise standards of living for themselves and to achieve the standards of quality, consistency and reliability that are needed if their export businesses are to be successful. But I believe that there are still strict limits to what we should encourage in terms of trade.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para82"></a>Both the United States and the United Kingdom Governments have been guilty of some extraordinary and, I believe, unacceptable attitudes. I quote from John Block, former US agriculture secretary, as long ago as 1986. If this is an attitude that has informed United States' policy since then, can we be surprised? He says that the,

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"idea that developing countries should feed themselves is an anachronism from a bygone era. They could better ensure their food security by relying on US agricultural products which are available, in most cases, at much lesser cost".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para83"></a>Much more recently, our own Clare Short said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"old ideas that focus on national self-sufficiency in food, rather than national capacity to purchase the food that is needed, are deeply outdated".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para84"></a>I think both those statements are deeply regrettable.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para85"></a>Some trade is positively undesirable if it reduces self-sufficiency or what has come to be called food sovereignty: the right of every nation to produce as much of its own food as it wants, needs and reasonably can produce, given climatic constraints. Parts of Kenya are suitable for intensive dairy farming, but for Kenya to export its dairy products to the United Kingdom and to Europe would be as nonsensical as it would be for us to dump our surplus dairy products on the Kenyans.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para86"></a>I find the attitude of some NGOs a little surprising. They are campaigning hard to persuade the EU and the WTO to make it easier for the developed world to import much more food from relatively undeveloped countries, seeing that as a matter of trade justice, which it is on any reasonable analysis. But that begs the question whether such increased trade is desirable. Is it good to introduce industrial and intensive agricultural methods in developing countries? Is it good to add food miles, all of which are environmentally damaging? There are already serious problems of overproduction of coffee, for example, low returns and a consequent treadmill effect of ever-increasing production and ever-diminishing returns. I do not believe that we want to see that process replicated in the case of other primary products.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para87"></a>There are real difficulties over monoculture crops such as bananas. It is vital for the European Union to continue to defend, to some limited degree, protection in specific cases, probably for limited periods. But the overriding principle should be of food sovereignty, which is in turn an important step towards food security. I would want to reverse absolutely what was said by John Block and Clare Short. The reform of the CAP, which originated in a strong desire to protect small-scale local production within Europe, should continue to have as a guiding principle the ideal of food self-sufficiency, the undesirability of needless food miles and the real benefits for developing countries of the sensible, flexible growth of traditional local food production, not the imposition on such countries of agribusiness methods. For all their benefits in increasing production levels, those methods have had the unhappy consequences of environmental degradation and the breakdown of rural communities.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para88"></a>I have one final thought&#151;more about the long term, but, I suspect, not as long term as many seem to think. Increasing world population and the progressive impact of climate change will pose very serious problems for world food production. The area of cultivable land will change. What are appropriate crops today will not be so in the same places in 50 years' time. Some countries will become better able to be self-sufficient in food; others will become much less <P>


<a name="column_167"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 167</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>able to achieve that. On any reckoning, we shall need to increase world food production well beyond present levels, but without causing unacceptable environmental damage.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para89"></a>Solving the problem of achieving successful and equitable food distribution will become a matter of such complexity as to make the reform of the CAP look like the proverbial vicarage tea party. But I believe that the United Kingdom Government, in all our present negotiations on CAP reform and the Doha development round, should take account of that longer-term context.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-10_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Williamson of Horton: </B>   My Lords, this debate relates to the external implications of the mid-term review of our agricultural policy; it is not a general debate about reform of that policy. I shall therefore concentrate my remarks on the 10th report of the Select Committee so clearly presented by the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, and its recommendations on how the mid-term review should be best used to improve the effect of the policy outside the Union. Some of the recommendations are clearly helpful. I am glad to see the Government's response and hope that they will follow it up in the imminent negotiations.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para90"></a>To put the recommendations in context, however, I wish to stress some features of the agricultural policy as it is today and not as it was yesterday. I sometimes think that commentators do not believe those who say that there have been important changes in the policy, but if they do not believe it they are wrong. The original common agricultural policy, created long before the United Kingdom joined the Union, was a system of market management for a number of major products. It maintained the level of prices by intervention, public purchase or similar mechanisms in the market, and the system of import levies and export refunds. It was a brilliant conception, but prices were set too high, and agriculture Ministers were not then willing to bring them down. The result was that agriculture thrived, consumers paid above the odds and stocks piled up because farmers were just too good at producing at those prices, and the costs and difficulties of disposal were great. In those distant days, I remember asking agricultural officials of the Commission whether they had ever seen a cheque paid to a farmer. The answer was "No", because there were little or no direct aids to farmers. Everything hinged on holding the market prices at or about the agreed level.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para91"></a>The reforms, to which there have been quite a number of references today, starting with the MacSharry reforms of 1992&#150;93, reduced the impact of intervention in the market. That was done either by reducing support prices&#151;the Select Committee's report refers in paragraph 12 to a net 34 per cent reduction in cereal intervention prices&#151;or by making the intervention mechanisms less rigid and therefore less effective. But the member states could accept the cuts in the support for agriculture only by introducing some compensatory payments direct to farmers. That is why the Select Committee, in the report that we are <P>


<a name="column_168"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>debating today, has the dilemma of dealing with the potential effect on third countries both of the now reduced market mechanism and the direct payments to farmers. As I understand it, we have created a double problem.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para92"></a>That is the background against which the Commission has proposed the next set of changes in the mid-term review. I share the view expressed in the Select Committee's report at paragraph 16 that the review proposes,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a much more ambitious programme of changes than was originally envisaged in the original undertaking to conduct a mid-term review".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para93"></a>That is good.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para94"></a>From the point of view of the external impact, the key elements for me of the mid-term review package are, first, a decoupling; that is to say, the replacement of direct compensatory payments with a single farm payment independent from production. That seems absolutely crucial. The second key element is linking the payments to environmental, safety and other conditions; the third is some increase in resources for rural development, as there are not enough; and the fourth is further revisions to market policy for some products. There are other proposals, which have been referred to, for cutting payments to large farms and degressive modulation. They are certainly important limitations for the United Kingdom and are opposed by the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales. I shall not deal with those because we are looking mainly at the external aspects.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para95"></a>The proposal for decoupling is clearly positive for trade liberalisation. It will be helpful in the negotiations on the Doha round, which is extremely important for the Union since, as the world's biggest trading power, we have important objectives in the Doha round in other sectors. We need to maximise our firepower to reduce barriers in other countries to our trade and commerce in all sectors. Beyond that, I think that Defra is right to make the following general point in its memorandum at paragraph 16:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Although essentially a domestic measure, the decoupling of direct payments (and, within that, the proposals on modulation) would have a significant external impact by making production more sensitive to market demand and theoretically"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para96"></a>the word is rather carefully chosen&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"eliminating the need for surplus disposal measures and market price protection".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para97"></a><P>

<a name="30610-10_para98"></a>Broadly speaking, I believe that the change will set our agricultural policy on a more sustainable track. The Select Committee adds that it is essential that decoupling is agreed and applied before the eastward enlargement of the Union next year. It thus recognises the potential attractiveness of the present policy to some new member states and the potential stimulation of production that might arise there. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Polish people on their extremely high level of acceptance of the proposal to enter the European Union.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para99"></a>The Select Committee goes beyond the mid-term review proposals in recommending the abolition of market intervention and export subsidisation. That is clearly radical. We have had it before our eyes many <P>


<a name="column_169"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>times and we have not succeeded. It would mean shifting the balance of our agricultural policy entirely, not gradually as we have been doing, from the market to a system of grants per farm, supported by some environmental and rural development measures. It is not, in my view, negotiable, but it may serve to continue pressure for the changes that will certainly be made as a result of the review and in later years.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para100"></a>It is worth noting that for some products&#151;notably cereals&#151;where the support prices have been cut most sharply, the relationship with world prices is, taking one with another, very much closer. For example, exports of wheat and barley from the Union were competitive enough in the second half of 2000 to be made without any refunds at all. It is also reflected in the way the agricultural budget is now spent. The latest report on the agricultural situation in the European Union shows that only around 18 per cent of the agricultural budget was spent on export refunds and storage of products, whereas 71.52 per cent was spent on aids to producers.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para101"></a>The Select Committee report also looks at the relationship between the mid-term review and trade with less developed countries. A number of noble Lords have referred to that important point. The question goes a little beyond the proposals in the mid-term review because least-developed countries have totally free access to the Union's markets except for three products, two of which, sugar and bananas, were excluded for the present in order to protect the position of other less developed countries which have preferential access.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para102"></a>The 70 or more African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, from whom the European Union imports around 7 billion euros of agricultural products each year, have special access at favourable and higher than world prices for some of their products, notably sugar. If the Union's own sugar regime was dismantled&#151;there is much to be said for that we would have to see how to maintain some advantage for those countries. They would be in serious difficulties. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, also referred to that important point. The principal beneficiaries of a more open sugar regime would not be those countries. The West Indies, Mauritius and so on would be the losers from opening up the market completely. The countries that would mostly gain would be Brazil, Thailand, India and Australia .
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para103"></a>The Select Committee refers also to the milk and milk products policy. The Union is one of the world's biggest and most efficient milk producers. The milk quotas, which are highly undesirable economically, were introduced to restrain production at price levels decided by Ministers. They will have to go earlier than is now proposed. However, the Commission is right in the review to propose price cuts going much beyond those agreed in Agenda 2000. Any significant change in the milk and milk products regime would benefit Australia, New Zealand and Argentina, but I am not sure that that would have any significant effect for less developed countries. As to the possible damaging effect of the current export regime on less developed countries' agriculture, it is regrettable that the recent <P>


<a name="column_170"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>French proposal to pay no export refunds on all agricultural exports to Africa has apparently run into the brushwood. That would have a real value in judging the consequences of such a course and is setting an example for other action. I hope that that can be revived.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para104"></a>In conclusion, there are valuable recommendations in the Select Committee's report and the Commission's proposal on the mid-term review should be broadly supported. Changes and reductions in agricultural support are needed, but I like to keep in mind&#151;I have had such a long time in the public service that I feel that I should be balanced&#151;first, that the European Union is the largest importer of agricultural products; secondly, that the Union imports about 27 billion euros&#151;a big figure&#151;each year of agricultural products from the ACP countries, South Africa, the ASEAN countries, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, South American countries in Mercosur and those in the Mediterranean basin; and, thirdly, that while the cost of agricultural policy is too high, it is still less than 1.2 per cent of public expenditure in the Union. I am not talking about GDP but public expenditure. The remaining 98.8 per cent is spent on more&#151;or less&#151;useful areas.

That still gave me time to experience the very able chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Selborne. He was effective and incisive and there was also the great advantage that when he told us at the start of the morning that the interrogation of the witnesses was to end at noon, it did. That is something that all members of sub-committees will appreciate.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para105"></a>I do not wish to repeat the comments that have already been made by other noble Lords about the contents of the report, although I agree particularly with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford on the very damaging effect of CAP subsidies on the agriculture and exports of less developed countries. I have an elder son working for Oxfam and the right reverend Bishop will understand that that is a subject upon which I receive considerable lobbying whenever my son is at home.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para106"></a>I learned quickly after joining the committee about the accuracy of Box 1 in our report, where we say under the heading "The language of the CAP":

<a name="30610-10_para107"></a>How true. One of the prevailing and constant messages that has come through in this afternoon's speeches is that whatever happens in relation to the reform of the CAP and the switching of money from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2, about which I shall say more, it is essential that that should be in language that the average farmer understands. Small farmers are already overwhelmed with forms from DEFRA&#151;so often the language is too complicated for them.

<a name="30610-10_para108"></a>As other noble Lords have said, the great development ahead of us is the joining of the 10 European countries to the European Union&#151;and the effect of that on the demand for subsidy of one sort or another, including whole farm payments from the CAP budget to the incomers to the Union. I was gloomily struck by an article in the Daily Telegraph three days ago. It was headed:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para109"></a>That was before the vote in Poland which I am glad to say was massively in favour of joining the EU. However, the article quotes a farmer who has a 100 acre breeding farm in Poland, saying:

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Mr Janecki said that only one thing is certain after Poland joins the European Union on May 1 next year: he will be paid pounds 10 an acre in subsidies from the Common Agricultural Policy, while German farmers nearby will receive four times as much.".
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para110"></a>That is just the sort of inequality and problem that the CAP has to live with and deal with over the years ahead with the new entrants into the EU.

<a name="30610-10_para111"></a>The section of the Select Committee report that I shall talk about for a few minutes is on page 23, paragraphs 82 to 93:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The effect of proposals on sustainability of European agriculture".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para112"></a>I declare an interest as chairman of the Sussex Downs Conservation Board, wrongly described in the register of interests for the report as "Sussex Downs Conservative Board". It is as a result of that chairmanship and the fact that I live on the South Downs that my own direct experience of British agriculture is concentrated on two different parts of the United Kingdom&#151;the South Downs and, 650 miles away, the little Hebredean island of Tiree. Funnily enough, sometimes the problems of agriculture in those areas are much the same. They both have working farmers who rely substantially on sheep production for their incomes. In both cases the smaller farmer, who has perhaps a holding of 150 to 200 acres, or a croft of that size in Tiree, has seen his income fall in real terms over the past five years, particularly with the massive fall in sheep prices. That presents a problem with the reform of the CAP. I very much approve of the contents of the report, and I agree with the note of optimism in it that has been echoed this afternoon. However, at the same time, one has to think about how the move from cereal production and headage payments for sheep and cattle will work out for the small farmer who does not have very much more to offer or to do other than to graze sheep or cattle on his land.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para113"></a>I very much hope that that area will be carefully thought about and further developed because I find that, so far, in relation to both those areas, if one tells someone that reform of the CAP will help them, most people simply look cross-eyed. It has been talked about so often and people do not know whether reform will happen, and, if it does, they do not know whether it will benefit them. It is rather like talking about the Arab-Israeli conflict. Everyone thinks that something should happen and that the CAP should be <P>


<a name="column_172"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reformed. There is an awful lot of talk, but what actually happens in the event that is explicable to those who are in need of support?
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para114"></a>As I look at the conclusions on sustainability in our report, I hope that, as it states, the cross-compliance measures of the move from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 will be sufficiently effective to ensure that the small farmer who is told to stop intensifying his produce does receive substantial alternative possibilities of income onto his farm. If that does not happen, the movement of money from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 could be ineffective in its result.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para115"></a>In that context, although the Curry report is referred to in this volume, I do not believe that DEFRA or the Countryside Agency have yet been dynamic enough in putting over to farmers in this country how they can use Pillar 2 money&#151;money for agricultural environmental improvement&#151;in an effective way. My noble friend Lord Plumb referred to country stewardship schemes, and I am also aware of the environmentally sensitive area schemes in the South Downs. However, the number of farmers who actually benefit from those is very small. We need wider, imaginative schemes to help the farmer who will now be told that he is not going to get more money for having more sheep or cattle, which is his normal reaction. He must be helped to find other agriculturally and environmentally suitable ways of producing more income. This is an area that needs a great deal of thought and help from DEFRA in making the ideas that come forward from the European Commission work practically.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para116"></a>We all welcome what Commissioner Fischler has suggested. We hope that his proposals will not be modified too much in the negotiations that start tomorrow in Luxembourg. It is noticeable that the letter in Box 4 to which others have referred is signed by seven agriculture Ministers, so there will be a lot of argument and debate in Luxembourg. I hope that the Fischler proposals will be accepted to a large measure. I noticed that one noble Lord in the debate this afternoon&#151;it may have been the noble Lord, Lord Desai&#151;used the words, "France is moving". Let us hope that that is the case. If France is moving, we will see really effective reform of the CAP that will help small farmers in this country.

<A NAME="30610-10_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Walpole: </B>   My Lords, I need not declare that I am a retired farmer as I do not get income from farming any more. I thank the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, the chairman, for the wonderful way in which he led the team in producing the report.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para117"></a>The time of publication of the report is good for the Minister. I am pleased with the Government's response to it. It is vital that the common agricultural policy be reformed before the new members join the market. The common agricultural policy was set up at the beginning of the Common Market in the 1960s by people who had personally experienced the horrors of a genuine lack of food&#151;even starvation&#151;in Europe during the Second World War. They were determined <P>


<a name="column_173"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 173</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that that would not happen again, and they envisaged virtual self-sufficiency in temperate climate food supplies. They aimed at encouraging higher and more efficient production through production subsidies and direct market support, as the noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton, said. I knew that, if he spoke before me, he would say that.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para118"></a>The problem arose when surpluses began to appear and mountains built up. Because of the large agricultural vote in most countries, there was no political will to deal with the problem. Surpluses were dumped at low prices and import barriers raised, which stopped developing countries exporting their products to the Common Market. The CAP had become like a supertanker, and, although there was some minor tweaking of the rudder, it moved forward on its disastrous course.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para119"></a>In paragraph 100 of the report, we state that time is not on the side of the reformers. How true that is. There must be more radical changes before the new members join. With the WTO, Doha and the development round, we must end up with sustainable agriculture and&#151;even more importantly&#151;environmental protection. I am particularly concerned about further environmental degradation in this country if less money goes into agriculture and if the change from the first pillar to the second is not large enough. In the 10 new member countries, existing unique habitats may be lost because of efforts to intensify and raise production.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para120"></a>I shall not go through all the proposals again. We want to end up with sustainable agriculture and environmental protection leading to more prosperous food production, a better countryside and more fairness to developing countries. Do the proposals go far enough? I do not think they do.

<A NAME="30610-10_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the committee and its chairman, the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, on an excellent report. I regret that I had to take my turn to come off the committee before it embarked on the inquiry.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para121"></a>As other noble Lords have said, the report is jargon-free, and it contains some good explanations. It was particularly encouraging that so many noble Lords who spoke this afternoon are not on the committee now. That shows how the committees of your Lordships' House can produce reports that widen interest in a subject to noble Lords who generally take an interest in other subjects. This is a truly cross-cutting report.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para122"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Desai, described how well the report examined the delicate balances that must be struck between the various interest groups and showed that interests that are seldom heard must be taken into account. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford underlined the fact that, when Ministers from the various nations discuss the matter tomorrow, they must resist the siren calls of national interest. Such calls are not in the interest of the WTO round or of developing countries. I understand that it will be difficult for national Ministers to resist them.
<P>


<a name="column_174"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 174</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para123"></a>The mid-term review discussed in the report is considered from four angles: what does it do to help developing countries; what does it do to help enlargement; what does it do to help the WTO round; and how does it affect our producers and our environment at home?
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para124"></a>I welcome the conclusion in paragraph 81 that the EU and developed countries need to help developing countries. It will be no use approaching trade more freely from the point of view of tariffs and subsidies if developing countries receive no help or guidance from us on health, safety, labelling and animal welfare regulations, which they find difficult now. They will not be able reasonably to access our markets. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford explained clearly why issues of local production, local markets and national food production are important. Nevertheless, great attention should be paid to paragraph 81.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para125"></a>Paragraph 115 refers to the level of subsidy receipts to individual holdings. I agree with the conclusion.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para126"></a>On enlargement, paragraph 47 refers to the transferring of funds from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2. Pillar 2 must be funded properly. Those countries may be in the situation we were in 30 or 40 years ago. We expect a great deal from our producers: that they continue to produce food and comply with all the environmental requirements. Paragraph 48 refers to rare habitats and species. The Government's response to that paragraph is so weak that I feel I must quote it. They said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We envisage that effective implementation of all relevant EU legislation in accession States, and not only that which relates to cross-compliance, would ensure that habitats and species are adequately protected".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para127"></a>I do not believe that that will be the case. We must learn from what happened with our intensification. Intensification there undoubtedly will be in enlargement countries. We must ensure that those countries which still have rare habitats and exceptional species are protected. The Government should pay more attention to that paragraph.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para128"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walpole, underlined the conclusion at paragraph 91. I shall not repeat it. These Benches believe strongly that the environmental issues underlined in that paragraph are important.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para129"></a>The WTO round failed to agree by March 2003 the agenda for the agricultural round in Mexico. The developing world might be right to call the attitude of the European Union, the United States and Japan to free trade something of an axis of evasion. We have talked a great deal about reform. Very little has happened. In the United States matters took a step backward with the introduction of the agriculture Act.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para130"></a>With its proposed reforms of the CAP the European Union is moving away from this evasion to a more positive attitude. That should be encouraged. It is essential that a decent agreement can be reached this week by the Council of Ministers. Given the importance that everyone attaches to such success, I was disheartened to read the briefing from the Country <P>


<a name="column_175"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Land and Business Association. I wonder whether all its members would sign up to this statement. It said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"this is not amongst the strongest or most useful [report] from the Committee".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para131"></a>It believes that undue importance to those issues as drivers of policy change is not helpful. Of course, the CLA is representing an interested body, but we must all work together to ensure that we can propose reforms for the long term that will benefit everyone.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para132"></a>Finally, I refer to the issue of decoupling and the single payment entitlement. The noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, pleaded for clarity and making it understandable. It is difficult to understand what will occur under the proposals. Some examples would clarify the situation. I am unsure what the Government propose under the single payment entitlement. Will farmers in this country who are entitled to that payment receive it for as long as they choose to stay on their landholdings, even though they may not be producing anything? I understand that that is part of the reform. But they will be effectively retiring on the job. That worries me in particular because of the implications for future new entrants.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para133"></a>I understand that there will be a 1 per cent national reserve to deal with the problem. But the new policy must send a clear signal that new entrants can expect CAP reforms to hold something for them. Perhaps the Minister could provide in your Lordships' Library a couple of case studies on the proposed single payment entitlement about what will happen now to a farmer in his 40s or 60s, or, alternatively, one who is just coming into farming.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para134"></a>It is an excellent report. I congratulate the committee on grasping a difficult nettle, cutting across the different issues and producing such an understandable report.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-10_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lord Selborne on introducing the Select Committee report. I found it challenging. The committee had to balance the needs of the less developed countries, the farmers in the UK, those in the EU and those who will join the EU. That is quite a melting pot. I congratulate the committee on producing the report. I remind the House of my family's farming interest. We are participators in a stewardship scheme.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para135"></a>When introducing the debate today, my noble friend said that it was a very timely event. Indeed, it is. The Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to consider these major reforms. It wishes to see a progressive move from food production towards environmental matters. How this can be achieved without continually disadvantaging less developed countries is the issue which has taxed noble Lords today. We are very aware of the needs of those countries and the requirement to overcome the unfair playing field which currently exists.
<P>


<a name="column_176"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 176</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para136"></a>My noble friend suggested that perhaps there was not enough money to achieve the required changes. The report suggests, in the part on modulation, that British farmers are likely to be disadvantaged because, on the whole, UK farmers are bigger farmers than others. But, as the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, pointed out in his very worthwhile contribution, it is 1.2 per cent only of total public expenditure. I think that that is not publicly known. Everyone thinks that CAP is the majority of expenditure and not a tiny proportion. We should be aware of that.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para137"></a>In paragraph 19, the committee has listed the eight important issues where the House of Commons conclusions and recommendations coincide with those of the House of Lords sufficiently to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"indicate a general meeting of minds on the main issues before this inquiry",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para138"></a>I should like to emphasise three of those eight important issues. First, the recognition that the primary role of farmers should be to produce food that consumers want to buy. Diversification is all very well, but it must not be allowed to eclipse the need to produce for ourselves&#151;indeed, in national countries, for themselves&#151;the greater part of our own food requirement, to recognise health and safety standards and to ensure that fair prices are paid both to the farmer and by the consumer. Many noble Lords have referred to the failure to introduce firm proposals to end milk quotas, so I shall not go into that issue, but I, too, consider the delay regrettable.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para139"></a>Turning to Part 3 of the report&#151;Analysis and Opinion&#151;I am grateful for the opportunity to comment in some detail on some of the points raised. Generally, the report rightly states that European food is safe and of a high quality&#151;in paragraph 32. That is important. It cannot be said of all food and, once again, there have been reports of adulterated imported chicken in processed food coming into this country. I firmly believe, as I am sure do other noble Lords, that food importers and processors should be bound by the same standards that apply to our farmers. Consumers should not be put at risk from processed food which contains adulterated product, nor should they be put in the position of buying goods produced in ways which they would abhor on our own farms. My noble friend Lord Plumb referred to this; he said that policing is patchy. I would go further; in some countries I think that it is non-existent.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para140"></a>Paragraph 42 contains possibly the most important statement in the whole report. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is essential that the Commission's recommendations on decoupling are agreed and applied in advance of the eastward enlargement from 2004".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para141"></a>We are already in the sixth month of 2003. Ten new member countries due to join in 2004 believe that an unreformed CAP would give their farmers higher incomes. The candidate countries applying to join after 2004 believe that an unreformed CAP would act as a spur to increased production from their farmers. I believe that a CAP still unreformed in 2004 will result in great danger to our own agricultural future and a downward pressure on agricultural earnings.
<P>


<a name="column_177"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para142"></a>Farm incomes have been unsustainable in this country for the past three or four years. It is true that they have improved slightly during the past year, but they are still a long way from being sustainable. Recovery in many sectors has been made possible in large part because of the huge numbers that have left the industry. How do the Government propose to persuade the remaining EU countries to get on with these reforms which they currently face?
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para143"></a>The committee proposes that modulation be strengthened by increasing the percentage taken from subsidies, by making transfer to structural funds at a faster rate than currently planned and by shifting some of the transferred funds in the EU15 to the new members to build up their structural resources more quickly. The committee has also dealt with the dairy and sugar regimes in paragraphs 49 to 51, 59, 79 and 112. These are huge and very important issues for the developing countries&#151;in particular, the sugar regime, to which other noble Lords have referred.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para144"></a>The committee was clearly disappointed by the Commission's lack of resolve in these areas&#151;which I support. It wants to see an end to the delivery and production quotas, stepped cuts in support prices and a consequential stop to market support and export subsidisation. Paragraphs 60 and 75 deal with the effect of the proposed reforms on the less developed countries&#151;for example, the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of states. I have highlighted in bold that the committee,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"deplores the lack of concern among Member States for their plight".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para145"></a>That has been reflected in the whole Chamber today.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para146"></a>The committee concludes that to help them the EU subsidies must be not only decoupled from production, but reduced eventually to the individual producer. In his introduction, my noble friend told us that the committee was looking in particular at the effects on less developed countries, and it is right to do that.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para147"></a>The suggestion that the level of subsidy receipts allowed, in toto, to individual holdings be capped follows as night follows day. Indeed, we have heard that some organisations&#151;in particular, the CLA&#151;are concerned about that. But it is an issue that we must tackle. I know that currently the Commission has moved away from the proposed capping system&#151;I think the Minister will confirm that later. But if the capping system is not to be involved, how will the desired goal be achieved?
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para148"></a>Will the Government ensure that money raised from modulation stays within the UK and comes into a national envelope or will it be returned to an EU pool over which this country has no control? If the money raised has to return to an EU pool, will we be certain that an accounting system will be kept annually and audited regularly so that we shall know where the money goes? It is hugely important that we do.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para149"></a>In paragraph 81, the committee recommends that more emphasis should be given to the development projects which will assist less developed countries to meet the EU health and safety quality and labelling <P>


<a name="column_178"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 178</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>requirements. We need to take that on board because it is no use if food is produced which it is then decided is not of the right quality and is therefore banned. This particular comment made in the report is very important.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para150"></a>I am sure that we would all agree that the recommendation in paragraph 92&#151;namely, that a revised CAP should be less complicated, less bureaucratic, less centralised&#151;is to be welcomed and it has been touched on by most noble Lords today. It should offer farmers more choice in running their businesses. I welcome the committee's observation that environmental measures should be designed to encourage and reward good land management.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para151"></a>However, the report has left some uncertainties. The CLA, NUF and others have raised with me their concerns on the decoupled payments proposed. It is accepted that the proposed single farm payment should be paid on the historic period of 2000 to 2002. But many do not accept that this payment should be paid when the structure of the farm has changed meanwhile, nor that the payments should be tradable without land. These uncertainties are already having an effect on our land market. People are unwilling to enter into long-term tenancy agreements or land purchase because they do not know what they are renting or buying.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para152"></a>I wonder if the Minister would comment on this issue: such proposals to allow payments to "walk off"&#151;the expression that I would use&#151;the land are a threat to our environment as they undermine land-owning confidence and discourage the ability of new entrants, as referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and they could bring CAP into future disrepute.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para153"></a>Does the Minister think there is a major problem in decoupling for livestock and the unsupported sector of the farming industry, in that there are no clear reference points as there is with IACS registered land? Has he considered that valuers could establish units of livestock, or whatever, for any given farm in the same way that is done when arbitrators discuss rents?
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para154"></a>The unsupported crop growers have written to me about their concerns on the reforms with CAP. Under the new proposals, farmers will all receive a once-a-year payment, regardless of crops or cropping rotations. Farmers who grow only highly subsidised crops of cereals and oil seeds will receive the highest payment, and those who grow unsupported crops as part of their arable rotation will receive less. Those who grow only vegetables, potatoes or fruit will receive nothing at all.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para155"></a>I wonder whether those issues have been taken up with EU Ministers and what their views were. Perhaps the Minister can touch on that in his response.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para156"></a>In his speech of 10 July 2002, Franz Fischler stated that he wanted to guarantee farmers a fair income and <P>


<a name="column_179"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>free them from the red tape imposed by CAP. I am sure that all of us would say, "Hear, hear" to that. But at the end of his speech, he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Farmers no longer have to present themselves as a charity case. Instead, as commercially minded businessmen working for a healthier environment and the countryside, they can request their due from the European Taxpayer with their heads held high".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-10_para157"></a><P>

<a name="30610-10_para158"></a>Those are inspiring words, but a fair income must encompass a profit. Without the prospect of profitable farming businesses, the aspirations of good environmental issues, beautiful countryside and social cohesion cannot be achieved.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para159"></a>We are looking for a fair deal for UK farmers and for the EU and the new countries joining it, and very much a fair deal for those less developed countries who are reliant on us. We are looking for certainty. We have a plan. We have a purpose. We have a direction. But over the years the plan keeps being changed, as other noble Lords have said.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para160"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford rightly touched on the impact that climate change might have on our long-term food production and the rising difficulties that that will give some countries in producing food for themselves. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, spoke of his concern, which I share, about it becoming a botched compromise. The noble Lord, Lord Williamson, said that the proposals, if carried through, would mean major changes for our farming communities both within and without the EU.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para161"></a>My noble friend and his committee have produced a good report. It is controversial in parts, but I am thankful for that, too. It emphasises the many challenges that we face with these mid-term proposals. I thank them most sincerely for the quality of work and the time that they gave. I look forward to the Minister's response.

The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, described it as "calm and rational". It is also incisive and one with which, by and large, the Government agree.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para162"></a>The timing of the debate is both hugely appropriate and extremely difficult. It is appropriate for the House to debate it on the eve of the discussions, but difficult for the Minister to reply&#151;certainly to do what the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, was tempting me to do, which was guess the outcome of what will be extremely difficult negotiations in Luxembourg over the next few days. How many days is not yet clear, but my right honourable friend Margaret Beckett will be leading those negotiations. I shall be here responding to the debate of the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, on the countryside and subsequently on the Water Bill, with which the two noble Baronesses and I are involved. I shall be slightly on the substitutes' bench, I suspect, as the negotiations will go on for some time.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para163"></a>There are different opinions in the various EU member states on Franz Fischler's proposals. His proposals are bold and clear. They have already had some set-backs, and there will undoubtedly be some negotiation and some compromise before we reach the end. The sense of direction of the radical change that Commissioner Fischler is proposing will survive. It will certainly have the strong support of the UK Government and several other member states. Everyone is moving a little as a result of those bold proposals. I think that my noble friend Lord Desai said that the French had moved. If so, it is the first shift in French policy on agriculture since Napoleon left Moscow, and is to be welcomed.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para164"></a>In his opening remarks the noble Earl referred to the danger of partial decoupling. Everyone who has spoken and the UK Government recognise that partial decoupling could be the worst of all worlds. It could leave us with two new systems rather than one; over-bureaucracy rather than simplification; distortion rather than clarity; and not a suffcient shift away from domestic support to do us any good at the WTO negotiations in Cancun in September.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para165"></a>Nevertheless there is an undercurrent of partial decoupling being discussed among the other member states. Franz Fischler is taking a strong line, and the UK Government will take a strong line, but there will be some discussion as the French, German and Danish Governments and others are talking about partial decoupling.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para166"></a>If partial decoupling exists in any form in the final agreement&#151;and we hope it will be minimal&#151;it must be clear. It must not over-complicate the outcome, but must achieve the objective set by Commissioner Fischler in terms of Europe's contributions to the WTO round and in shifting the burden of support for agriculture away from production-related subsidies towards support for land management that delivers an effective and environmentally sensitive landscape, while freeing farmers to follow the markets rather than subsidies. That is the whole point of our approach.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para167"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, underlined the fact that farmers would benefit. I strongly appreciate the support that, with some difficulties to itself, the National Farmers Union has given to the position taken by the British Government&#151;and with some reservations the Country Landowners Association as well. We have strong support from progressive farmers in this country, and Franz Fischler also appreciates that. Farmers will benefit by becoming more commercially oriented, as will society if we get a more environmentally oriented agricultural system as a result.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para168"></a>The noble Earl and others referred to the limited degree of new money that is going into the second pillar. It is true that it is not such a large-scale modulation as was originally proposed, but nevertheless it is some additional money and again gives a clear sense of direction. Others expressed concern that the dairy regime was not a very radical proposal. I am afraid that I have to sympathise with that. The quota system, which was intended to restrict <P>


<a name="column_181"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 181</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>production, has turned into a system that people have to meet and a trade-all asset that distorts the way in which farmers respond to what is the real market. We should have liked to see a quicker end to the present dairy regime, but there will be subsequent negotiations.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para169"></a>Having said all that, where we are now, at the beginning of the negotiations, and with the clarity of Commissioner Fischler, we have the opportunity for radical reform. The burden of the Select Committee's report is on the international repercussions. It is on the development ground and the ability of Europe to make gestures to help developing countries that will begin to reduce the export refunds and resistance to access to the markets, which the traditional CAP has presented to developing countries. Much more is needed, and in the negotiations, if we accept more or less the Fischler package, we shall go into the Doha negotiations in Cancun in a relatively strong position, but not as strong as perhaps it should be. We need to recognise within Europe that we need to do more, as the right reverend Prelate said, to help the developing countries to help themselves. I do not go as far as the right reverend Prelate in casting quite as much doubt on free trade as he did. There is quite a long way to go from the current CAP to unbridled free trade. Somewhere down that road we would have a much freer trading system, subject to some terms. Some of the terms will protect agricultural production both in developing countries and in Europe and protect the consumer in terms of safety and environmental impact.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para170"></a>But it is important that increased trade is seen as part of the solution for the developing countries. It is not right simply to say that they should be self-sufficient, any more than we should maintain one of the original tenets of the European Union's common agricultural policy&#151;that, as a prime objective of agricultural policy, we should seek self-sufficiency. That would not be good for Europe nor for the developing countries. Trade would be good for both, albeit not trade on completely free terms but trade which recognises what the European Union, in its position statement for the WTO negotiations, refers to as non-trade considerations, including safety, the environment, quality and animal welfare.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para171"></a>I agree with the right reverend Prelate that the United States is in the frame as well as the European Union. While I hesitate to use the term "hypocrisy" in regard to our American allies, there is an element of double-talking in relation to their approach to agriculture and the development round. Certainly the net results of the agricultural and trade policies of America give less access for the agricultural products of developing countries than does the European Union. Therefore the United States has a contribution to make as well.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para172"></a>It is important to get this issue clear before enlargement. Certainly it was necessary for us to ensure that the decision was taken in a timescale before we enlarge the European Union. That has meant some deals with the accession countries which, to some extent, they resent. I disagree with a number of noble Lords, including the noble Earl, the report and several <P>


<a name="column_182"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>others who have implied that it is inevitable that the new member states will be against reform and will want to maintain the agricultural policy as it is.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para173"></a>The accession countries want a level playing field&#151;the Polish pig farmer referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, makes the point crudely and clearly&#151;and they have not got a level playing field in relation to direct payments. But they have benefits in other respects, including the price of labour and the price of land, so there are swings and roundabouts. However, although they argue for a level playing field, they do not argue that we should maintain the CAP system as it is.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para174"></a>I have made many visits to eastern Europe&#151;to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Estonia&#151;in the past few months. None of the governments of those countries support the CAP system as it is. Most of them are radical reformers. It is very interesting that almost all of the accession countries have decided to pay the part of the direct payments we have agreed should be received by them in a decoupled way, not in a way relating to production. That is a very positive and clear signal that they want to decouple the system; that they do not want in their systems the over-production and price distortion that most of western Europe went through.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para175"></a>As to some of the anxieties expressed about the environmental impact in eastern Europe, the accession countries do not want to go through the same negative impacts of intensification which occurred within western Europe. Clearly there will be some restructuring of central European agricultural&#151;there will be some mergers where the size of farms is not sustainable&#151;but that can be done by adopting production methods which do not repeat most of the problems that occurred within western Europe during the 1960s and 1970s.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para176"></a>That is largely because the regulations to which they have now signed up&#151;and most of the accession countries have transposed those regulations faithfully&#151;are very different from the laws which applied in western Europe during the period of intensification of its agriculture, both in regard to the landscape and biosecurity and the positive attraction of the agri-environment dimensions of the agricultural policy. None of that was there when we went through the often quite devastating effects of intensification on our landscape and wildlife.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para177"></a>I am relatively optimistic that the new nations will not drag us backwards but will be part of the way forward. I am also relatively optimistic that they will not repeat the mistakes of western agriculture but will join with us in creating a more environmentally sensitive agricultural system in the future.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para178"></a>This reform is not the be-all and end-all. As the noble Lord, Lord Plumb, rightly reminded us, this was originally simply a mid-term review. It has grown somewhat&#151;I am very pleased that it has&#151;but there will be further stages. As the committee pointed out, some areas have not been fully addressed.
<P>


<a name="column_183"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 183</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para179"></a>The sugar regime has not been touched, as it was not touched in the earlier stages of CAP reform over the past 20 years, a process with which the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, is very familiar. He was right to remind us that much change has taken place, but not much in the sugar regime. Part of the reason for that is that changing the sugar regime would have some complex effects internationally as well as domestically within Europe with its large-scale beet farming.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para180"></a>If we were to straightforwardly liberalise the sugar regime it would have enormous implications for the cane producers who have traditionally supplied the UK market. The ACP countries which have benefited from that regime are obviously anxious that we do not immediately embrace a sugar regime which effectively would change from being one which gave them preferential access to one which transferred the benefit of the European market, at a lower price, away from the poorest to the less poor, such as Brazil, and, in some cases, to rich countries such as Australia.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para181"></a>There are other regimes like the sugar regime which need to be addressed, but it is not straightforward how we should address them. There are others which have not been addressed which, I would argue, should end as rapidly as possible&#151;the most obvious being the tobacco regime. From all points of view&#151;in terms of trade distortion and producing and subsidising a product which then imposes costs on our National Health Service and health services throughout Europe&#151;there is no justification for the tobacco regime. But, because of the timescale of these proposals, tobacco is not covered at the moment. However, it has been registered as an area for further reform.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para182"></a>The process of reform and the degree to which it succeeds will be crucial when we go to Cancun and the WTO negotiations in September. It is very important that the European Union arrives at those negotiations with a clear and positive agenda for reducing both domestic and export support and tariffs. The proposals do not currently go far enough. The outcome of the negotiations needs to be sufficient for us to have met the demands on the reduction of domestic support required by the WTO.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para183"></a>That does not mean it will all happen overnight in the WTO negotiations. There will be phased progress, as there has been in previous WTO rounds. But in previous WTO rounds the EU was always on the back foot, partly, if not largely, because it could not bring anything on agriculture to the table. In this round of WTO negotiations, which is the development round, agriculture is absolutely central. We must therefore go to Cancun with a positive policy on agricultural trade.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para184"></a>Sometimes it has been politic for us not to focus on that reason for CAP reform. It does not always go down well with European farmers who see it as being more in the interests of other sectors of the economy that we should develop a more liberalised trading system than in their interests. But it is nevertheless important for all of us. It is important for the developing countries and for Europe. It is estimated <P>


<a name="column_184"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column 184</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the benefits from a better system of trade will run into several hundred billion euros and it is important for the farmers themselves that they are seen as part of an international trading system and a domestic economic system and not as an arcane, obsolete anomaly.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para185"></a>The central problem with the CAP is how it plays with the citizens of the rest of Europe and the world. Currently, most taxpayers, however they may feel about rural and farming ways of life, resent the fact that a significant amount of the European taxpayer's money goes to farmers to produce products which are not those they as consumers want in the market. They vary in the intensity of their view, but we must move to a system in Europe where the CAP is justifiable to the rest of the citizenry of Europe. At present it is not.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para186"></a>Even more importantly, crucially, Europe has to have an agricultural policy that is justifiable to the rest of the world. I believe that the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, pointed to the paragraph of the views of my ministerial colleagues in other countries, to whom my colleagues will have to be nice in the next few days. But it is wrong to say that the CAP does not cause hunger in the developing world; it does. The fact that we subsidise exports to those countries replacing their own agricultural products&#151;the Jamaican example is germane&#151;causes poverty in rural areas in developing countries and an increase in the cost of food to people in urban areas in developing countries.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para187"></a>We cannot go much further into the century and hold up our heads in discussions with the rest of the world if we continue to operate a policy whose prime impact on two-thirds of the world is to cause poverty, and starvation in extreme cases. The British Government recognise that; as does the European Commission. Farmers' leaders here recognise that fact. All governments in Europe recognise it to some degree. The noble Lord, Lord Williamson, referred to the Africa initiative by the French Government, which indicates a sensitivity there as well as here. It did not go far enough in our judgment, but it was a recognition that the development impact of agricultural policy must be recognised by all EU countries.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para188"></a>We need to build on that recognition. The discussions starting tomorrow, this report and the Government's response published today, give an indication of the position the UK will be taking. But for Europe and the world as a whole we need a positive outcome: for our farming communities in Europe; for consumers and society in Europe; but most of all for the future relations between Europe and the rest of the world. My thanks again to the noble Earl and his committee, and to all noble Lords who have participated in this very good and, by and large, consensual debate.

<a name="column_185"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>common agricultural policy and our international responsibilities&#151;the debate illuminated just what those are.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para189"></a>I return to an issue raised by the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford, and the noble Lord, Lord Williamson. It relates to the specific problems of the ACP countries, which currently benefit from special access. They leapfrog across the import barriers that apply to other countries. If we demolish those import tariffs in order to help countries such as Brazil, they will lose their preferential status, which is a problem to which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and others drew attention.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para190"></a>When we come to the sugar regime, which will follow, that issue will have to be addressed. We hope by the end of the week to have the precedent of decoupled payments. There is no reason why that principle should not be applied to the producers in the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>ACP countries. We have to find a way of giving support to the farmers without perpetuating something very convenient for the European farmers, who benefit from the high prices internally and say that they are doing it for the benefit of the least developed countries.
<P>

<a name="30610-10_para191"></a>I am delighted to share the Minister's optimistic note about the applicant countries, which he believes are taking a sensible view. They will not be adding to the dead weight of those who signed the letter, which we reproduced in Box 4. I am happy to agree with him that there are excellent indications that the support will be used sensibly.

<P>

<a name="30610-11_para0"></a>Clause 27 [Budget calculations: report on inadequacy of controlled reserve]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield </B>   moved Amendment No. 74:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 12, line 4, leave out subsection (1).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-11_para1"></a><P>

<a name="30610-11_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 75 to 79.
<P>

<a name="30610-11_para3"></a>The clause lays down in statute a requirement on a local authority to have regard to reports from its chief financial officer when making decisions on its level of reserves. We had long discussions about the level of reserves in our previous sitting. Of course a local authority should have regard to the views of its chief financial officer on such matters. That is one reason why we employ a chief financial officer. We in local government would not employ someone in that role whose advice we did not seek and respect. However, to lay that down in statute is rather strange. I cannot see how the provisions could possibly be effective or warranted in principle.
<P>

<a name="30610-11_para4"></a>In a spirit of open-mindedness, however, we tabled the amendments, which seek to work with the Bill and clarify how the provisions will operate in practice. For example, I do not understand how Clause 27(2) will work. What does it mean for a chief financial officer to report on the likelihood of reserve being inadequate for a previous financial year? We discussed that previously. The level of reserves for a previous financial year may have no bearing at all on the level of reserves that an authority intends to set for the forthcoming financial year. If we are to have that provision, why is it not directed directly at the levels of reserves that an authority intends to set for the forthcoming year? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I support my noble friend's amendment. We had many discussions at our previous sitting about the purpose of minimum reserves; now we have the inadequacy of controlled reserves.
<P>

<a name="30610-11_para5"></a>I pick up the point that my noble friend made about subsection (2), which states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If in relation to the previous financial year it appears to the chief finance officer that a controlled reserve is or is likely to be inadequate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-11_para6"></a><P>


<a name="column_GC48"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC48</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
We all have to look back from time to time but the proposal is to look back at a reserve that was set for a previous year; it was either adequate or not adequate. If that refers to whether its adequacy should be reflected in the forthcoming year, the Bill should say so. The amount of reserves should be set for the forthcoming year and they must be set on the basis of the budget that is being considered. It appears inexplicable to us that that will be done in relation to the previous year. I am sure that the Minister will give us a good explanation in this regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Amendments Nos. 74 to 79 would transform Clause 27 into a new free-standing duty on the chief financial officer to report to an authority if the officer believed that the reserves were inadequate. I entirely accept that that is a logical consequence of the opposition that the noble Baroness and the noble Lord have expressed to Clause 26. As it stands, without Clause 26, Clause 27 is redundant. However, if Clause 26 remains in the Bill, Clause 27 has an important role to play in its unamended form. Perhaps I should spell out what that is.
<P>

<a name="30610-11_para7"></a>Regulations made under Clause 26 would require any authority to budget for at least a minimum level of reserves. But reserves are there to be used in the appropriate circumstances. Nothing in Clause 26 stops the use of the reserves, even if that brings them below the minimum level. But the fact that the actual level has fallen below the budgeted level means that some other element in the budget must have been overspent. It is right in our submission that the authority should be informed of the reasons why that has happened, so that lessons can be learned for future years.
<P>

<a name="30610-11_para8"></a>We all learn from events in the past; they inform what we do in the future. I remember from my time in local government ensuring that we had a proper and legal budget. We had to understand what had happened in budget movements in the previous year in planning future years' budget strategy. It seemed to me to be an important piece of budgetary intelligence that we viewed what had happened, where the overspend occurred and what areas needed action in that regard. It seems plain to us that when setting next year's budget, all authorities should in any event review progress in relation to the budget to ensure sound foundations for the coming year. Clause 27 requires a report at that time if it is foreseen that the reserves at the end of the current year will fall short of the minimum.
<P>

<a name="30610-11_para9"></a>If Amendments Nos. 74 to 79 were accepted, Clause 27 would become a duty on the chief financial officer to report if in relation to the forthcoming year it appeared to the officer that the reserves were or were likely to be inadequate. It seems that that is intended to apply to the reserves that are to be allowed for in the forthcoming year's budget. Clearly, that duplicates part of the duty placed on the chief financial officer by Clause 25 of the Bill. It is therefore unnecessary.
<P>


<a name="column_GC49"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC49</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-11_para10"></a>With that clarification of why we regard the provision as important, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I still would like more clarity from the Minister. As the arrangements currently stand, what happens at budget time is that the financial officer reports to the council if he thinks that the proposed level of reserves for the coming year is inadequate. In the previous year, if reserves are used, reports are also given to the cabinet&#151;they used to be given to a policy or finance committee. Whether reserves are used becomes obvious as the year goes on. They cannot be used secretly and they must be spent during the year. When one gets to budget time, what happened to reserves in the previous year is always obvious.
<P>

<a name="30610-11_para11"></a>I understand what the Minister said and that there should perhaps be a report saying what had happened, but everyone who is closely involved will know what happened during the year. Surely the more appropriate information is the level of reserves for the coming year because the rest of it is history. As things stand now, that is what happens. The extra arrangements appear to be rather redundant. That was my point. The subsection appears to impose new duties unnecessarily on what happens now.
<P>

<a name="30610-11_para12"></a>The situation involving Hackney or Walsall, if we want to discuss failing councils, would not involve the provisions. Everyone knew what has happening&#151;the problem involved the incompetence of the members who were taking decisions. It did not involve the fact that the figures were not transparent or that people did not know. There was not much secrecy attached to them. The decision-making procedures in those councils were inadequate and no one could agree. We were supposed to be giving local government freedoms with the legislation, but in this regard we will give more restrictions. I take the Minister's point, but this involves much unnecessary work for local government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-11_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I take the Minister's point about needing to have regard to the past in order to deal with the present and future. As he said, when he led a local authority, he was able to do that without having risk provisions on the statute book. Will he explain to Members of the Committee what has changed? Perhaps current councillors do not have the quality and skills of the noble Lord. I am sure that that is the case. Will he also explain what is achieved by a clause that depends so much on the chief finance officer? A chief finance officer who is worth his salt or who does the very minimum will do such work and report to members anyway. An orange flag on every local authority's calendar saying, "Keep thinking about what the reserves are", is perfectly appropriate but that need not be imposed by central government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Smith of Leigh: </B>   Will my noble friend clarify the situation with regard to Clause 28? If an authority was carrying out the duties imposed under Clause 28, <P>


<a name="column_GC50"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC50</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>inevitably the information that appears to be required under Clause 27 would be provided as part of the ordinary budget-monitoring process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Let us consider a real-world example. In my authority we used to have a real problem with the home-to-school transport budget. Each year, it seemed to balloon out of control. When I was leader, it grew from about £500,000 to £1.2 million. That had a massive impact on the LEA element of the education budget and meant that there were likely to be resource shortfalls in other parts of the authority's spending. I should have found it bizarre if we had not had a report from the finance team, including the chief finance officer, on the impact of that on our whole budget.
<P>

<a name="30610-11_para13"></a>In this regard, we are saying that we want to ensure that retrospective reporting on those matters&#151;providing us with the lessons&#151;is provided across authorities. That is what the clause will achieve. Of course we see that the best comes from the best. We want to ensure that such reporting is there for everyone, so that there is transparency and a view is expressed that we can understand, so that we can plan better for the future. In ensuring that we have adequate reserves for future years for councils, we must understand what happened in previous years. After all, the auditors' annual management letter does not examine simply what is there in front of them; they look at the audit history and audit trails in the authority so that members can use the best information that is provided to plan for future budgets. That is what we are trying to achieve; it is not complicated.
<P>

<a name="30610-11_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Smith, asked about Clause 28. In that regard, we are trying to ensure that authorities follow good practice, monitor their budgets and take action if necessary when problems are identified. Why are we making budget-monitoring a statutory duty? The reason is plain. The financial difficulties that have affected some authorities recently appear to have been exacerbated by delays in detecting and picking up budgetary problems. A failure to report and understand those reports led to many of those problems. Our hope is that that will be confined to very few authorities. We must ensure that good monitoring processes are in place in all local authorities. That is what the Bill seeks to achieve. We must have such good practice so that members are given the tools with which to do the job so that they can make effective budgetary decisions for future years.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Smith of Leigh: </B>   The Minister misunderstood my question. I was saying that presumably any authority that is carrying out duties under Clause 28, on monitoring budgets, would pick up any changes in levels of reserves. Clause 27 is therefore in a sense redundant. I return to the Minister's old days. If one looks at where expenditure has gone, one has presumably paid for the expenditure in some way. If one has not cut other budgets, presumably it has come out of reserves. That information is made available to <P>

<P>
<A NAME="30610-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   We will come on to Clause 28 again in a moment. At present, the CPA looks at part of the audit system, there is the auditors' management letter and rigorous processes are in place. This part of the Bill, including the level of reserve for this clause and Clause 28, is restrictive; it looks as if the Government wish to nanny local government unnecessarily instead of giving it the freedoms that the Bill is supposed to provide.
<P>

<a name="30610-12_para0"></a>I repeat what I have said and I will carry on repeating it. Whatever party is in power, we, as a Parliament, do not want to restrict local government too narrowly. Other countries do not&#151;indeed, my continuing campaign in life is for us to treat local government as it is treated in other countries. I am sorry to have to say all that again, but I am sure we will come back to this matter. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="30610-12_para5"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 28 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I shall use some of the arguments we have used on previous clauses in speaking against Clause 28 standing part of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30610-12_para6"></a>Clause 28 requires authorities to monitor their budget position and take action where they think the budgetary situation is deteriorating. I will repeat what has just been said&#151;if that happens, what does the Secretary of State think people do all day in local authorities? All of us have very competent financial teams which report to the members. I assure him that a lot of these staff monitor the budgets. Does the Minister really believe that some local authorities do not monitor their budget position during the year?
<P>

<a name="30610-12_para7"></a>I repeat what I said a while ago. I have had some involvement, through the LGA, in some authorities that have not done so well, such as Hackney. The situation has been transparent; members have known about it, but they have not taken the decisions. Officers provided the information in Hackney, but the members did not take the right decisions to rectify the position. Therefore, these provisions do something that is not necessary. If we could legislate to make competent members, that would be a different matter. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>In its comments on this issue, the Select Committee said that the provisions would have no real impact. I hope that this clause does not stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-12_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I think these provisions are about teaching your grandmother to suck eggs. I found it very hard when we discussed it last time to understand why Part 2 has been included. After all, local authorities are already controlled by financial legislation, financial regulations and their members. I appreciate that some buck the trend, but normally it is well understood that they have to work within financial regulations and that the chief finance officer has a very significant and important role to play.
<P>

<a name="30610-12_para8"></a>I am struggling with the whole of Part 2 to understand why this particular bit has been picked out. Why do we not have entirely new financial regulations going across the whole gamut of local authority responsibilities if the Government are so concerned about it? Why pick out these particular aspects which, under normal circumstances, as my noble friend said, we would expect local authorities to deal with properly?
<P>

<a name="30610-12_para9"></a>Chief finance officers' reports have been wilfully ignored in some instances, and I guess Hackney fell into that situation. But that, surely, does not require three major clauses in a new local government Bill. The provisions have to be picked out of the Bill rather than kept together with all the other financial controls and areas that are monitored.
<P>

<a name="30610-12_para10"></a>It is also fair to say that the Audit Commission or the district auditor comment specifically on the reserve. My recollection is that those management letters always had a comment on reserves&#151;whether they were perceived to be adequate, too many, too few, whether they were opaque and whether they should be there in the first place. It is not as if local authorities are not advised about reserves&#151;they are. It is a very specific part of the monitoring process.
<P>

<a name="30610-12_para11"></a>I simply fail to see what justifies the inclusion of these clauses, given all the other aspects of financial control which it is so important that local authorities maintain and consider. I support my noble friend in not wanting Clause 28 to stand part of the Bill. It might be helpful if the Minister gave us some indication as to why the focus has fallen just here. I am sure there are many other parts of local government finance legislation and regulations that could be included in the Bill, if required or necessary. However, it would be equally sensible to leave it all out and leave everything under one piece of legislation or control.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-12_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I think we are agreed that a competent or even moderately good chief finance officer and even moderately diligent members will have regard to these matters. Perhaps I could frame my support for the points being made by asking two questions. First, what in the provision will, in real life, ensure that a chief finance officer does the job if he is not otherwise inclined to? Secondly, what is the sanction for not complying with the clause?

<A NAME="30610-12_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister   (Lord Rooker): </B>  The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, started by saying that he would repeat some of the remarks he made on the previous amendments. In part of my answer, I shall repeat part of what my noble friend said in responding to the amendments, as he quoted some parts of the Explanatory Notes on Clause 28.
<P>

<a name="30610-12_para12"></a>I realise this is upsetting to Opposition Members, but, in all sincerity, I guarantee that these clauses would have been included in a Bill introduced by a Conservative government. I suspect that the same arguments I am about to make would have been made by Conservative Ministers. The point is that they would be in such a Bill because they are wholly justified; they are not there to waste time; and it is not because we do not trust local government.
<P>

<a name="30610-12_para13"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, referred to chief finance officers and, I think, half-diligent members. Some members of local authorities are less than diligent, and this clause places a duty on members rather than officers.
<P>

<a name="30610-12_para14"></a>All well managed authorities monitor their budgets during the year, and if problems are identified they take action. We have to have this longstop&#151;that is all it is&#151;because financial difficulties that have affected some authorities recently have been exacerbated by delays in picking up budgetary problems or by failures to report them to members once officers knew about them. I repeat that this is, in effect, a duty on members. Our hope is that this will be confined to a few authorities, but to be honest, these problems should not be happening anywhere.
<P>

<a name="30610-12_para15"></a>The monitoring process is one of the most fundamental aspects of effective financial management. A duty to monitor the housing revenue account budget during the year has been a statutory requirement since 1990. This clause will impose a similar duty for the general fund budget. Our aim in this clause has been to ensure that the process is carried out, but&#151;and this is the important point&#151;to leave the details and decisions to be taken to the authorities. It is not being prescribed by central government or Parliament. The clause requires that reviews are made from time to time&#151;the frequency is for the authority to decide in the light of its own circumstances and the professional advice of its officers. If a deterioration is identified, it is for the authority to decide what action to take, if any. If the deterioration is minor or has been allowed for in setting the reserves, the authority may decide to use its reserves. In other circumstances, it might decide that remedial action is necessary. Either way, it is for the authority to decide. The purpose of the clause is to ensure that the reviews are done and that they are then considered by the councillors in that authority.
<P>

<a name="30610-12_para16"></a>The clause works by requiring an authority to review the calculation of the budget requirement that it made when deciding its call on council tax. If the review produces a higher budget requirement than when the council tax was set, this constitutes a deterioration, and the duty to consider action to deal with the situation is triggered.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-12_para17"></a>The rather technical-looking subsection (2) simply ensures that any changes in income and expenditure identified in a review are not absorbed by transfers to or from the reserves. Freezing the assumptions on reserve transfers means that predicted changes in income and expenditure carry through to the overall net figure. I think this is wholly reasonable in the circumstances. It is not designed to cause onerous problems for local authorities. It is confined to only a few, but, frankly, these problems should not be happening in any authority. It does not place a burden on the authorities; it certainly puts a duty on members. If there are any half-diligent, or less than fully diligent councillors, this clause will point out to them what their responsibilities were when they were elected to office in the first place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I do not think there is any difference at all between any of us about the desirability of this. However, can the Minister answer my question about the sanction for failing to comply with the duty? I ask that because I am trying to envisage how this would operate in practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   As I have said, the clause puts a duty on members, so we are talking about an authority. As far as a sanction for non-compliance is concerned, the district auditor will determine whether the laws are being obeyed. This would be a legal requirement, but the detail of its implementation is for the authority. Ultimately, if there is a wilful refusal to operate the law and an authority says, "We will not carry out a review from time to time", the district auditor can take action and, if need be, go to the courts to seek enforcement. Indeed, the matter could be dealt with by judicial review if there is a problem.
<P>

<a name="30610-13_para0"></a>I am sure the noble Baroness is not on the side of giving sustenance to councillors who wilfully refuse to review their general budget from time to time. They choose the time and they choose the action as well. They choose how and when the budget is reviewed and they choose the course of action to take. They will obviously seek professional advice if there is a deterioration. I cannot conceive of sanctions being required against the sort of councillors elected these days, but ultimately, the district auditor is always there as a longstop on behalf of the public.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-13_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Of course I do not wish to support the incompetent or the wilful refusal. However, I do not want to see any more words in the statute than are absolutely necessary. After all, there are quite a lot, year on year. Does it come down to this&#151;that the clause gives the district auditor a trigger to do something, but nothing that the district auditor would not do without the clause? It will deal with the wilful refusers, and all that is added in technical terms is that a judicial review might require an authority to take action. Anything else would be triggered, in any event, by the mechanisms of which we have all seen examples over the years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   It would be, but, to return to what I said at the start, we have had very few examples, but there could have been a failure on the part of officers to report to members about a deterioration in the budget. Because the authority has a duty to review from time to time, it catches that situation. Where for various reasons it may have been defensible at the time, the officers did not report to the councillors that there had been a deterioration in the budget, that then brought on a crisis, one exacerbated by further problems. So because normal and reasonable councillors serving on normal and reasonable councils&#151;the vast, overwhelming majority&#151;would operate the clause and review from time to time, in effect that impels officers to report to the members, and the duty is then on those members to take action.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   There is one matter we have touched on, but I do not think that the Minister has referred to it at all because so often he refers to "the council". At present, under the new legislation that has introduced cabinets, the council has only one particular purpose, which is to set a budget. Only once during the year does the council itself become involved in the detail of financial management. That is the case for every council for over 85,000 residents, which embraces most councils in the country. Those 85,000-plus people have cabinets with a member responsible for finance, working closely with the financial officer. As I have said, I know how many councils operate. Most councils would produce a financial report of some kind every month, presented either by the financial officer or by the responsible cabinet member.
<P>

<a name="30610-13_para1"></a>The council itself would not be involved to any degree because it has no powers in these matters other than to set a budget each year. I wonder whether, even in discussing this proposal, that is recognised because over the year the council has no powers itself to change the budget. Therefore, even in the way that the Minister has presented this, that fact has not been recognised; namely, how modern local government has been operating over the past two years. I am afraid that the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, is totally out of date on how councils operate today because this system was not in place in the past.
<P>

<a name="30610-13_para2"></a>Having been involved in the way we operate over the past two years, I have noticed a tremendous change. I hope that the Minister is fully aware that local government is very different since the introduction of the cabinet. Indeed, I have just come from a cabinet meeting in Essex held this morning.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   If I did not know the noble Lord better, I would say that he is starting to filibuster. We are well aware of the changes. When local government structures are changed, surely the powers of the council are delegated either to committees, to officers or to the cabinet. There are scrutiny committees and questions at council meetings. So there are plenty of opportunities. It is absolutely true to say that at one point the full council may meet to endorse the budget to set the council tax, but monitoring carries on throughout the year, whatever the structure.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-13_para3"></a>Not all councils have opted for this system. Some have elected mayors with executive authority. So all those structures still take account of the fact that if there is a deterioration in the budget but the financial reporting system is in place&#151;the clause refers to the "authority"&#151;the authority is in fact the area to which scrutiny has been delegated, such as the finance committee, the scrutiny committee, the cabinet member or the executive mayor, as well as reporting back to the council.
<P>

<a name="30610-13_para4"></a>The clause as drafted takes account of the changes as well as the flexibility in local government structures that we have today, but which certainly was not there either in my noble friend's day or indeed in my day, because I was never there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   We have addressed this whole series of clauses because we feel strongly about them.

With that, I withdraw the Motion that the clause should not stand part of the Bill.

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 13, line 21, after "situation" insert "and the Mayor of London shall report the deterioration to the Chair of the London Assembly"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-13_para7"></a><P>

<a name="30610-13_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: I have already declared my interests to the Committee, including my role as chair of the London Assembly. This is a probing amendment which seeks to understand whether, under Clause 29(3), there is a difference of approach as between the four functional bodies&#151;that is, Transport for London, the Metropolitan Police Authority, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and the London Development Agency&#151;on the one hand and the Greater London Authority, which we have become accustomed to referring to as the "core GLA", on the other. I assume that, in referring to a body, Clause 29(3) includes the core GLA, because otherwise nothing would be left to be the subject of subsection (3)(a).
<P>

<a name="30610-13_para9"></a>In the case of a deterioration of a functional body, Clause 29(3)(b) requires that to be reported to the Mayor and, unusually, to the Chair of the Assembly. I am not sure whether any similar provision is included elsewhere in legislation covering the Chair himself or herself.
<P>

<a name="30610-13_para10"></a>The Chair would not know automatically about a deterioration in the position as regards the core GLA. As it happens, through a budget committee, the Assembly monitors the spending of the GLA, although inevitably that is by nature somewhat retrospective. But it is the Mayor's budget and it is his operation of it, as are the budgets of the functional bodies.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-13_para11"></a>I have moved the amendment largely to determine whether there is a difference in approach and, as a sub-text, to suggest that if one seeks transparency and reporting in the public domain, then a provision such as reporting to the Chair of the Assembly would be helpful to ensure that it actually takes place and the Mayor does put matters into the public domain. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I confess that I had some difficulty understanding the amendment, given how the clause has been drafted. Then again, I do not fully understand the workings of the Greater London Authority or, indeed, the internal politics of the authority. I suspect that the amendment might have more to do with that than with the drafting of the legislation, for reasons that I shall explain.
<P>

<a name="30610-13_para12"></a>Clause 29 places a duty on the Greater London Authority and its functional bodies to monitor their budgets and to consider what action to take if a deterioration is identified. Amendment No. 79A introduces a new duty into Clause 29 requiring the Mayor of London to report to the Chair of the London Assembly if the deterioration is identified in the budget of one of the Greater London bodies.
<P>

<a name="30610-13_para13"></a>The amendment is completely unnecessary. If one of the functional bodies identifies a deterioration, the clause already places a duty on the body to report to the Mayor and to the Chair of the Assembly. If it were a deterioration in the Greater London Authority's own budget, current practice would ensure that it was made known to the Assembly, and the Assembly has sufficient powers to obtain information if there were any resistance.
<P>

<a name="30610-13_para14"></a>Clause 29 was drafted in its present form taking into account a joint response received on the draft Bill agreed by both the Mayor and the Assembly, of which I understand the noble Baroness is a member. The reporting duty proposed in Amendment No. 79A was not requested in that response. I hope, therefore, in the light of this clarification, that the noble Baroness will not pursue her amendment.

<A NAME="30610-14_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I am not much clearer about this point, but I am not sure that we would be able to pursue this matter productively this afternoon. The Minister has said that the Assembly has "sufficient powers". Certainly it has powers to call the Mayor and officers before it to answer questions&#151;of that there is no doubt&#151;but if the Assembly does not know that an issue has been identified then it will not be prompted to call for those questions to be answered.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para0"></a>This is not a matter of internal politics. It is always difficult to convince others that sometimes one simply wants the Authority, as a new piece of government, to work well and to be seen to be proper and transparent. I want to make it clear that this is not a Liberal Democrat attack on the current Mayor. There are other things over which we could attack the Mayor, but this is not a part of that, nor indeed is it an attack on the professionalism of the current officers.

<a name="30610-14_para6"></a><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-14_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I am not telling noble Lords what is going on because I am not seeking any political purpose here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-14_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   The temptation is too great. Three years ago the Mayor of London offered the post of Deputy Mayor to a member of each of the political parties in turn. One party had the offer withdrawn almost immediately and I am sure that the noble Baroness will work out which one that was. Another party, my party, refused the offer before the Mayor could withdraw it. So I can say to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that he does not get up to anything with me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-14_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Today's news is that he has sacked his Deputy Mayor. I mentioned it only because I thought that the noble Baroness would like to know.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para8"></a>I shall move on to Amendment No. 80. The purpose of this amendment is to put questions about the grant and grant powers under Chapter 1 of the expenditure grant. It seeks to probe exactly what are the circumstances under which these powers would be used.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para9"></a>The Explanatory Notes suggest that the expenditure grant is a power that is very wide-ranging, one that would enable any Minister to make a grant to any local authority of either capital or revenue. The notes also suggest that it is a power which, in the future, would largely eliminate the use of specific grants. I am aware that specific grants have been widely criticised by local authorities as their use has increased over the years. Today they make up a significant percentage of a local authority's total grant.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para10"></a>Currently such grants amount to around 15 per cent of the total local government finance settlement. However, in general they have been given to all local authorities for specific purposes and only in the most limited circumstances have they been made available to only a small number of authorities.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para11"></a>It is true that local authorities have long resented specific grants, believing that hypothecation is a contradiction in terms to a block grant. Therefore I <P>


<a name="column_GC59"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC59</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cannot understand why, when this matter was discussed in another place, the Minister said that these powers would be welcomed by local government.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para12"></a>I could just about have understood if the power had been limited to enabling the Minister to pay out grant to, for example, an area hit by a natural disaster&#151;replacing, say, the troubled and complicated Bellwin formula. But the Explanatory Notes make it very clear that that is not the case. Grants under public service agreements are, apparently, in the frame, as are those to a particular class of authority. We are presumably back to our "excellent" and "good" categories under the comprehensive performance assessment&#151;or, more worryingly, would the grants be made to support the poor and the weak?
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para13"></a>However, current legislation enables Ministers in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to make such limited grants in any event. So what is to be included under the clause? Why is it needed? Why is it so widely framed? Any opposition party must be highly suspicious of any legislation that may allow Ministers to do anything they want, when they want. Does the Minister want me to give way?

If she could tell me to which section of which Act she is referring, I can check whether that is the one to which I shall refer or some other provision. That is important in discussing the issue raised by the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-14_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Any Minister already has power to provide specific grants under normal legislation. That is my point: there are already powers in legislation for specific grants, however they are identified.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para14"></a>I was about to make one of the party political points on which the Minister is so keen, and on which I seldom get a chance to shoot back. To repeat: any opposition party must be highly suspicious of any legislation that may allow Ministers to do anything they want, when they want, and which leaves open the possibility of grants being given to favoured councils for undefined purposes. Of course, it is not just ODPM Ministers who will be able to dish out those grants, but any Minister&#151;a matter to be dealt with under further amendments.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para15"></a>Further enlightening words in the Explanatory Notes point out that Treasury approval will be needed for any grant under that heading. In what areas under whose responsibility are applications expected to be made to that august and all-encompassing department? It would help our understanding of the situation if the Minister would explain in detail what is expected under the clause&#151;what it is anticipated to cover&#151;and why those grants currently made as specific grants in the local government finance <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>settlement cannot just be paid as part of the block grant, which is precisely what local government would like, rather than ring-fenced, as they are at present.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para16"></a>My surmise is that the Local Government Association thought that it was welcoming a limited power to pay grants to local authorities for a small number of tightly defined purposes requiring urgent investment, not a sweeping power encompassing about 15 per cent of its total finance. I look forward to hearing the Minister's explanation. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-14_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I have tabled a later probing amendment. I was going to ask then, but perhaps it is appropriate to ask now, whether the Minister can confirm that Sections 88A and 88B of the Local Government Act 1988&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-14_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   No, I am sorry; I thank the noble Baroness for giving way, but she can help me. All these amendments were originally grouped as one block. They have all been degrouped. I did not degroup them. I intend to answer each amendment in order. I shall not make a repeated compendium speech, because I could end up making the same speech on each amendment. I am more than happy to answer the questions, but, with respect, it is not on for the noble Baroness to regroup the amendments while she is on her feet.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-14_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I am not regrouping; I am asking a question pertinent to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. Can the Minister confirm that Sections 88A and 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 will not be repealed? I ask that because that is pertinent to the question of the Baroness about the clause's purpose. As I understand it, those sections, which contain the grant-making provisions, introduced in 1992, will remain on the statute book. That was the sole purpose of my asking the question; I am not trying to speak to my later amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-14_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Perhaps I may speak first to the lead amendment, Amendment No. 80&#151;except that there is no group because Amendment No. 80 now stands on its own. I fully understand why the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked her questions, because under the clause as drafted, subsection (1) could give rise to her thinking that we are up to naughty deeds. We are not.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para17"></a>The new grant-making power in Clause 31 is intended to allow Ministers or the National Assembly to pay grants without imposing undue restrictions on authorities on how they achieve desired outcomes, and so help to ensure that we keep ring-fencing to the absolute minimum necessary. In other words, it is part of the package of trying to reduce ring-fencing. I shall explain why.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para18"></a>Amendment No. 80 would remove Clause 31(1), which gives a Minister of the Crown power to pay a grant to a local authority towards expenditure incurred or to be incurred by it. The amendment would therefore negate the intention of the whole of Clause 31 and its dependent Clauses 32 to 35. We would have <P>


<a name="column_GC61"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC61</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to continue using the cumbersome special grant power under Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 to make unfenced grants.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para19"></a>That in itself encourages the use by some departments of their power to make ring-fenced grants and tends to lead to grant regimes that impose restrictive conditions on local authorities' expenditure decisions. The new power in Clause 31 will make it much easier to give grants that are not ring-fenced. Amendment No. 80 would therefore make it difficult to reduce ring-fencing and to free local authorities from restrictive conditions on grants. The clause provides an important element of the Government's desire to free councils to manage their own business, in line with our principles of public sector reform. We want councils to be responsible for their decisions.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para20"></a>In other words, freeing up the position as set out in Clause 31(1) avoids us having to fall back on Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 to make unfenced grants. However, because that procedure is cumbersome, and because the centralist tendency is always there, some government departments tend to use their powers to stick in ring-fenced grants, with all their rules laid down about what local authorities can and cannot do.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para21"></a>The purpose of the Bill is to give freedom and flexibility to local authorities, so we do not want departments to fall back on their powers to introduce ring-fenced grants under the carpet or through the back door, simply because they do not want to use the Local Government Finance Act 1988&#151;which, without Clause 31(1), would be the only other route. So the provision is not a means for Ministers to spend on a whim&#151;obviously, Treasury approval will be required and Ministers cannot spend on a whim in any event, as the noble Baroness well knows. It is designed to pass the grant money over with the minimum possible conditions&#151;indeed, on some occasions, with no conditions&#151;but for a general purpose. It will be up to the local authority what to do with the money.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para22"></a>Given that we have a host of amendments with which I propose to deal in turn as they are moved, I shall briefly set out the general purpose of Clause 31 before we start to discuss the amendments. That may be useful.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para23"></a>Clause 31 provides a new wide-ranging power for Ministers to make expenditure grants to local authorities. It will create greater flexibility in delivering capital or revenue support to authorities and allow government departments to pay grants without imposing undue restrictions on authorities&#151;as I mentioned.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para24"></a>At present, the only general grant-making power is the "special grant" power under Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, which was, I remind the Committee, the poll tax Act. That was substituted by Section 104 of and Paragraph 18 of Schedule 10 to the Local Government Finance Act 1992. Exercise of that power requires not only Treasury consent but the laying of a report before Parliament for debate in Standing Committee. Once <P>


<a name="column_GC62"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC62</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>approved, a report cannot be amended and any changes required later can be achieved only by laying a new report before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para25"></a>The procedure tends to lead to grant regimes that impose restrictive conditions on local authorities' expenditure decisions. It encourages the use by some departments of their own powers to make ring-fenced grants. We want to avoid that. The new power will make it much easier to give grants that are not ring-fenced.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para26"></a>However, we do not propose to repeal the special grant power, which will remain available for any cases in which it is appropriate to seek Parliament's approval for the award of a grant. We shall also continue to pay revenue support grant under existing powers, thereby preserving Parliament's right to oversee the awards.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para27"></a>As Clauses 31(3) and (4) make clear, conditions may be attached to the grant, which could include expenditure conditions, but there is no need to attach any conditions at all&#151;subject to the circumstances. The structure of the provision is designed to ensure that conditions are attached only as a result of clear policy decisions, rather than arising through default, as is typically the case when departments use their own powers to make ring-fenced grants.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para28"></a>Clause 31(5) requires that, in England, the Treasury's consent will be needed to the exercise of the power. That will be an important safeguard against the imposition of spending conditions unless they are genuinely necessary and beneficial. That will stop Ministers taking that route to ring-fencing. In the short time for which I have been in the ODPM, I have felt a bit of frustration about grants paid.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para29"></a>A good example is the planning delivery grant, which we announced in December. It is not ring-fenced over the three years. It will be paid on the basis of better performance of the planning regimes, but, when the money goes to the authority, the authority can do what it wants with it&#151;planning or anything else. The test of paying the money is an improvement in planning performance, but the money is not ring-fenced. So when the money arrives at the local authority treasurer, the local authority can do what it wants with it. We have tried to step back: to encourage improved performance in that function and to pay the money; but not be prescriptive about how it is spent.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para30"></a>Of course, the presumption is that the authority will already have spent more money to improve its performance to achieve the extra planning delivery grant, but when it receives the grant, it is not ring-fenced. So that is one example of a different kind of flexible regime under which money is paid to local authorities.
<P>

<a name="30610-14_para31"></a>I hope that that helps to set the scene for the clause. I shall be happy to respond in detail to the amendments as they have now been grouped.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply, which was clear but left me almost as confused by its clarity as I was when we started. I now do not understand the need for the power. One problem <P>


<a name="column_GC63"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about specific grants has been precisely what the Minister identified: local authorities have been highly restricted in their use of them. I well remember the mental health grant, for example, under which one was confined as to what could be done. Ultimately, it was absorbed into the local government finance settlement, after it had run its course.
<P>

<a name="30610-15_para0"></a>If specific grants are not really part of the Government's thinking, I do not understand why the power is required at all. Ministers could include whatever they want as part and parcel of the local government finance settlement and the money that local authorities receive. If grant is to be allowed to be used for any purpose at all, I do not understand why the power is necessary. If it is only to control Ministers, it may just have some benefit, but I suspect that they are not its prime target.
<P>

<a name="30610-15_para1"></a>I understand that there are times when there are urgent, emergency reasons&#151;natural disasters or something else catastrophic&#151;that would normally fall under the Bellwin formula. But, as far as I understand it, the Bellwin formula will still apply. So that is not what this is about. It is about additional money that is being given to some local authorities to be used for any purpose, irrespective of why it is provided and by which Minister. I still find that extremely strange. The fact that this matter will not even come before Parliament before the grants are agreed makes the whole thing even more disturbing.
<P>

<a name="30610-15_para2"></a>Unless I have completely misunderstood&#151;not wilfully&#151;the Minister's remarks, it seems to me that this grant-making power is not necessary, because of the wide way in which the Government are now looking at money to be given to local authorities, in what would truly be a block grant. It would be welcome were the Minister to tell me that we are returning to a true block grant, enabling local authorities to use it for whatever purpose, in whatever way and in whatever proportion they believe to be right. If that were correct, we should perhaps be getting somewhere. But in that case this power would be unnecessary. I remain very sceptical, and quite confused, about the benefits of this power, particularly when it is so wide-ranging.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I want to be able to guarantee&#151;but I can never guarantee anything&#151;that by the time we discuss Amendment No. 95, the final amendment on Clause 31, everything will be clear. As we give a reasonable explanation in response to each of the Opposition amendments, the picture will form as to how Clause 31 operates. It is difficult. Were the amendments grouped together I could read out all the notes, but they have been split up and we should do better to deal with them separately.
<P>

<a name="30610-15_para3"></a>Perhaps I may give an example, which I hope will be helpful, of the use of other powers. Section 93 of the Local Government Act 2000 is used to make various health grants to local authorities. But grants made under the power must, according to the legislation, be spent on health and social services. Those grants are <P>


<a name="column_GC64"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC64</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>therefore inherently ring-fenced. The new power under Clause 31 will avoid this. It will in effect replace mainstream funding.
<P>

<a name="30610-15_para4"></a>We are trying to move back from ring-fencing. We are not giving local authorities money to do anything that they want. The functions of local authorities are prescribed by Parliament anyway&#151;some are statutory, some are non-statutory. But we want to reduce the amount of ring-fencing. It ties local authorities. They can have several streams of ring-fenced money, some of which are fully used, some of which are under-used. There is no possibility of vying between the two. Ring-fencing curtails and restricts the freedoms and flexibility of local government, and that is what the Bill is designed to open up and avoid. It is part of the process of trusting local government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   Would this be the beginning of the end of ring-fencing? I refer, for example, to the Bill dealing with bed-blocking. If local authorities are able to be fined for bed-blocking, will the Secretary of State for Health give local authorities some money in the first instance specifically to help with the problem? Would that kind of ring-fencing cease under this clause? Is it intended that money should go to local authorities and that they might then use it for different purposes?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   First, I cannot talk about what is happening at present: the powers will come into operation only when the Bill is enacted. On the other hand, the example that I have given&#151;the planning delivery grant&#151;requires parliamentary approval. It is a good example of where we wanted to see improvements in the performance of local authorities. The question of bed-blocking is slightly different: on the one hand, NHS beds are being blocked, but on the other hand there are the social services, so one is vying between the two. I shall take advice, but it may well be the case that in such circumstances the Secretary of State could pay the grant to the local authorities with a view to solving the bed-blocking problem, and do it under this power. But the local authority would have to perform. There would have to be a measure of the outcome; namely, whether it had solved the bed-blocking problem. However, the number of beds or pillows that are ordered, the number of bureaucrats who are put on the job, which ambulances and which particular buildings are used are all restrictions in terms of the ring-fenced grant. Incidentally, none of the grant can be used outside the direct limits that we have given. That could come under the terms of the Bill and make the system far easier to use and, at the end of day, much more effective.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-15_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister for that explanation. I am breathless to see whether, by the time we reach Amendment No. 95, we shall have solved the problem. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-15_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>   moved Amendment No. 81:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 14, line 25, leave out "A Minister of the Crown" and insert "The Secretary of State"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-15_para6"></a><P>

<a name="30610-15_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 87. The Minister indicates that he was expecting me to do so and that it will not cause confusion in terms of his briefing.
<P>

<a name="30610-15_para8"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to probe why such a wide-ranging power should be given to any number of Ministers of the Crown. We have discussed to some extent the fact that grants will come from various departments, and that may be the explanation. But we also want to ascertain which departments are to be included and why such grants should be subject to the Treasury and not also to the Secretary of State who has responsibility for the particular area.
<P>

<a name="30610-15_para9"></a>In reply to the previous amendment, the Minister gave some examples but was not specific about the departments that are likely to be involved. The amendment gives him another chance to be so, and a further chance to explain clearly and specifically before we reach Amendment No. 95 what the intention is. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   There is a simple, short explanation. Amendment No. 81 would mean that only a department that had a Secretary of State could use the new grant-making power in Clause 31. This would mean that any department that did not have a Secretary of State but had a Minister would not be able to use the power. The Lord Chancellor's Department would fall into this category.
<P>

<a name="30610-15_para10"></a>Prior to the change in May last year, when MAFF became DEFRA, MAFF did not have a Secretary of State; it was a Whitehall department with a Minister but no Secretary of State. Therefore, in those circumstances the power could not have been used. DEFRA does have a Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="30610-15_para11"></a>Amendment No. 87 would restrict the determination of the amount and the manner of payment of a grant under Section 31(1) to a Secretary of State. Again, it would mean that this power was unusable by, for example, at the present time, the Lord Chancellor's Department. That is the reason, and that is the answer to the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-15_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-15_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>   moved Amendment No. 82:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 14, line 26, leave out "incurred or"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-15_para13"></a><P>

<a name="30610-15_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of the amendment is to remove the provision allowing for grant to be made to a local authority for expenditure incurred by it in the past. This power would presently allow a government to make payment retrospectively&#151;potentially to bail out an authority which had incurred expenditure for which it might or might not have had government authorisation or had <P>


<a name="column_GC66"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC66</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>got itself into trouble. This is potentially a kind of National Enterprise Board for the 21st century, except that it would be bailing out failed councils rather than failed companies.
<P>

<a name="30610-15_para15"></a>Such exceptional central powers should not be retrospective. Retrospective power is a dangerous thing. It is not normally favoured in our law and it puts pressure on Ministers to intervene where otherwise they might not. We have now established that the Minister intervening would not necessarily be the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="30610-15_para16"></a>The wide-ranging powers in this clause, if they are to be used at all, should be used only on the basis of the most scrupulous and objective conditions. Ideally, they should be subject to proper forward planning as any other use of taxpayers' money. So, I put my questions again: how exactly is it planned to use the retrospective power, or how does the Minister see it being used, and how retrospective can it be? Could a grant be made under the clause for some pet project&#151;I have noted the example of Brighton Council; I cannot think why. On the face of it, it could be. There has to be some cut-off, limit or control.
<P>

<a name="30610-15_para17"></a>I will move from the example of Brighton to that of Haringey council. It cannot be right that a Minister can say: "Haringey has got itself into a mess by over-spending on a particular project. Let's give it a grant to get it out of trouble", without proper scrutiny of the situation. This provision potentially leaves a Minister or the Government open to charges of partiality or bias. Furthermore, it is not a proper use of taxpayers' money. The powers in this clause, if they are used at all, should be forward-looking, open and planned. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   Perhaps I may add to my noble friend's point. I accept what the Minister has said; namely, that this provision will do away with the problem of ring-fencing and enable money to be given to local authorities in a wider way. But that does not apply to expenditure that has already been incurred. Therefore, this seems to be a different point from the one that the Minister has explained as regards why the Government want this power.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   That is the reason that I shall give the answer that I am going to give.
<P>

<a name="30610-16_para0"></a>I do not want to be ungallant, but it is a long time since I heard anyone mention the National Enterprise Board, so the noble Baroness is showing her age!

<P>

<A NAME="30610-16_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I do it all the time!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Amendment No. 82 would mean that the new grant-making power in Clause 31 could be used only to make grants to a local authority towards expenditure,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to be incurred by it",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-16_para1"></a>
not towards expenditure "already incurred". This would therefore preclude reimbursement grants, where a local authority incurs some cost and the Government subsequently pay to the authority some or all of the expenditure incurred. An example would <P>


<a name="column_GC67"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC67</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be where the Government want to compensate authorities, say, for the extra costs of looking after asylum seekers, where, because of their peripatetic nature, it is not possible accurately to predict future expenditure need. Amendment No. 82 would mean that we should need to continue to pay reimbursement grants through Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 or some other specific power, where available, which tends to cause delays in the payment of the grant to the affected authority and limits the flexibility with which the grant might be used.
<P>

<a name="30610-16_para2"></a>That is the simple explanation. I repeat that the grants will not be paid without Treasury approval, and, as we shall see in relation to Clause 32, authorities are required to provide information to Ministers before such grants are made. So this is not a matter of doling out money on pet projects. I am not going to be wound up by this constant sniping of a crude political fashion. Labour Ministers do not fund "pet projects". I hope that Tory Ministers did not do so. That would be outwith the conduct of public life in this country. We did not do it previously, and we are not going to do it now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-16_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister. I am rather enjoying these amendments. They provide me with the first opportunity in a long time to have a dig at the Minister and for him to have a dig at me!
<P>

<a name="30610-16_para3"></a>The more the Minister talks and the more the explanations come, the less I understand why Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act is not being amended under this legislation. What is happening now is that there will be almost contradictory legislative powers running in parallel.
<P>

<a name="30610-16_para4"></a>The Minister's comments on grants in relation to asylum seekers relate to what I had understood the subsection to be; namely, a permissive power for the Minister to help in a specific situation. No one could have initially foreseen what would happen in relation to asylum seekers. Local authorities were faced with a very serious situation and great financial outlay. In such a situation the provision would be perfectly proper and I would not have sought such an amendment. This is not just about that. We are talking about specific grants in totality. Therefore, it is such a wide power that it should fall under Section 88B of the Local Government Act 1988; and within the ordinary finance settlement. There would be exceptions, such as asylum seekers or natural disasters&#151;I almost put those in the same category and in the same breath. I would then understand the power. But we are beyond that. The reimbursement powers, as described by the Minister, in this very wide power to get rid of specific grants, seem too wide for the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-16_para6"></a><P>

<a name="30610-16_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that any grants are made on objectively published criteria; that they are certified by the department's permanent secretary; and that they are subject to the fullest possible scrutiny. That would become an onerous burden in the light of the wide-ranging powers that the Minister described. However, where there is scope for selective grants to individual authorities, it must be right to ensure that there is no question of the powers being used selectively.
<P>

<a name="30610-16_para8"></a>The amendment would prevent the Government writing special rules for an individual authority. I hear what the Minister says about governments not abusing these powers. But under them there will be times when an individual authority can be given money. So the amendment would prevent the Government writing the special rules which the Explanatory Notes that say they may want to do. They might want to give some special grants.
<P>

<a name="30610-16_para9"></a>We return to how to ensure that there is fair play on the special grants and that the sweeping power would be double-locked, so that it could be seen to be fair. I do not see why the Government should object to that, which would safeguard Ministers against any accusation of unfairness. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   As the noble Baroness said, Amendment No. 83 aims to ensure that grants made under the new power in Clause 31 are available on the same terms to all authorities of the same category. The department's accounting officer has publicly certified those terms. However, the amendment would limit the use of the powers in Clause 31. It would be odd indeed were the Government, having determined the eligibility conditions for a grant, then not to use those conditions in distributing the grant. If there is a set of conditions for a grant to be distributed to authorities, we would be daft not to use them.
<P>

<a name="30610-16_para10"></a>There may be circumstances in which a grant would appropriately be made to one particular authority. I understand&#151;I do not know the background to this; I am just asking about it&#151;that Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1998, about which the noble Baroness obvioulsy knows a great deal more than I do, so if I am not careful I shall get my legs chopped off, has been used in that way in the past.
<P>

<a name="30610-16_para11"></a>Parliament agreed that an additional grant should be provided to the London Borough of Hackney to aid the authority's revenues. That was an exceptional case, which met the Government's criteria for giving additional financial support as set out in the local government White Paper. Without the £25 million Hackney could not have agreed a balanced budget for 2002&#150;03 and would have been unable to start building future financial stability. Although it would be appropriate for a grant to be made in such extreme circumstances through the existing special grant power in Section 88B of the 1988 Act, there may be less extreme cases in which it would be appropriate to use Clause 31 to make a grant to one authority only. The amendment would preclude that.

<P>

<a name="30610-16_para12"></a>So I must say that I stand here naked in knowing nothing about Hackney&#151;the past, the present or what is expected in the future, or how the money was paid. I presume that it was ring-fenced, in the sense that the authority had obviously got itself into a mess and the money was to get itself out of it. I presume that it was not given without strings. Furthermore, it is quite clear that the process used was one that Parliament approved as a one-off payment. That is the example that I cite, although I do not have the background. But that was a wholly exceptional case.
<P>

<a name="30610-16_para13"></a>We want to retain the flexibility of the clause, in case there is a need to use it, instead of using the Section 88B powers, in which of course Parliament would be involved. That is the point. The point is not to circumvent Parliament, but there could be occasions when one authority, because of whatever special circumstances have arisen, would receive a one-off grant in circumstances that would be known to everyone. The grants would not be paid in secret. Information, as I have said, would have to be provided to Ministers before the grants were paid.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-16_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. I think what he said was that in the event of something being quite specific and quite unusual, the process involve what I have actually asked him to provide: it would ensure that there was proper support and agreement for it. We shall not go further into Hackney. It involved a specific situation&#151;none of its services were working well. I think that anyone would agree that that was quite a different case. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30610-16_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: We reach the point about whether Parliament is or is not included in the new grant regime. The purpose of the amendments is to test the reasons why the Secretary of State want such wide-ranging discretionary powers, and, if he does, to subject the use of those powers to control by affirmative resolution of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30610-16_para17"></a>It cannot be right that selective, discretionary powers of that kind should be exercised by Ministers alone. If included in primary legislation, grants to specific authorities but not others would be hybrid, requiring the very highest level of parliamentary scrutiny. Such potentially discriminatory powers should not be exercisable at the Secretary of State's pleasure. All rules surrounding them should be open to parliamentary control and that control should be achieved by affirmative resolution.
<P>

<a name="30610-16_para18"></a>We return to where we started when we suggested that there are two forms of grants. There are specific grants, which any department may give and which would be included as a specific grant in the Local Government Finance Act 1988; and there are grants which may be given on a discretionary basis for a particular reason. If the grant is given as part of the <P>

<A NAME="30610-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I apologise in advance that I shall take some time to work through the amendments, but I will try to give the noble Baroness a full response.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para0"></a>The new grant-making power in Clause 31 is intended to allow Ministers or the National Assembly to pay grants without imposing undue restrictions, in line with our freedoms and flexibilities approach, to authorities as they achieve desired outcomes, and so help to ensure that we keep ring-fencing to a minimum. For that reason, the LGA is very supportive.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para1"></a>The amendments would defeat one of the main aims of the provision, which is to offer an alternative, so that departments are able to make non-ring-fenced grants available to local government. Amendments Nos. 86, 89 and 91 would require a procedure that is even more cumbersome than the present special grant procedure, which requires the grant to be approved only by the House of Commons. That would be needed for every grant, including small or uncontroversial grants, or those being repeated from previous years.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para2"></a>Amendment No. 86 would mean that the amount and manner of payment of a grant made under Clause 31 would have to be considered and approved by both Houses of Parliament. Therefore, it would defeat one of the main aims of the new power, which is to make it easier to make grants without conditions.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para3"></a>Amendment No. 89 would mean that any conditions on a grant made under Clause 31 would need to be set out in an order and approved by both Houses of Parliament. I have sympathy with the evident aim of the amendment, which is to make it more difficult to place controls on a grant which would make it ring-fenced. But the Government have put in place separate machinery&#151;a gateway process&#151;to ensure that there will be no new ring-fenced grants that do not meet a set of criteria set out in the local government White Paper, Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services. Where a conditional grant is made, that will be as a result of clear policy decisions.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para4"></a>Amendment No. 91 would mean that both Houses of Parliament would need to approve the terms of any grants made using the powers in Clause 31. Amendments Nos. 91, 89 and 86 will make it more likely that departments will continue to use their own specific grant-making provisions, which may include more restrictions than are necessary.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para5"></a>In a previous discussion on Clause 31 in another place, some Members were concerned that that power will mean that Parliament would no longer be able to consider grants to local authorities. In England, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>parliamentary approval will still be needed in the ambit of each department's request for resources. Parliamentary approval will still be sought for the local government finance settlement each year, which provides the majority of funding to local government. In addition, the special grant power will remain available for any cases where it is appropriate to seek Parliament's approval for the award of a grant.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para6"></a>In England, where the new power is used to make grants, the Treasury's consent will be needed, which is an important safeguard against the imposition of spending conditions unless they are genuinely necessary and beneficial.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para7"></a>Amendment No. 88 relates to Clause 31(3). It states that a grant made,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"under this section may be paid on such conditions as the Minister . . . may determine".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-17_para8"></a>
The amendment, which deletes the word "such", would seem to make no change to the meaning of the clause but simply make it ungrammatical.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para9"></a>Amendment No. 84 would remove Clause 31(2), which gives a Minister of the Crown the power to determine the amount of a grant made under Clause 31(1) and the manner of its payment. The amendment would make the power unusable because a Minister could make a grant but could not determine its amount or how it is paid. The amendment would therefore negate the purpose of Clause 31. We would have to continue using the cumbersome special grant power under Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 to make non-ring-fenced grants. As with the other amendments, that would encourage the use by some departments of their own powers to make such grants. That tends to lead to grant regimes which impose restrictive conditions on local authorities' expenditure plans and decisions. So Amendment No. 84 would make it more difficult to reduce ring-fencing and would counter our efforts to free up local authorities from the overly restrictive conditions that exist with some grants.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para10"></a>I apologise for taking the Committee's time, but it was necessary to go through the impact of the amendments in some detail. I hope that, on reflection, the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<A NAME="30610-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I am extremely grateful to the Minister for also replying to Amendment No. 85, which I have not moved. But he has done so, which saves me having to go through the words. I think that he is just trying to hurry me up, rather than anything else.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para11"></a>The Minister's reply just makes larger the question of why specific grants are being left in Section 88B of the Local Government Act 1988. If the power will mean that one does not require the restrictions on the grant for the specific reasons for which it has been given, then why on earth not just remove Section 88B and get rid of the power to make specific grants, which is what the complaint is all about? Local government is not happy with specific grants and never has been. To have those powers removed so that Ministers can <P>

<P>

<a name="30610-17_para12"></a>I am now even less clear on why we should have this provision, in addition to Section 88B, if we are trying to reduce the power of restriction and provide more flexibility. Either specific grants under Section 88B will become totally irrelevant and that power will never be used, or this power will be used, or there will be a hotchpotch of the two.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para13"></a>I think that the amendments have achieved some enlightenment, as they were intended to do. However, I do not know why the Local Government Association is not leaping up and down about the issue. Specific grants will still exist, and this provision will probably be used in limited circumstances. I do not think that the situation which the Minister described is the one that he intends to achieve. Nevertheless, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-17_para15"></a><P>

<a name="30610-17_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment proposes leaving out subsections (3) and (4) which allow conditions to be applied to the making of grants. I think that both Ministers have said that the new provision will allow grants to be made without undue restrictions&#151;which is wholly consistent with what was said in the Commons. We applaud the reduction of restrictions and the reduction of ring-fencing. However, like the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, I am still puzzled about which of the Bill's provisions will ensure that. We know that Section 88B of the 1988 Act is not to be repealed. I would feel much more comfortable about the proposals if it were repealed. We have heard about other Secretaries of State having the right to make grant. As I understand it, no other similar provision is to be repealed.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para17"></a>Under Clause 31(3), the grant,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may be paid on such conditions as the Minister . . . may determine".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-17_para18"></a>I wonder whether the Minister can explain how that differs from Section 88B(7) of the 1988 Act, which says that a special grant "may" specify conditions that the Secretary of State intends to impose. Does the "may" in the 1988 Act mean "must"? Do both "mays" mean "may", or do both mean "must"? I hope that that is a clear question.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para19"></a>By way of a small but not unimportant illustration I should like to cite an example which came to my attention today, regarding the cost incurred by fire authorities in implementing the Bain recommendations as part of the settlement that we hope will soon be achieved in the fire dispute. Implementing the recommendations will cost quite a lot; I understand that the cost to the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority will be not far short of £500,000 in the current year. It is hoped, of course, that a grant will be made to enable the fire authority to meet that cost. The Minister need not look worried; I am not <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>going to ask him to respond to any of the details. My point is that the fire authority and other brigades will need to take their own decisions on how best to spend the sums required to move into the new regime anticipated by Bain of prevention and of making appliances available to meet new criteria. If you like, it is about local autonomy.
<P>

<a name="30610-17_para20"></a>Although that is perhaps not a good example, it is a concern which illustrates why we want as little restriction as possible. As we have heard, we do not want undue restrictions. I beg to move.

If the grant is going to be paid on conditions, where goes this business of getting rid of the ring-fencing and the specific grants?

I am therefore not sure that we are freeing up anything.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I think that we all understand the impact of the amendment. The clauses as drafted allow Ministers to put conditions on a grant. The amendment would in particular remove provision as to the use of the grant and the circumstances in which it must be repaid. The amendment would ensure that only unfenced grants with no conditions could be made under the new power. I find it difficult to believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, wants to achieve that end or thinks that it would be a sensible instrument of policy. However, perhaps she thinks that we should establish such a regime of extreme liberality in local government finance.
<P>

<a name="30610-18_para0"></a>The effect would be that ring-fenced grants approved on policy grounds would continue to be made under departments' own specific grant-making powers, which may be more restrictive than necessary, or under the less flexible general Section 88B power in the Local Government Finance Act 1988. I think that that is the point of our proposals. That particular provision is less flexible. I think that that was one of the noble Baroness's concerns.
<P>

<a name="30610-18_para1"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked a couple of specific questions which I shall try to deal with in turn. Both Section 88B and the new power can make grants with no conditions&#151;unfenced&#151;or with conditions, ring-fenced. We have separate machinery in place to ensure that departments do not make conditions when those are not justified. That machinery is called the gateway process. My understanding is that the Local Government Association is very much in favour of Clause 31, which it regards as an important statement and method of working. Specific grants need not be ring-fenced. They can have conditions in relation to which <P>


<a name="column_GC74"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authorities receive them but still no conditions as to how they are spent. Reward grants, for example, fall into that category. Other examples are the planning grant, which has already mentioned, and the LPSA performance reward grant.
<P>

<a name="30610-18_para2"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, picked us up on the use of the word "may". The usage of "may" in Section 88B(7) is the same as that in Clause 31(3) and means "may" and not "must"&#151;conditions "may" be imposed. So there is a similarity. I know that there is always a fog over matters of local government finance, but I hope that that has cleared up at least some of it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-18_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I am afraid that it has not. At least we have learned that "may" means "may". I assume that the gateway process could apply to grants made under either provision. It does not surprise me that the LGA is in favour of anything involving grant money going to local authorities. It is not so much that I am not persuaded of the value of a grant-making power; it is that I do not understand the basis on which the achievements are claimed.
<P>

<a name="30610-18_para3"></a>I am persuaded that omitting the reporting provisions in Section 88B is a good thing. As I said before, however, I would be more convinced if Section 88B were to go entirely. I am not suggesting that Ministers should not have any rights at all to impose conditions, if only because I recognise reality. It is not even necessary to say that they may impose conditions because that is implicit. If conditions were not agreed to by a local authority the money would not go to them; so QED.
<P>

<a name="30610-18_para4"></a>My perplexity is not fully addressed. I shall go away and find some hot towels after the debate. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="30610-18_para14"></a>Amendment No. 92 would require the grant to be reported as a special grant report under Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 within five months. It would mean using the cumbersome Section 88B power in every case. I have previously explained that process. That would involve using it for very small or uncontroversial grants, or those being repeated from previous years. With the amendment, a grant made under the new power could be struck down after it had been paid by some later decision by Parliament not to approve the special grant. That would mean uncertainty and delay for local government.

<a name="30610-18_para15"></a>In a previous discussion of Clause 31 in another place, some were concerned that that power will mean that Parliament would no longer be able to consider grants to local authorities.

Throughout our debate on the clause he has agreed to the need for that. Amendment No. 93 asks for a list of the grants being made under Clause 31; under what head they would be made and whether they were unusual or significant; and what their purpose was. That is a routine task. As the Minister said, the Local Government Act comes before Parliament but the amendments would require that those grants that have been given under the power to be listed. I am sure that the Minister will not object to that.

<a name="30610-18_para20"></a>Amendment No. 94 complements and reinforces Amendment No. 93; it takes up the same point. At least the general rules of the general settlement should apply to everyone equally if the grant is equal&#151;if it is a specific grant across the board. If it has been given not across the board but to a particular authority, the explanation under the list would be different. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Amendment No. 93 would require the Secretary of State to publish on an annual basis a table giving details on all grants paid under the new power in Clause 31. We do not believe that there is any need for such a requirement in legislation for reasons that I will explain. We already make information available, as noble Lords would expect us to want to do. For local authorities overall, one of the key tables provided at the time at which Parliament considers the annual local government finance revenue settlement sets out all known relevant special and specific revenue grants to be paid to councils each year. Each grant is listed separately together with the size of the grant. We will add those grants made under Clause 31 to that list. We also provided a list of grants as part of our announcement on freedoms and flexibilities. For individual authorities, we will look to consider setting out the allocations for individual authorities at the time that grants are made.
<P>

<a name="30610-18_para21"></a>For example, a circular by the Department of Health that was issued at the time of the provisional local government finance settlement set out the allocations to councils for those grants that were announced at that time. The purpose of the grant will be made available at the time at which the grants are announced. We also draw together information on grants in a variety of forms in response to Parliamentary Questions of both Houses. Those reflect Members' interests at the time.

<a name="30610-18_para22"></a>We do not publish the political control of the authority at the time at which the grant was made and do not believe that it would be appropriate or practical to do so for reasons that I will explain. Grants are given on the basis of need and not on the basis of political control, which, in any case, changes over time. Information on the political control of authorities is publicly available but grants are not until we make them and publish them. Prescribing some particular set of information to be published each year would add no benefit.
<P>

<a name="30610-18_para23"></a>Amendment No. 94 would make it unlawful for the Secretary of State even to consider the political control of an authority in reaching decisions on the use of the power. It would require certification to Parliament by Ministers and officials that the political control of a local authority had not been taken into account, and so on. This is an unnecessary amendment because Treasury approval is already required to the use of the power. The Treasury will be exercising control over the grants made under Clause 31 and will need to be satisfied that there is proper justification for the amount of the grant, the manner of its payment and any conditions imposed on its payment. The payment of grant under that power will depend entirely on the eligibility criteria for the grant and not on the political control of the authority, which may, in any event, be subject to change.
<P>

<a name="30610-18_para24"></a>Local authorities could, if so advised, seek judicial review of any distribution of grant moneys under Clause 31 if it appeared that the basis of distribution was tied to the political control of the local authorities concerned. The change proposed by the amendment is not found in the legislation governing the revenue support grant, which provides the majority of local government funding&#151;several billion pounds a year&#151;to local authorities. It is also not present in the grant-making power under Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988. We believe for those reasons and for practical reasons that that would be inappropriate. It would introduce an unnecessary bureaucratic requirement of a certificate to Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30610-18_para25"></a>On the thrust of Amendment No. 93, we will add the grants under Clause 31 to the list that is already published so that everyone can see them at the appropriate time.

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC78</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clause might be acceptable if the purpose of Clause 31 was limited but, as we have discussed in relation to preceding amendments, it is clearly not. It contains a wide-ranging power. The Minister will be familiar with the details. The Explanatory Notes, if nothing else, make it clear that the clause does not contain a limited power. This is an open door to endless paperwork and additional information. If the power related to specific powers in general, the various departments&#151;as we now know it to be&#151;should have virtually all the information that they need from general returns. That sounds as though a generalised fishing expedition would result from any use of the power, whether on a wide or narrow basis, probably resulting in unnecessary bureaucracy.
<P>

<a name="30610-19_para5"></a>I am sure that the Minister will tell us that it would not be like that really, and that the requirement for information would be restricted only to a particular aspect, and so on. However, that is not what the clause says.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-19_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Really?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Yes. In a way, I am absolutely astonished that Clause 32 is in the Bill. I am amazed by the idea that it was necessary to include it in the Bill. I should have thought that there was loads of legislation involving what Ministers could ask local authorities, such as, "What are you doing on this, that or the other?". That happens all the time. We write letters asking for information. We are always told by officials, "Do not put burdens on local authorities. We must not ask them for too much information", and so on.
<P>

<a name="30610-19_para9"></a>The power is specific to Clause 31. Someone obviously thought that it was necessary to include it in the Bill; one needs information to operate the clause. Applications for a grant can be on a one-off basis from the authority or Ministers may have an idea about a new scheme that requires a grant; one needs information or some eligibility criteria on which to pay the grant but not necessarily to ring-fence it. I should have thought that there were loads of ways in which <P>


<a name="column_GC79"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC79</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ministers could get information from local authorities in order to set that up. Parliamentary counsel must think otherwise; if not, it would not have included the clause in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30610-19_para10"></a>That is all I have to say, really. I feel totally and utterly inadequate that I cannot give chapter and verse about why Clause 31 could not have been added to all the other thousands of pages of legislation in which Ministers ask local government for information. That would enable us to say, "Under Section 31", as it may turn out to be, "Ministers can ask for that information". However, that clearly was not thought to be appropriate. Inadequate though I feel the answer is&#151;in fact, if I were in opposition, I should not accept it&#151;it is the best that I can do, I am afraid.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-19_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Whatever parliamentary counsel may be, does the Minister agree that it is not a very good psychologist? Is not the short point that if a Minister wanted information to assist in a decision to make a grant under Clause 31 and the local authority did not give it, that authority would not get the dosh?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   No. The Minister may have paid the grant and then thought one day, "I wonder whether I got the outcome that I required from the grant?". There is an outcome to be measured. I have said that there is no problem with this; ring-fencing is not the same as measuring the outcome. Ring-fencing is highly prescriptive but the grants are paid for a purpose. Ministers should be able to check on the purpose. I return to planning. In due course&#151;it may be in the next Session&#151;the House will receive the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill. Another place is debating it today&#151;it should be done with by now&#151;and I hope that the carry-over Motion will be agreed to.
<P>

<a name="30610-19_para11"></a>This is a classic example. We want to be able to measure the outcomes in improvement in planning performance without being prescriptive about how the money is spent, so the authority needs to be able to do that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-19_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I agree that measuring outcomes is hugely important, although, given that Clause 31 is about paying the grant rather than reviewing it, I wonder whether Clause 32(1) achieves that. I am not sure whether I should not shut up, however, because I might be on the way to suggesting to Parliamentary Counsel that further duties are imposed on local authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-19_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My understanding of the procedures of this Committee is that if everyone agrees to an amendment, it can be accepted. Is the Minister agreeing with me, after all that conversation, that Clause 32 is not a useful part of the Bill and we could therefore remove it, or will I be forced to bring it back on Report for the Minister to agree once again that it is not very valuable? I hope that the Minister might agree with me that it should not be part of the Bill and therefore this amendment might succeed.

<FONT SIZE=3>Bill. I have to trust Parliamentary Counsel, given the amount of legislation. I know the way they work: they would not put in a Bill something that duplicates a measure in another Bill. A golden rule of Parliamentary Counsel is not to legislate twice for the same thing, because one thing is for sure&#151;one aspect will be challenged and it will lead to confusion. So it must be the case that in no other legislation is there a power that would fit this one. Therefore, I have to demand that the clause stand part of the Bill, even though I feel inadequate in the way I have explained it. I genuinely mean that&#151;I should have paid more attention to this and got further and better particulars from my learned friends behind me.
<P>

<a name="30610-19_para12"></a>Clause 32 agreed to.
<P>

<a name="30610-19_para13"></a>Clause 33 [Application to Greater London Authority]:
<P>

<a name="30610-19_para14"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 33 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-19_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   This Motion is intended to probe the special provisions under Clause 33 for grants made to the Greater London Authority. Clause 31(1) gives the Secretary of State wide-ranging powers to pay a grant to a local authority. The local authority may subsequently transfer this grant to any functional body which requires funding for expenditure incurred. Clause 33 seems to confuse the matter. Under subsection (2), the Secretary of State may set conditions in any grant to the Greater London Authority which requires the Mayor to transfer funds to a particular local authority. Or, under subsection (5), the Mayor may receive a grant which he can decide either to transfer to a functional body or not, as he thinks fit.
<P>

<a name="30610-19_para15"></a>Is the Greater London Authority devolved or not? Under Clause 31, the Secretary of State may already pay grants directly to functional bodies. So there are two options: first, that the grant has passed through the Mayor, with or without conditions about its final use, depending on whether or not Clause 33(2) has been applied. The second is that the Secretary of State has cut out the middle man&#151;the Mayor&#151;and pays a grant directly to a functional body under the control of the Greater London Authority, which we all know is not a local authority.
<P>

<a name="30610-19_para16"></a>Can the Minister explain why there are two options and on what basis the Secretary of State is to choose which one he uses? The drafting seems to be rather confusing and obscure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-19_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I shall not repeat the questions the noble Baroness has asked which occurred to me as well. In subsection (5), I would particularly ask about another use of the word "may". One would have expected it to be "shall" or "must" in this context rather than "may". This does not quite seem to fit with the thrust of this part of the Bill. I am one of those who supports the autonomy of the Mayor. I am certainly not arguing against grants to the GLA or for the functional bodies, but I should like to understand the workings of this clause better.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-19_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   In effect, Clause 33 slightly adapts the grant-making power in Clause 31 for the purpose of <P>


<a name="column_GC81"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC81</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the GLA. This is to take account of the special relationship of the Greater London Authority with its four functional bodies, namely, Transport for London, the Metropolitan Police Authority, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and the London Development Agency.
<P>

<a name="30610-19_para17"></a>The grant power will operate in basically the same way as for other authorities, but any grants intended for the functional bodies will have to be paid via the Mayor of London. As Clause 33(4) makes clear, if a grant is earmarked by a Minister for one of the four bodies, the Mayor will have to pass it on to the named body immediately. Clause 33(5) allows Ministers also to pay grants to the Mayor which are not earmarked for any of the four bodies. In that case, the Mayor would have the option of using the grant himself&#151;not personally, of course&#151;or distributing it in a way he thought fit between the bodies.
<P>

<a name="30610-19_para18"></a>This modification to the grant power for the GLA reflects the current arrangement for the issue of credit approvals to the GLA, which again has to be done via the Mayor. The arrangement acknowledges the central role of the Mayor in the GLA structure. It does not disadvantage the bodies at all and it is not possible for the Mayor to divert resources in a way contrary to Ministers' intentions. So this is a twin approach which reflects the current practice. I hope that the Committee will find it acceptable.

<a name="30610-20_para1"></a>Clause 34 [Wales]:
<P>

<a name="30610-20_para2"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 34 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-20_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   This clause refers to the position of Wales and how the grant-making provision under Clause 31 will be applied. Presumably this is a fully devolved matter. It is made clear in Clause 31(5) that no Treasury consent is needed for grants made in Wales. The question here, therefore, is one of scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="30610-20_para3"></a>Taxpayers' money is levied by central government in Westminster, but we retain no control over how this money is spent and disbursed under the grant system provided for here. The matter will be one for the discretion of the Welsh Assembly. I am not challenging the devolution process&#151;not really&#151;I merely ask what provisions are in place in the Welsh Assembly to ensure that the eventual dispersal of funding in the form of grants made under Clause 31 is subject to a satisfactory level of public scrutiny and transparency.
<P>

<a name="30610-20_para4"></a>For Ministers to make a grant in England, Treasury consent is needed. Why is there no similar provision for Wales? The Welsh Assembly cannot levy its own <P>


<a name="column_GC82"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC82</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>taxes; is it right for it to have absolute discretion in the use of United Kingdom taxes for grants in Wales, without any central government control?
<P>

<a name="30610-20_para5"></a>Can the Minister say whether this marks a significant change in terms of grants and funding for the Welsh Assembly? On what basis have the changes been made? Will regular reports be made available of the progress of this system?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I shall give a short answer to the Motion because a longer response will be made later. I can confirm that the Welsh Assembly intends to put in place controls to ensure that the power is exercised prudently and properly. What I do not know is when or whether we will know even what are to be the draft controls before, say, the Bill receives Royal Assent.
<P>

<a name="30610-20_para6"></a>However, it is axiomatic that, following the devolution settlement and the probity with which the Welsh Assembly is operating, the grants would not be made in Wales until controls have been put in place by the Assembly. I can put it on the record that those controls will be put in place which I suspect, although I do not know, will perform the same function as that performed by the Treasury for England.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-20_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I think the Minister said that no grant would be paid under the terms of Clause 31 to the Welsh Assembly under Clause 34 until the United Kingdom Parliament or Ministers were satisfied that the controls were in place. Is that correct?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   No, that is going much too far. I am simply saying that we have repeatedly said that, in England, the Treasury's consent is needed for award of the grants and that, in Wales, Treasury consent will not be required before the Assembly exercises its power to make grants. That is consistent with the devolution settlement. However, the Assembly intends to put in place controls to ensure that the powers are exercised prudently and properly. I am therefore assuming&#151;it has to be the case&#151;that before the Assembly exercises its powers to make grants it will have put in place the controls which I outlined to ensure that the functions are exercised prudently and properly. I did not say that grants would not be made payable after Royal Assent.
<P>

<a name="30610-20_para7"></a>The Assembly will exercise the powers in Wales as that is consistent with the devolution settlement. However, it will not exercise the powers before it has put in place those controls. As I have said on the record, the Assembly intends to put in place controls to ensure that the powers are exercised properly. I therefore assume that no grants will be paid until those controls are put in place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-20_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Will the Minister also confirm that the grants in Wales will be listed as they are in the United Kingdom under the local government finance settlement, as we have discussed in previous debates?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-20_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I assume that that is the case. The Welsh Assembly will be the grant-paying body. This clause is not about UK Ministers paying grants to Welsh authorities or the Welsh Assembly. I should <P>


<a name="column_GC83"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC83</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>perhaps say that there is open government in Wales. Indeed, people in Wales sometimes claim that government is a bit more open there than it is in England. That is what devolution is about.
<P>

<a name="30610-20_para8"></a>There should be no doubt about whether the Welsh Assembly will publish who has received grants, although it might not be done exactly as it is in England. I can say that no secret grants will be paid in Wales under the proposals. However, listing might not be done exactly as it is in England&#151;by adding to the list, as I said, when the rate support grant and all the other grants are dealt with. There will be no secret grants, and a list of grants showing the amounts and the receiving councils will be made available.

<a name="30610-20_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 96 is a very simple amendment. It adds town and parish councils to the list of local authorities for the purposes of Part 3, Chapter 1 of the Bill. It is a probing amendment. The next clause talks about best-value grants for parishes. However, there is a question as to why town and parish councils cannot be part of the grant-paying regime. I suspect that part of the answer is that this is not something that the Government do very often. However, if they are going to try to introduce legislation that allows for many different possibilities, which clearly is the purpose of much of the Bill, it seems logical to include town and parish councils in the list. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30610-20_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Well, there is a logical explanation, in that the power in Clause 31 is intended to be a much more streamlined and flexible alternative to Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988. Parish and town councils are not among the bodies that can be paid under that Act; they do not receive grants under Section 88B. Clause 31 is designed to be, not a replacement for that power, because it will remain on the statute book, but a much more streamlined alternative.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30610-20_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is intended to probe where regional assemblies may stand in the new expenditure grant system, as laid out in Clauses 31 to 35. I know that the Minister will tell me that there are no regional assemblies yet, but they are in process. As we know from the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003, which was recently passed by the House, and from what the Minister said in Committee last week, it is likely that a referendum to establish a regional assembly in one of the regions will be called before too long&#151;always assuming that, somewhere along the line, the soundings exercise can be made to square with what is proposed.
<P>

<a name="30610-20_para16"></a>That means that, before too long, we may have a fully fledged assembly functioning with a certain amount of devolved and independent power. Under Clauses 31 to 35, conditions are set out to adapt the expenditure grant provisions to the unique circumstances of the Greater London Authority and the Welsh Assembly&#151;as we have discussed.
<P>

<a name="30610-20_para17"></a>How would regional assemblies fit into that scheme? Is it envisaged that they could receive grant from central Government, as can the Greater London Authority? Would conditions be imposed for the use of such grants, as for the Greater London Authority, under Clause 33(2), or would they have autonomy, as does the Welsh Assembly, in the disposal of any grants made? What would be the allocation of funding to regional assemblies?
<P>

<a name="30610-20_para18"></a>Throughout discussion of the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003, there was considerable confusion about that. The Minister told us then&#151;I can hear him saying it now:

<a name="30610-20_para19"></a>My noble friend Lady Blatch, among others, pointed out that if the powers of a regional assembly were to be merely scrutinising and advising on regional strategy, it would have no need of the precepting powers that are to be made available to it. As we learnt during discussion of that Act, regional assemblies will not be categorised as local authorities, as the Greater London Authority is not. Nor will they take powers from local authorities, according to the noble Lord, Lord Rooker.

<a name="30610-21_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment, as are all our amendments today.
<P>

<a name="30610-21_para5"></a>A form of local government which is not apparently covered by either Chapter 1 or Chapter 2 is charter trustees&#151;of whom there are very few, but who are very proud of their status. My amendment seeks to include them in the Bill. The answer may be that none of them has the duties referred to which would attract the grant. I should be grateful for an explanation as to why they are not included. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The noble Baroness has answered her own question. The amendment would add charter trustees to the Bill, and the purpose of Clause 36 is to enable grants to be paid. The amendment is not workable simply because charter trustees are not among the authorities subject to any of the best value duties set up under the Local Government Act 1999. So from our perspective it is entirely illogical&#151;it makes no sense at all&#151;to have a power to pay them.
<P>

<a name="30610-21_para6"></a>My understanding is that charter trustees in general are bodies that have continuing responsibility for abolished local authorities. If that is the case, I cannot see much point in their having a best value regime. We should be giving counties such as Berkshire best value duties when Berkshire is there merely for ceremonial purposes.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The amendment is not relevant. It would place central government in an odd position. We should be powerless to withhold the payment of grant to any best value parish in certain circumstances, particularly if an authority failed to carry out the best value duties for which the grant is payable. That makes the proposition in the amendment not a very sensible one. It would not be a sensible use of public money. I cannot see that the amendment is at all valuable.

I seek to change the provision which allows a determination about a grant to be made during or after the end of a financial year to one allowing it to be made only during that financial year.

<a name="30610-21_para15"></a>Earlier this afternoon we discussed briefly the monitoring of outcomes. I have said that I understand that entirely, but it would be unfortunate if the Secretary were to decide, after having paid over moneys, that conditions ought to have been attached. I beg to move.

<a name="30610-21_para17"></a>It is hoped that the grants would be administered efficiently and promptly. However, circumstances could arise where the amounts payable could not be finalised until the year to which they relate has ended. This may arise, for example, if technical difficulties are encountered when establishing whether a particular parish or community council has a budgeted income that exceeds the required threshold. The amendments would make it impossible for any changes to be made to the amounts payable once the financial year to which they relate has ended, thus making it possible that some parishes or community councils would end up receiving less grant than otherwise they would be entitled to receive.
<P>

<a name="30610-21_para18"></a>I see where the noble Baroness is coming from, but the clause provides an element of security to ensure that, because of technical difficulties that might arise during the budgeting process, the situation can be put right when the amounts payable are finalised for the year in which they are payable.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-21_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Can the Minister respond to the specific concern that, a grant having been made, this provision would make it possible for the Secretary of State subsequently to impose conditions? I hope that he will be able to respond by saying that that is not the case. I do not think it is, but I want to be clear about it. Having raised the matter, I should ensure that the answer is put on the record.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-21_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I can say on the record that that is not the intention behind what we are seeking to achieve in the clause.

<A NAME="30610-21_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I am not sure whether that answers the technical question as to whether the possibility remains. Is that something that could be considered after our Committee proceedings today, so that we can be quite clear about it?

<a name="30610-21_para22"></a>Our aim in the amendment is simply to remove the Secretary of State's power to revoke or vary a grant to a best value parish council within a single financial year. This will be accompanied by amendments which aim to ensure that any grant paid to a best value parish council or best value community council is transparent and debated before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30610-21_para23"></a>In Essex County Council, we feel it is vital that we support the work of parish councils to deliver quality services to our local communities.

<P>

<a name="30610-21_para24"></a>This amendment would ensure that parish councils can plan for a full financial year without the threat of an unexpected change in funding from the Government. That is essential if resources are to be managed effectively to deliver quality services.
<P>

<a name="30610-21_para25"></a>I accept there may well be a need to modify grants and, in some instances, to withdraw them. Nevertheless, as the Bill stands, there is no safeguard for ensuring that grants are not promised and then withdrawn at short notice or without transparency.
<P>

<a name="30610-21_para26"></a>The Government are trying to support parish councils as a fundamental tier of local democracy, and attempting to fulfil their promise to allow local authorities of all kinds increased freedom to manage their resources more effectively. A reliable income stream is therefore fundamental to achieving this aim, particularly for small authorities like parish and community councils.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I find it quite surprising that a grant may be revoked. I can understand that it might subsequently be varied, but why should it subsequently be revoked? Either it was justified when it was first given or it was not. If it was not justified, it should not have been given, and, if it was, I cannot see what would enable or prompt the Minister to revoke it subsequently. We should be grateful for an explanation.

It would be a pity if, having achieved all that and having reached best value status, the grant was revoked. It is a question of why and under what circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   We have some sympathy with Amendment No. 98. It is not the kind of thing we plan to do&#151;we have one straightforward determination, one financial year, with everybody knowing where they stand; the money would be paid and spent, and that would be that. It is not our intention to use the power to determine or revoke best value grants in any arbitrary way, believe you me. But we think it is right <P>


<a name="column_GC89"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC89</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be able to compensate a council which had lost a significant amount of best value grant through no fault of its own but because of an administrative error. I am concerned about that, because councils can make mistakes filling in forms applying for grants and lose out purely because of administrative errors.
<P>

<a name="30610-22_para3"></a>There may be circumstances in which some parish or town councils become eligible for best value grant quite late in the day after an initial determination of grant has been made. This power would allow us to make a replacement determination.
<P>

<a name="30610-22_para4"></a>We would revoke a grant only for purely technical reasons. How it could happen I do not know, but a grant might be made to a council that was not eligible. I do not know whether that happens very often but those are the kind of circumstances envisaged. If a grant was made to a council that was not eligible, it would need to be revoked&#151;before the money was spent, I hope. But it would not be our intention to use this power in an arbitrary way. It would be a crisis for a grant to be paid and then revoked.
<P>

<a name="30610-22_para5"></a>The size of parish and town councils varies enormously. Some are tiny, while others are bigger than some small district councils, covering many thousands of people. It is simply not possible to compartmentalise them all as the same kind of body. I hope that that is a satisfactory explanation. I do not know whether there is any example of such grants to parish or town councils being revoked under the existing processes. However, I repeat what I said earlier, because it is relevant. Town and parish councils do not come under Section 88 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988. They are not covered, so I do not know of any circumstances in which grants have been paid and then revoked or varied under the existing processes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I note the noble Lord's comments about grants being varied. One could accept that point. However, if a grant has been paid to a council that does not qualify, that would be the Government's fault. Parish, town and community councils could be frightened off by this kind of measure. Knowing that a grant could be revoked, the worthies could decide not to apply for it. I hope that the Minister might reconsider the part about revoking a grant, although I understand and accept the need to vary it. The Minister said that circumstances would have to be quite exceptional and I hope that he will reconsider the element of revoking a grant.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-22_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Before the Minister replies, perhaps I may raise a further point. What happens if the revocation comes as a best value council suddenly becomes a non-best value council and the position changes in a financial year? This depends on Audit Commission reviews and how they operate. Is it possible that that might be one reason for it? If that were the case, would it be left to the end of a financial year before such a revocation took place? I think the <P>


<a name="column_GC90"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Minister is struggling with this, and we are struggling too. A few concrete answers from the Minister's officials might get him off the hook.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   If the noble Baroness thinks that I have been struggling so far, wait until she hears what I have to say now. If money had been paid to an authority on the basis that it was good or excellent and it changed during the course of the financial or the following year, we could not take the money back because it had been paid for a purpose. But listen to this other reason for revocation: we might get the parish council's name wrong. This is the best bit&#151;it has happened occasionally, even with full local authorities, so we need to revoke and replace money under the right name. It beggars belief, but it has happened. I do not have an example, but apparently it has happened occasionally&#151;very occasionally, I assume&#151;with full local authorities. The name was wrong in an order and the money had to be replaced. That is another example.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-22_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   That does beggar belief. If there is a mistake in the name and it should be Much Binding in the Marsh instead of Much something else&#151;my imagination fails me&#151;and there is no council with the wrong name, that is just a matter of rectification. Everyone, in all walks of life, makes the odd mistake. If the wrong name is that of another council and money has been paid, it is simply too tough to say, "Give it back, we did not mean you, we meant your neighbour". I am sure that the Minister's advisers cannot quite mean that. I hope not.

<FONT SIZE=3>The amendment would ensure that grants paid under Clause 36 are reported to Parliament in the appropriate manner.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-22_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I regret that I cannot help the noble Lord. As I hinted when dealing with the previous amendment, we could not operate this because town and parish councils are not relevant bodies under Section 88 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988. It simply does not apply to English parish councils, so it would not be possible to use that mechanism.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-22_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Okay. There are 8,000 parish councils, all varying enormously in size. We are in a different league altogether here. It would not be relevant. They are not covered by the 1988 Act, so the mechanism in the Act could not be used. However, the absence of a special report does not mean that Parliament would no longer be able to consider the grants under Clause 36. Parliamentary approval will still be needed within the ambit of the relevant department's request for resources, and Treasury consent will also be needed.
<P>

<a name="30610-22_para13"></a>The grants made under Clause 36 are likely to be quite small or to be repeated. The need to continue to rely on the grant-making powers under Section 88 would be very cumbersome, as I have explained. Therefore, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<A NAME="30610-22_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   May I take up a point just made by the Minister? I pursue this possibly out of my own ignorance here. If a grant must be approved by the Treasury, is any stage of such a decision made available to Members of Parliament? I appreciate that the Minister made the point that there are over 8,000 parish councils and so many decisions must be made, but equally a list should be made available somewhere to Members of Parliament which indicates what are those grants and for what they have been given. I ask that if for no other reason than it would be quite interesting to scrutinise the allocations and see what the money is being spent on, in particular given the different sizes of parish councils. Some are small and some large. We should like to know the purposes to which those grants are being put.
<P>

<a name="30610-22_para14"></a>It may be that the Minister will leap to his feet and tell me that a list of these grants is always available on the Internet, the Intranet or in another form.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30610-23_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: At this point we move on to the position in Wales. This amendment aims to ensure the transparency of any grant paid to a best value community council under the terms of Clause 37 by the National Assembly for Wales by ensuring that it is scrutinised by Parliament. This is a similar issue to that raised by the previous amendment.
<P>

<a name="30610-23_para5"></a>Again, we welcome the Government's good intention to reward good performance in all kinds of councils in England and in Wales. We support awarding grants to enable councils to meet the requirements of best value status once it has been attained.
<P>

<a name="30610-23_para6"></a>However, as we discussed under Amendment No. 99 in relation to parish councils in England, we would prefer all best value grants to be scrutinised by Parliament. If that cannot be done, let us introduce some form of process by which the award of grants is made more transparent. However, we also want to see how the Welsh Assembly may deal with the issue.
<P>

<a name="30610-23_para7"></a>This amendment will ensure that grants paid under Clause 37 by the National Assembly for Wales are reported to Parliament in the appropriate manner. This will maintain the transparency and the credibility of such transactions and, as we discussed during the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>previous amendment, it will provide a clear incentive for those councils striving to improve their performance. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-23_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I shall be interested in the Minister's reply, in which I hope he will explain whether this too is a devolved matter. Nothing in the Bill enables the scrutiny we seek. However, again it is important that these details are published in some form. People in Wales have a right to be able to see what grants are being paid to which local authorities. I presume that in the case of Wales, Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 will pertain. If it does not&#151;the Minister is shaking his head, suggesting that since Wales is not a local authority, it is not subject to the local government regime&#151;will he let me know how Welsh community grants are reported?
<P>

<a name="30610-23_para8"></a>As with the English parish councils, such information will help us towards greater transparency.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   We are entering dangerous territory because of the devolution settlement. First I want to put it on the record&#151;I am repeating what I said earlier, but it is relevant to this amendment&#151;that Section 88B of the Local Government Finance 1988 does not apply to Welsh community councils. They are outside that legislation and therefore it would not be possible to make such determinations. There are around 750 community councils in Wales. In any event, as I said previously, the absence of a special grant report provided under Section 88B does not mean that Parliament is no longer involved because approval is needed under the ambit of the share of resources for the National Assembly for Wales. Furthermore, appropriate safeguards will be put in place in Wales to cover the payment of the grant.
<P>

<a name="30610-23_para9"></a>However, it would be quite inappropriate for grants made by the National Assembly for Wales to be reported in a special grant report to Parliament. That would be inconsistent with the devolution settlement. This is a matter for the Welsh Assembly. It will put procedures in place and safeguards will be set up in relation to the payment of the grant. So we must leave this to the Welsh Assembly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   As we discussed during the previous amendment, I wonder whether it would be possible to make the process more transparent. Since Wales is included under the terms of the Bill, surely a form of guidance could be added. As with the previous clause, we would like the same transparency for Wales that we sought for the English parish councils. Even though this is a devolved matter, here a new national policy is being implemented. Surely it would be wise, for the reasons we have already set out, for the same to apply in Wales.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I shall take advice on this, but I think it would be inconsistent with the devolution settlement if we were to seek to instruct the Welsh Assembly. It must be accepted that this is a grey area. We are still in the early stages of devolution; it has been in place for only a few years. Many times it will appear that the <P>


<a name="column_GC94"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC94</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>boundaries look as though they are moving on the devolution settlement, but Wales is not the same as Scotland and the powers are totally different. However, in this case and at the community level, to be frank, it has nothing to do with us. We should not seek to give advice to the Welsh Assembly.
<P>

<a name="30610-23_para10"></a>This legislation is necessary to make available the statutory procedure for this public money to be paid. Furthermore, the Welsh Assembly will not keep these matters secret from the citizens of Wales.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-23_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   The Minister has said that he would look again at the powers of devolution to Wales. Perhaps he will let us know how they stand in relation to these areas.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-23_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I have not said anything of the kind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-23_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   The Minister said that he would look at this again.

<P>
<P>

<a name="30610-23_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment I shall depart from my notes. I do so because they are totally inconsistent with what the noble Lord said about my last amendment. He said that in the matter of community councils we can give no directions to the National Assembly for Wales. The matter is devolved and it is up to the Assembly. However, Clause 37(6)(c) allows the Assembly to vary or revoke the grant, as we pointed out earlier is the case for the English Parliament. Surely, therefore, the response the Minister made on the last amendment means that we need to remove the power of revocation or variation from the Welsh Assembly because it would nevertheless have the power to do whatever it wishes.
<P>

<a name="30610-23_para15"></a>I do not understand the position. Surely these two provisions in the Bill are totally inconsistent. The Minister said that we cannot tell the Welsh Assembly what to do, but here is a provision that does tell them what to do. I am absolutely sure that the Minister will not be able to respond. The reason why I am seeking more clarity in this area is because I knew that we were about to reach this amendment. What he said in his last reply will not be consistent with this provision. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-23_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I shall attempt to achieve consistency across Ministers. I do not agree with the noble Lord that the provisions are inconsistent.

<a name="column_GC95"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC95</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not least because it is our hope that only one straightforward determination will be needed for each financial year.
<P>

<a name="30610-23_para16"></a>It is not our intention to use the power to revoke or vary a determination of best value grant in an arbitrary way. That is not what we seek, but we believe that it is right to be able to compensate a council that had lost a significant amount of best value grant through no fault of its own, perhaps as a result of an administrative error.
<P>

<a name="30610-23_para17"></a>There may be circumstances when some Welsh community councils become subject to best value duties&#151;and hence become eligible for best value grant&#151;perhaps quite late in the day and after the initial determination of grant had been made. The power would allow a replacement determination to be made to allow them to receive grant. This provision has been included as a helpful measure, offering a degree of flexibility so that we could make an extra determination if it were to become clear that a community council had qualified to become subject to best value duties and thus required eligibility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I am sorry, but the noble Lord has not answered my point. We have just pointed out on the earlier amendment that the Government have no power to tell the Welsh Assembly to publish or make available a list, but here the Bill takes the power to tell the Assembly that it can change or vary a grant. That is the point I sought to make.
<P>

<a name="30610-24_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said that we cannot tell the National Assembly for Wales to publish a list, but we can tell them to vary the grant. I find the whole thing inconsistent and I do think the Minister has responded to that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I suppose it is part of the beauty of the workings of devolution. As regards powers, Parliament can choose not to give the power to the National Assembly for Wales, but if it chooses to do so, then it has to do it in a way that is consistent with the devolution settlement. This is the way the power should work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I still do not understand how these two elements are separate in the devolution settlement. On a minor point such as grants to community councils, we cannot tell the Assembly to publish a list, yet we can tell it to make variations to the grant. I am afraid that I do not accept these responses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   This is a matter of choice for the National Assembly for Wales. The power is in place. How the Assembly chooses to exercise it is a matter very much for itself.

<a name="30610-24_para3"></a>Clause 38 [Grants in connection with designation for service excellence]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-24_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee </B>   moved Amendment No. 101A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 17, line 35, leave out "any of the following"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-24_para4"></a><P>

<a name="30610-24_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: I had asked for this amendment to be grouped with Amendment No. 101B as it makes no sense without it. Will the Minister be happy for me to speak to both amendments? I cannot say anything about Amendment No. 101A on its own.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-24_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Although the amendments are not together on the groupings list, I shall be quite happy to deal with them both.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-24_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I am grateful. An error has crept in somewhere in the procedure. In effect, Amendment No. 101A is consequential to Amendment No. 101B, which questions the ability of the Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly to make a grant for applying for designation based on excellence&#151;here I suppose that we are talking about beacon status under the CPA regime&#151;and a grant for rewarding the award of such a designation.
<P>

<a name="30610-24_para6"></a>Earlier the Minister said that grants are made on the basis of need, but clearly that does not extend to this clause. It seems quite extraordinary that here we are allowing for the giving out of goodies to those who have been good boys and girls. That is more or less what this provision amounts to, other than the provision allowing for expenditure on disseminating information about best practice, which I am sure we would all support.
<P>

<a name="30610-24_para7"></a>This clause was not dealt with at all in the Commons and I think it proper to ask the Government to justify its inclusion. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-24_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I support the questions posed to the Minister by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. The clause raises the question of how much it costs to become a beacon or best value authority. If the clause is what the Explanatory Notes say it is, it enables the Government to repay to a local authority the costs that it has incurred to achieve beacon status or to become designated as "excellent".
<P>

<a name="30610-24_para8"></a>That is an extraordinary admission of the folly and the amount that must be done to achieve such designations. We are always discussing the cost to local authorities of regulations and of various government squeezes. The clause seems explicitly to underline that. If the Government are to be able to pay to a local authority the money which all that has cost it, what are we talking about in terms of grant? Is it expected that the grant will be as much as it needs to be to achieve the status or to carry out the duties?
<P>

<a name="30610-24_para9"></a>I am bound to say that when I scoured the Bill I missed the implications of the clause. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, it requires explanation so that we know exactly what is being proposed. On grant towards expenditure incurred, every other local authority which does not achieve excellence or best value status would also have spent that money. So why <P>


<a name="column_GC97"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC97</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is it only those who achieve that status&#151;they will receive a reward anyway for such a designation under paragraph (b)&#151;that will receive grant for the costs incurred? Explanations are required for the clause and I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, for having picked it up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-24_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I shall break the habit of a lifetime and the commitment I gave earlier today. I shall not only do what I agreed to for Amendments No. 101A and 101B, but I shall also put a few words on the record about the clause. It may be more appropriate if I speak first to Clause 38 and then to the amendments.
<P>

<a name="30610-24_para10"></a>Clause 38, which applies to England and Wales, provides that the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales may pay grant to best value authorities, subject to any best value duty, in relation to any expenses that they have incurred in applying for the award of a designation based on excellence in provision of services. That was one sentence, by the way. Where a best value authority is awarded such designation, the power will also enable grant to be paid as a reward for such designation and in relation to expenses incurred or to be incurred by the authority in disseminating information about best practices.
<P>

<a name="30610-24_para11"></a>The background to this is the beacon council scheme, introduced in 1998, to identify centres of excellence from which others can learn. Authorities are awarded beacon status on the strength of excellence in the delivery of specified services, supported by good overall performance and effective plans for dissemination. The scheme is open to all best value authorities in England, but subject to any of the best value duties in Sections 3 to 6 of the Local Government Act 1999. Beacon authorities are currently awarded a retrospective grant to cover the costs incurred in disseminating information about their best practices. Grants are paid by the Secretary of State under the special grant-making power of&#151;here we go&#151;Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988.
<P>

<a name="30610-24_para12"></a>The local government White Paper confirmed the Government's commitment to the long-term future of the beacon scheme. Wales does not currently operate a beacon scheme, but may introduce something similar in the future. Clause 38 reflects the Government's long-term commitment to the scheme by establishing a specific legislative basis for paying grant to beacon authorities. It will also enable the Government to provide financial incentives to encourage participation in the scheme through grant relating to expenses that authorities have incurred in applying for beacon status and grant as a reward for gaining beacon status. That is why the clause is in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30610-24_para13"></a>I shall now deal with Amendment No. 101A. It relates to Clause 38, on which I have just given some background information and which provides for grant to be paid to best value authorities. Under Clause 38, grant can be paid for any of three purposes: first, as a grant towards expenditure incurred in applying for the award; secondly, as a reward for being awarded a <P>


<a name="column_GC98"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC98</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>designation; or, thirdly, as a grant towards expenditure incurred in disseminating information about best practices.
<P>

<a name="30610-24_para14"></a>Amendment No. 101A would mean that where an authority was awarded a designation, grant would be payable both as a reward for being awarded a designation and towards expenditure incurred in disseminating information about best practices. Central government would not therefore have the discretion to restrict the grant to only one of the above purposes, which we may want to do.
<P>

<a name="30610-24_para15"></a>Under Amendment No. 101B, which relates to the same clause, any grant payable under Clause 38 would be payable only for the third purpose&#151;as a grant towards expenditure incurred in disseminating information about best practices. Central government would therefore not have discretion to pay grant for either of the other two purposes listed above. That could significantly limit policy options&#151;for example, if it were thought that paying grant towards expenditure incurred in applying for an award would be a necessary incentive to encourage authorities to take part in the scheme.
<P>

<a name="30610-24_para16"></a>I realise that this is a special, one-off provision, as it were, but I hope that what I have said about the two amendments and the background to the clause explains why the clause is in the Bill, which was a legitimate question. I hope that I have satisfactorily answered it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-24_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I want to come back on one question; again, to confirm what the Minister said. In Clause 38(1)(a), am I right that the grant towards expenditure incurred by the authority relates only to those designated as best value authorities? Would it be open to the Minister to decide that authorities which had not achieved that status ought to receive some sort of grant to enable them to apply for or advance their rationale for such status? The Minister may have answered that, and I apologise if I missed it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-24_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   True, it was wrapped up in my explanation of the clause, but any authority can receive a grant under paragraph (a)&#151;that is, for the cost of applying for designation. So it is not just for those that are successful. Otherwise, there would be no incentive for authorities to apply. If they thought that they would incur the cost of applying if they were unsuccessful, they would be wasting that cost, so any authority can receive a grant under paragraph (a) for the cost of applying for the designation.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-25_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I am sorry to be tiresome about this, but, as far as I understand it, a best value authority is an authority that has achieved best value status. The clause states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"of the following to a best value authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-25_para0"></a>That suggests to me that the grant is payable only to an authority that has achieved best value status, not, as the Minister just said, any authority that applies for that status. That matters because, as the Minister just said, not to be able to give grant to any authorities applying would discourage them from doing so. But I <P>


<a name="column_GC99"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC99</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do not think that that is what the clause states. There is a bit of nodding going on in the back row; I think that I am right to say that it would be payable only for expenditure incurred by an authority that had achieved best value status.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   That is the shorthand of local democracy, if you like. The noble Baroness is quite right: if we read the first line of the clause&#151;line 35&#151;it states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The appropriate person may pay any of the following to a best value authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-25_para1"></a>But it applies to those who are applying for beacon status. If a best value authority applies for beacon status but fails to achieve it, it may receive grant under paragraph (a) for the expenditure incurred in making that application. But it must be a best value authority in the first place. Any confusion is my fault, because of the way in which I gave my previous answer, but that concerns best value authorities applying for beacon status.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for putting some flesh on the bones of the provision. As I understand it, the definition of a best value authority in Clause 123 applies in the clause, as it does throughout the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para2"></a>As I said, I understand the desirability of grants to assist the dissemination of best practice, and that the third purpose in Clause 38(1)(b)(ii) is necessary to trigger Clause 38(1)(b)(i)&#151;the reward. It is questionable whether there should be a payment to reward the designation of beacon status, which carries with it various other rewards that one would have thought were perfectly adequate.
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para3"></a>I do not accept the policy of financial incentives to apply to beacon status, but I am glad that we at least understand what are the proposals. We have been told that there is currently not only a grant-making power but a practice under our old friend, Section 88B, for the dissemination of best practice, so I am not persuaded of the value or desirability of the clause. However, I shall read carefully what the Minister said and, for the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   The answer has to be "yes". The noble Lord deserves a better explanation. The amendment would require any grants made under Clause 38 to be reported in a special grant report under the now&#151;I should not say "infamous"&#151;Section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 within five months.
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para9"></a>This would not be workable because Section 88B does not apply to English parish and town councils or to Welsh community councils. It would not therefore be possible for a determination made under these clauses in relation to those bodies to be reported. It would also represent a significant increase in the scope of Section 88B.
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para10"></a>In so far as principal local authorities are concerned, Amendment No. 102 would raise the possibility that a grant made under the new power could be struck down after it had been paid, by a later decision made by Parliament&#151;I referred to this in relation to a previous amendment. Apparently the amendment would also apply to Wales and the requirement for parliamentary approval would be inconsistent with the devolution settlement.
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para11"></a>The absence of a special grant report under Section 88B would not mean that Parliament would no longer be able to consider grants under Clause 38, as indeed is the case under the other clauses that we debated. Parliamentary approval will still be needed to the ambit of the relevant department's request for resources and, in England, Treasury consent will also be needed. In Wales, appropriate safeguards will be put in place.
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para12"></a>In addition, the grants made under Clause 38 are likely to be quite small or to be repeated and therefore the need to continue to rely on the grant-making powers under Section 88B would be cumbersome. Furthermore, Amendment No. 102 would apply to Wales, and the requirement for parliamentary approval would be wholly inconsistent with the devolution settlement.

<a name="30610-25_para13"></a>I hope that I have provided the noble Lord with an answer. The points that I have made about Section 88B being cumbersome and about the fact that Parliament knows what is going on, as I indicated in relation to Clause 36, should be taken in the round. No secret grants will be paid. No grants will be paid either without Treasury approval or without proper procedures in the Welsh Assembly, and they will be publicly listed in due course.

<FONT SIZE=3>about devolution of powers to Wales, but this point also relates to a further amendment. This is a new policy and a new initiative. The point relates to wider publicity, if that is the right word&#151;if there has to be Treasury approval and so on. The accountability that we should like to see is not provided.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-25_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   No, it is even worse than that. I am informed that Treasury approval is not required under Clause 38, merely under Clause 36.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-25_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   So it is worse. As I said, we support the policy. It is merely a question of the process of making it public, visible and accountable. Even if it does not apply to parish and town councils, because powers are not included in the previous Act, surely something could be done to make the process more transparent and visible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-25_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I may be wrong&#151;I have no experience of local government save for the period when I was a co-opted member of an education committee 30 years ago&#151;but my experience is that local government is not slow in coming forward when grants are available. In fact, sometimes&#151;I shall not go down the road of a current issue&#151;local authorities over-egg the pudding. When changes are made to grant systems, it is suddenly discovered that all kinds of things fall out of the cupboard. The treasurer will say to members: "Let's get in with this little lot before they make changes". So I honestly do not think that local government will be unaware of the changes being made in this legislation.
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para14"></a>I accept the point in relation to the 8,000 parish and town councils&#151;although we have means of communicating with them, and many members of parish and town councils are members of district councils as well. The intention is not to keep quiet about this. I am sure that the LGA will make sure that its members are fully up to speed on the grants that are available.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-25_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   Of course, it would not be the LGA looking after the town and parish councils.
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para15"></a>There is a theme that we might want to reflect on before we go further in our debates on the Bill; namely, how we deal with parish and town councils. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para22"></a>Clause 40 brings us to the subject of overhanging debt&#151;the amount of money owed to the Public Works Loan Commission as a result of borrowing by a local council to provide housing. It relates also to the amount of debt and to paying it off.
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para23"></a>In another place, it was suggested that the provision of such debt for 2003&#150;04 was currently more than £600 million. That is a substantial figure. It is substantial, too, in the sense that the Secretary of State or the Minister will be making payments to the Public Works Loan Board for individual authorities, as I understand it, as they transfer their housing stock to registered social landlords and consequently ensure that the debt is written off.
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para24"></a>Part of the problem as regards the transfer of housing to registered social landlords is that, sometimes, not all of it is transferred and some remains with the council. The amount of money that the Secretary of State is proposing to pay off will be different in proportion depending on which authority is involved.
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para25"></a>It seems to us that, where this will happen and where the Secretary of State will have the powers to pay this money to the Public Works Loan Board, it is right that he should do it only with the approval of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para26"></a>A further point arises in relation to Clause 41; namely, the right of the Minister and of authorities to use money from one good authority to pay off the debts of an authority that is not quite so well run. Some authorities do not have debts; they are prudent and debt free. We discussed these in relation to the pooling arrangements earlier in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30610-25_para27"></a>I hope that the Minister can accept an amendment along these lines. This amendment may not be brilliant, but it would ensure that Parliament would see what was being paid to the Public Works Loan Board, on what basis, and on behalf of which authority. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   We believe that the amendment is unnecessary. It is based on a concern that the overhanging debt payments are not open to scrutiny. It seeks to reduce the Secretary of State's ability to repay the appropriate amount of an authority's debt and to hamper a transfer, voted for by tenants, taking place successfully. That is the summary of the points that I wish to make. However, in view of the remarks of the noble Baroness, I want to place rather more on record.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para0"></a>Clause 40 allows the Secretary of State to assist one or more English local housing authorities to meet debt liabilities through a payment to the Public Works Loan Commissioners. Amendment No. 103 would require the Secretary of State to make an order before making such a payment.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para1"></a>Clause 122(4) would require such an order to be made by statutory instrument. The requirement to make an order before a payment could be made could prevent the Secretary of State from paying the correct amount in respect of an authority's overhanging debt following a stock transfer.

<P>

<a name="30610-26_para2"></a>Members of the Committee will be aware that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is quite open about housing transfer programmes. We publish on the ODPM website a list of those authorities that apply for a place on the housing transfer programme and we announce to Parliament those that secure a place. Once a transfer takes place, details of the transfer, including the number of dwellings, the sale price, private finance and overhanging debt payment are also included on the website and are freely available from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para3"></a>Overhanging debt payments were originally recorded in Her Majesty's Treasury's annual accounts. Since 2002&#150;03, they have been recorded in the annual accounts of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Therefore, payments are open to scrutiny by Parliament and by the National Audit Office. Were any such payments to be made by the National Assembly for Wales, they would be shown in the Assembly's accounts. There are no secrets about this.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para4"></a>The actual amount of the overhanging debt which the Secretary of State would repay is known only at the very last moment when the housing stock transfer takes place. As a minimum, the rate for new loans from the Public Works Loan Board is reviewed weekly, with any changes impacting on a local authority's debt redemption premium and therefore on the level of an overhanging debt payment. If the amount had to be specified in an order, which would be made and would have to be laid before Parliament at least 21 days before coming into force, the amount of the debt repayment specified in the order may not be the actual amount of overhanging debt that needed to be repaid.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para5"></a>The payment specified in such an order might be insufficient, leaving the authority with an outstanding debt or, indeed, an excessive amount. We should be unable to consent to the transfer if the order had not been made before the transfer, as the authority would be unable to meet its housing debt obligations and would remain eligible for housing revenue account subsidy. The purpose of Clause 40 is to remove that possibility, as we believe it is inappropriate for an authority with no housing to be in receipt of ongoing housing revenue account subsidy.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para6"></a>As I said, I believe that the amendment is based on the concern that overhanging debt payments are not open to scrutiny. I hope that I have said enough to assure the Committee that they are indeed fully open to scrutiny.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-26_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. I understand his point; namely, that the process is open to some scrutiny. But there is no better scrutiny than an order being laid before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para7"></a>The trouble with these debt repayments is that it is fairly arbitrary as to which authorities are having debts paid off. Some substantial debts are being paid off. A question also arises as to where the money is coming from that the Secretary of State is using to pay off the debts. There is a suspicion that some of the money&#151;money from pooling, for example&#151;might find its way into those coffers. There is more than just a little concern about this.

<a name="30610-26_para8"></a>The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy has said that the playing field is not level and that taxpayers' money is being used in a discriminatory fashion&#151;that is, to pay off debts. It has stated that there is also a measure of perverse incentive in the proposal, as it benefits authorities that have not maintained their housing stock in the past to a standard where the market value exceeds the historic debt; that is, authorities which, by definition, have let their housing stock run down. They will benefit from having debts paid off when they have not expended sufficient money on their stock for tenants to wish for them to be maintained.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para9"></a>I shall not pursue this amendment, but the Minister might like to take up the comment from the Select Committee Report which was in the evidence given by the Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy. He may have more to add on this matter.

<A NAME="30610-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Perhaps I may put on the record that I resent the word "arbitrary". Stock transfer takes place only after a tenants' vote. There is nothing at all "arbitrary" about the issue. It is well known that the Government have a policy. There are three ways to get the extra money to meet the decent homes standards&#151;stock transfer, armslength management organisations or private finance initiative. They are the only ways that local authorities will receive money for meeting decent standards. That is it. The reality is that they will not get dollops of money to continue badly-managed council housing.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para10"></a>In answer to what the noble Baroness said about CIPFA, in commenting on the draft Local Government Bill, it suggested that these provisions will lead to greater cost to government. However, CIPFA was one of the consultees when the DTI&#151;as it was&#151;issued its consultation paper in August 1999, which outlined the proposed options and arrangements for making overhanging debt payments. Its responses made no criticism of the principles of the proposal in respect of overhanging debt, nor any of the suggested routes for dealing with housing debt. Rather, its comments were centred on technicalities and made no mention of the cost implications to government. That is how I understand the position. I am always quite happy to receive further advice and particulars.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para11"></a>There is some suspicion about where the money is coming from. We are quite open about that. The noble Baroness spoke about some scrutiny. I have said how the amounts are made available&#151;the stock and the dwellings. The tenants are balloted and the amounts follow. The ballot is done in public. It is not a secret ballot. It is a secret ballot for the tenants, but everyone knows about the ballots and will report on them. So it is available to total scrutiny, not just some scrutiny.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-26_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. What is the total amount that is likely to be written off in the year 2003&#150;04? I understand it to be a sum <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 18, line 17, leave out "a" and insert "each"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30610-26_para13"></a><P>

<a name="30610-26_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 104, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 106 and 107. These are all amendments to Clause 40. As the Government and the Minister in his recent statements have made clear, and particularly when the draft Bill was published, this clause and the following clause facilitate the transfer of council housing to registered social landlords. I have no objection to that. However, I think we should look carefully at whether there is a level playing field and whether people are being given the right choice. The Bill is about local councils being given a choice. In fact, this is one of its most restrictive parts. If local authorities want to bring their houses up to a certain standard, this is one of the choices they have. It is the same for the tenants.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para15"></a>Clause 40 enables the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales to make payments to local authorities in England so that they can meet the outstanding overhanging debts which we discussed in the previous clause. Clause 40 is about debts that arise from the Public Works Loan Commissioners. Sometimes early repayment of such loans attracts premiums or penalties. The Bill enables the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to meet these payments.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para16"></a>We discussed set aside on capital receipts earlier in the Bill. That is how the system is managed at the moment. In 1999 arrangements were made to pay overhanging debts. I am grateful to the Minister for the letter he sent me on these issues following Second Reading. In it he states that, since arrangements were put in place, £824 million has been paid to 10 local authorities for whole stock transfer.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para17"></a>That is a considerable amount of money. There may be considerable amounts involved in the future. To put the matter into context, basis credit approvals to all local authorities in England amounted to only £793 million in the year 2002&#150;03 and £852 million is the estimate for the year 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para18"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, talked about discussions in the Select Committee of another place. One matter that came out from the National Audit Office was that this system of improving the property through large-scale voluntary transfer costs the taxpayer £1,300 more per property than if they remained with the local authority.

<P>

<a name="30610-26_para19"></a>I have already mentioned the other problem of the denial of choice for tenants. The choice is not very real when one looks at the financial matters that surround it.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para20"></a>The inclusion of this power moves the Government further away from the level playing field that we would prefer to see. Therefore, we have tabled these amendments. The Government argue that payments made from a sum of money requested on an annual basis come from the Treasury as part of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's annual managed expenditure. They are made on the basis that it would otherwise have to pay ongoing housing revenue account subsidy to the local authorities. So, in practice, the overhanging debt payment is treated as a one-off payment, discharging that liability.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para21"></a>One can&#151;as are the Government&#151;pay £" million to an individual authority, or one could pay all authorities some money. We seek in these amendments to do that in order to make the situation fairer. The reduction in the liability to pay ongoing housing revenue account subsidy is the same amount.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para22"></a>I do not expect the Minister to accept these amendments for one moment because he has made it quite clear that the Government want to make sure that local authorities are pushed into this way of dealing with their housing. We do not agree with him and would like to see much fairer treatment across local authorities and that we do not have some local authorities getting large amounts of money. The advantage of what we propose is that it has the potential to release revenue streams within housing revenue accounts that could then be used under the prudential framework introduced in Clauses 1 to 6 and enable local authorities to finance renovation of their own stock. I recognise that the Minister will not approve of that, but I think that many people in local government would support a fairer use of this money.
<P>

<a name="30610-26_para23"></a>If the Government wish to take powers to repay outstanding debt loans, we believe they should be applied equally between local authorities, regardless of whether a decision has been made to transfer the housing stock. The whole matter will get even worse when regional boards are distributing money to local authorities. At the moment, the Minister has said there are three ways in which people can deal with their housing stock&#151;large-scale voluntary transfer, arm's-length management organisations and PFIs. It seems to us that councils that go down the route of large-scale voluntary transfer get an advantage, and we want to see a fairer playing field. That is the purpose of these amendments. I beg to move.

We must acknowledge and accept that.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para0"></a>The noble Baroness has described the effect of Clause 40. In our view no amendment is required because the clause allows the Secretary of State, or in <P>


<a name="column_GC107"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC107</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Wales the National Assembly, to make payments in respect of all authorities' debts, in proportion to those authorities' debts at the time.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para1"></a>As is understood by the Committee, the policy behind Clause 40 is to assist individual authorities who transfer their housing stock to a registered social landlord, but need assistance to meet outstanding housing debt liabilities where the receipt is insufficient to do so.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para2"></a>I think the amendments are based on a misunderstanding that we are somehow giving favourable treatment to those authorities which transfer their housing stock and for which we make an overhanging debt payment. That is not the case. My noble friend explained that there are three ways in which local authorities can take forward their policy in terms of investing back into the stock through ALMOs, through the PFIs or through this route. We think that provides the basis of fair and reasonable choice.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para3"></a>We say that clearly all authorities are treated on a fair basis. It is up to the local authority to choose whether it wishes to retain or to transfer its stock, based on a rigorous option appraisal which will involve tenants and other key stakeholders. If an authority or its tenants choose to retain its stock, the Government, though the housing revenue account subsidy, continues to ensure that a local authority can meet the cost of servicing its attributable debt.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para4"></a>However, where a local authority has transferred its stock, we believe it is inappropriate for an authority that has no housing to remain in receipt of ongoing housing revenue account subsidy. That would make a nonsense of the scheme.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para5"></a>That approach would be undermined by the amendments which are offered forward as a scheme to remove the Secretary of State's broad discretion and to require us to make payments to reduce or extinguish all English authorities' debts where the Secretary of State considered it appropriate to make such a payment for one authority.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para6"></a>The amendments would similarly constrain the National Assembly for Wales. It is a policy matter for the Secretary of State, or in Wales the National Assembly, to decide whether and how to contribute towards meeting local authorities' debt liabilities. The Secretary of State and the National Assembly should have the discretion to decide whether to make such a payment, or whether to leave it to authorities to use their own resources to pay off debts if those resources are sufficient. The amendments would of course take away that discretion.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para7"></a>Clause 40 is drafted sufficiently broadly to allow us to reduce or extinguish authorities' debts in other circumstances. By constraining the Secretary of State to reduce all authorities' debts proportionately, if he wished to reduce one authority's debts, the amendments would effectively prevent the use of the powers in Clause 40. So there is a clear divide here in policy terms. I have set out clearly our position. While <P>

<P>
<A NAME="30610-27_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I thank the Minister for his not totally unexpected reply to my amendment. One issue he failed to address was the extra cost per property in doing it that way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I have the response to that. The £1,300 per dwelling was over 30 years and represents the cost of private finance. That comes from the NAO report and is in that sense a hypothetical calculation. Our argument is simple: over time, the benefits of the housing transfer, including bringing forward works and better performance, outweigh the costs. That is how we see it and that is how we think it will work in practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-27_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I thank the Minister for filling us in on that matter. Does that mean that we do not take an awful lot of notice of National Audit Office reports? He seemed to dismiss it rather lightly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-27_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   It was not that; it was the Minister's throwaway comments about the National Audit Office. However, let us forget that; it is not important. It is what comes of making throw-away comments to oneself&#151;it is not always a good idea in such circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para9"></a>I appreciate that the Government approach the matter from different points of view. I think that there is a case to be made for creating a more level playing field for local authorities that are trying to improve their stock. Large sums are involved. That is not necessarily the fault of local authorities&#151;very often it occurs because the housing is located in parts of the country with much lower housing costs. That is one of the reasons why their stock is not in good condition. I also remember the years when many local authorities were starved of the ability to spend money on housing. So the history is not simple.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para10"></a>I certainly do not think that local authorities should be penalised because they find themselves in that situation. However, I am concerned that some of them which do find themselves there are able to get out of it more easily than others which have been trying desperately to improve their properties. We may return to the issue. Given the Minister's comments, I may be able to improve the amendments. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

If the noble Baroness wants to speak to Amendment No. 110 in moving Amendment No. 105 I will reply to them together. I have not read Amendment No. 110 but I shall now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-27_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   It will be very enlightening. The purpose of the two amendments is to ensure that the capital receipts of debt-free authorities&#151;which the Committee discussed last week, and which cannot benefit from these provisions&#151;are not taken by the Secretary of State to be used to pay off the debts of perhaps less prudent authorities.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para14"></a>The first purpose of the amendments is to enable the Government to spell out in detail the circumstances in which they might intend to use the powers under this section. The Liberal Democrat amendments have probed, as we have in other clauses in the Bill, why the Government feel the need for selective powers at all and how we can prevent injustice and political decision-making. However, it is vital that the objective criteria that will govern the exercise of these powers are published. It is simply not good enough for the Minister to say&#151;I do not know whether he is saying this&#151;that these are reserve powers.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para15"></a>The amendments specifically attempt to prevent what would be an abuse of power&#151;for the Government to seize the capital receipts of well-run, debt-free councils and use them to bail out the less prudent. Not only would that be wrong in principle, it would create a moral hazard for both good councils and bad ones. Why should any council seek to be a debt-free council and operate responsibly if it feared that its reward would be to see its capital receipts, or at least a proportion of them, creamed off? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-27_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   A quick perusal of my speaking notes answers why the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has done me the favour of speaking to Amendment Nos. 105 and 110 together. My speaking notes for the two amendments are nearly identical. I can therefore comfortably cope with the grouping. However, and by <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the way, I do not want to give the impression that I think that the Opposition are speeding up. I still think that we have gone very slowly today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-27_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   It has been perfectly normal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610-27_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   No; we have gone very slowly. There are only three more sittings and we want to scrutinise the Bill properly.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para16"></a>Clause 40 allows the Secretary of State to assist one or more English authorities to meet debt liabilities through a payment direct to the Public Works Loan Commissioners. Both in Committee and on Report in another place, and through this amendment, there has been a suggestion that the pooling provisions in Clause 11 could apply to housing transfer receipts. It has also been suggested that there is a direct link between the money paid in respect of overhanging debt and the money likely to be collected through the pooling proposals. That is mistaken.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para17"></a>For the record, I hope that it is now recognised that receipts from a large-scale voluntary transfer by an authority that is debt free will not be subject to the pooling provisions. When a housing transfer takes place we expect the local authority to use the receipt as provision against any housing attributable debt. Any receipt over and above that will be subject to the already existing large-scale voluntary transfer levy, which is currently set at 20 per cent. As is prescribed in Section 136 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 this levy is paid into the Consolidated Fund.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para18"></a>Resources for making overhanging debt payments are not held within the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister provision for capital allocations. They are requested on an annual basis from the Treasury as part of the ODPM's annually managed expenditure and will not be found from the pooled receipts. That reflects the ODPM's liability to pay ongoing housing revenue account subsidy to a local authority with housing attributable debt which in practice the overhanging debt payment discharges. It also reflects the difficulty in knowing the level of resources required in advance. As such, the resources are not available to fund capital expenditure.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para19"></a>Since arrangements were put in place in December 1999 we have paid £824 million to the Public Works Loan Commissioners in respect of whole stock transfers in 10 local authorities. All that has taken place prior to proposals for pooling of capital receipts in this Bill.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para20"></a>We have made clear during passage of the Bill that redistribution is a fundamental principle of housing capital finance and that that can be delivered through pooling. We have always taken the view, as have other administrations, that it is right for a portion of the proceeds from the sale of council housing to be available for use in areas of greatest need. Recycling those resources back into housing means that other authorities with lower capital receipts will receive a fair share of housing resources where their need for housing investment is greater. For that reason, when the new capital finance system comes into force, the <P>


<a name="column_GC111"></a>

<B>10 Jun 2003 : Column GC111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>present system of set-aside will end, to be replaced by an explicit pooling system. That is the simplest way of providing the additional resources to contribute to housing investment nationally. It is not a reserve from which overhanging debt payments will be made.
<P>

<a name="30610-27_para21"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will accept that explanation. We have already debated Clause 11, but I fully accept that it is controversial and that we will return to it on Report. The above remarks are equally applicable to Amendment No. 110, which seems to be word perfect the same as Amendment No. 105.

<P>
<A NAME="30610-28_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply which I shall want to read carefully before pursuing the matter further. The proposals on housing finance, how the stock transfer body is being dealt with, the payments to the Public Works Loan Commissioners and the new arrangements for improving set-aside are a major aspect of the Bill. The trouble is that the proposals are splattered among a number of clauses. I should therefore like to examine the issue more closely. I think that there are issues to which we need to return, particularly how the housing finance will work. I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>crime, amounting to &#163;190.2 million in total, announced by David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, on 21 January 2003. &#163;94 million of this funding was for use by the 376 crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs) and drug action teams (DATs) across the country to help them tackle crime and drugs in their communities. &#163;82.3 million of this is now being made available to CDRPs under the Building Safer Communities Fund and the remainder, separately, to DATs.
<P>

<a name="30610w01_para1"></a>In announcing the new funding for CAD, the SCI and the PDF in January, the Home Secretary indicated that he wished to consult with local groups&#151;those at the sharp end, including CDRPs, DATs, voluntary groups and national bodies concerned with crime reduction&#151;about whether they wished to see a merger of these programmes in order to reduce the bureaucratic burden on them, thereby allowing them to concentrate on delivery rather than paperwork. There was clear support for the idea of a merger and a single pot of funding but a strong wish to ensure that the level of drugs spend was maintained.
<P>

<a name="30610w01_para2"></a>Practitioners have been aware for some time that plans were being drawn up for this new fund, and activities are already well under way to spend the money, with many already drawing down grant and progressing their work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610w02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston:  </B>  The Blue Badge Scheme and the enforcement powers to protect it do not apply to off-street car parks. There are no plans to change that position.
<P>

<a name="30610w02_para1"></a>Vehicles can be clamped on private land, but the legality depends on the circumstances of the particular case and whether the clamper has acted reasonably in the protection of private property rights. Off-street car parks are private property and the conditions of use are a contractual matter between the owner and the motorist.
<P>

<a name="30610w02_para2"></a>There are other ways of tackling abuse in off-street car parks, which are set out in a factsheet which is available from the Department for Transport. In addition we are also working closely with, and supporting, the Baywatch campaign, which is committed to encouraging more protection of disabled persons' parking bays in retail car parks from abuse by non-disabled drivers.

<P>
What are the reasons for the penalty fares regime being reintroduced for rail travel between Gatwick Airport and London stations; and [HL3161]

Whether the Strategic Rail Authority consulted the London Transport Users Committee on the issue of the rail penalty fares regime from Stansted and Gatwick Airports to London. [HL3163]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610w02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston:  </B>  Train operating companies are free to decide whether or not to apply penalty fares. Those that wish to charge penalty fares must submit a scheme for approval to the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA). The scheme has to comply with the Penalty Fares Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Transport and the Penalty Fares Rules made by the SRA. The approval process includes consultation with the relevant rail passengers committee and passenger transport executive. The London Transport Users Committee was consulted on all the London area penalty fares schemes, including Thameslink and South Central. Thameslink and South Central charge penalty fares on most of their networks, including on their services between Gatwick and London. Gatwick Express and WAGN's dedicated London&#151;Stansted Express service have decided not to operate a penalty fares scheme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610w03_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  In research commissioned by Defra, an interdisciplinary panel of experts were asked to summarise the state of scientific knowledge and uncertainty and estimate the risk of a sea level rise of over four metres due to the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS). The study revealed a wide range of opinions on the stability of the WAIS and concluded that it would most likely not collapse in the next few centuries, although they estimate a 50 per cent probability of WAIS causing sea level rise of at least 10mm per year within 200 years. There is still much uncertainty about the behaviour of the WAIS: whether it is still adjusting to changes after the last ice age and how it will respond to climate warming and contribute to sea level rise. Both the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the Hadley Centre continue to assess the impacts of climate change on ice sheets both in the Arctic and the Antarctic through observational and modelling studies. The collapse of the WAIS over a period of centuries would raise sea levels by some six metres with a major impact on low-lying countries and coastlines.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30610w03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   The most rigorous method for measuring the cost of management would be to start with the definition of the activities that constitute management. The amount of time each member of staff spent on those activities would then be calculated and costed but even if a list of activities could be agreed upon, such a method would be prone to subjectivity and inconsistent application. It would also be extremely time-consuming and bureaucratic to undertake. The method adopted is based on management posts.
<P>

<a name="30610w03_para5"></a>Not all the running costs of primary care trusts and National Health Service trusts cover activities that are classed as management, unlike strategic health authorities and former health authorities, whose management cost definition includes elements for both staff and non-staff costs as their running costs do cover activities that are classed as management.

<P>

<a name="30610w03_para6"></a>New data from clinical trials in children and adolescents were received by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) at the end of May 2003. These new data have been reviewed by an expert working group on SSRIs and the CSM. These data do not demonstrate efficacy in depressive illness in this age group and show an <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>increase in the risk of events including episodes of self-harm and potentially suicidal behaviour in the Seroxat group compared to placebo. Various analyses suggest that the risk of these events is between 1.5 and 3.2 times greater with Seroxat compared to placebo. On the basis of these data, CSM has advised that the balance of risks and benefits of Seroxat is unfavourable when used to treat depressive illness in this age group. CSM has advised that Seroxat should not be used in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years to treat depressive illness. Ministers have accepted the committee's advice.
<P>

<a name="30610w03_para7"></a>Seroxat is not and never has been licensed for use in those under 18 but it is used in this age group outside its licensed indications where prescribers make a judgement on their own responsibility that it is the right treatment for a particular patient.
<P>

<a name="30610w03_para8"></a>SSRIs, including Seroxat, have been under close continuous review by the MHRA and the CSM for a number of years with the CSM issuing advice in 2000 and 2001. The product information for SSRI antidepressants already contains advice that suicidal thoughts and behaviour are likely to increase in the early stages of treatment of depression (as with all antidepressants) and patient information leaflets already contain advice to seek medical advice urgently in the event of such symptoms.
<P>

<a name="30610w03_para9"></a>The recent concerns expressed by patient groups and in the media over the safety of Seroxat have been taken very seriously. In response to concerns of an association of Seroxat with withdrawal reactions and suicidal behaviour, a new expert working group of the CSM has been convened to further review the safety of SSRIs and to ensure the advice in the product information for both patients and prescribers is optimal for the safe use of these products. This group will be incorporating the experiences of patients in its safety evaluation.
<P>

<a name="30610w03_para10"></a>Communications to patients and prescribers are taking place today. The expert working group of the CSM, convened to look at the wider issues relating to the safety of SSRIs, will examine urgently what implications, if any, these new findings have for the use of Seroxat in adults and for other SSRIs. The benefits of taking Seroxat are well established and patients over 18 and patients who are benefiting from Seroxat should not be frightened into stopping their medication. Patients who are experiencing any side effects or are concerned about their treatment should discuss these with their doctor.
