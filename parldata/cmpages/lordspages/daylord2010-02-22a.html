It includes everything from intelligence to the equipment that can be used, although I would point out that equipment is only a small part of our defences against these particularly obnoxious devices. We do of course include our allies in terms of sharing information and we use the information that they give us, but often we are operating in somewhat different circumstances, so

These soldiers are highly trained, very brave and take a great number of risks on behalf of their colleagues. Those who undertake this kind of work are volunteers, and it has been possible to find volunteers to undergo the training at present. We are continually in the process of trying to expand the skills that we have in this area. However, we should be under no illusions about the dangers that these people face. We should all be very grateful for the work that they undertake.</p>

That brings the total estimated expenditure on UORs for the year 2009-10 to £736 million, and that does not include the plans to spend over £700 million on protected mobility vehicles. The Treasury has recognised this particular area, and I think that the Prime Minister's Statement last year made it clear that for everyone in Government, countering the IED threat, which is so important in this campaign, is a very high priority indeed.</p>

However, I can assure the noble Lord and indeed the House that everything possible is being done. One of the most significant initiatives was the tiger team set up by the MoD last year to bring together the best brains from industry and the scientific community, inviting new ideas and then evaluating them. That is a very exciting project. It is ongoing because the threat is developing all the time. Although we are sharing that information with the United States, which is very interested in it, it is important to realise

We have to adapt our technology because the nature of the problem that we face is evolving, and we have to try to anticipate what the next steps should be. It is an exceptionally high priority for everybody in the military and the MoD.</p>

By the end of last year we had increased very significantly our capability in terms of the hours that we have available for drones: by 33 per cent for Hermes, 50 per cent for Desert Hawk, and 80 per cent for our Reaper capability. We acknowledge the very real importance they can play, but I emphasise that the equipment we have is only one part of the battle. It is also about our tactics and procedures, and the training we give our troops. Overall, taking all those things into account, we have made real headway, and we are working very closely with allies to share our experience and indeed to learn from them.</p>

A recent CIPD report showed that three-quarters of these people need to work past the state pension age because this affects their pension.

The House will understand that I would not wish to offer him any redeployment opportunities from the Dispatch Box. I recognise that this is a serious question. It is right that we invest in young people, who are the future of our country, and ensure that they are not allowed to drift into long-term unemployment at the start of their working lives. We have made significant investment in new measures for jobseekers of all ages. In the recent White Paper, <I>Building Britain's Recovery</I>, we announced more help for older workers. This includes new, specialist, back-to-work support for the over-50s; a widening of access for over-50s to work in job trials, where older jobseekers would benefit from earlier access; and ensuring that over-50s with significant barriers to employment receive early access to the six-month offer.

Among men, long-term unemployment has gone up by more than 50 per cent in the last year for the over-50s, compared with only 23 per cent for women.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="1002222000161"></a>"If there is ever a time for women to make a decisive breakthrough in corporate boardrooms, it is surely now. Many boards, especially in financial services, are in flux after the testosterone-fuelled excesses that led to financial disaster".</p>

That is a matter of some concern to Members of this House, where we discuss the board's report.</p>

<p><a name="st_43"></a>

I spoke about it to the chairman of the SSRB, who pointed out-quite rightly-that when the board sought new members recently it did not have the number of women coming through to be interviewed. Quite frankly, that is not good enough. There are women out there who could come forward, but perhaps the advertisements and the headhunters who were used did not identify them. That is something in which we must all engage constructively.</p>

Excuse me! Does the noble Baroness really think that we ought to employ these people again?</p>

We have to ensure that they are properly identified and know that the opportunities are there for them to grasp.</p>

Part of the problem for headhunters is that they look at CVs that reflect a linear career path, but these do not represent women who have stopped off, had children and developed their careers at different times. There is an endemic culture of not recognising how women peak at a different time in their careers because of their different responsibilities.</p>

CONTEST presents our strategy to reduce the risk from international terrorism. The Prevent strand aims to stop people from becoming or supporting violent extremists.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_815"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 815</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="1002222000063"></a>The international terrorist threat is mainly from al-Qaeda and AQ-influenced groups, which primarily seek to recruit vulnerable individuals from Muslim communities. Muslim communities, though not the sole focus, remain a priority for Prevent support.</p>

<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="1002222000064"></a><b><a name="100222-0002.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="1002222000252"></a>Baroness Knight of Collingtree:</b> My Lords, does the Minister think that the recent permission given for a hard-line Muslim priest-Yahya Ibrahim, banned in America-to come to Britain to speak in a number of British universities might just be adding to the extreme concern expressed by the State Department in America, and have led to the House of Commons Select Committee to describe our approach to the al-Qaeda programme as "lethargic"?</p>

There are very specific rules about who we can stop coming in and, in the assessment of the Home Secretary, the particular individual talked about did not meet the cut-off level for not being allowed in. We are always dealing with some organisations which, one could argue, are on the cusp of these things. It is vital that we engage with them because sometimes they can make a genuine difference in stopping violent extremism, though they might have views that we abhor.</p>

<a name="100222-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="1002222000066"></a>This is a very difficult balance. We have done a lot over the past two and a half years. I think that we have got better at this, and that we have got a better understanding. We have made some mistakes, but we have learnt from those and we are much better at it now. As far as the Americans go, they are really impressed with our Prevent strategy. They did not have a similar strategy, and they see it as a very good example. They have some views about how they would adjust it, and we are in very close dialogue. But we are doing the right thing, and it is very important that we have done that.</p>

This is a significant and important issue, and there is no doubt that it poisons a lot of other issues. The British Government are clear on our views on it. The noble Lord is right that a resolution of the affairs in the Middle East would make a huge difference to extremism; it would change it fundamentally.</p>

There is no doubt that the vast majority of Muslims oppose violent extremism; only a tiny minority are violent extremists. That is why we have close liaison with a number of people from all faiths and communities within the Prevent strategy.</p>

<a name="100222-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="1002222000071"></a>With regard to funding, we have spent £240 million on Prevent over the past two years, a level of spending that had not been there before, within this country at community level and above. Foreign Office spending on Prevent is at about £80 million over the past three years. That is a lot of money, and it is more than has ever been spent. There have been constraints on some of that but overall it has still increased, and it is an important part of the whole package.</p>

<a name="100222-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="1002222000072"></a>I am proud of our Prevent package. We had not really talked about these issues until about two and a half years ago; we had certainly not done very much. We were all culpable, in that in the 1990s we did not understand this pernicious radicalisation of tiny numbers of people in our midst-we just had not spotted it. That was an error. We picked it up in our CONTEST strategy and we pointed it out. We now understand it to a degree; we are still learning, but we are doing a lot of good things to try to counter it.</p>

I see these programmes as being complementary-they all work together. Things like our Channel programme do a huge amount in identifying and pulling out those who are vulnerable and working with local communities. The vast majority of our Muslim community understand this and are becoming linked in to the Prevent agenda. I am not pretending that we have got everything right; this is a difficult and sensitive area, and we are working hard and learning lessons all the time. These things all work together, though, and all of them are needed.</p>

It is a pleasant change to be moving the first amendment in Committee instead of being last up at 10 pm, as I have been on several recent occasions. However, I can be as brief in moving this amendment as one is obliged to be at 10 pm. At Second Reading, the noble Baroness asked me to work with the Government to make the Bill and its guidance stronger and more effective. It is in that spirit that I move this amendment today.</p>

<a name="100222-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="1002222000084"></a>The amendment would make it a legal requirement for service providers to involve users of those services in decisions on how they will discharge their functions under the regulations. Apart from this being good practice as a matter of course, there is a particular reason for making this a legal requirement in the Bill. Two recently introduced statutory instruments-2655 and 2678-made two very welcome changes to benefit rules applying to service users who are paid for their involvement in the work of a variety of bodies in the health and social care field. One concerned the treatment of reimbursed expenses as earnings and the other the application of what are known as "notional earnings".</p>

<a name="100222-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="1002222000085"></a>However, the new rules cover only those whose involvement is required by law. Those whose involvement is merely a matter of good practice or a response to policy guidance are not covered. The new rules do not apply unless the involvement of service users is required by statute or is commissioned by a public body that is required by law to involve service users. I am moving this amendment to make absolutely sure that service users who are involved in decisions about how the new regulations are implemented will be covered and able to derive the benefit of the new benefit rules. I beg to move.</p>

He has cited various good, technical reasons why his amendment should receive sympathetic treatment from the Minister, but what troubles me about the Government's policy for rolling out free personal care to the elderly is the prescriptive feel of the policy. It has a kind of "take what you're given" feel. As such, I cannot help feeling that it cuts across the trend towards greater personalisation in social care, on which-to be fair to the Government-there has been a lot of encouraging progress in recent years.</p>

<a name="100222-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="1002222000087"></a>Before you can get free care, you have to tick a whole series of boxes, at the end of which you are either entitled to the service on offer or you are not. By contrast, the premise of the personal budget is the exact opposite: it starts from the position of saying that service users should have choice and control over what they buy to meet their care needs.</p>

<a name="100222-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="1002222000088"></a>The policy will also, I think, serve to disincentivise people from engaging in prevention programmes before serious health problems set in. If people are led to

Involving service users and their carers in decisions about the type of care that is appropriate and necessary is absolutely essential. I hope the Minister will find a way of ensuring that, at the very least, the guidance to local authorities on the issue makes this point clear.</p>

This is very much in line with the Government's policy of devolving power to disabled people and realigning care and support systems so that they promote real choice, control and personalisation. These are goals that current legislation actively thwarts. Unless you live in an area-and such areas remain the exception-where the local authority is at an advanced stage of implementing self-directed support and individual budgets, you will find that your care package remains something handed down to you, rather than something you actively participate in, design or own. Many people continue to receive services they would not choose for themselves and much provision is arranged for the convenience of the provider, rather than being tailored to what the individual needs.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="1002222000090"></a>The amendment would provide a valuable corrective to this lingering culture of paternalism. It could also provide an invaluable guarantor of the cost-effectiveness of the new free care offer. There is copious evidence that self-directed support achieves better outcomes for people with the same resources. I strongly urge the Minister to give a firm commitment today to embedding the principles of choice and control in the arrangements made under the Bill.</p>

I am interested in the comment of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, about so many care packages being designed to suit the carer. At Second Reading I mentioned how people are being put to bed at 6 pm when they would rather stay up for the ten o'clock news. It is important to ensure that these users of services have a say and are involved. However, it is clearly impossible to accommodate everyone because not everyone can be put to bed at 10 pm. That is why it must be spread over a period. Although in theory I absolutely agree with the amendment, in practice it is not as easy to implement as we imagine. My other question is about those users of such services who are not capable of making decisions. Exactly what provision will there be for such people where they rely on someone else to make decisions?</p>

<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="1002222000092"></a><b><a name="100222-0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="1002222000275"></a>Lord Sutherland of Houndwood:</b> My Lords, I support the amendment for the reasons already given. One of the great dangers in providing care services is that we move inevitably towards a "one size fits all" approach to suit the institutional providers of care. This is a welcome corrective and I support the principle of the amendment.</p>

One of the most distressing features of increasing incapacity is a sense that you can be disempowered from making decisions about your life. If we are talking about personal care at home, care cannot be imposed on people, because it then treats the human person as an object to be done to. The value of the amendment is that it recognises that real care includes a degree of reciprocity, while recognising all the practical problems that have already been mentioned. The sort of consultations that are suggested here would make it feel like real care. I hope the Minister will feel able to accept the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="1002222000094"></a><b><a name="100222-0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="1002222000277"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, I am replying to Amendments 2 and 4, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe. It is appropriate that we should be discussing now, right at the beginning of the Bill, the importance of the involvement of users and carers in determining care needs. These are entirely appropriate amendments, each addressing slightly different aspects of this area. However, I think that we all agree how important it is that an individual should be involved in determining how their own care needs can best be met, by being involved in the assessment and decision-making processes.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="1002222000095"></a>That is the whole ethos of the transformation agenda in <I>Putting People First</I>. The excellent work going on in councils such as Manchester, Trafford, Oldham, Essex and others demonstrates the value of life-changing projects which ensure that people who need care are involved in shaping it. I am not claiming that this happens everywhere, but we know that there is very good practice that needs to be spread throughout the country.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="1002222000096"></a>Our aim is to put people in the driving seat to enable them to be in control of their own lives, as explained by my noble friend Lady Wilkins. It is important to say that there may be situations where a person has the onset of a degenerative or other neurological condition, as pointed out by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, and it is no longer possible for them to determine what is best for them. In these situations, others must be entrusted to make the right decisions. In doing so, they have to be mindful of the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act and seek to do this in a way that is not only in the person's best interest but follows as much as is possible what the person would have wished for themselves. This House has discussed that Act on many occasions.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="1002222000097"></a>We will continue to encourage councils and to champion those which do good work with their user organisations. We do not believe that we need to insert new provisions into the Bill to do so, because we already have directions made under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 that support user involvement in care planning. These directions already place a statutory requirement on local authorities to ensure that people receiving care services have appropriate input into determining their care.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="1002222000098"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Low, rightly said that his amendments refer to the users of services being involved in those decisions. The problem is that they conflate the functions with which the regulations will be concerned, which concern the eligibility for free personal care,  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_821"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 821</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and the functions relating to the delivery of free personal care themselves, which is not something with which the regulation power of Section 15 is concerned. However, it is right that people receiving care are involved in the development of their care plans, which is a key element of the principle of personalisation that we have already begun to develop over the past two years. We have been working to transform adult social care.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="1002222000099"></a>I therefore say to the noble Earl that it is entirely consistent with the approach of personalisation. The Bill will be setting through the regulations, when they are made, an entitlement to free personal care. People will then receive a personal budget that can be spent flexibly with their carer to meet their needs, and guidance will make that clear.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="1002222000100"></a>Several noble Lords have said that they agree with the principle of this-as do the Government. We think that the regulatory framework is there. However, we believe that what the noble Lord, Lord Low, is proposing would be covered in guidance. We would be very happy to re-emphasise this in guidance and to discuss it with the noble Lord and others as the guidance is developed.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="1002222000101"></a>Finally, I understand from the noble Lord's remarks that he was concerned that user involvement in this way might result in some people being pushed above the threshold of certain benefits if they receive a small payment for their involvement. I can assure him that that would not be the case. This is not a scheme that will involve payments for user involvement. I therefore ask the noble Lord, with those assurances, to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="1002222000102"></a><b><a name="100222-0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="1002222000278"></a>Lord Low of Dalston:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for her reply and to all noble Lords who have spoken and given the amendment a warm welcome.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="1002222000103"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, made a couple of points. I think that the Minister probably responded to the point about users who are unable to represent their own needs or have difficulty in doing so. On the point that it is not possible to meet everyone's needs simultaneously, thoroughgoing implementation of the personalisation agenda should help in that regard. However, I am largely reassured by what the Minister said, in that a statutory requirement for service users to be involved does in fact exist under the community care Act. That being the case, there is probably no need for the amendment to be put on the face of the Bill. I was glad to hear the Minister say that it is her intention to emphasise that requirement in guidance, and possibly to give further guidance as to how to discharge the obligation.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="1002222000104"></a>I shall read carefully what the Minister said and see whether there is anything that we need to return to on Report. I was a bit concerned when she said at the end of her response that people would not be paid. Arrangements differ from one body to another, and sometimes payments are made for this kind of user involvement. I would want to be sure that, where there was a practice of payment, this could be maintained without, as she said, pushing people above the benefit thresholds. For the time being, I am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It is very important that people who have been denied the right to personal care and feel that they have been wrongly assessed should have the right of appeal.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="1002222000106"></a>Staff working in many different fields have the right of appeal for many different reasons. Why should service users be denied this right? Why has the right of appeal been left out of this Bill? In order to establish this, it is necessary first to amend the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Act 2003. This is covered by Amendment 39, which creates the right of appeal. Amendment 3 simply amends Clause 1(1) of the Bill to make it clear that the community care Act is being amended.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="1002222000107"></a>There is a growing army of elderly people, some of whom have serious and complex neurological conditions. When money is scarce, it will be very easy for local authorities to refuse much-needed help. Some local authorities have a very dogmatic approach to the people who need help. It is the wish of most people to stay in their own homes and, if possible, to die there. However, that is not for everyone. I will give your Lordships an example, having received an e-mail last week from the daughter of an elderly lady. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="1002222000164"></a>"These are my views and those of my mother. The Government seems set on providing care for elderly people in their own homes, stating that this is their preference. However, the sad fact is that many elderly people, like my mother, live alone and long for company. Although she has carers coming in three times a day, they stay a very short time to deal with household and personal care tasks, and she then spends many hours alone with no-one to talk to. For this reason, there should be choice so that those with families nearby or close friends can have the opportunity to stay in their home with the help they need. But for those without this resource and who express a preference, a move into a care home will mean constant companionship, planned activities during the day and the stimulation of conversation with others. Research shows that constant stimulation is beneficial to the elderly and aids good health. Leaving an elderly person to cope in their own home can lead to isolation, depression and vulnerability to poor health".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="1002222000108"></a>I brought up the need for a right of appeal at Second Reading but had no response from the Government. I hope that this time there will be a positive reply. As people's needs vary so much, choice and flexibility should be the policy of all local authorities. Unfortunately, that so often is not the case. Therefore, an amendment to the appeals system should be in place. Would it not be possible for the Care Standards Tribunal, which deals with many appeals from members of staff, also to deal with appeals from service users who have been turned down by their local authorities? I hope that the Government and your Lordships will accept this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_823"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 823</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the provisions of the Bill are brought into force, there will be many decisions that will go the wrong way from the point of view of the service user. I am afraid that we are going to see a lot of disappointed people out there. There needs to be a formal process by which service users can make representations and be sure that their concerns will be considered objectively. I therefore strongly support the noble Baroness's amendment.</p>

<a name="1002222000110"></a><b><a name="100222-0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="1002222000282"></a>Baroness Gardner of Parkes:</b> My Lords, I also support the noble Baroness but I am concerned about a number of things. One is the point she has just made about the person who would prefer to be in a care home rather than live in their own home. As I understand it, there will be a perverse incentive there in that if, under the Bill, you are one of the people who will be eligible to receive free care, you will not receive it unless you are already in the very limited category of those who have their residential home paid for. Therefore, we are probably eliminating the element of choice for those people who would prefer to go into a home but not to have to pay for their care, whether it was in a home or wherever. I think we are almost discriminating in this way, in that the Bill proposes to help those in their own homes but not to help them if they make a choice as in the case described by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="1002222000111"></a>There are two different issues here. I support completely the right of appeal because I think that, under normal justice, we all expect to have the right of appeal on any and all issues. However, I am concerned about the bureaucracy that will be required to cope with the appeals, because I imagine that there will be a huge number of them. Once people get the feeling that, no matter what your income is, you can have your care at home for free, everyone will want to appeal on that. The proposal, according to the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, was to have a separate external body hearing the appeals. I think that is essential because local authorities will not possibly be able to cope. They will be hard-pushed enough coping with the assessments proposed under the Bill, never mind the appeals against them. Therefore, I support the principle of the right of appeal but I am concerned about how the process would work in reality.</p>

I emphasise the point borne out by her moving quotation-the fact is that most people living at home get very small amounts of care of, typically, six hours a week, typically confined to week days. The Government may say that that will all change but they have spent all the money on making the care free, so they are not going to have any left over to provide much more care. In those circumstances, unless the Government's costings are hugely increased so that far more care is made available at home, as well as it being free-that would explode the Government's costings-the reality is that for many people staying on at home is not a bearable option. I shall refer to that later in the debate. It is therefore all the more essential that something is done to prevent the bias in the Bill-it can be put no less highly than that-against people who need a lot of care, will not get it at home and who, if they go into residential care, will unfairly have to pay for it whereas people who receive it at home will not.</p>

I rather naively thought that there was a right of appeal; perhaps I have misunderstood. For example, there is a rather arbitrary cut-off point as regards whether a person receives half the attendance allowance or the full attendance allowance depending on the level of disability. The majority of appeals against the half-day rating are found for the appellant. Those decisions are often very arbitrary and are not founded on a proper understanding of the impact of a person's disability. Therefore, it is clear to me that there must be a right of appeal. If it is not there automatically in the Bill, I add my support for the amendment, but I hope very much that the Minister will tell us that it is already in there.</p>

However, like my noble friend Lady Gardner, I am worried about the costs and the work which we are imposing on local authorities. I should make plain that if someone would like to pay the costs which my wife and I incur for her care, I would be extraordinarily grateful. However, I wonder whether anybody has a realistic idea of what those costs are. That is one of my worries about the Bill. If we then added to all these costs the perverse incentive that my noble friend Lady Gardner mentioned of allowing those who qualify for free care at home to take that free care with them into a care home, that would be quite extraordinary because it would mean that they would be better off than people who had been in the care home originally. Although Her Majesty's Government were no doubt inspired by all sorts of good and decent feelings in this matter, they have not quite thought through-nor have some of my noble friends thought through-the complications, possible perverse incentives and sheer scale of the cost involved.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="1002222000115"></a>I think that my wife qualifies for about £60 a week for her care. We sometimes have a good laugh about just how much care can be provided for £60 a week. It is pretty darned little. I would be very happy to tell the Minister in private exactly what it does cost to care for someone like my wife at home.</p>

One of the lacunae in the Bill is the uncertainty about the relationship between care in residential contexts and care at home. For example, what happens if someone comes from a care-at-home situation and needs care in a residence, which could well happen part-way down the system? So there are lacunae in the Bill, but I would like to detach those from the question of whether there ought to be and sensibly should be an appeals system of some kind. I can think of two practical grounds for having an appeals system. One is that evidence has shown in the past that appeals will come in anyway. Indeed, two or three years ago they came in in their thousands to the health ombudsman's office. That office was not set up specifically to deal with this need, but appeals will go somewhere and, in that sense, it would be far better to have an appeals system that was understood within the context of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="1002222000117"></a>The other point is that it would be a considerable discipline, for those who agree what criteria should be applied, to have those criteria plain and understood and with as much objectivity as possible in such a difficult situation. That being the case, there would be fairly straightforward grounds, I would hope, for settling whether a particular appeal should be upheld. There are cases to be made for supporting an appeals system, despite the continuing problems of the Bill.</p>

A couple of weeks ago, I listened to a senior member of a local authority social services department make a complete hash of explaining care brokerage to a roomful of people. She managed, in the course of five minutes and two sentences, to confuse care assessment, care brokerage, negotiation of services and funding.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="1002222000119"></a>It is important that, in talking about an appeal, we recognise that there are three different appeal processes in social care. One is an appeal against an assessment of needs, the second may be an appeal against the basis on which that assessment was made-that is, the criteria-and the third is an appeal against the decision about what funds or, indeed, services to allocate to somebody. I assume that the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, wishes to do all three of those, but I want us to be very clear all the way through these discussions about precisely what we are talking about, because those three assessments need to be done entirely separately.</p>

<a name="100222-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="1002222000120"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, will understand that, although it is interesting to follow where the money comes from, it is absolutely essential that the analysis of need be independent. Not only might the individual user wish to appeal against that, but crucially their carers might wish to do so, because of the way in which those assessments are commonly done. I reiterate: please could we have some clarity about terms throughout this debate? The 47 amendments that have been put down show that this afternoon is all about clarity and definition, which may be the only thing that we achieve at the end of our debate. Therefore, we should be very careful about the terms that we use.</p>

We recognise that clarity and transparency are important here. That is why we are putting a great deal of emphasis on developing what the department calls a national tool-I know that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, will cringe when I use that expression, but he knows what I mean-that all councils should use to assess people with the highest personal care needs to ensure a consistent approach. Therefore, people who are unhappy about their assessment, about the package of reablement or about the package of care should have the right to make a complaint to the council in the usual fashion.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, and the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, highlighted why we will be asking the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, to withdraw her amendment. We do not wish to create a separate and potentially bureaucratic layer to deal with this on top of the existing complaints system. People already have an opportunity to pursue their case, if necessary as far as the Local Government Ombudsman. This House has discussed the work of the Local Government Ombudsman on previous occasions and noble Lords have remarked how effective and accessible the ombudsman has been and is. We are reluctant to create another mechanism over and above that, as that would add to the costs and the administrative burden placed on councils and it might create confusion for users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="1002222000123"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Masham and Lady Gardner, raised the issue of people being able to choose whether to stay at home or move into residential care. The purpose of the Bill is not to remove choice. We recognise that some people will choose to enter residential care-we will discuss the issue later in Committee. However, we are also encouraging local authorities to work with, for example, the voluntary sector to encourage the development of wider community services for older people who are lonely. Here the noble Baroness made an important point. She also asked whether it would be possible for the Care Standards Tribunal to deal with these appeals. I have already addressed that. The appropriate appeals system is already recognised in this area.</p>

<a name="100222-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="1002222000124"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, and the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, raised the issue of the incentive for people to stay at home because it is free when a residential setting may be more appropriate. The decision about the appropriate care setting for people should be made first based on the person's needs and whether they have carers who can help with some of them. The Bill will give people a breathing space sometimes to stay at home for longer, rather than going into residential care.</p>

<a name="100222-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="1002222000125"></a>Amendments 3 and 39 would require the Secretary of State to make regulations to establish a specific appeals mechanism for those who believe that they are entitled to indefinite provision of a free qualifying service but have been denied it by their local authority. I have explained why that is not an appropriate route to go down. As the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, said, it is important that decisions on free personal care are as fair and transparent as possible. People who believe that they have not been treated fairly and that the criteria have not been applied fairly should have the right to challenge the local authority's decision. Refusals to provide free personal care that are felt to have been wrongly determined should be dealt with under the existing procedures. We intend that this area should be considered as part of the review policy within 12 to 18 months of implementation.</p>

This whole situation is very complex. One of the most complex things is that the people who have the highest personal care needs are going to be the ones that get it free. However, what happens to those who may not have the highest needs? Do they get nothing? I can see local authorities saying, "We haven't got any more money, so you can't have any help".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="1002222000128"></a>What worries me tremendously when I think of people who may be diagnosed with motor neurone disease is the slowness of assessments.

I would like to discuss this whole matter with Members such as my noble friend Lord Sutherland, who is an expert on these things, and with other noble Lords so that we can get something satisfactory written into this Bill to avoid confusion, because I am sure that there will be confusion-indeed, there is already a lot of confusion about this whole Bill.

<a name="100222-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="1002222000131"></a>"Mr Speaker, although new facts continue to emerge, let me set out the facts as we know them. On 19 January, Mahmoud al-Mabhouh was killed in Dubai. The first press reports about this death appeared on 28 January. On 31 January, the Emirati authorities confirmed to our officials press reporting that European passports had been used, and undertook to provide us and others with further details. This was followed up by embassy officials in Dubai and Abu Dhabi on several occasions.</p>

<a name="100222-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="1002222000132"></a>On 12 February, the Emirati authorities informed UK officials in London that UK passports might-I repeat, might-have been involved. On 15 February, they confirmed this and provided the details of six British passports involved. Soon after on the same day, they provided a full briefing to the media. On 17 February, the Prime Minister announced a full investigation by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. On 21 February, the Foreign Secretary spoke to Abdullah  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_828"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 828</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bin Zayed, the Emirati Foreign Minister, who confirmed that they would be sending us details of at least two further British passports that may have been involved.</p>

<a name="100222-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="1002222000133"></a>It would be wrong of me to prejudge the SOCA investigation. But let me make it crystal clear that no part of the British Government, either Minister or official, had any foreknowledge of Mr al-Mabhouh's killing or the use of British passports in it or of any clandestine operation being planned. To suggest otherwise is to make an irresponsible allegation without any basis in fact.</p>

<a name="100222-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="1002222000134"></a>I know that there is considerable concern among honourable Members about the possibility of the role of the Israeli authorities, so I should set out our exchanges with them. On 18 February, the Israeli ambassador came to the FCO for a meeting with the permanent under-secretary, and earlier this afternoon my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary met the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr Lieberman, in Brussels. He underlined the deep discontent felt in this country, in this Government and in this House over the issue. He made clear that we regard the killing of Mr al-Mabhouh as profoundly unhelpful for the cause of peace in the Middle East and stability in the region. He stressed that we require full co-operation from the Israeli authorities with the SOCA investigation.</p>

<a name="100222-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="1002222000135"></a>My right honourable friend said that we would stand ready to work with Israel on bringing stability and peace to the Middle East, but that we can only do so on the basis of trust and mutual transparency. Honourable Members are rightly concerned about the impact this incident has had on the British nationals involved. Our embassy in Tel Aviv has been in touch with all six of those whose passports have already been reported as having been misused. We will do all we can to ensure that they get the consular support they need".</p>

These questions are quite aside from the facts of the apparent assassination and whether it furthers in any way the cause of peace in the Middle East.

That is very important. Can he explain a little more, even at this stage, how on earth these passports were forged, if they were forged, or cloned, if they were cloned-or were they copied or stolen? Were they older British passports without microchip technology, or were they the newer documents, in which case can we draw the conclusion that this sort of thing is now less likely to happen?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="1002222000138"></a>How soon did the Government first learn of these passport thefts? The Statement tells us that the assassination took place on 19 January, and that, apparently on 12 February, the British were warned by the UAE authorities that British passports might have been involved, which was confirmed on 15 February. Almost a month passed between the killing and the information coming to light, which seems an extraordinarily long time. At what point was the Serious Organised Crime Agency involved? I understand that the agency operates from a base in the British embassy in Abu Dhabi. Was it aware of the impending difficulties and the involvement of British passports before 15 February, or was it news to the agency as well?</p>

<a name="100222-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="1002222000139"></a>Does the noble Lord agree that this is very worrying indeed for a number of groups? At present, British passport arrivals in the UAE get a visa waiver. I say "at present", and one hopes that there is no question of that changing. However, does the Minister accept that all passport holders-especially those travelling in the entire region where we have good friends and maintain good relations which we wish to develop and strengthen; and particularly all those whose identities have been stolen-really need swift and urgent reassurances that our system is secure and that this kind of thing can never happen again?</p>

These are very serious matters that touch on attempts to get a peace settlement in the Middle East, on the safety and security of our own citizens, and on the ability of our passport, intelligence and other services to secure the integrity of data held on British citizens. The Minister has given us the chronology of the events. That bare chronology is known to all, but two or three issues come out of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="1002222000141"></a>If, as the Minister said, UK officials were told that British passports might have been used on 12 February, can the Minister confirm why it took until 18 February for the Israeli ambassador to be invited to a meeting with the head of the UK Diplomatic Service? The citizens of this country would expect that when their security is so endangered and when such a serious breach resulting in identity theft has taken place in what is ultimately an unstable part of the world, the UK Government would be slightly more agile in investigating the matter and calling in the relevant ambassador in a more efficient manner than the chronology reflects.</p>

<a name="100222-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="1002222000150"></a>First, in order to put things into context, I should say that at least two criminal inquiries are taking place: the SOCA inquiry into possible misuse of British passports, and, in the Emirates, a murder inquiry. I am not sure what will happen in our European partner countries whose passports also were misused-Ireland, Germany and France. We have to be somewhat careful, certainly in apportioning blame. I can do no better than to start by referring to the statements made by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary on 18 February. The Prime Minister made it clear that we have to get to the bottom of this question, then we can see where we go and what remedial action to take.</p>

<a name="100222-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="1002222000151"></a>The noble Baroness raised the question of what the response of the Israeli ambassador was. I think that we saw it, because he made a brief statement on television. He simply said-I think that it is a fact-that he would take the message from the UK Government back to his Government. That was as far as he went. The meeting that took place today between the Foreign Secretary and his Israeli counterpart was requested by the Israelis some 10 days ago. I have related, as my colleague in another place has, the response of the British Foreign Secretary. In turn, we await the response of the Foreign Minister of Israel. I am sure this will be reported back to your Lordships' House in one form or another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="1002222000152"></a>The gap in time was the other issue that concerned both the noble Lord and the noble Baroness. Fifteen February was the first occasion on which we knew the names of the six British passport holders. We made inquiries between 12 and 15 February, but it was made clear by the police authorities in the Emirates that they wished to conclude their initial investigation before they contacted any other foreign embassy. It was only at the point when we received the passport details that we could start to investigate whether they were forged or real. We know now that they were not real. We are offering assistance to the passport holders and reassuring them about the reissue of passports and so on.</p>

<a name="100222-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="1002222000153"></a>We take seriously the compromising of the British passport system. To answer the noble Lord's question, these were current, not old, passports, but they did not have within them the facility that we have with biometric passports, which will be fully introduced by 2012 and will be much more difficult to forge. On this occasion, we do not know how the forgery took place and I am sure that that will be one of the issues that the Serious Organised Crime Agency will continue to investigate. We are seeking the co-operation of the Emirates and Israeli authorities in conjunction with our European partners, who also have an interest in this issue.</p>

<a name="100222-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="1002222000154"></a>As I say, we have not received any reassurances from the Israeli Government. At the moment we have no proof of an extra-judicial killing, whatever supposition we might have and whatever speculation there has been in the press. The Government should be commended for their clear and speedy response in setting up the SOCA inquiry, which will report to the Identity and Passport Service and, through it, to the Home Secretary. I am sure that when in due course that inquiry is completed, the outcome will be reported to Parliament.</p>

Suffice it to say that there is enough blame to go round. On this occasion we are looking at a specific act which appears to have involved the use of British and other European passports. That is a matter of major concern. We have instigated an inquiry and we have sought the co-operation of the Israeli authorities by telling us what they know. It would be injudicious to go any further than that until we have some indication of the Israeli response and the outcome of the inquiry.</p>

One of the main concerns about this Bill which emerged at Second Reading was the deeply unsatisfactory way in which its provisions cut across the key arguments and principles articulated in the Government's Green Paper of last July, <I>Shaping the Future of Care Together</I>. For my own part, I found that Green Paper to be an extremely helpful analysis of the issues that should be uppermost in our minds as we consider the long-term reform of social care provision. Two conclusions from the Green Paper were inescapable. The first was that, as a nation, we cannot afford to deliver free personal care to all who need it and fund this out of general taxation. Any attempt to do that will not prove sustainable over time because of the demographic trends which are already in evidence. Therefore, as the paper says, the foundation of the new system lies in the partnership option-that is to say, in co-payment of one sort or another.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="1002223000008"></a>The Government are holding fast, as far as I know, to the conclusions of that Green Paper, but they are at the same time bringing forward a Bill which is completely at odds with it. The Bill is said to be a "bridge towards" a fully reformed social care system, but it is hard to see that phrase as anything more than just words. If the Government had been a bit straighter with us and said that the Bill was designed as a temporary stopgap in advance of long-term reform, that might have been a more credible and accurate description. I would have liked the Bill to point a clearer way towards the vision set out in the Green Paper; in other words, to be a genuine bridge and a genuine building block to long-term reform.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_834"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 834</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100222-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="1002223000009"></a>To be that bridge, the Bill needs to open up the way to a much more varied and flexible set of options. We have already considered some of the pitfalls that look set to await us as a result of the lack of clarity in some of the definitions that will determine eligibility for free care. In any decision about eligibility, so much will be at stake that people are unlikely to take a refusal lying down. I genuinely fear an explosion of complaints, appeals and litigation.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="1002223000010"></a>The obvious way forward is to preserve the core idea of a more generous deal for those in critical need of care, but to cut the cake differently so that there is a more graduated scale of preferential charging and therefore much less incentive for people to dispute the results of an assessment. The difference between having substantial needs and having critical needs will often be quite narrow. The difference between requiring help with four activities of daily living and requiring help with only three may be equally narrow. Therefore, I ask the Minister what thought the Government gave, as an alternative to offering free personal care to all those people with critical needs, to the idea of a graduated preferential scale of charging under which local authorities would be able to take into account not only the acuity of a person's need but also their personal financial means.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="1002223000011"></a>I mention means-testing here with no apology. The cost-benefit analysis contained in the impact assessment seems to me the loudest warning bell, if any were needed, that we are in danger of creating an unsustainable system. People who can afford to bear some or all of the cost of their personal care cannot in the current climate be considered a more important priority than those without financial means whose need for care may be only very slightly less acute. I am no advocate of the postcode lottery, but I believe in local authorities having discretion to manage their finances in ways that they consider fair and affordable. The Bill takes that discretion away from them in a material sense, and it does so, as we will debate later, in a very unstructured and ill planned way.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="1002223000012"></a>I have spoken up till now about the short term; the longer term should concern us equally. What are the ingredients of a sustainable and fair system of social care provision over, let us say, the next 100 years? To my mind, they are these. We should aim for a personalised service to enable people to buy the care that suits them best. One of the problems with the Bill, despite what the noble Baroness said earlier, is that it seems to cut right across the personalisation agenda, which, up to now, the Government have done rather well at. We need consistent national standards for the assessment of care needs. The Government are right about that, and I shall support them in their efforts to introduce them. We need to help people stay in their homes for as long as they can-again, the Government are right about that. We need also to find a way of protecting people from having to sell their homes to pay for long-term care. I should like to think that there is no disagreement between my own party and the Government on any of those four principles.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="1002223000013"></a>I do not want to exacerbate the public spat which has been going on between members of my own party and Ministers in another place, but I would simply say  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_835"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 835</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that we on this side part company with the Government over their apparent enthusiasm for schemes and ideas which directly cut across one or more of the four principles that I have mentioned. For example, we do not think that it is helpful to disempower people by removing national benefits from them, such as attendance allowance, and disability living allowance.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="1002223000014"></a>A national care service is a great idea, but if you mandate the service from the centre, and fund it centrally, it becomes inflexible and depersonalised. I do not think that that is the way to go. Equally, a compulsory state insurance scheme takes us in the wrong direction if we believe in empowering people through choice. It also acts as a strong disincentive to informal care, and I worry greatly about that.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="1002223000015"></a>If this Bill is to act as a bridge towards a flexible and personalised system of social care, under the banner of a national care service, it needs to offer a greater range of possibilities than it does at present. It needs to factor in the likelihood that people will wish to provide for their critical care needs by means of voluntary insurance, and to allow for those who wish to engage in preventive health programmes, not simply reablement. To incentivise the take-up of those programmes, it needs to protect those who cannot afford to pay for personal care, while at the same time giving due recognition to those who are prudent enough to provide for part of the cost of their care from their own resources. It also needs to recognise the value of informal carers. In general, it needs to be more enabling towards local authorities, and less prescriptive in terms of the structure of care services which they commission and fund. It is against that background that I beg to move Amendment 5, and I hope that the Minister will feel able to move at least a little way in my direction.</p>

This is a much better time for me, and I thank him.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="1002223000017"></a>It is a privilege to have this opportunity to again raise the vital issue of social care portability. It is so fundamental to the basic human rights of disabled and older people. Many noble Lords will remember the very positive debate that we had when my amendment on portability was debated during the passage of the Health and Social Care Act. Strong cross-party support then led directly to the commitment in the recent social care Green Paper to work towards a national care system with portability at its heart. I promised noble Lords during that debate that I would give portability my forensic attention. I am therefore very glad that I am today able rather modestly to place an amendment to make that commitment a reality for 280,000 disabled and older people with the highest support needs who are anticipated to qualify for the new free care provision.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="1002223000018"></a>The effect of my amendment would be to ensure that the new free personal care provision is portable between local authority areas. People who qualify for free personal care in one local authority area would be entitled to move to another, in the certainty that they would continue to receive that free care without anxiety, disruption or delay. The amendment achieves this by  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_836"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 836</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>placing a duty on the receiving authority to pick up funding responsibility for a person's free personal care for a transitional period without being required to carry out a further assessment. Authorities would also be required to take other steps to ensure that the person enjoys full continuity of support.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="1002223000019"></a>It is vital that those with critical-plus needs receive seamless support if and when they move home to be near relatives. Delays as people wait for a new assessment could at worst be fatal and at best lead to grave health crises, putting disabled people and their families under enormous strain.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="1002223000020"></a>The Government have pledged that the new free care offer will be underpinned by a common assessment framework that will help to iron out inconsistencies between authorities. Some say that this negates the need for a portability clause in the Bill. However, a common assessment framework will not guarantee that the transition from one authority to another will be seamless. A receiving authority will be required to reassess people who previously qualified for free personal care, even though their needs will not have changed. I will now hand over to the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, to assist me.</p>

<p><a name="1002223000027"></a><I>At this point, Baroness Wilkins continued the speech for Baroness Campbell of Surbiton.</I></p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="1002223000021"></a>It is widely accepted that local authorities fail in their responsibilities to deliver seamless support to disabled people who move between authorities. Continuity of support is treated as an aspiration rather than as a necessity. Many people I know are too terrified to move for fear of their support falling apart. If they do move, they face huge stress and hardship as they struggle to renegotiate vital care and support. It is these fears and this hardship that my amendment seeks to address, albeit only for those with the highest level of need.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="1002223000022"></a>A major inspiration for the amendment, apart from a desire to address the harrowing experiences that disabled and older people face when moving home, is of course the desire to see human rights standards brought to life. The UK Government recently ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which spells out that disabled people must be able to choose where we live on an equal basis with others, and that we have the right to work and participate in our communities and to be free from exploitation, violence and abuse.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="1002223000023"></a>The amendment has strong support from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which states that,</p>
<ul><a name="1002223000031"></a>"current arrangements place an unfair and inequitable restriction on freedom of movement and, at the very least, are very much against the spirit of the right to private and family life as set out in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights ... the Commission supports enshrining portability within primary legislation. Any other approach would continue to restrict this fundamental human right".</ul>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="1002223000024"></a>I am pleased to report that there are now local authorities out there itching to implement portability. I recently had the pleasure of being on the interview panel for the Department for Work and Pensions' Right to Control trailblazer sites. We were tasked with choosing eight local authorities to test the new Right  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_837"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 837</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to Control over one's support services. I was delighted to see that some local authorities put in their consortium bids, with one or two neighbouring councils, a right to portability. They did this to streamline support services between local authority boundary lines. Some are now very keen to test portability where once they were not. I think that this enthusiasm for portability, which really was not there one or two years ago, and certainly was not in the criteria for the trailblazer bids, demonstrates the beginning of a local authority culture sea change. Let us capitalise on that now, for we do not want best practice confined to only a noble few.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="1002223000025"></a>My amendment is short, sweet and to the point. In many ways, it is cost neutral-we are not asking for more funding. As time is short, I will just say two things on the detail. The first is that disabled people are very aware that the exact level of direct payments and type of services available will differ from one local authority to another. We are realistic about that. We understand continuity of support to be about creating a support package that meets our needs, rather than replicating identical services. Secondly, I want to emphasise that it will be particularly important to spell out in regulations and guidance the need for user and family involvement in all arrangements made to support someone in picking up their new life in a new place.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="1002223000026"></a>If the Government accept the need for action today, it will send a strong message of hope to thousands of disabled and older people in England that they may move without fear of reprisals. It will also keep the costs of this Bill down by ensuring scarce resources are not wasted on reassessing people whose needs have not changed. We have a momentous opportunity to test this out and make a start on portability, and I urge noble Lords to grasp it. I beg to move.</p>

In doing so, I confess to a certain amount of confusion in my mind. There is a possibility of conflict here between, on the one hand, the need for local authority autonomy and the ability that each local authority rightly has to administer and control its own budget as far as possible, and, on the other hand, the requirement-as put forward so ably by the noble Baroness who has just spoken-that there should be portability in the benefits or awards of assistance received by the individual in the event of a move from one local authority area to another. Will the Minister be able to clarify this for me? I am very much in favour of both but I do not quite see how we can have both.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="10022212000002"></a>The operative word that seems to be missing throughout much of our deliberations is "flexibility". There must be flexibility in identifying the needs of the individual, in allowing for that individual to move from one area to another and for the local authority to manage its own financial affairs. These are the issues that need to be ironed out because if we ultimately go the full course and achieve in this country what the Government are evidently aiming for-the establishment of a national care service-that predicates a degree of centralisation, of central control, of central direction and of central

I am not happy about any of those things because we are dealing with real individual cases which need to be assessed at ground level by people qualified and trained to do so. I hope the Minister will help me out of my confused state of mind.</p>

I do not support the amendment moved by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, but I support Amendment 29, which provides for a transition between one local authority and another. I think that was part of the Government's original intention when we discussed the Bill earlier. However, the rest of the amendments in the group, and particularly the Question whether Clause 1 should stand part, cut right across the general intent of the Bill, and I certainly would not be in favour of that. As I said at Second Reading, I support the intention of the Bill; I support what the Government want to do for these-mostly elderly-people who are in the neediest group. This is, I understand, a first step towards a much bigger national care programme, which I think many of us in this House would fully support. In the mean time, I support the Bill and therefore cannot support the amendments in this group, except Amendment 29.</p>

I set myself a goal: I would go through today's proceedings as though I were somebody who needed social care services, a carer or someone in the unenviable position of trying to organise this for a local social services department. I would try to get to the end with greater clarity and understanding about what the social care system in this country is. However, I have to say that it is not looking good at the moment. In fact, it is becoming more confused. That is an inherent problem when people talk of such things as a national care service without clarity about what it means. It is not about unanimity of provision; it is about agreeing about what care services are, who is entitled to them and how they are funded.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="10022212000005"></a>That leads me directly to both of these amendments and to ask a question. I can see the intent behind the amendments of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and I have a great degree of sympathy with it. We are, after all, talking about a system which has never met-and never will meet-all the social care needs of the country, and about trying to find an equitable way of ensuring that such resources as we have are best applied to people who have needs. My question for the noble Earl, Lord Howe, is: who would set the preferential rates for services? When we talk about care services, by and large we talk about people carrying out care tasks for individuals. The cost of employing people does not vary much, whether they are in the private sector or the public sector, or whether they are in different areas of the country. It might vary ever so slightly. What is the rate for a care attendant in one area of the country? It may differ, but only very slightly, in another. I ask the noble Earl, Lord Howe,

Would it be up to local authorities to set different rates for different services, as they deemed them to be needed in that area? That would be interesting.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="10022212000006"></a>I draw the attention of the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, to the issue of portability. She said that we are not asking for more money. Care, in the terms of the Bill, applies not just to people providing care for others but to adaptations. The capital expenditure of adapting somebody's home might well be doubled if they moved. Both the noble Baronesses, Lady Campbell and Lady Wilkins, said, in relation to this amendment and Amendments 2 and 4, that personalisation and self-directed support now has a body of evidence behind it that proves that it is cost-neutral and cost-effective. I wonder whether they could both point me to that, as I have not yet seen evidence as strong as that. The IBSEN report on the pilots did not go that far.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="10022212000007"></a>Given that cost is at the absolute heart of this debate, I should very much appreciate seeing the evidence behind both those statements. That will help noble Lords when we come down to doing what we ultimately all have to do-to work out what we believe to be the best use of finite resources for the best benefit of the most people. Noble Lords who listened to the "Today" programme with as much attention as I did this morning will know that my colleagues and I have concluded that this Bill does not represent that. We would use the resources in other ways that we think would be to the greater benefit of the greater number of people. In that context, I believe that these are fair questions and I would appreciate some answers.</p>

<a name="10022212000008"></a><b><a name="100222-0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="10022212000065"></a>Lord Tebbit:</b> My Lords, I wonder whether the Minister can help us, or at least help me. I refer to the proposals made by the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, and the number of people who might move from one local authority to another, as there is a tendency for people to do in their old age, or relative old age, or when they become disabled. Quite a lot do so, either from a high-cost residential area to a lower-cost one or nearer to relatives and things of that kind. Therefore, there is bound to be a certain number of people washing backwards and forwards across local authority areas.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="10022212000009"></a>We can only guess at those numbers but it would help us if we had at least an idea of what was in the minds of Ministers as to the cost per individual involved in this scheme. How many people do the Government think will benefit? The Government's estimate of the cost of the whole thing is that it will be less than £650 million. I must confess that my reaction to that is "Come on, pull the other one". If the Government are going to stick to £650 million, how many people will be involved? That will give us an idea of how many of those people might be transients washing backwards and forwards across the boundaries.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="10022212000010"></a>Is there a cap? The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, added the cost of changes to homes to make them possible for people to live in. It might not be just the cost of a stairlift; it might be a substantial lift at a cost of £15,000 or £20,000. The cost of a bathroom being adjusted can be £2,000 or £3,000. That is apart from the recurring costs. We have to have a better idea of what the Government think will be the cost per head

It is quite a small Bill and quite a small area of quagmire, but my impression is that the depth is considerable and one gets out of one's depth very quickly.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="10022212000012"></a>However, I want to support Amendment 29 put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell of Surbiton. I supported the principle of this at Second Reading and I have seen no reason to change my mind. Here, there is at least one bit of hard ground on which we can walk where there could be a significant benefit from legislation that we might advance this afternoon. The benefit would be in three contexts. One is the individual. By and large, people who need substantial care packages do not move for frivolous reasons. If they are moving from one authority to another, there will probably be a good reason, normally to do with folks who are relatives and potentially informal carers. The benefit there is clear and significant.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_time2"></a><h5><a name="10022212000060"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="10022212000013"></a>However, there will also be a benefit to the local authorities involved. If someone with substantial care needs comes into a new area and has to be reassessed completely, that will involve significant time and the cost of their assessment, including professional time. One can be fairly sure that if significant capital costs are involved-which may well be the case, and that is a legitimate point to query-the move will, by and large, not be for frivolous reasons and there will not be a large number of people to whom this applies. They would not be moving if the capital costs were likely to be great, because the care needs would be equally great. The move would be for good reason.</p>

<a name="100222-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="10022212000014"></a>Thirdly-this point has been made-some of us believe that one of the more important features of the Bill is that it moves towards a national care service, involving a degree of equity between different postcode areas and local authorities. That would be one way of establishing equity in a very specific way. Costs borne by a new authority are running costs-I accept not capital costs-lost by another authority. Surely it would not be beyond our powers of intelligence to devise a way of transferring money if the costs were significant and substantial. I support the amendment.</p>

It is right that people should have portable rights, but a valid point was made by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, about capital costs. When someone dies, it is deplorable if all the wonderful appliances that have been put into a property are wasted. A neighbour had a stairlift for only two or three months. When she died, the executors were advised by the selling agents for her property, "Take out everything that could possibly look as if someone disabled lived here if you want to get the best price". The executors tried to get rid of the lift. No council or anyone else would take it or reuse it anywhere else. In

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="10022212000016"></a>It is important that if a property is adapted for special needs, if at all possible-and it should certainly be possible regarding social housing-that property should be passed on to someone else with special needs. Then the adaptations would not need to be so great and the loss to the council that had made the adaptations would not be so great.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="10022212000017"></a>As regards portability, apart from anything else, it would be of benefit to the receiving local authority if it had warning that someone who rapidly needed special care was coming.

Noble Lords will know that we are very much aware of the issues around greater portability of care, and it is something that will be addressed in more detail both in the review by the Law Commission into social care law and in the White Paper.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10022212000021"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, raised the very important point about consistency of care and the difficulties faced by those who move between different local authorities' areas. This is an issue that we have discussed across the Dispatch Box and outside the Chamber for the past couple of years. I commend her persistence in her championship of this very important matter. We debated this during passage of the Health and Social Care Act, and I explained at that time that we certainly had a lot of sympathy and understanding about it. We do recognise the potential for disruption to patterns of care, which can be the reality for an individual who moves from one authority to another. We speculated about why people might do that, and the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, did so as well.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="10022212000022"></a>One thing that has not been mentioned-although I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, would mention it-is that this is also about, for example, young disabled people who go to university or who want to find a new job in a different part of the   


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_842"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 842</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>country. So we are not just talking about the elderly and elderly disabled. We are also talking about young people and their rights to fulfil their potential.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="10022212000023"></a>This amendment seeks to reduce the impact of disruption by putting in place transitional arrangements so that an individual can retain their entitlement to free personal care until a new community care assessment can be undertaken by the receiving authority. I think that that addresses the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10022212000024"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness for identifying this issue, and I can confirm to her today that we intend as a result of her representations to include provisions to effect this transitional protection in regulations. The reason that we can do that, of course, is that we are seeking in the Bill and its regulations to make the assessments more standardised. So it is in keeping with the Bill and the direction of travel in terms of the national care service.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10022212000025"></a>This will mean that, in addition to being able to put into place emergency care services under Section 47(5) of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 as at present, the personal care element must continue to be free until such time as the community care assessment is commissioned. So in bringing forward these regulations, we want to remove the requirement to amend the Bill. I therefore request that the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, withdraw the amendment. However, I undertake to continue discussing the regulations with her and the organisations that support this activity.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10022212000026"></a>I hope that that also answers the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Eden, because the key is to allow an assessment to take place. It recognises that an assessment should take place eventually, and that will allow that assessment to take place in the new location. I therefore hope that that answers the point about how we maintain the integrity and independence of local services at the same time.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10022212000027"></a>I now turn to the other amendments in this group: Amendments 5, 6, 14, 16, 27 and 40, in the names of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton. I have a very long speaking note about local government finance, but since nobody has actually asked me about local government finance, I do not intend to inflict that on the Committee unless somebody asks me for it at a later date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10022212000028"></a>I would, however, like to reflect on the issue raised by the noble Earl, that we regard the Bill as a stepping stone to the national care service and, indeed, to the White Paper. I do not know whether he used the word "transition" or a similar word, but we are not far apart on the direction of travel or on the fact that the Bill's proposals will help us to achieve what we want to do in creating a national care service. At the conference last Friday-at which other parties were present though the noble Earl's party was not-my right honourable friend Andy Burnham expressed similar sentiments to those reflected in the remarks that the noble Earl made about what we are looking for and the consensus that we are seeking.</p>

A national assessment should be established whereby care needs are assessed and paid for in the same way across the country. Services should work together smoothly and information and advice should be available to enable the care system to be easily understood and easy to navigate. Personalised care and support should be integrated and based on people's circumstances and need and there should be fair funding. Money will be spent wisely and everyone will get some help to meet the high cost of their care needs.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="10022212000030"></a>The Bill is a step towards setting up a national care service and is evidence of the Government's commitment to an area which has been neglected for far too long. It is a shame that the noble Earl's party chose to walk away from the discussions but I hope that they will walk back into them in the next parliamentary Session and that we can solve these difficult and important issues in the way that many organisations are calling on us to do; that is, together as a nation. There is no question but that there are still huge challenges in the care and support system. The Green Paper sought people's views on how we resolve those challenges and how we create a sustainable system in the long term. The White Paper will develop those proposals and will be available soon.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="10022212000031"></a>The noble Earl asked about the differences between three and four ADLs and how that would work. We recognise that there will be challenges in delivering care to people with the highest needs and that some people may be on the wrong side of that divide. We are also very mindful of the overall costs of this scheme. However, this is an interim measure before we introduce our proposals for long-term reform of the care and support system. This measure is designed to help those with the highest need. Our wider proposals on the transformation of social care will encourage investment in prevention, early intervention and supporting individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="10022212000032"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said that there was no evidence that personal budgets are cheaper. The IBSEN report showed that personalised services were no more costly than commissioned services, though user satisfaction was increased, and the evidence from councils introducing personal budgets is no less strong.</p>

For example, the costing for personalisation that the noble Baroness cited was predicated on the fact that there would be no significant increases in the cost of employing care staff. It is important that we are absolutely clear about the costs of what we are talking about and do not make sweeping assumptions. If we are not accurate about costing, we will head off into unsustainability in a different fashion. That would be equally as wrong as the faults in the Bill to which a number of noble Lords have already pointed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="10022212000035"></a>I turn to the specific amendments. They seek to give powers to the Secretary of State to require local authorities to charge for personal care at a set rate. I accept that the noble Earl is testing whether that would be a preferred system. This would mean that a centrally set figure would be decided upon and an amount of personal care would not be provided free of charge, but rather would be charged at a prescribed or preferential rate. Any personal care requirements beyond this set figure would then be free of charge. Clearly, this proposed amendment is not in line with the purpose of the Bill. The Bill aims to provide free personal care at home to those with the highest needs, providing freedom from worry that they will be unable to meet the costs of their vital personal care. Should local authorities be able to charge for elements of care at a prescribed rate, it would continue, we believe, to add worry and distress to those who have the highest levels of personal care. They would be in fear of a bill landing at the door, as is indeed the case in the current system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="10022212000037"></a>Amendment 40 would broaden the regulation-making power under Section 15(5)(a) so as to expressly say that not only would regulations make different provision for different prescriptions of qualifying services; they could also make a different provision for different circumstances. We do not believe that this amendment adds anything of substance, because Section 15 already gives the Secretary of State power to make a different provision for different qualifying services. Coupled with other existing powers to prescribe circumstances in which services would be provided free, we therefore already have the power to prescribe different circumstances in which different qualifying services are to be provided free. I therefore ask the noble Earl and the noble Baroness not to press these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="10022212000049"></a>I agree with her that there is only one way forward when it comes to reform of long-term care, and that is cross-party consensus. By definition, we should look at a long-term solution that will hold good for many decades to come.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10022212000050"></a>I share her wish that the parties will come together and find a common way forward. It was partly for that reason that I wanted to see this Bill as a genuine bridge towards long-term reform, because I fear that to describe it as a bridge at present is an inaccurate use of words. The problem I have is that it is too narrow in its scope and too prescriptive. It might be worth my quoting to the noble Baroness a short extract from page 16 of the Government's Green Paper. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="10022212000057"></a>"Because care and support costs can be so high, we think that the Government should provide some support to everyone who has to pay them. We therefore propose that, in the new National Care Service, everyone who qualifies for care and support from the state should get some help with paying for it".</p>

<p><a name="10022212000051"></a>That is a much more tenable and intellectually respectable approach than the one which the Bill invites us to take.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10022212000052"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, asked me about the kind of preferential system that I was trying to advocate. Maybe she and other noble Lords were not here to hear me talk through that idea. You can achieve it in several ways with varying degrees of central prescription and local autonomy. My amendment would not rule out any particular solution. For example, you could have a graduated scale describing a varying acuity of need, defined centrally, as the foundation for a graduated charging system. That could be moderated at a local level by consideration of people's financial means and the affordability of certain charging bands.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10022212000053"></a>Revised fair access to care services guidelines could well act as the basis for a more sophisticated charging structure, but you would leave it to local authorities to decide exactly how the available cake should be cut. Free care for those in critical need would not be precluded under my amendment. It could still be prescribed in regulations. However, you would at the very least avoid the cliff edge which the Bill will create in terms of its perceived unfairness towards those whose care needs are deemed to fall very slightly short of the level eligible for free personal care at home. That, in a nutshell, was where I was coming from. However, I have no fixed views on how one would structure this. It is for discussion.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10022212000054"></a>That is as far as we can go at this stage. I am grateful for the noble Baroness's comments, upon which I will reflect. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="10022218000001"></a>Noble Lords will realise that this amendment goes to the heart of the injustice that is built into the Bill. It is an injustice that was well described by the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, in the debate on Second Reading. When the Bill takes effect, a very typical case of an older person will run like this. The person needs a bit of help at home, but they have money of their own so they do not get any help. More and more, councils are restricting the little bit of help that would enable them to stay at home. Suddenly the person reaches a threshold where they fail four activities of daily living-you have to be in pretty poor shape to fail four ADLs-whereupon the Government will pay for the whole of their care. The person can continue to live at home like that for a while, but there comes a day when they are not able to do so in any sensible way and they have to go into a home. On that day, not only does the person lose their home, not only are they suffering from extreme physical disability and often dementia, but they also have to pay in full.</p>

<a name="100222-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10022218000002"></a>This is an injustice that it is impossible to defend and it is why, when the Government published their excellent Green Paper on the subject, it produced the words just used by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, to the effect that whatever the setting in which someone gets their care, perhaps the state should meet part of the cost; that is, part of the cost if you need care at home and part of the cost if you are in a home and need care. That is not what is being proposed in the Bill. The proposal is that you get your care paid for in one setting only-at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10022218000003"></a>In response to an earlier debate which touched on this subject, the Minister said that the kind of care you get should depend on your care needs. That sounds very plausible. I can imagine the person writing the words for the brief perhaps even believing them as they did so. But of course that is largely a nonsense because for the great majority of people it would be possible to be cared for in their own home until they die if sufficient resource was applied. It would be possible if they had full-time care from trained nurses working eight-hour shifts. I once saw a woman aged 101 receiving such care in Northern Ireland. With  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_848"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 848</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>full-time care, the doctor popping in as often as needed and the complete re-equipment of the home into a sort of mini nursing home, it could be done, but it would be unaffordably expensive. It is simply not economic to provide one-to-one care 24 hours a day to someone in that situation, but it could be done.</p>

<a name="100222-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="10022218000004"></a>Equally, it is possible for people with rather low care needs to go into residential care. Some individuals prefer residential care, odd though that seems to most people. It is not a question of the need that determines this; rather, it is a question of what is best when reviewing both the expert assessment and the wish of the person themselves about where they want to be cared for. I put particular emphasis on the latter half of that remark: the view of the person themselves is terribly important. What we are doing in this Bill as drafted is to build up a terrible conflict. The person is almost bound to want to be cared for in their own home. Not only is it perhaps a nicer place to be, but everything in the home is free. The local authority, on the other hand, has every incentive to put the person into a home because then they will have to pay for their own care. If they are in their own home, the local authority has to pay for the care. I am sure that we will come back to this at some length later in the day.</p>

<a name="100222-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10022218000005"></a>It is perfectly evident to anyone looking at the figures with an ounce of objectivity that the Government's assessment of the cost of this policy to local authorities is a grotesquely unrealistic underestimate. It makes no allowance for what will certainly happen, which is that many people who at present are paying for their own care at home or not getting any care will suddenly emerge as claimants. Anyway, we need not speculate because we know what has happened in Scotland. There the cost of care in someone's own home has doubled in just five years, leaving the original cost estimates in tatters, as will be the estimates of this Government. That is why this inequity in the treatment of people in their own homes and in homes cannot be allowed to persist. I am not arguing that care should be free everywhere-far from it. I say that the Government should be making whatever contribution is felt to be affordable and appropriate whatever the setting in which people are receiving care.</p>

<a name="100222-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10022218000006"></a>I want to add a second leg to the argument, which is as follows. We have not begun to conceive of the process that is going to be let loose by this piece of legislation. We heard about the Local Government Ombudsman and the Health Service Ombudsman already being swamped by appeals as to who should pay, but when this piece of legislation comes in with this built-in, grotesque unfairness, where will people go? Are they going to say, "Oh, I am sure this local authority officer who has come to see us is right-mum should go into a home and run down our inheritance"? Of course they are not. Today, we have personal injury lawyers stamping the land, offering their services to people who get hurt in accidents. I see a lot of their adverts because they are always on during the horseracing in the afternoon, where people are trying to look at ways to pay their gambling debts. Just as we get those personal injury adverts, up and down the country firms of solicitors will be set up seeking judicial review of every case that comes before them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="10022218000007"></a>The case of extra care homes-the second of the amendments in this group I have tabled-is an example of the kind of thing that will happen. Systems like this get gamed; we know this. People will start gaming the system to try to turn whatever accommodation they are in into something that can be described as their own home. For example, care homes might start selling the rooms in which residents live to the individual within them, so that the rest of the care can be free. It is far from clear that extra care homes will be properly eligible-it depends on the nature of the care coming in. I read the Commons debate on this matter, which went on for some time. The answer given by the Minister-Mr Phil Hope, a man for whom I have some admiration-would not convince anybody that the Government are on top of this problem. The definitional changes and the ranks of lawyers looking to cash in on human misery as a result of these provisions will be absolutely enormous.</p>

<a name="100222-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="10022218000008"></a>As so often, I finish in the same place as the noble Earl, Lord Howe. We need a consensus on this matter; I believe this would include a contribution from the state to care, whether it is in a care home or care at home. We need a consensus above all, but this Bill cannot provide a consensus. That is why, in the amendments that will be tabled this afternoon and in voting at subsequent stages, we shall have to make provisions to ensure that the Bill cannot go through before there has been a general election, which may well lead to a situation where the support of a single party-perhaps I should say a single Prime Minister-is not enough to determine what the right state of the law in our land should be.</p>

In these amendments, we want to explore the boundaries that are proposed, the knock-on effects on other funding systems, and particularly the rationale for providing care funds only for those living at home. This was criticised widely at Second Reading, and I want to point out that three very different predictions were made then about the impact this would have on the use and costs of this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="10022218000010"></a>In my speech at Second Reading I predicted that financial incentives to stay put would deter people from going into residential care at the point at which it was clinically and socially desirable. There have been numerous times when I, as a clinician, have seen spouses or daughters absolutely exhausted and on the brink of a breakdown caring for an elderly person with dementia. By the way, it is usually not the activities of daily living which are the most stressful problem; wandering, emotional and behavioural difficulties and failures of recognition are far more likely to be the straws that break the camel's back. At some point, it almost feels as if you want to insist for the sake of the carer's health that a residential home place is found. If there are real financial incentives to maintaining a person at home, these decisions will be even more difficult.</p>

<a name="100222-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10022218000012"></a>I remind noble Lords of the major expansion of nursing homes and care homes which came about in the 1980s, the direct result of the funding of care places through individual, generous grants via social welfare budgets, which then created thousands of new residential places. One-third of business expansion scheme grants-the investment miracle of the Thatcher years-were invested in the care home sector. Care homes were, of course, basically property investments; but property companies were at first excluded from the BES initiative and so the care home sector was an attractive alternative as long as revenue was guaranteed by the Government. I used to watch the Laing and Buisson figures of the growth in residential care places with utter amazement. For a time I acted as an investment adviser to '3i' because the business investment companies were so worried about how much BES money was channelled through these schemes into care homes. They were very worried about the quality of what they were investing in-rightly so, as it turned out. It was a classic case of the Government having a genuinely philanthropic policy hijacked for the benefit of the small business community to the growing frustration and disbelief of the Treasury.</p>

<a name="100222-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10022218000013"></a>It did not last long, of course. In both the USA, where expansion was similarly funded by Medicaid, and in the UK our Treasuries soon woke up to the escalating unaffordability, but here, in 2010, we have witnessed a 15-year decline of the care home sector, although with some suggestion that sheer demographic pressures are now reversing that trend again. Even small shifts in incentives can have major impacts. There has been no modelling of the impact of this Bill on other revenue streams in spite of the theoretical impact of the ADL deficits on the demand for care and the need for modelling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10022218000014"></a>I was predicting in one direction and the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, at Second Reading, cited the care needs of his mother-in-law, pointing out that after a classic hip fracture and hospital stay, at the very moment her care needs went up from perhaps 30 hours a week to 168 hours a week, her eligibility for financial support went down. That cannot make sense. Crucially, this fails the test set out by the Minister in her exposition of the Bill when she said that those with the highest needs must receive the greatest help. It was that injustice more than the issue of costs to which the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, objected.

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="10022218000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, and I were predicting in one direction but the noble Earl, Lord Howe, made the crucial point that there is an intermediary body which is going to be the vehicle for this new funding-the local authority. If the total cost of delivering the Bill should exceed the budget, local authorities will have to find whatever extra money is required. In other words, they are being landed with an open-ended commitment, not fully funded as expressed in the famous "new burdens doctrine". The noble Earl pointed out how predictable would be the response of local authorities.

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10022218000016"></a>Alternatively, and perhaps additionally, in order to fulfil their obligations to those in critical need, councils will be forced to remove social care funding from those who are in lower categories of need. To the extent that this happens, it may drive some people out of their homes and into residential care, thereby serving to dilute the main benefits of the Bill, which is supposed to enable more people to avoid or delay entering residential care. I further predict that, just as used to happen, very dependent old people will end up in acute hospital beds and acute psychiatric units. I hate the phrase "bed blocking"-which means a very frail, needy, older person whose health and social care needs are being denied to them-but that is what we will see. So we have four unpredictable scenarios which have not been explored and I would like the Minister to explain what work is going on to clarify which of these scenarios is likely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10022218000017"></a>Amendment 10 follows up the point made in Committee in the Commons by Andrew Lansley, who wanted to be sure that extra care accommodation would be regarded as a person's home and not residential care for the purposes of this Bill. People who live in extra care housing have their own self-contained homes, their own front doors, and a legal right to occupy the property. Extra care housing is also known as very sheltered housing, assisted living, or simply "housing with care". It comes in many built forms-blocks of flats, bungalow estates and retirement villages. But it can, and does, sometimes provide an alternative to a care home, and that is the nub of the problem. In addition to the communal facilities often found in ordinary sheltered housing, domestic support and personal care are also available, provided by on-site staff. Properties can be rented, owned, or part owned and part rented. The Government say that people who live in sheltered accommodation or extra care housing are not to be excluded on the grounds that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="10022218000031"></a>"The accommodation and care provided in such accommodation are not provided together but under separate arrangements made by the individual".</p>

<a name="100222-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10022218000018"></a>The problem is that the increasing numbers of these types of schemes-which I was involved in developing myself when there was lots of Housing Corporation money around-are now providing 24-hour care seven days a week in exactly the same way that care homes do. That marvellous organisation, Methodist Homes for the Aged, or MHA, has, for example, at Moor Allerton resource centre in Leeds a 20-bed extra care scheme especially for people with dementia. It serves as a direct alternative to residential care. MHA established their housing association arm as a subsidiary of their well known care homes charity in order to benefit from the split in funding and also, admirably, from a wish to continue to provide even the most disabled

<a name="100222-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10022218000019"></a>But while the philosophy of care may be different, extra care housing in reality provides identical personal care and nursing services. There are at present only 25,000 or so extra care housing places, whereas there are 500,000 care home places. So maybe the Minister is not too worried about the outright favouring of the minority who find one of these schemes available in the area as an alternative to a care home. Nevertheless, does the Minister agree that, as soon as legislation of this kind is introduced, large numbers of care-service providers that currently make provision by way of a single contract with people-one that provides accommodation and care together-will suddenly find it desirable to provide different separate contracts for accommodation and care services? In just this manner, I and my colleagues in Lewisham managed to close long-stay beds for people with dementia in Bexley and Cane Hill hospitals and provide tenanted accommodation in conjunction with South London Family Housing Association-now part of the Horizon Housing Group-as similar to a specialist care home as to be indistinguishable, but all our residents had personal tenancies. In other words, they were indistinguishable from a residential care home. Is it not peculiar that if people are in extra care housing and they have two contracts-one for care and one for accommodation-they are eligible for free personal care that pays their care needs, but if identical care is provided under one contract it will be charged for. I cannot see how this flaw in the legislation can be reconciled. We could end up with a distortion in the care market with large numbers of care providers recreating their services so as to distinguish between accommodation and care. The Government, whether intentionally or not, are creating a potential loophole for people who are currently in long-term residential care who would not be regarded as being in extra care housing. They will inevitably restructure their arrangements at the point at which they enter care in order to make themselves eligible for free personal care. The Bill does nothing to prevent this from happening. That seems to be an obvious flaw in the legislation-unless this is the intent, but I doubt it. Personally, I have always been an advocate of separating housing and support costs but this is not the policy intention and I fear that we are going to end up with a great confusion.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, set out in considerable detail quite a number of government policies surrounding community care.

<a name="100222-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10022218000021"></a>At Second Reading I talked about the fact that back in the days before the NHS and social care were funded to the extent that they have been through this Government, the capacity of mangers mostly, but also frontline staff, in social care and the NHS to bat older people back and forth between them, in order to avoid having to pick up the costs of their medicines, adaptations or care, was considerable. That has not been the case for about the past 10 years, but when the NHS is looking down the back of the sofa for money and social care is ripping up the floorboards because it has already looked down the back of the sofa, it will happen again. Older people will find themselves being pushed between one and the other. At that point, what the law says is of utmost importance. I point noble Lords to the fact that the title of this clause is: "Free provision of personal care at home". It is not free provision of care to people living at home. There is a world of difference to a social services department that has no money between those two different phrases. Does care at home mean only care in a person's home or does it mean care to a person who lives in their home? As the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said, how do you define a home that is eligible under this Bill? That may seem like utter pedantry but on it rests the fate of thousands of people. I want to draw to noble Lords' attention the fact that there are thousands of older people who are unable to remain living at home because they and their carers use services in their locality but not in their homes.</p>

<a name="100222-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10022218000022"></a>We need to take into account the collateral damage to services provided in the community to people who have substantial, high-care needs that keep all the older people in an area-and their carers-going. They are at risk if we are not absolutely clear about the definition. Does the Bill refer only to services in a person's home, or services provided to them as they live at home in order to keep them living at home? It may be pedantry, but it is of the upmost importance in these matters.</p>

It is confusing because the Bill is presented to us in a rather piecemeal form and one has to fit the jigsaw pieces together. The Government are saying to us, I think, "Those living in residential care will not get their personal care free, but by residential care, we don't mean extra care". I think that that is how it fits together.</p>

What troubles me is the word that the Government have chosen in subsection (2). I should like to hear the Minister explain what will stop a care home operator who currently provides residential care by way of a single contract dividing himself into two or more legal entities such that the contract from one legal entity, which relates to the residential accommodation, is separate from the contract from the other legal entity, which relates to the care services. In that situation, as the noble Baroness rightly indicated, there would in law be two providers operating side by side, one the equivalent of a hotel, the other the equivalent of a domiciliary care service. In those circumstances, what will prevent the recipient of those services claiming eligibility for free personal care?</p>

I need the Minister to explain to me what that answer means, because I do not understand how the CQC will be in a position to influence the situation one way or the other. We may well end up with a market that is very distorted, with large numbers of care providers reconstituting their services in a different legal form that distinguishes accommodation from care. As the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said, that after all is what extra care amounts to. We have heard that someone living in extra-care accommodation will be treated as living in their own home for the purposes of this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10022218000030"></a>In practice, the effect is little or no different from care delivered in a residential setting. The legal dividing line which the Bill seeks to establish will in practice be unsustainable.</p>

We should not create something that makes it more attractive; we should aim at that standard of extra-care housing for as many people as possible. We should not have this difference between accommodation in a residential home where people get all their care paid for if they are in a certain category, and another category where care would not be paid for. We are inviting such a situation with the Bill, because we are covering those who should be able to pay their own bills. I would love it if someone paid all my bills, but I would not consider myself entitled to it-I would think that I was not needy enough.</p>

I find it strange that we are so concerned to bring in a law that will help only an additional 110,000 people, according to the answer that I had from the Minister earlier in our debates. The points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, about the damage that might be done to the services now available, were sound. Local authorities are very concerned that instead of being able to continue the amount of help they are currently giving to the most needy, in terms of assistance and finance, help will be so enlarged as to cover those who could well afford to pay their own bills. We risk doing away with services that are vital to those who cannot pay and who may find their services reduced. I support the amendment.</p>

As the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, made plain, all the efforts of those working in detail in this field have been devoted to trying to break down a very rigid distinction between being cared for at home and being cared for in a residential institution. They explored extra care in the community, the use of residential homes for other purposes and a whole range of options, including the possibility of housing associations being involved in creating sheltered accommodation of an even higher standard. The risk is in the Bill. I hope the Minister can indicate how it will be dealt with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="10022224000005"></a>I get fed up speaking about Scotland, but I have to say that the increase in expenditure on care at home in Scotland is not a mistake but a deliberate policy, because the Scottish Government have set out to meet the wishes of people, which is, if possible, to remain in their own home and to reduce the costs. One of the ways in which they are doing that is by making it more attractive to remain at home than to go into far more expensive residential and nursing-care accommodation. That is the reason for the shift in cost, and you can see that the cost of residential care has pretty well stabilised. To do that is quite an achievement, but it is being done because they are finding cheaper and more appropriate ways of providing care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="10022224000006"></a>There is, however, a real lesson from Scotland here, and I think that this relates to the point that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, was making. Scotland does have a divide between what you might call hotel costs, or accommodation costs, and care costs. The hotel or accommodation costs for those in residences are still means-tested. The picture of freedom and free supply of cash for everything is not the case. These costs are means-tested. They have ways of dividing them off from the actual costs of care, and in Scotland they make a contribution to the cost of care. So the danger to which he points-that such a division will be brought into place here in a way which distorts the system; it does not distort it in Scotland, it is deliberate-is real, and there is an example of how to do it.</p>

The majority recommendation was that nursing and personal care should be paid for, but that accommodation and care would-as already indicated-be subject to means-testing and so on. We now have a situation in which care costs and nursing costs are regarded as one, and I would agree with that.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10022224000008"></a>When the commission first made its report, I was in favour of it; but the report was not fully accepted by the Government, and so we had the distinction made between nursing and personal care. I always thought that that was not a very good division to make, because it very often came to virtually the same thing. In Scotland it was not accepted, and I see from an article which recently appeared in the <I>Times </I>that<I></I>the allegation that Scotland is not managing to meet that cost is said to be quite untrue, and that Scotland is in fact managing those costs quite well. If this is what is intended in this section of the Bill, I would certainly be in favour of that, because I never believed that there should be a split between nursing and personal care. I always thought that they were the same care costs. If that is to be eliminated in this section of the Bill, then I would be all in favour of it.</p>

I absolutely agree that it has always been an absurdity that nursing and care costs, both of which are related to the way in which an individual is cared for, should be separated. Any move away from those artificial and ridiculous distinctions is to be welcomed. My anxiety about this clause is that we are unfortunately imposing new definitions and new trenches down which people can fall, and new cliffs to fall over, making them ineligible.

However, each amendment addresses rather different aspects of the provision. I shall therefore begin by making some general points about this aspect of the Bill.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_857"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 857</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="10022224000011"></a>First, it is important, and has been an aspiration of this Government for a number of years, to support people in their own homes. That is what people tell us they want, and indeed it has been supported by the Audit Commission's report <I>Under Pressure</I>,<I></I>which was published just last week. This report highlighted that there is a growing trend towards care at home which meets the needs of people who need care and is something to which local authorities should aspire. We recognise that there are different residential settings, however, and so it is important to have a debate on what is classed as a person's home. We want to retain the flexibility in our definition to maintain the intention of the Bill while recognising that different settings or models of care may emerge over the coming years-something which we all know will need to happen to meet the needs of our growing ageing population.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10022224000012"></a>The intention that underlies the Bill is that people with the highest care needs should be supported to live at home. We have made the specific point in the Bill that it is important that those adults who are part of an adult placement scheme, living in a family, do not miss out on this opportunity. It is therefore important to make it explicit that, for the purposes of the Bill, such adults are to be considered as living at home. In our opinion this is the only situation which is required to be excepted from the six-week restriction on free provision of personal care in accommodation where care is provided as an integral part of that accommodation.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="10022224000013"></a>In other situations it should be clear that people are either living in accommodation where care is provided as an integral part of that accommodation-a residential care home-and are not eligible, or living at home and may qualify for free personal care.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="10022224000014"></a>Some people have sought to argue that a residential care home could re-badge itself as extra-care housing and enable its residents to have their care free of charge. This is not about residential care or re-badging. We have always made it clear that it is about people living in their own homes for longer. Residential care is not the same. In any case, as was debated in another place and made clear there, where providers seek to change the provision of their services, it is for the regulator, the Care Quality Commission, to ascertain that they meet the relevant registration criteria.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="10022224000015"></a>Others have argued that residential care is a cheaper option than helping people to live at home. However, the experience of many local authorities shows that appropriate interventions and support-the right housing, adaptations and equipment, including telecare-can help people to live at home at a lower cost than going into residential care. Indeed, as I said a little earlier, last week's report by the Audit Commission, <I>Under Pressure</I>, made these points most effectively and forcefully. Local Authorities must invest in new models of care. It is no longer acceptable for them to invest in the same old models of care-home care and residential care-as they have in the past.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="10022224000016"></a>For some people, and at the right time, entry to residential care may well be the only option. We do not want to close off this option. However, the majority of people say that they want to stay in their homes for longer, and the provisions in the Bill will enable them  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_858"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 858</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to do so. We recognise that, by introducing this policy, there may be perverse incentives for local authorities to encourage people who would otherwise have funded their own care to move into residential care, thereby saving the cost of free personal care. However, that would be a completely short-sighted approach. Not only does it not deliver what the individual or the family wants-a little extra help that would allow them to stay at home for longer-but we know that entering residential care prematurely can lead to individuals running down their assets and then becoming a charge on the local authority. Surely it is better for the person and the council to invest to deliver more cost-effective care at home and to support local citizens to fulfil their wishes to stay in their own homes for as long as possible.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="10022224000017"></a>However, I also recognise that while it is important that this Bill supports people to stay in their own homes for as long as possible in order to live more independent lives, this does not mean that every care activity needed to support them happens inside their own home. Sadly, there may of course be situations where somebody is not able to leave their own home at all. For others, however, having support in the community is beneficial and maximises their ability for independent living in their own home. The Bill supports that principle and does not seek to prevent this; on the contrary, we will develop guidance which reflects that as good practice. I will talk a little further about that when I discuss in detail the specific amendments in this group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="10022224000018"></a>Amendment 7, in the name of the noble Lords, Lord Lipsey and Lord Warner, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, is clearly a wrecking amendment. It wrecks the fundamental essence of the Bill by removing subsection (2), which is the linchpin of the Bill. To accept this amendment would prevent us being able to ensure that those in the highest need could receive free personal care at home for more than six weeks. This is clearly against the spirit of the Bill and should not be supported by anyone who supports the principles underlying this Bill. We therefore cannot accept this amendment and urge opposition to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="10022224000019"></a>The Bill is about specific help for a specific group of people: those in greatest need. I believe that my noble friend said earlier that it would help 280,000 people, as well as the 130,000 who will be helped by reablement. It is about doing this now. It is the first step of a total package. We have confidence in the estimates, and we have gone through the figures with ADASS.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="10022224000020"></a>The Bill is not the same as what is happening in Scotland. The other place has agreed to the basic concept. This House has given the Bill a Second Reading, which enclosed the basic concept, and I do not intend to participate in or respond to a further Second Reading debate at this point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="10022224000021"></a>Amendment 8 would require that regulations specified every setting that was not considered to be a person's home for the purpose of provision of personal care, and therefore every setting of accommodation where the six-week restriction to provide free personal care would still apply. We consider that the proposed definition as set out in the Bill accurately describes and excludes  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_859"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 859</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a range of different settings that are not to be classed as a person's home. These exclusions are necessary because we wish to encourage and enable people to remain in their own homes where that is what they wish to do.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="10022224000022"></a>Were we to specify the specific different settings that should be excluded, that could require numerous changes to regulations as the nature of service provision changes over time. That seems unnecessary and undesirable. We are encouraging councils to look to provide care in a wide range of settings to meet people's changing and longer-term needs. Where providers wish to be seen to change the provision of services to benefit from the provisions, it will be for the regulator, the Care Quality Commission, to ascertain that they meet the revised registration criteria. We are not willing to accept this amendment, as the proposed definition set out in the Bill is accurate. I therefore hope that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="10022224000023"></a>The Bill seeks to remove restrictions on existing powers and will allow us to require people with the highest needs living at home to be provided with free personal care indefinitely. Amendment 10 from the noble Lords, Lord Warner and Lord Lipsey, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, seeks to make it clear in the Bill that personal care for people living in extra-care housing can potentially be required to be provided free indefinitely.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="10022224000024"></a>We believe that such an amendment is unnecessary. As the Bill already provides in new subsection (4D), a person should be considered to be living at home as long as they are not living in accommodation provided under Part 3 of the National Assistance Act 1948, or in accommodation where personal care is provided together with that accommodation. That definition of living at home would include a person living in extra-care accommodation as it would be neither Part 3 accommodation nor accommodation where personal care was provided together with that accommodation. That is because in extra-care housing, care and accommodation are provided not together but under separate arrangements made by the individual.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="10022224000025"></a>We would certainly seek to encourage people who wish to stay and receive the care they need at home to consider extra-care housing, as well as other forms of supported living such as sheltered housing, because they allow individuals to continue living independently. Because this setting of accommodation is already adequately covered by the provisions of the Bill, I hope that the amendment will not be pressed.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="10022224000026"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, brought out a series of predictions and potential downsides. We have committed to review this legislation after 12 to 18 months and in that review we will see whether those predictions turn out to be true, but we believe that the predictions that we have made on cost and on numbers served are sound and will be borne out by experience.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="10022224000027"></a>Amendment 13, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, raises an important point: these provisions should seek to ensure that those living in their own home are supported to do so for longer. However, it is important to reflect on the fact that this does not necessarily mean, as I believe the noble Baroness wishes to indicate with this amendment, that all the  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_860"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 860</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>support activities needed to help the person must be carried out in the home itself. The noble Baroness used the example of a person whose needs were best addressed through being bathed in a day centre because it was not possible to make the necessary adaptations to their own bathroom at home. They should certainly be offered that.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="10022224000028"></a>We will ensure that this area is covered fully in the statutory guidance that we will be developing to provide support to local authorities. For that reason, I do not consider that this needs to be in the Bill. While I do not accept the noble Baroness's amendment and ask not to press it, I very much agree and commit to taking forward its principle.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="10022224000029"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, as ever, made interesting points about the Bill. He was particularly concerned about "gaming" and language. That is a fair point, but we believe that many of the issues will be resolved in the development of regulations and guidance. With regard to the issue of residential homes being re-badged, we have said that the Care Quality Commission will create a definition that will stop that happening. We believe that the legal dividing lines will be practical, although we cannot go further into why we believe that. If it proves useful to elaborate on that in a letter, I will certainly send him one.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="10022224000030"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, referred to the number of people who will be helped. As I said earlier, some 280,000 people will be helped with support at home and some 130,000 by reablement.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="10022224000031"></a>I hope that some of the comments that I have made will meet the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland. The noble Baroness, Lady Turner, was perhaps giving us an insight into the broader picture that will be revealed in the coming weeks when we publish the White Paper.</p>

An awful lot of us here have served in both national government and local authorities. There is a perennial tension between, for example, local authorities and the health service. At the end of the day, we must believe in good will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="10022224000034"></a>There has been some reference to this being an area where we have to develop consensual politics. Many of us have the same common belief that services delivered locally are a good thing, but nevertheless there has to be intrinsic equity between the delivery of those services. There will be tensions between what we specify nationally and how that is interpreted, but one hopes that in this new world of consensus which I think even the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has promised us, we will be able to solve those problems.</p>

There is a debate going on in this Committee between people with real depth of knowledge of this area-I include people like the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, with whom I do not see altogether eye to eye, and also the noble Baronesses, Lady Turner, Lady Murphy and Lady Barker-and Ministers, doing their best to inject a show of conviction into reading out the notes prepared for them by their civil servants, who are themselves trying to inject a note of conviction into defending a policy that has been handed down to them by the Prime Minister and has no intellectual substance behind it, other than what they have managed to cobble together in the few months since he delivered his imprimatur.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="10022224000038"></a>That came out particularly in the remarks made by the Minister, in saying that this is about getting local authorities to invest in new models of care; it is unfair to expect him to be a great expert on long-term care and it is always great to see him on the Front Bench. Of course local authorities need to invest and to invest heavily in new models of care, but the plain and simple fact of the matter is that they will not have the cash to do so, because they are spending it all on free care for the Prime Minister's targeted electoral group. That is the reality of the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="10022224000039"></a>There is no point pursuing this argument further with the Government, save to say this. The Minister said that he was not going to have a Second Reading debate because the House of Commons voted in favour of this Bill. That is perfectly true, but since then, Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, has this morning announced that they made a mistake in doing so. He has thought it through and-I give him great credit for this-he has changed his mind and is now against the Bill. I hope that he is not the only one. In view of these debates, I hope that before we get to Third Reading the Government themselves may think again about this Bill and see if we cannot yet make this a stepping stone on which a consensus reform could be built.

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="10022224000041"></a>"With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a Statement on the release of prisoners under the early release scheme known as end of custody licence, or ECL.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="10022224000042"></a>This scheme will be brought to an end on 12 March this year. All prisoners who are eligible for release on ECL on or before 12 March will be so released. Prisoners who have as of today been formally notified, under form ECL3, of release dates under the scheme up to and including 9 April will also be released. No prisoners will be released on ECL from and including 10 April.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="10022224000043"></a>In the last 13 years the prison population has increased dramatically. When I became Home Secretary in May 1997, it stood at 60,335. The most recent published figure was 83,820 on 19 February. Predicting the prison population and matching places to meet demand has always been difficult and inevitably imprecise. I can certainly recall early release schemes on three separate occasions-in 1984, 1987 and 1991-when the Government of the day faced crises in handling pressures upon the prison population.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="10022224000044"></a>In June 2007, my predecessor as Justice Secretary, my right honourable and noble friend Lord Falconer, introduced ECL to manage temporary pressures upon the prison estate and to guarantee that prison places were available for all those sentenced to custody. The end of custody licence enabled prison governors, under existing prison rules, to release on licence, up to 18 days before the end of their sentence, offenders who had been given a determinate prison sentence of four weeks to four years. The scheme specifically excluded offenders convicted of serious violent crimes, sexual offences subject to registration requirements, those who had broken the terms of temporary release in the past and foreign national prisoners who would be subject to deportation at the end of their sentence. It was later amended to exclude anyone convicted of terrorism-related offences.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="10022224000045"></a>ECL was explicitly introduced as a temporary measure. I have always said that we would end it as soon as we could. I have always recognised that, while necessary as a temporary measure, it was inherently unsatisfactory and potentially damaging to public confidence in justice-confidence which is otherwise high, particularly in the light of falling crime. I have therefore told the House on a number of occasions that I would bring it to an end as soon as it was safe to do so. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has underlined this, for example on 7 May 2008, when he said at Prime Minister's Questions: 'When we have built up the number of prison places ... to ... 86,000, we will make ... decisions on the right thing ... about early release'. We are now at that point, and we are there because we have worked hard to increase the capacity of the prison estate.</p>

<a name="100222-0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="10022224000046"></a>As a result, prisoners have not been held under Operation Safeguard in police cells since September 2008, nor in court cells since February 2008. The House will wish to compare this to 1991, when a total of nearly 376,000 nights were spent by prisoners in police cells or court cells.</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_863"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 863</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>way of operational capacity, with headroom of 2,500. We anticipate that withdrawing the scheme will increase the prison population by around 1,000 to 1,200 prisoners. My assessment is that on the basis of our plans further to increase the capacity of the prison estate, we can safely manage the forecast prison population this year, in 2011-12 and beyond. We are on track to provide a total of 96,000 by 2014 through our capacity-building programme.</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="10022224000048"></a>Given the headroom available in the estate, we are therefore in a position to end the scheme. This does not mean, however, that there is no longer pressure on prison places. The system continues to operate at levels which are close to capacity. I pay tribute to all those who work so hard to protect public safety and help offenders turn their lives around.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="10022224000049"></a>Protecting the public is the first priority of this Government. We have acted decisively to tackle crime. The use of prison has been central to that. Prison will always be the right place for the most serious, persistent and violent offenders. It is vital if we are to protect the public.</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="10022224000050"></a>There are 75 per cent more serious and violent offenders in prison than in 1997. People who commit serious offences are going to prison for longer. Indeterminate sentences have been introduced for the most dangerous offenders; more than 5,000 have been imposed by the courts in the first three years of the scheme. We will continue to make sure that there are places for them.</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="10022224000051"></a>At the same time we have also introduced tougher, more visible and effective community sentences and are giving communities a say in the types of projects offenders carry out. In the case of less serious offenders, such non-custodial sentences can often be a better alternative to prison in terms of turning an offender away from crime and further cutting reoffending rates.</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="10022224000052"></a>We are also working hard to implement the findings of the Corston and Bradley reviews on women and mentally ill offenders. I am clear that in such cases diversion away from prison is often the best approach for both the offender and the wider community. We will continue to examine the number of women and mentally ill people in prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="10022224000053"></a>The results of the Government's strategy are an overall fall in crime of 36 per cent since 1997, the most substantial and sustained reduction since the war. Violent crime is down by 41 per cent according to the British Crime Survey, the most reliable measure. The chances of being a victim are at their lowest for a generation.</p>

I remind him that we welcome the end of this scheme; he knows that we always opposed it. I also remind him of just why this scheme-which has led to some 8,000 criminals being released early, of whom some 1,500 were violent-was necessary.

The scheme was introduced because the Home Secretary and his predecessors failed to provide sufficient prison spaces. They failed to do so because the then Chancellor and current Prime Minister failed to provide sufficient money, as requested by the then Home Secretary, for those spaces. I would be grateful for confirmation of that from the Minister.</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="10022224000057"></a>I have several questions resulting from the Statement to put to the Minister. The first relates to the timing of this announcement-just weeks before what we expect to be the announcement of a general election. Many of us are somewhat suspicious that the timing of this announcement might have something to do with the fact that there is to be an election some time later in the year. Can the Minister tell us exactly when the Government planned to make this announcement? Have they changed their minds on that? Was there any debate within the department about when it would be made? Can he, with a straight face, tell the House that this announcement is being made at this time without any consideration of the coming election?</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="10022224000058"></a>My second question is about the number of prison spaces. The Minister told us in the Statement that there are now some 86,000 places and, even with that figure, head room of 2,500. It is anticipated that withdrawing the scheme will increase the prison population by around 1,000 to 1,200 prisoners. He then told us that there would be some 96,000 places by 2014. Can the Minister tell us exactly when and how those places will come on-stream, particularly in light of the fact that we have heard recently of plans for prisons in north Wales and one in Dagenham being shelved? We have seen changes to the Titans and the mini-Titans. If the noble Lord-as I am sure he would not-went to his bank manager to arrange a reduction in some overdraft, I am sure the bank manager would say, quite sensibly, "Can you tell us how much you will pay off this year, next year, the following year, and so on?". Similarly, it behoves the Minister, when he answers, to tell us exactly when those extra places-that will take us from 86,000 to 96,000 places-are likely to come on-stream. It is no good saying that they will come on-stream by 2014, as if, magically, it will happen by then. We want to know how many will come on-stream this year, next year and the year after. We would like the Minister to spell that out in some detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="10022224000059"></a>My third question is very important: how many prisons are currently over capacity? We know that the prison system itself is nearly over capacity. Could the Minister talk about individual prisons? We have heard of some that have reached 150 per cent or 175 per cent of their capacity. Can he confirm that and tell us which those are, what regional variations there are and what problems the prison estate is facing on that front?</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="10022224000060"></a>Fourthly, could the Minister address the question about the reduction in crime and violent crime? I put this question to him earlier in our debate in the Moses Room on the Motion from the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew. The Government boast about a reduction in crime and violent crime but, at the same time, they tell us that there are 75 per cent more serious and violent offenders in prison than there were

The two do not add up. Why is it that we have an alleged reduction in crime and violent crime and, at the same time, see a dramatic increase in the number of prisoners?</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="10022224000061"></a>Those are four small questions that I would like the Minister to address. No doubt there will be others from other parts of the House. We look forward to hearing his response in due course.</p>

This is not a scheme which has had support. It was rushed in its introduction and poorly implemented, with no home circumstance check or risk assessment. It is a scheme which, as NAPO put it, wrong-foots other authorities. I, too, have questions.</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="10022224000063"></a>The first is on capacity. The Statement tells us that capacity has been increased. Is this because there is more doubling up, so that there is more overcrowding? If that is so, noble Lords will well appreciate that this must reduce the chances of rehabilitation, quite apart from giving an impression rather at odds with the reality. According to Ministry of Justice figures, in June 2009 the prison population was 111 per cent of the in-use certified normal accommodation. At the end of last September, 85 of the 140 prisons in England and Wales were overcrowded. However, the Government are now claiming that there is sufficient capacity safely to end the scheme. Has there been a dramatic change in the last six months? In 2008-09, almost 25 per cent of the prison population was held doubled up in cells designed for one prisoner, or three in a cell designed for two. When the Minister talks about extra prison places, would such a situation count as two prison places or one? If the former, it amounts to a significant and, I have to say, unacceptable fudging of the numbers. If the latter, when can we expect to see the number of prisoners held in overcrowded cells go down?</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="10022224000064"></a>The Minister talked of his assessment for the future. What assessment has been made of the places which would have been freed up if people who should not be in prison-such as the mentally ill and those with a drug or alcohol addiction-were not there and were treated differently? It seems shameful that we talk of capacity in prison places, not the community-based responses that are being brought into the picture, in the way that the Howard League report which we have just debated dealt with. After all, custodial sentences are, of course, the most costly.</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="10022224000065"></a>For clarity, I have one precise question: could the Minister confirm that the home detention curfew is not affected by this decision?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="10022224000066"></a>Reconviction rates have risen as the prison population has grown, with two-thirds of all prisoners being reconvicted-so probably more than that are offending-within two years of release. That figure is 75 per cent for children; I deliberately call those under 18 children. Some prisoners released early under this scheme have reoffended and some have reoffended appallingly. What assessment or work has the ministry done to compare that with rates among those who are not on ECL or following ECL? In other words-and this is a fundamental

What have the impacts been on individual prisoners? What has the impact been on the criminal justice system as a whole? It seems that there has been a scramble to apply the scheme and a scramble to end it, so we hope that something has been learnt from it.</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="10022224000068"></a>I was asked why we are making the announcement at this particular moment. As I think I said in the Statement, we have kept the situation under careful review ever since we introduced ECL-assessing the delivery of new accommodation, population levels and the latest prison population projections. Our assessment is that there is now a viable level of headroom in the estate to enable ECL to be ended. If there is and it is our judgment that it is safe to do so, then surely this is the moment to remove it.</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="10022224000069"></a>Regarding the general election, I am grateful to the noble Lord for reminding me that there will be one later this year. It cannot be that far in the future but I hope it is long enough for the party opposite to be able to tell us what its prison policy is. It seems to change day by day, with its leader saying on the one hand that more people should be in prison and its shadow Justice Secretary saying there should be fewer. No doubt in due course we will have a policy on that. That is the reason we have timed it as we have.</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="10022224000070"></a>So far as concerns capacity, at the risk of boring the House, this is how we see the position in the next few years leading up to the figure of 96,000 by 2014. This year we are planning to deliver just over 3,600 places, including two 480-place young offender institutions and the final 264 places at HMP Bure, which some noble Lords will know opened as a new prison on the site of the former RAF Coltishall in 2009. We are building two 600-place prisons-Belmarsh West in London and Maghull in Liverpool-and are planning to build a 1,600-place prison near to the existing HMP Featherstone, to be operational in 2012. Full planning permission is being sought in partnership with the Youth Justice Board for a new 3,600-place young offender institution at Glen Parva in Leicestershire. Therefore, this year there will be 3,650 more places, next year 1,400, and 2,600 more in 2012. It is hoped that the first of the new larger prisons will be open by the end of 2013. I hope that, in perhaps too much detail, I have answered the noble Lord's points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="10022224000071"></a>He asked about overcrowding. That is a perfectly legitimate question. Crowding is not evenly dispersed across the prison estate. It is particularly concentrated in local prisons-those that serve the courts of a specific area. There is less crowding in training prisons, where activities are targeted at reducing reoffending by providing constructive regimes that address offending behaviour and improve opportunities on release. All prisoner accommodation is assessed and certified by the Director of Offender Management in accordance with national guidance and the related performance standard for accommodation. Operational managers  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_867"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 867</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>must ensure that each cell used for the confinement of prisoners has sufficient heating, lighting and ventilation and is of adequate size for the number of prisoners to be held in it. No prison will be expected to operate at a level of crowding beyond that agreed by the NOMS Director of Offender Management.</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="10022224000072"></a>The relationship between the reduction in crime, which has been substantial, and the number of people in prison is of great interest. It would be rash to say that there is no causal connection between the two, although I would not want to place too much emphasis on that. There are more dangerous, persistent and very serious offenders in prison now than before we came into power. They are also serving longer sentences. What effect that has on levels of crime is for conjecture rather than for definite view, and that is how I shall try to answer the noble Lord, Lord Henley.</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="10022224000073"></a>I am also grateful to the noble Baroness for her comments. She asked whether new places have been delivered by further crowding. The new capacity has been delivered both by substantial new blocks of accommodation and through ensuring that we are making best use of the current estate. For example, this year a new 480-place young offender institution has been delivered at Littlehey in Huntingdon and a 176-place house block at Swaleside. Therefore, it is mostly new capacity, together with the use of existing accommodation under the very strict rules and regulations that I have already read out.</p>

<a name="100222-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="10022224000074"></a>I know that the numbers in prison are a concern of the noble Baroness and of many noble Lords. Our policy is to ensure that serious, persistent and dangerous offenders spend time in prison in order that the public are protected, but that those who do not need to go to prison do not go there. That is why we have set up the community sentences and projects that I referred to when repeating the Statement. We think that is the right policy. We think it is paying dividends and that the moment has come when it is appropriate and safe to get rid of this particular scheme.</p>

Unfortunately, errors are made from time to time in a system such as our prison system. That has always been the case. The House will recall the day when 500 prisoners were released early in 1996. It happens. Luckily, I think the case referred to involved a good deal fewer than 500. Was it two who were released early? These mistakes do happen. I cannot offer any other explanation for that.</p>

As the Minister knows, two figures are always used. One is the certified normal accommodation and the other is the overcrowded or operational capacity. When I was the Chief Inspector of Prisons, I tried to get back the previous responsibility for inspecting cells and deciding what the capacity should be. It was not just a question of size; it was whether there was a bed, a table, a chair and a locker for every person in there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="10022224000079"></a>We confuse ourselves if we talk about operational capacity, because that is the overcrowded capacity.

For this decision to be taken, it was necessary for there to be some headroom between the capacity in the system and the current number of prisoners. If that headroom was too small, it would not have been possible to make the decision that we have made. But if the headroom is substantial-I have given a figure of 2,500 for the present time-our view is that it is safe to halt the early release scheme. That is what we have done today.</p>

The figure is 5 per cent at this stage, and there is a target of a 10 per cent reduction by 2012. In that case, the noble Baroness is right to chide me. It is much more than examination; it is actual reduction. The Bradley report on mentally ill prisoners is more recent, and she will know that we have set up a cross-government scheme to try to implement the recommendations of my noble friend Lord Bradley.

A moment ago we were in court number 1; now we are in centre court. We were discussing how the system could be changed whereby it generated within itself the means of reducing reoffending. I hope that the noble Lord can assure us that the Government are also looking seriously at how to spend significant sums of money on preventing offending in its origins.</p>

The test is whether there is less crime, and less serious crime, than in previous years. On that test the Government have been very successful-more successful than any other Government since the Second World War. No one wants to send anyone to prison, but the fact remains that there are those, I am afraid, who commit serious and persistent crime or violent crime and who need to be imprisoned. I think that that is generally accepted around the House. However, the Government do not leave it there. They say that particularly for those who have committed less serious crime and where the alternative is a short period of custody it is better to press for harsh community sentences to be imposed on defendants. The figures seem to back this up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="10022224000086"></a>The Government are putting forward many schemes, including intense community orders, which are important in trying to wean people off crime. Another thing that takes people away from crime is their ability to get help at an early stage-possibly legal help-regarding social problems that affect their lives. The Government have a good record on that, too. Perhaps I may digress for a moment. I went to Blackpool on Friday and saw the results on an estate of the provision of new buildings, new schools, Sure Start projects, new educational establishments, more policemen on the beat, less crime and less fear of crime. It can and does happen in the community, but for those who offend seriously we believe that prison is the right option.</p>

I and many noble Lords find it strange indeed that violent crime is down by 41 per cent, yet that more and more prisons are being built as a result of all these extra people in prison. We have been listening to a very interesting debate in the Moses Room relating to the Howard League, which has done a brilliant job. I should like the Minister to expand a little on the route he started to go down. As crime is reducing by the considerable amount that he indicated, would it not be better to take a risk with some of the money that is being spent on building more prisons and spend it on very early preventive work, putting the money where it is going to matter?</p>

The Government have a proud record on this. It is to try to improve the infrastructure of deprived areas in our country and to help people to obtain legal help whereby they avoid falling into the pit of crime.

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="10022224000089"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will forgive me if I use her question to respond on the CNA figures. At the end of January, the figure was 76,188 and the prison population was 83,378. I apologise for not having those figures earlier.</p>

His case, put as always with great force and articulation, is that persons in prison are there because they have to be there. For 25 years I had the task of sentencing people, and I fully accept that persons who are dangerous must be in prison; there is no other place for them. I fully accept that persons who commit offences so outrageous that the public feel that there is no other place for them are properly in prison. However, that is not the situation. As the noble Lord will remember from what was quoted in the Grand Committee a few hours ago, 55 per cent of all prisoners have sentences of six months or less. They did not commit serious offences; otherwise they would not have been sentenced for such periods.</p>

<a name="100222-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="10022224000091"></a>My other point relates to an order passed by Parliament within the past few weeks which made 25 years the starting point when considering a sentence for murder involving the use of a knife, instead of the 15 years it had been hitherto. Two calculations were made of the effect that that would have on the prison population. One, from the Sentencing Council, estimated that the population would increase by between 500 and 1,500 places. The other calculation, by the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney General, estimated that the increase would be somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000. Does that affect in any way the calculation that the prison population will be no more than 96,000 by 2014?</p>

We probably disagree about those who should be in prison and those who should not, but the Government accept that there are problems with short sentences. Good alternatives can be found, if the offences are not too serious, in serious community work, rather than sending people to prison. More than one noble Lord has asked how it is that crime figures can go down at the same time as the prison population goes up. Serious and violent offenders receive longer sentences, and so those sentenced some years ago will still be in prison. It is therefore hardly a surprise to see an increasing prison population for serious and violent offences, while also seeing a fall in that particular type of crime.</p>

We believe there will be no impact for 15 years or so; the effect will not be felt until the tariff these prisoners would have been serving has expired. While the figures are no doubt substantial, there is an area in which we will be able to study trends carefully and plan accordingly. Much will happen in the intervening period, and this point and the pressure that the noble Lord talks about will be factored into our future strategy for managing the prison population. So, as I understand it, these figures are taken into account in making our judgment.</p>

What would they think of a new norm whereby in each prison, those prisoners with the best conduct report would be released in the event of that prison reaching its full normal capacity? Surely this would help to prevent overcrowding and provide a useful incentive of good behaviour. I have not given notice of this question and I do not expect a fully considered reply, but I hope that the Government will take it away.</p>

The noble Lord has a great reputation and an interest in this field. The immediate danger is, if we did that, we would be back to early release in the same but different way from what we are just abolishing today. The court's sentence is of some significance in terms of when release is due, given that there are amounts allowed. Of course, if prisoners behave well, they benefit. Whether they should benefit by being let out of prison earlier than the judge intended is a difficult question.</p>

The truth is that, in order to protect the public, some prisoners need to be locked up for a very long time. However, it is important that prison regimes have education proposals as well as other treatment, and I was quoting earlier-to use the noble Lord's phrase-in Court No. 1, the fact that huge amounts of money have been spent over the last few years to ensure that the prison regimes have much more education and drug treatment provision than was ever the case. It is just a horrible fact of life that there are people in our society who have committed such bad crimes that they need to be locked up for a long time. There is often hope for them, and I have seen this in prisons myself. I went to Foston Hall Women's Prison in the Midlands the other day, where I met a number of women serving life sentences. Every consideration was being given by excellent prison staff to helping these women get closer to the day when they would be able to come back and live in society.</p>

<a name="10022226000007"></a><b><a name="100222-0010.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="10022226000048"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I shall speak also to Amendments 12, 31, 35 and 43. We come to an issue which I personally find extremely troubling and difficult. That is the impact which this Bill and its regulations will have on those people who, by any criteria, have care needs that are of the most acute kind, but who nevertheless will be deemed ineligible for free personal care under the proposed assessment criteria. I refer specifically to people who are deafblind.</p>

<a name="100222-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="10022226000008"></a>Deafblindness much surely be one of the most isolating and burdensome of disabilities, but it is important to understand that the kind of care which deafblind people typically need is quite different from the care usually given to a frail, elderly person. Deafblind people are often able to wash and dress and feed themselves, but without support in communication and mobility, many of them are effectively condemned to a life of solitary imprisonment in their own homes. It can be impossible for them to have access to food or basic information, and they are prevented from interacting with other people. Taking exercise, going out to the shops, visiting the doctor, dealing with household bills-all those things which we take for granted-are out of reach without physical help. Indeed, deafblind people are at extreme risk of having to go into residential care if their care needs are not addressed-exactly the imperative which has motivated the Government to bring forward this Bill.</p>

<a name="100222-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="10022226000009"></a>Yet this Bill will be of no use to those suffering from deafblindness, despite the fact that under the current FACS guidance, deafblind people are frequently assessed as having a critical need under the category that relates to involvement in family and wider community life. The Bill in its current form will undermine FACS guidance because it prioritises the provision of personal care over other types of care, such as communications support-the one form of help above all others that gives deafblind people a lifeline to the wider world. As such, the Bill appears discriminatory.</p>

<a name="100222-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="10022226000010"></a>Sense, the voluntary sector organisation which champions the interests of deafblind people, has submitted a paper to the Joint Committee on Human Rights in which it argues that the Bill violates the Human Rights Act. In particular, it says that a failure to provide adequate social care for deafblind people can result in a breach of Articles 3, 5 and 8 as well as Article 1, Protocol 1. I am not in a position to offer a legal opinion on the case that Sense has advanced. However, it needs to be taken most seriously.</p>

<a name="100222-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="10022226000011"></a>The Government justify the Bill's discrimination on the grounds that there are limited resources available. In saying that, they argue that their policy is directed to reach those who have the highest needs. The counter argument to that is that the policy is neither  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_873"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 873</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reasonable nor proportionate because deafblind people with the highest care needs will not receive care under this policy.</p>

<a name="100222-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="10022226000012"></a>Amendments 9, 12, 31 and 43 are designed to address these issues by broadening the definition of the kind of care that will be covered by the Government's policy. Amendment 35 takes a different approach deliberately distinct from that of Amendment 9 and the others. It is a much narrower amendment which would ensure that those deafblind people who have the greatest need and who are at most risk of needing residential care if their needs are not met may qualify for free care and support. I hope the Government will look at this. There is no doubting the recognition that Ministers have given to the unmet needs of deafblind people. Only in June last year they reissued the guidance document, <I>Social Care for Deafblind Children and Adults</I>. This guidance is aimed above all at social services staff. The case studies that Sense has provided to me, and I believe to a number of your Lordships, are of the most heartrending character. The noble Lord, Lord Low, has asked me to say how sorry he is not to be able to be present to support these amendments and to give the Committee a more graphic picture than I could ever give of the gravity of the disability that deafblind people have to endure. I am in no doubt that the needs of deafblind people should be factored into any revision of social care policy. Therefore, I beg to move.</p>

I will deal with the very important deafblind issue that he raised and make one or two comments about the generality of the other amendments in the group.</p>

<a name="100222-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="10022226000014"></a>I absolutely accept the point that the noble Earl made about the gravity of the situation of deafblind people and the problems that they face. It is very important that their needs should be recognised. There is no doubt about that at all. The services concerned are clearly of high importance to people who are deafblind or have multiple sensory impairments. As the noble Earl said, specific guidance, updated and published in June 2009, advises local authorities that they must ensure that services provided to deafblind people are appropriate and that deafblind people are able to access specifically trained one-to-one support workers if they are assessed as requiring them. For that reason we published statutory guidance on that issue. I have an assurance that the guidance that we will produce will cross-reference with that guidance. However, between now and Report I will have discussions with Sense and its supporters to ensure that we are doing that in the right way because this is very important. I reassure Sense that we are taking these issues very seriously and that they are taken into consideration, if not in the Bill at least in the guidance that we will produce. I undertake to do that because, apart from anything else, I want to reassure myself that this is okay.</p>

I understand the intention of this is to ensure that the financial burdens for those in the highest needs are reduced as far as possible, but this falls outside the scope of this Bill and outside the cost envelope which has been allocated.</p>

<a name="100222-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="10022226000016"></a>It is fair to say that it is our intention to reform the care and support system so that it is fairer for all in the longer term, and we will be setting out in detail in the White Paper how we intend to do this. However, full care provision through taxation and free of charge at the point of need is something that we know is not sustainable now, or for the longer term, and was ruled out in the Green Paper. That is why we cannot accept Amendments 9, 12, 31 and 43, and ask that they are withdrawn.</p>

The reason for tabling amendments omitting the word "personal" was not to widen the scope for delivering free services to those living at home; it was rather to highlight the importance of defining "personal" in a way that did not exclude deafblind people. While I note what she said in relation to the guidance, I am a little doubtful that it will of itself be sufficient because the definition of "personal care" in the draft regulations that the Government have promulgated does not to my mind include the kinds of tasks and activities with which deafblind people typically require help.</p>

Wide-ranging figures have been suggested but I will not go into that now. Local authorities have asked that if the estimated cost is exceeded the Government should agree to pick up the whole of the bill. It cannot be asking much of the Minister kindly to give them that assurance this evening since it is in accordance with the new burdens doctrine. That led me on to another thought which relates back to a

<a name="100222-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="10022226000021"></a>We have learnt a lot from the Scottish experiment. Some people think that it has worked well, some do not, but we have learnt a lot from it. Would it not be best to try this scheme in a few local authorities as part of a holistic package of addressing the long-term care issue? Should we not try it in a few local authorities, see how the cost works out, and give them incentives from the Government to try it out? We would then be running a kind of pilot experiment, rather than imposing in one great movement a whole package which we would have great trouble untangling should the fears that I and other noble Lords have expressed here and elsewhere prove to be justified. Why are the Government determined on a national scheme?</p>

I am told that, for example, in Buckinghamshire, the majority of people meet their own costs and yet, perhaps, in Dagenham, they do not. It is very important that any pilot scheme should cover a wide range of areas, to give an assessment of the different situations that occur.</p>

Before I come to the specific amendments, some of which are, of course, against the spirit of the Bill's principles, I say to noble Lords that we recognise that, when determining people's care needs, local authorities are best placed to judge what is appropriate in their own situations, depending on their clients and on the availability of services. However, we want to move towards greater consistency of care provision and, as noble Lords know, we will soon have a White Paper.</p>

<a name="100222-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="10022226000024"></a>We believe-I know that my noble friend Lord Lipsey disagrees with this-that this is a stepping stone towards greater consistency of care provision. The Bill requires all local authorities to offer free personal care at home to those with the highest needs in order to end the postcode lottery which this House has discussed on and off for many years. It will allow councils to have elements of continuing discretion so that they can provide the most appropriate services, which will be dependent on them knowing what works well in their community.</p>

<a name="100222-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="10022226000025"></a>We think that it is right that the Bill proposes that functions imposed on local authorities relating to eligibility for free provision should include the exercise of that discretion, so that they can effectively manage the provision of free personal care in their area. There will be a need for some cases to be considered in light of other healthcare services being provided to an individual and we have already discussed that.</p>

<a name="100222-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="10022226000026"></a>There is sometimes confusion about continuing care and what it means. It is care provided over an extended period of time to a person aged 18 or over to meet physical or mental health needs that have arisen as a result of disability, accident or illness. If an individual has primary healthcare needs, NHS continuing

It is important to recognise that if an individual needs continuing care to meet needs which do not include a significant health component, this will be provided by the local authority-it is right that they should be able to receive their personal care free of charge, if they qualify for it. It is important that NHS continuing care and free personal care are recognised as different ways of delivering health and social care where the balance between health and care may differ.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="10022226000027"></a>I think that the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, is trying to seduce us by his proposals of pilot schemes, but I am afraid that he is not going to divert us from our intention in this matter. We oppose Amendment 11, which is a wrecking amendment. It refers to regulations under Section 15 of the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Act 2003 as having the power to be able to "permit", as opposed to "require", free provision of personal care. However, Section 15 enables the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring-as opposed to permitting-qualifying services to be provided free of charge. This amendment does not change the fundamental nature of the power under Section 15 and therefore the reference to regulations permitting free provision of personal care does not correctly reflect the nature of that power. Therefore, the amendment is not necessary. Local authorities have the power to charge for non-residential community care services but are not obliged to do so. They are therefore already able to provide free personal care if they wish and do not need additional powers to be able to do so.</p>

<a name="100222-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="10022226000028"></a>Amendment 15 seeks to limit the functions relating to eligibility for free provision of personal care which can be imposed on local authorities in regulations. However, in doing so, it would prevent a very important sub-delegation of powers by removing reference to those functions included in the exercise of discretion. We believe that local authorities are best placed to judge what is appropriate in their own situations, dependent on their specific clients' needs and circumstances and the availability of services. It is therefore right that functions imposed on local authorities relating to eligibility for free provision should include the exercise of discretion, so that they can effectively manage the provision of free personal social care in their area.</p>

Amendment 15 deals with the exercise of a discretion. Can the Minister tell me whether that refers to the reablement clause? I am not sure, from reading the Bill. My understanding is that the local authority might have a discretion when or not to insist on the reablement. If it does, I am not sure how that might relate, for example, to a stroke patient returning home with profound disabilities, who would probably not reach his maximum potential for several years, but whose carers might feel it was inappropriate to subject to reablement at that point. Can the Minister reassure us about how the discretion could be exercised in relation to reablement?</p>

We addressed this issue, I think, when I was asked about people receiving palliative care and whether subjecting them to reablement would be appropriate. At that time, as I recall, I said that it would depend. You would not necessarily say that someone who is receiving palliative care should not have reablement, but it may not be appropriate. The local authority would have the discretion to decide whether that was the right course of action. I will write to the noble Baroness in detail if I need to, but my understanding is that this discretion covers reablement.</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_878"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 878</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The order makes provisions that will drive forward energy efficiency and emissions reductions in large organisations, and has been developed with significant business and public sector input over the past four years. The order is the first to be laid under powers in the Climate Change Act 2008 that provide for the creation of trading schemes. When this House passed the Climate Change Act, it created a clear framework for the UK's transition to a low-carbon economy and gave us the credibility to take the lead on the international stage. That Act, as well as making provisions for carbon budgets and other measures to reduce our carbon emissions, provides the legislative basis for the order.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="10022233000002"></a>The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme Order 2010 will encourage participating organisations to reduce their emissions and become more energy efficient. Analysis by the Carbon Trust in 2005 of the large private and public organisation sector found significant potential for cost-effective emissions reductions through energy efficiency. In its analysis, the Carbon Trust found evidence that the introduction of energy efficiency measures was being hampered by at least four obstacles. These are: insufficient financial incentives to reduce emissions; uncertain reputational benefits from demonstrating leadership; split incentives between landlords and tenants; and, finally, organisational inertia. The disappointing rate of implementation of energy efficiency is one of the reasons why my Government have decided to introduce the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme. The CRC is intended as a catalyst for action and is designed to address these barriers.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="10022233000003"></a>The scheme will cover large public and private sector organisations that produce approximately 10 per cent of the UK's emissions. Private and public sector organisations that have at least one half-hourly meter settled on the half-hourly market and use more than 6,000 megawatt hours of electricity through all their half-hourly meters will qualify for the scheme. As a rule of thumb, organisations that spend more than £500,000 on their energy bills are likely to be covered by the CRC.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="10022233000004"></a>The Government will lead by example. All central government departments will participate, even where they do not meet the qualification threshold. Participants will be required to identify and report annually their electricity, gas or fuel-related emissions. Domestic housing and transport emissions are not included in the scheme. Participants are required to surrender a CRC allowance for every tonne of carbon dioxide emitted as a consequence of their reported energy supplies. These allowances can be bought from the annual government sale or on the secondary market.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="10022233000005"></a>We have created an additional safety valve buy-out mechanism whereby additional allowances can be purchased from the EU ETS if the price of CRC allowances becomes too high. The floor price of the safety valve mechanism is being increased from £12 to £14 per tonne of CO2 to ensure that it is used only as a last resort. This will be provided for in the recently published regulations to be made under the Finance Act, which will be laid before Parliament shortly.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="10022233000006"></a>After each year, the Environment Agency, as the scheme administrator, will publish a league table ranking participants by how effectively they reduced their emissions  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_879"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 879</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and became more energy efficient. CRC will be broadly revenue-neutral to the Exchequer: all revenue raised from the annual sale of allowances will be recycled to participants according to how well they perform in the league table.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="10022233000007"></a>The scheme has been designed to overcome the three main barriers to energy efficiency that were identified earlier. The league table overcomes the barrier of unclear reputational incentives. It will provide clear evidence of which organisations are the most energy efficient. The information will be available to investors, to the public and to other companies procuring goods and services. For the first time, energy efficiency will be a reputational issue.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="10022233000008"></a>Another barrier that we have addressed is the split incentive between landlords and tenants. This is a difficult area and we have chosen to assign the responsibility of reducing emissions to the landlord, where they have the contract with the electricity supplier. Landlords are building professionals; tenants are not. Landlords are more knowledgeable about the measures that can be implemented to reduce energy use, and about how to implement them cost-effectively. Furthermore, landlords rather than tenants can have by far the greater impact on the overall energy efficiency of a building. A recent study by the Carbon Trust revealed that landlords have the ability to implement measures that could bring about 80 per cent of available emissions reductions. These arguments convinced us that placing the responsibility on the landlord was the clearest and most effective way to reduce emissions.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="10022233000009"></a>The second major issue that we are tackling is the lack of financial incentives. This is countered by the revenue recycling, which adds an additional incentive on top of savings on energy bills for high performers.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="10022233000010"></a>Another barrier has been organisational inertia. This is addressed by the carbon reduction commitment, which will bring energy efficiency to senior management attention via ranking in the league tables, and through the financial demands inherent in planning both for the CRC and to introduce energy-efficient measures. It is expected that the need to plan and to purchase carbon allowances will gain finance directors' attention in a way that an incremental carbon tax on energy bills would not. The requirement for up-front purchase of allowances each April is intended to make organisations plan rather than deal with the consequences, as currently happens when energy bills are paid. Finally, the fact that an organisation's energy efficiency choices directly impact on how much money will be recycled to them provides a novel financial incentive that is already drawing a lot of attention from potential participants.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="10022233000011"></a>The unique combination of financial and reputational drivers will bring the CRC, and hence energy efficiency, to the attention of boardrooms across the country, and will do so more effectively than any other policy that could have been undertaken.. In many debates on the issue, the need to bring this to the attention of the boards of both public and private sector organisations has been remarked upon. By targeting the CRC to overcome the barriers that have blocked progress in this area for so long, we are confident that by 2020 the CRC will have delivered emissions savings of a  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_880"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 880</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>considerable amount, and financial savings for participants of around £1 billion per year. It is important to reflect that alongside the potential financial incentives and disincentives for organisations that are part of the CRC, at the end of the day, reducing energy consumption reduces bills overall.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="10022233000012"></a>I assure noble Lords that we have listened carefully to stakeholders during three rounds of consultation, and amended the scheme to improve the focus on energy efficiency and to allow greater flexibility for participants. I commend the order and beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="10022233000013"></a><b><a name="100222-0011.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10022233000103"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> My Lords, I apologise to the House for being a few minutes late into the Chamber. I was surprised when we started at 19.20 rather than 19.30: my comfort zone suddenly evaporated.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="10022233000014"></a>I will be brief, as the crucial points of this important matter will be picked up by my noble friend on the Front Bench.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="10022233000015"></a>The briefing that I am receiving from the UK ports industry suggests that DECC advisers and officials are not listening to them. As a result, the way in which the carbon reduction commitment is applied will have consequences that are unfair and, worse still, counterproductive in terms of maximising the impact of the scheme. Parts of the Minister's speech reinforced that feeling on my part.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="10022233000016"></a>As noble Lords know, shipping is the most carbon-efficient form of mass transportation of goods. Therefore, it is vital that the future measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions do not compromise the industry's competitiveness with other modes of transport. Furthermore, the ports industry has a very good record on tackling carbon emissions throughout its operations. For example, I am told that, in the first half of 2009 alone, the port of Tilbury reduced its own use of electricity consumption by around 30 per cent, building on reductions achieved in previous years. Tilbury has a public aspiration to become Britain's greenest port. I look forward to visiting the port for the first time shortly.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="10022233000017"></a>I fully support what the Minister said, but I ask that he ensures that he fully understands the intricacies of port estates and their operations. From what he said this evening, I am not convinced that he does. I urge him to take further time to consult and to make the necessary amendments to the CRC scheme, to ensure that the industry and its tenants can fully contribute to the county's efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

My noble friend Lord Teverson, who knows so much about these issues, is unable to be with us this evening. However, we have had a number of discussions about this. I can say at the outset that we on these Benches are very positive about what you are seeking to achieve through this.</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_881"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 881</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>where the rising sea levels in the south are already leading to mass migration and where melt waters from the Himalayas are causing widespread devastation. Climate change is a reality there that one can see every day and it puts this, and what we are seeking to achieve through this, very much into context.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="10022233000020"></a>I have a few questions for the noble Lord. First, can he confirm that fuel consumption is being calculated for these purposes on an average carbon emission level-in other words, that it is not taking into account how the carbon is generated? It seems rather odd to make no differentiation between organisations that are generating carbon that comes from renewable sources and those that are using coal-fired fuel. Is that the case, and might it be possible to adapt the scheme as we go on to recognise organisations that choose to use more sustainable energy forms?</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="10022233000021"></a>Secondly, with the fixing of the carbon price at £12 per tonne, how confidant is the noble Lord that this is sufficiently high to genuinely have an impact on the behaviour of these large organisations-as he described it, the organisational inertia which has bedevilled us? How confident are the Government that there will be sufficient trading of these permits in order to create a viable market? There is certainly some doubt among experts that there will be.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="10022233000022"></a>Finally, even within the highly regulated EU ETS, there have been incidents of fraud and forged permits. Given that this scheme will include thousands of organisations, how confident are the Government about the auditing and management of the scheme?</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="10022233000023"></a>We very much support what the Government are seeking to achieve with this instrument.</p>

<p><a name="st_203"></a>
<a name="10022233000024"></a><b><a name="100222-0011.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10022233000105"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing these regulations at last. Any scheme aimed at improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions must be seriously considered and developed. There is a legitimate role for government in providing business with stable, long-term incentives to invest in energy efficiency and carbon reduction. This order has the potential to be a progressive and effective tool in reducing the carbon emissions from UK business. However, serious questions remain over the development and implementation of the scheme. To ensure the success of this programme it is essential that the process be workable and intelligible throughout.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="10022233000025"></a>The CRC could have been an excellent starting point for a new carbon accountancy scheme, growing out of the inevitable accountancy that the scheme entails. The Government are sticking doggedly to their unambitious timeline for mandatory reporting that we fought so hard against during the passage of the Climate Change Act. Businesses across the UK have voiced concerns at the lengthy and overcomplicated process of consultation and publication that has taken place.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="10022233000026"></a>There have already been delays to the original timeline of this programme. As the April 2010 launch has remained fixed, there are real concerns that businesses will have too little time to comply now that the regulations have finally been published. Has contact been made with UK businesses to reassure them, or to offer them assistance, guidance and support so that UK  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_882"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 882</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>business may be best equipped to properly comply in time and with the minimum disruptions possible to their business?</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="10022233000027"></a>We can see that the burden of bureaucracy falls far beyond the companies which qualify in the regulations before us today. Many more companies will have to submit detailed reports to the scheme. While some of this is clearly necessary to ensure that we capture the right players, adding unnecessary bureaucracy and stress to the already challenging task of running a business, particularly in our current climate, is highly undesirable. What steps has the Minister taken to ensure that this reporting is as straightforward and simple as possible? Will he also assure us that the period of uncertainty for businesses waiting to hear about their qualification status is as short as possible?</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="10022233000028"></a>These regulations seem to fall between being sensitive to individual sectors' very different carbon abatement challenges, and being a simple blanket measure. Some sectors captured by the scheme will have a far greater exposure to its costs than others. DECC estimates additional costs of around 9 per cent on energy bills. While some sectors' energy bills amounted to up to 65 per cent of their total OpEx costs, for others this is less than 10 per cent. It is clear that this scheme will squeeze some far harder than others. Has the Minister considered the knock-on effects of these to specific sectors of British business? If not, I urge him to do so.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="10022233000029"></a>There has been a good deal of uncertainty around the inclusion of structured companies. In the last round of consultation the regulations were changed to allow the separate inclusion of certain subsidiaries. Will the Minister explain how the valid and sensible steps to give a level playing field to companies owned through franchise structures and holding companies will not be exploited through restructuring larger firms to avoid involvement in, or fair payments to, the CRC scheme? There has been criticism of this piecemeal approach to considering the specifics of a given sector. We have already heard from my noble friend Lord Attlee-who spoke about it more eloquently than I ever could-about the problems perceived by the UK ports industry. There is very little that I can add to what he has already said. I am sure that the Minister will respond if he can.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="10022233000030"></a>As I said in the beginning, we enthusiastically support any measures to drive energy efficiency, as do the Liberal Democrats. We welcome this order. We hope to see rapid improvements in the processes and details of their implementation. The Government have struggled with this. I am sure that any Government, whoever happened to be in power at the time, would have struggled with bringing this to the table. It is very big, complicated, new and exciting. The bad boys will look for all the loopholes as they always do. One tries one's best to write legislation in a way that gives the honest trader a fair crack of the whip. However, it is not easy. We support this as it stands.</p>

I thought that the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, about rising sea levels in Bangladesh and the living experience of climate change provided a helpful anecdote for the current debate on the science. Issues have been clearly identified in relation to the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia and in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change process, but nothing that has occurred seems to undermine the basic science. The evidence is clear that climate change is happening, and if we do not do something about it quickly, we will be bequeathing to future generations what can only be described as catastrophe. Unfortunately it is affecting the people of Bangladesh now.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="10022233000032"></a>Although this is not a debate about Copenhagen, it is worth saying that despite the disappointment about a lack of agreement on a legal treaty, none the less we are seeing with the accord a significant number of countries making their own commitment. We have to build on that and work towards the Conference of the Parties 16 meeting to be held in Mexico at the end of this year. In that context, this order is important because perhaps we have not placed the required emphasis on energy efficiency as a means of reducing emissions. I am convinced that there are huge gains to be made if we can motivate individuals and organisations to take energy efficiency seriously. I take the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, about the complexity of and the time taken to produce the order, but with the league table approach and a system of financial penalties and incentives, we have an opportunity to make serious inroads into a sector which we have found very difficult to encourage to take energy efficiency seriously.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="10022233000033"></a>Perhaps I may start by dealing with the issue of complexity because it is a fair point. Noble Lords very kindly did not comment on the length of the order, but it is not brief and I accept, even though we are talking about large public and private sector organisations which therefore ought to have the capacity to deal with this issue, that there are questions about whether this is too complex a system. I can say that we have consulted fully with the Better Regulation Task Force, which in my experience is not backward in raising issues that have to be dealt with, and I believe that we have gone through all the hoops in that regard. We set out to design a scheme that is as fair and transparent as possible and we engaged extensively with stakeholders to make sure that that was the case.</p>

<a name="100222-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="10022233000034"></a>I want to come back to the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, on the question of fairness. His essential point was to ask whether the scheme is fair to the port sector. We have tried to ensure fairness across the sectors, and to an extent the complexity of the order arises from the fact that we have therefore had to engage with a range of intricate organisational structures. I know that this contrasts, for example, with the installation-based approach of the EU ETS, but we do not think that that would have been suitable. I also do not think that it would have identified some of the barriers that I have already referred to.</p>

However, in the light of comments made by both the noble Baroness and the noble Earl, this of course has to be an organic process. The order is a first and we need to learn as we go along. We will review it on a regular basis, and if issues are raised which show that in the building of the edifice of the CRC-if we have missed points out or learn that there are problems as we go along-we will be prepared to make amendments from time to time. That has been the approach taken by my department in relation to a number of the interventions that we have made. I can think, for example, of the introduction of banding in the renewables obligation scheme. That was done very much in response to comments and concerns raised by stakeholders. We will continue in the same way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="10022233000036"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, referred to the timeline. I probably do not need to go into it, but I am happy to send the timeline to noble Lords if they wish to see it. In brief, the introductory phase is from April 2010 to 2013. The first annual reporting year will start from April this year, the second annual reporting year being 2011 to 2012 and the third from 2012 to 2013, with the first sale of allowances taking place in April 2011. There is always a balance to be struck between wanting to get on with something and wanting to give businesses and public sector organisations time to adjust. I hope that we have got it right and that we can look forward to the introductory year starting in only a few weeks' time.</p>

We have worked very hard with the Environment Agency, the scheme administrator. In April 2009 the agency held eight regional seminars involving more than 600 delegates. Two further national events are scheduled for this year, to be held this month and in March, and the agency wrote to all potential participants during May and June 2009 to inform them about the scheme. My officials and representatives from the Environment Agency have over the past year hosted around 140 events in order to consult on and raise awareness of the scheme. Lastly, what my speaking note calls "newsblast emails"-whatever that means, but it sounds jolly good-have been distributed to our CRC stakeholder list which comprises more than 16,000 individuals. I think it means that we are highlighting what is taking place. There has been an important effort to get this across. I accept that we need to do more and we will be working with the Environment Agency to do all that we can to ensure that the organisations that will be affected know that the scheme is coming their way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="10022233000038"></a>I take on board what the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, says about the ports, and I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed. Some noble Lords may have heard from Forth Ports on these issues. One of the concerns is the apparent inability of the ports to influence their tenants' emissions. For instance, I note in a briefing sent out by Forth Ports that,</p>
<ul><a name="10022233000091"></a>"it is worth remembering that electricity on-sales represent a substantial revenue stream".</ul>

<p><a name="10022233000088"></a>I take that to mean that this is a profit centre: the more electricity that tenants use, the more income is generated for the ports. That is a problem, of course, because the CRC is designed as an incentive which seeks to reverse that.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="10022233000039"></a>There are financial and reputational rewards for those who use less energy. I know also that there have been concerns about what might kindly be described as erratic tenants. I would add that there is nothing to stop any port from asking its tenants to take responsibility for their own emissions by connecting directly to the grid. The noble Earl asked whether I would continue to look at the matter. I will continue to do so but, as I said, this is the start of a process. Noble Lords have not raised the issue of schools, for instance, but concerns have also been raised about schools being brought within a local authority's responsibility. I again give the assurance that we will be monitoring the scheme and its introduction very closely. If it proves that we have to make changes, we will want to do so. However, I also want to give certainty to businesses that we are not going to suddenly come in and change it after a few months. We need to see how it works in practice, and give some stability to those organisations as well.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="10022233000040"></a>I turn to the question of price and trading. We have had very happy debates on the EU ETS and issues to do with the carbon price. The noble Baroness is probably aware that because Copenhagen was not all we wanted it to be, the EU has not been able to say that it will go from a 20 per cent to a 30 per cent emission target. We wanted that as it would have had a positive impact on the carbon price, which is low at the moment and is undoubtedly causing some difficulties. Obviously, we do not want that to happen in relation to the allowances on this scheme. I am advised that we think we have got it right, but again, we will have to look at that very carefully.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="10022233000041"></a>On the issue of auditing, my understanding is that we are currently drafting guidance for the Environment Agency on the criteria that equivalent schemes must meet to be recognised as equivalent to the CTS under the early action metric. I take the point the noble Baroness raises: there has to be integrity in the system, and people have to trust the measurement; she is absolutely right. Throughout the whole emission trading sector, the point about clean development mechanisms is that integrity of the measurement system is critical. One of the unnoticed gains from Copenhagen was the agreement in the accord to have, for the first time, a much more vigorous process in relation to measurement. It applies just as much here as it does to wider international trading schemes.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="10022233000042"></a>As for the impact on business, I turn first to the noble Baronesses, and come back to the issue of price and the question of whether there will be sufficient robustness in the system to make businesses want to take this seriously. We think that it is going to work; it is designed to encourage cost-effective emission reductions. The problem has always been that although the amount of savings we think will come through reduced energy demand is £1 billion a year, energy costs in the budget of large organisations can typically be quite low. That is the problem we face: directors of finance going to  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_886"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 886</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their boards do not see it as a major expenditure item, yet from our point of view, we have to get across to them that this is serious. In many cases, it takes very little effort for organisations to become more energy efficient. I believe that the combination of the allowances system, the incentives for organisations that do well, and, perhaps in some cases, the league table, will provide the necessary incentives.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="10022233000043"></a>In my opening remarks, I referred to the fact that government departments will be enrolled in this scheme, even though some of them do not reach the thresholds. League tables will have a very powerful impact on government departments themselves. Noble Lords know that my department moved into its offices in Whitehall Place in October 2008-in a building with the lowest rating for energy efficiency that you can have. We took a bit of punishment for this, but we have improved. This shows that external pressure, combined with leadership inside the organisation, can lead to that kind of change.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="10022233000044"></a>I turn to the issue of renewables and why they are not raised here. This is a question I asked my officials too. The noble Baroness is quite right; no differentiation is made in relation to where electricity comes from. The reason is that we are talking about ensuring energy efficiency; that, in essence, is taken as the currency. I suspect that we could have a theological debate about that, but this has been decided in terms of simplicity. That is why you do not get different recognition for renewable, nuclear or, hopefully in the future, carbon capture and storage, or whatever.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="10022233000045"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, asked why we group private equity funds with their investee companies. This raises the whole issue of what the correct governance structure is in these kinds of circumstances. We have taken the decision that grouping organisations in the CRC is determined by whether or not there is a parent-subsidiary relationship as defined in the Companies Act. Where such a relationship exists, we think it is appropriate for the subsidiary company to be grouped under the parent to ensure that accountability is applied at the correct level. The criteria set out in the Companies Act involve a level of influence of parents over their subsidiaries that should be sufficient for private equity funds to encourage their investee companies to become more energy efficient. Private equity funds have an excellent opportunity to use their strategic overview of different companies to facilitate the take-up of best practice, and can use their influence to raise energy efficiency up the corporate agenda. I also think that in deciding to use this approach, we will overcome the problem that the noble Baroness rightfully raised in her opening remarks.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="10022233000046"></a>I am encouraged by the generally positive response to this order tonight. We will be looking very carefully at implementation and at issues that arise when the scheme is introduced. Overall, however, I think that this could be very positive and powerful in ensuring that energy efficiency in this country takes a further leap forward in the next few years.</p>

I must now declare an interest as president of the Local Government Association. I am grateful to the LGA for its briefings on the Bill.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="10022233000048"></a>The first amendment in my name in this group, Amendment 17, and Amendment 44, which is also in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, both raise questions about the real cost of providing care free of charge to people with high needs living at home. Amendment 44 calls for a regular appraisal of the actual expense in place of the unsure estimates that are all we have to go on at present. Amendment 17 seeks to put back the date of commencement of the legislation by six months.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="10022233000049"></a>My motivation for pursuing these amendments comes from the real anxieties felt throughout local government that, first, the Government's "guesstimates" of the costs involved may turn out to be highly inaccurate; secondly, that the financial penalties, possibly in hundreds of millions of pounds if the figures turn out to be underestimates, will be borne entirely by the local authorities, which are already expected to contribute £250 million by making efficiency savings on other spending; and, thirdly, the current planned deadline of 1 October 2010 represents for local authorities an impossible task.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="10022233000050"></a>Let me explain why these fears, expressed very plainly by the LGA, seem likely to prove well founded. However, I preface my remarks with some positive comments about the financial arrangements which the Bill seeks to deliver. It must be a good thing that the Bill has helped to trigger this national debate on paying for personal care for older people and others. In the mid-1990s I organised an inquiry by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation into paying for long-term care. We recommended a national care service, with no boundaries between health and personal care, free at the point of delivery, but paid for by a compulsory national care insurance scheme funded by payments from earnings over one's lifetime alongside national health insurance contributions. We failed at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 1996-as did the King's Fund with an excellent financial analysis from Sir Derek Wanless 10 years later-to provoke sufficient debate for this issue to become a central concern for politicians of all parties. The publication of this Bill has helped to bring these issues centre stage and, I hope, will eventually lead to the essential consensus that we need on how the dramatically rising care costs of the future can best be met.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_888"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 888</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100222-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="10022233000051"></a>My second positive comment about the Bill is that its financial framework is built on removing some of the divide between health and social care budgets. The Government intend that this will lead to £420 million moving from the central health budget to the local social care budget. This is just the kind of holistic, joined-up thinking, pooling resources across old boundaries, that will achieve sensible outcomes for those who need personal care at home.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="10022233000052"></a>My third commendation for the Bill is that it should lead to equality of treatment in the assessment of care needs throughout the country, along with, I hope, the portability of that assessment for those who move from one place to another, as proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell. This approach to assessment of needs should lead to greater fairness all round. However, I believe that these amendments are necessary if local authorities are to be able to carry out the new duties now laid upon them.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="10022233000053"></a>Amendment 44 would make sure that Parliament and the wider public know the real cost of free personal care at home and understand where the cost will fall. They can then decide whether any in-flight corrections are needed to make the arrangements affordable at central and local government levels. The amendment would require the Secretary of State to commission an independent review, initially and then annually, reporting to Parliament on what the measures really cost and what they are likely to cost over the next five years. The amendment calls for the itemisation of any efficiency savings which the Government expect will arise from a reduced use of residential care by people for whom the local authority has to pay. I am not sure how real these savings may be, but if there are savings, the independent review will identify them.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="10022233000054"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, spelt out at Second Reading some of the key concerns of the LGA's members. I want to underline and expand on these points. I fear that the accuracy of the Government's estimate of a £670 million total cost is very much in doubt. The Bill's impact statement says there is "inherent uncertainty" in estimating the costs. It is not known how many people who currently fund their own care at home will come forward and claim the costs of care from the local authority. It is unknown how many people who have gone into residential care and pay their own way will move back to their homes or into new homes or extra-care housing where their care will be free. Statistics are not collected on the number of people who are defined as being in "critical" need of care under the <I>Fair Access to Care Services</I> assessment process. Nor are there figures for the numbers already receiving reablement services or what proportion of those receiving reablement services will need no further help once that reablement exercise is over. Therefore, there are lots of uncertainties.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="10022233000055"></a>The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services reckons that the true cost of offering free personal care to those with high needs could well exceed £1 billion rather than the Government's figure of £670 million. Because the Department of Health has capped its own contribution at £420 million, the balance will all fall on the local authorities. I have noted that local councils are already expected to fund £250 million in very uncertain efficiency savings. For sure, there are few  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_889"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 889</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>opportunities for any savings within the overstretched social care budgets. Eighty-one per cent of home care is currently provided by the private sector under very competitive contracts. Wages are notoriously low and, consequently, staff turnover can be high and shortages of properly qualified care workers are acute in some areas. Social care has had to be fiercely rationed in many areas, so it is not surprising that local authorities are fearful of the consequences, not only for funding the £250 million allocated to them but also perhaps another £300 million if the Government's estimates of the real cost prove completely wrong.</p>
<a name="time_37"></a>
<a name="100222-0012.htm_time2"></a><h5><a name="10022233000097"></a>8.30 pm</h5>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="10022233000056"></a>Amendment 17 would put back the start date for the implementation of the new arrangements from the Government's planned 1 October 2010 to 1 April 2011. It seems unreasonable to expect local authorities to be fully geared up and ready to go by 1 October when the following points are taken into account. First, a new national assessment tool is to be provided to local authorities in the summer of 2010. This will be essential to them in implementing the Bill's measures, but they might not receive the details until as late as 31 August. There has to be training and the organisation of administrative structures. New IT systems will be needed to record assessments and capture all the necessary data. If guidance came out much earlier than late August, it would be sure to find people away on holiday. All this work will have to be done in a space of perhaps four short weeks. To expect local authorities to handle all the necessary training and organise internal administrative structures in that timescale is simply not realistic.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="10022233000057"></a>Secondly, the Government are also planning to revise their guidance on fair access to care services. Eligibility for free care will depend on that, which, again, will mean new software, with providers having to develop the requisite systems and councils having to procure them. More training will be necessary on top of that already required.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="10022233000058"></a>Thirdly, new staff will need to be recruited to take on the expected extra workload, not least covering the additional reablement services envisaged in the Bill. Fourthly, councils will have to have their budgets set in early March, as they always do, and most are well down that road. The Bill comes very late to reorganise 2010-11 budgets. With local and national elections ahead, it seems unreasonable to expect local authorities to budget for the Bill's provisions for the financial year that is just about to start. Moreover, although costs would start to fall on local authorities on 1 October 2010, the Government's Pre-Budget Report indicates that the savings, if ever they materialise, from reduced expenditure on residential care will not be achieved at the target level of £250 million before 2012-13, which means that a new financial burden will fall on local authorities during 2010-11 and 2011-12. Under the agreed new burdens directive, government are committed to funding fully any such burdens that result from new legislation. That adds another good reason for holding back implementation of the legislation. Amendment 17 would put back the start date to 1 April 2011. I have pleasure in moving it and commending also Amendment 44.</p>

The Government's timetable for implementing the Bill is unrealistic in the extreme; in fact, I am afraid that I go so far as to say that it is grossly irresponsible.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="10022233000060"></a>Local authorities have already set their budgets for the coming financial year, which already include substantial efficiency savings. They are therefore coming at this exercise not only not knowing how they are going to find the money to fund free personal care but completely unprepared for the practical aspects of implementation, as the noble Lord rightly said-never mind having to get used to a new system of assessment, which is a major task in itself. They will have to have enough people on the ground capable of responding to what in some areas will be a tidal wave of applications. In many councils, those trained people on the ground are simply not there.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="10022233000061"></a>We know-and the Government themselves admit-that the costings underpinning this policy are of the weakest kind. They are based almost entirely on assumptions which themselves rest not even on vague data but on no data at all. Even supposing that areas for further efficiency savings can be identified, the Government themselves concede that such savings do not just happen overnight. They happen gradually, over a period of years. Therefore, to expect councils collectively to find £125 million as from October this year, and £250 million per year thereafter, is to place upon them a burden which not even the most well managed of them will be able to sustain.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="10022233000062"></a>Make no mistake, this is a new burden. It defies belief that the Minister can claim that it is not. It would not be a new burden if central government were funding the whole policy, but they are not. Central government have limited their own liability, while at the same time inflicting unlimited liability on to local government. The result of that is likely to be that councils will find themselves making ill thought-through and perhaps arbitrary decisions in order to achieve instant savings.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="10022233000063"></a>These rushed decisions are almost bound to impact adversely upon council residents. We cannot predict in what ways, because that will depend on the budgets that are cut, and/or the new charges that are levied. Even then, councils will still be groping about in the dark prior to 1 October as regards the costs of implementation. London councils have pointed out that if the Government's estimates are incorrect even by 1 per cent in the first year, the additional costs nationwide could amount to another £40 million.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="10022233000064"></a>The Minister knows, without me telling her, that introducing any new policy brings with it upfront costs. It is no different here; upfront costs will be incurred at the precise time when councils are expected to make savings. What estimates have the Government made about the additional manpower resources needed to deliver reablement on the scale envisaged? If no such estimate has been made, do we not owe it-at the very least-to local authorities to think about this in a measured and considered way? The money for reablement is one thing, but you need trained people to deliver it to the right standard of quality. If you do not have that, you are creating false expectations among the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="10022233000065"></a>The Royal College of Nursing is very concerned about this, as is the United Kingdom Homecare Association. I have seen some of the responses from local authorities to the department's consultation exercise and a note of panic is detectable in some of them. This is not just on the funding question but also on the issue of manpower resources. Again, I say that it is irresponsible of the Government to take things at this breakneck pace. It is not being straight with the public. There is only one logical way forward, which is to revise the timetable for implementing this Bill and the regulations.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="10022233000066"></a>The Government need to get round a table with local government and to put together a more robust impact assessment based on much more accurate and reliable figures. This can be done. Only then, when proper costings are in place, and everyone agrees that the plans are workable and affordable, should the policy be implemented. Whether the policy can ever be made workable and affordable has to be a matter of doubt but it is certainly neither of those things at the moment. I very much hope that the Minister will take on board the very serious concerns expressed on this issue and be prepared to act accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="10022233000068"></a>In moving these amendments, I am delighted to be quite confident that this time the Minister will not be able to say that these are wrecking amendments. They are designed specifically to improve the Bill, and I hope therefore that I shall be more seductive with my arguments on these than I proved to be on the "wreckers".</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="10022233000069"></a>I can be pretty brief because the case for the amendments is self-evident. The Bill is the thinnest of skeleton Bills; it does not in itself do anything except remove the limitation on local authorities. All the substance-the flesh, the bones, the blood, the brains-is to come in the regulations, which are of course out for a consultation that closes tomorrow. It is sad indeed that the House has to consider the Bill today when the consultation on the regulations does not even close until tomorrow, and it is a sign of what the noble Lord, Lord Butler, who has participated in this debate, said earlier: that the Bill is being treated as if it were a piece of emergency legislation.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="10022233000070"></a>I see that the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, is with us, and it is good to see him. It is quite strange, this; for 10 years he and I, with different solutions in mind, have tried to get long-term care up the policy agenda. We took one step forward sometimes, but usually two steps back. Then, suddenly, as a result of the Prime Minister's conference speech, it has become a subject so urgent as to require emergency legislation without any of the safeguards that this Parliament and this country's unwritten constitution usually demand in such cases.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para29"></a>

It is never the case that you get a Bill introduced at this haste without a commencement date where the timetable is so flimsy-and where, for the reasons that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, set out so well, it is extremely doubtful that the timetable is even attainable.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="10022233000072"></a>There is a further argument for a commencement date, which arose earlier in our debates: there is widespread agreement, although it seems harder to turn this into reality, that we need some form of consensus over this. It is no good producing a Bill to last the four weeks until a general election; we want a Bill that will take us forward in policy in this area not over days, months or even years but over decades, because decades are the time horizon for the Bill's effects. It therefore makes sense for a commencement date to be after a general election. The proposal, which would insert a commencement date to be agreed by affirmative resolution in both Houses, would have that effect. In my judgment, it would not be possible for the Government to get an order of that kind through before an election.</p>

<a name="100222-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="10022233000073"></a>Our second proposal is that this be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Frankly, I am astonished that the Government have tried this one on. The argument is that the regulations that are being amended by the Bill were under the negative resolution procedure, and therefore the Bill should be too. That is rather like saying that a home that was fit for a mouse will of course be appropriate for an elephant. The House is clearly required to look at the amendments in detail in full debate and, if they will, agree them. We talk sometimes about Henry VIII powers. On that sort of scale, Henry VIII was an uxorious monogamist in comparison with the Bill, which is simply unsuitable to be taken under the negative procedure.</p>

Indeed, I do not see how the Government could honourably object to having a procedure of this sort. I have criticised the process by which this policy was abruptly adopted and introduced, but I leave that aside. Nobody could listen to the debates today without being aware of the serious concerns among those in the frontline about the incentives that this Bill would introduce, and nobody could be unaware of the controversy about the costs of the Bill and the uncertainty about that.

However, when the country is in the economic state that it is, to introduce a policy which, on the Government's own estimate, would cost £670 million a year, the source of which has not been identified, is in my view "worse than irresponsible", to take the expression of the noble Earl, Lord Howe. We have a situation where the Government are arguing that it is too early to start reining back public expenditure to reduce public debt, and that is a big argument in the politics leading up to the general election. It is one thing to say that it is too early to cut back expenditure; it is quite another to force through in the weeks before a general election a policy like this, which would impose on the Government after the election a very large and indeterminate piece of extra expenditure.</p>

If they do, it will still be in the Government's interests to have had a pause for reflection, to have taken into account the outcome of the consultations and to have considered the regulations which should be brought forward before they bring this Bill into effect. If they lose the general election and the Opposition become the Government, for the Government to have forced through this legislation in advance of the election is, in my belief, in the highest degree irresponsible. I do not speak from a politically partisan point of view when I say that. In political terms, the Government might regard this as a piece of scorched earth; I think, in national terms-and I do not use these words lightly-to force through this legislation, in advance of a general election, and to impose it on an incoming Government would be an act of national sabotage.</p>

It is the most important group of amendments that we have debated today. If it were to be accepted, it would allow all of us to feel a little more confident that what the Government want to achieve would eventually be achieved by a consensus between the parties and in the country about what needs to be done on personal care. This would give us a real breathing space, and an honourable one for this Government to accept. I support the amendments in this group and I hope very much that the Government will listen.</p>

In doing so, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, for her efforts to ensure that Members of this House had copies of the draft regulations and the consultation paper on draft regulations. There is something fundamental in those documents which led me to table Amendment 47, which asks for there to be a review not within a year of the Bill being implemented, but within six months. The reason for that is that I think noble Lords have overlooked something fundamental. We have made an assumption about the eligibility for this provision; we have assumed that it will make free personal care widely available to many people.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="10022233000080"></a>I am not sure that that is true. It depends entirely on the answer to one question, which I want to put to the Minister. Pages 14 and 15 of the consultation document about the regulations helpfully set out two things side by side. One is the FACS "critical" criteria band; the other is the list of activities in daily living with which people must have problems to be eligible. It is quite clear from the activities of daily living that someone must have problems with four of them. However, in the FACS "critical" band, the wording is not clear. The criteria for the critical band are as follows; I apologise for reading them out briefly. Somebody's needs are deemed to be critical when:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="10022233000090"></a>"Life is, or will be, threatened and/or ... Significant health problems have developed or will develop ... Serious abuse or neglect has occurred or will occur ... There is, or will be, little or no choice and control over vital aspects of the immediate environment ... There is, or will be, an inability to carry out vital personal care or domestic routines ... Vital involvement in work, education or learning cannot or will not be sustained ... Vital social support systems and relationships cannot or will not be sustained and/or ... Vital family and other social roles and responsibilities cannot or will not be undertaken".</p>

<p><a name="10022233000081"></a>How many of those criteria must a person fulfil to be eligible? This is the curse of the bullet point; it is not clear. It mentions these criteria but says "and/or". Is it two? Let us presume that it is two. Is it three? Is it four? That, in conjunction with somebody having to have problems with four ADLs, means that somebody must be very, very ill and restricted in their ability to live to be eligible for this. That makes a huge difference to all the assumptions that underlie the Bill.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="10022233000082"></a>It could be that in six months' time it is quite evident, after the implementation of the Bill, that the criteria have been drawn so narrowly that it is not delivering personal care to anyone, or to anything like the number that had been assumed. In which case, I assume, the Government would quickly want to rectify that. Equally, in six months, if this legislation is enacted, word may go around like wildfire that free personal care is available, at which point thousands and thousands of people who self-fund present themselves for assessment. In either of those two cases, that means that this legislation would be wrong. Therefore, it seems to me that within six months we can begin to tell whether it is appropriate or not. The critical question that I want to ask the noble Baroness is how many of those criteria does one have to fulfil? From that we can work out what the impact is likely to be both in budgetary terms and the likely impact on social services departments, which the noble Lord, Lord Best, set out so eloquently.</p>

As I understand it, the Pre-Budget Report suggested that annual savings of £250 million could be achieved from the reduced costs of residential care by 2012-13-and thus I suppose available to local authorities. However, after implementation on 1 October local councils would be expected to find an additional £250 million a year straight away. Are these two sums unrelated, though strangely the same figure? The submission from the LGAs seemed to me persuasive, as did the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Best, tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="10022233000084"></a>It is intriguing for a bishop that the Government's declared commitment to ensure new burdens falling on local authorities should be fully funded is commonly called the "new burdens doctrine". I fear doctrines are much misunderstood. They are thought to be rigid and inflexible by those who do not understand them. Cardinal Newman, soon to be beatified, wrote a lot about the development of doctrine. I will spare you too much theology. The essential truth remains, in his understanding, that the understanding of doctrine develops and a doctrine gradually discloses more of its truth through history. Thus the doctrine is reshaped as its truth unfolds.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="10022233000085"></a>I wonder what sort of unfolding of the "new burdens doctrine" we are actually witnessing in relation to this Bill. There seems to be a curious flexibility built in about local government financing of the provisions of this Bill, which is not carried across into the very sharp distinctions that are drawn between care at home and care in residential care homes.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="10022233000086"></a>I was much struck by the explanation given by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, of her amendment. It seems to me what we probably need is both a short-term review, for the very reasons that the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, has explained, as well as much longer-term reviews of what this Bill might lead to. It could well be what the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, has explained will happen. The fear in my part of the world is a rather different one-some of the adult day care centres in Norfolk have been under threat already. They certainly do not care for those in the greatest need, far from it, but as well as specialist services they provide meals, companionship and a life beyond their home for those who would otherwise have very little social engagement at all. Being continuously at home without any social encounter can cause many older people to decline in spirit pretty rapidly and that often leads on to greater physical decline.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="10022233000087"></a>Such unintended consequences of this legislation could be very expensive in a host of ways, not simply financially, but in terms of our social fabric. I noted that the briefing from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, while broadly supportive of the Bill, raised this point about negative trade-offs. What I am sure none of us wants to see is the free provision of personal care for some in great need at home leading to others, with lesser needs, feeling imprisoned in their homes.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="1002234000003"></a>I have a specific point on Amendment 44. When something like this is put into place, it is important that we see the outcome in terms of real costs. However, I would also want to add the word "net". We need to look at the net costs of provisions of this kind. The information that I have is that in Wales, for example, the percentage of the cost of providing personal care raised by means-testing is in the region of 14 or 15 per cent. That means that the expenditure is already committed to virtually 85 per cent of actual costs. We need to see what the net cost is in order to properly assess whether savings elsewhere would go some way-perhaps the whole way-towards covering some of these costs.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="1002234000004"></a>I support these amendments because, as I said, there has to be rethinking and constraint, but I would not want to stop the Bill dead in its tracks. Naïve as I am as a Cross-Bencher and in the ways of party politics, I realise that emergency legislation is the flavour of the month before a general election. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, indicated, this issue is back on the agenda in a sensible and serious way. The wider community is debating this sensibly regardless of whether we in this House and down the Corridor are doing the same.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="1002234000005"></a>I fear that if the Bill is stopped in its tracks, it will not come back in significant form after an election-whether as a similar Bill or as any other legislation. My fear is that the discussion of these immensely important issues will once again be sent into the long grass because "they are too hard to deal with" or "the problems are too large and the costs would be too great". For various reasons, the latter view is naïve. The costs of pensions in the public sector are too great, but we are not debating those in the same detail. We ought to be looking at this issue and bringing it back. It will not be brought back in any realistic way unless something is put onto the statute book that in the end, to be honest, requires revision. These provisions allow the possibility of such revision.</p>

They are not available. From both direct personal experience and anecdotal comments from people who have told me of their histories, I have found that in many cases local authorities cannot assess anyone within three months. If that is the case, how will they carry out all these new assessments? Getting people trained for these jobs will be a major issue, not just in terms of expense but in terms of getting them all to a point where they can operate efficiently. I said on Second Reading that the whole Bill is pure electioneering. That is tragic because this is a worthwhile cause which we should all be looking at.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="1002234000007"></a>The points made by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, are very interesting, and I appreciate his comments. However, I support the amendments. The whole thing has to be thought out much more thoroughly and local authorities must be sure that they can produce not only the money but the trained staff necessary to carry out the assessments and deliver the care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="1002234000009"></a>This group seeks to address a number of issues concerning the Bill-the commencement date, the way in which it will be reviewed, and the cost of the Bill. It is right that legitimate concerns are raised about the way the provisions are introduced, the costs and how it will be reviewed. We do not agree that delay is needed or warranted. We have made it clear that we want to introduce the regulations so that they will take effect from 1 October this year and people can benefit from the earliest possible date. I think that it is disappointing that so many councils that have responded to the consultation have so far focussed almost solely on the financial aspects of the scheme-I will return to our view of their figures in a moment-and so little on the practicalities of implementation that we identified in our consultation document.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="1002234000010"></a>These proposals are not brand new or a great surprise to these councils; what we are intending to do was signalled well in advance. Indeed, we are working with them and with other stakeholders on an almost constant, daily basis. We are committed to working very closely with them and supporting them through the process of introducing this. We know that this is a challenge for them, but we think that it is achievable if they start in a timely fashion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="1002234000011"></a>The Bill has a simple purpose: to bring relief to those disabled adults and older people who have the highest personal care needs. Despite the furore surrounding the Bill, we do not believe that our costs are underestimated. We think that they are a fair cost: £670 million, with £420 million funded from the Department of Health and £250 from local government efficiencies. The estimates of the costs of free personal care at home are derived from analyses by the Personal Social Services Research Unit at the London School of Economics, using its micro-simulation package for older people, with additional analysis by Department of Health analysts. We are confident about the accuracy of these estimates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="1002234000014"></a>The ADASS survey, to which less than half of the councils responded, proposed an annual cost of £1 billion rather than £670 million. Your Lordships will not be surprised to learn that we have gone through the figures with the ADASS, and it has conceded not only that it had overestimated the effects of lost income but that it had misread the impact assessment on the likely numbers of younger adults who might be eligible for free care. Our detailed consideration of its survey therefore gives us no reason to believe that the estimates that we originally published were not correct. However, we will be focusing on this and remain committed to our review in 12 to 18 months, after the policy is introduced, rather than providing powers to review it in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="1002234000016"></a>Amendment 17 seeks to delay the introduction of free personal care at home to those with the highest need by delaying the date when the necessary regulations may be enacted. We have been clear from the outset that we intended to introduce the provisions from 1 October. We have already made available a working draft of the regulations which will inform how this scheme is proposed to be delivered, and we intend to publish detailed guidance alongside the national assessment tool for determining eligibility for free personal care in the early summer. We know that this is a challenge for local government but, as I say, it has had plenty of notice of these proposals. It also has a highly trained workforce and the tools which will enable it to implement this if it has the will to do so. We do not believe that there is any need to delay the implementation of the regulations enabled by the Bill in this way, and as such ask the Committee not to support Amendment 17.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="1002234000017"></a>I turn to Amendment 20, in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. The policy is to provide free personal care and it is right that councils play their part in delivering it. As such, it would be inappropriate to accept this amendment, which would enable the Secretary of State to put a cap on the amount of free personal care which councils can be required to deliver. I am concerned that setting such a limit, giving local authorities the protection of an arbitrary cap on expenditure, might reduce the incentive for them to manage the costs of the policy as effectively as possible. Indeed, the Audit Commission's report <I>Under Pressure</I><I>,</I> released last week, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="1002234000100"></a>"There are huge financial pressures on councils in the years ahead, but redesigning services and exploiting technology can make them better, more efficient and more personal".</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="1002234000018"></a>The report found that the longer people can stay at home, the happier they are and the less they cost the taxpayer. Innovative, personalised services mean that older people stay independent longer and save public money in the long run. Members of the Committee have conflated two issues as regards savings. Indeed, savings are to be gained in the long run by keeping people out of homes and independent; there is no question about that. However, those savings will not fund this scheme in the next two years; 4 per cent of local authority spend-which is what local authorities  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_899"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 899</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are committed to save through efficiencies-is 4 per cent of almost £100 billion. Therefore, it seems to me that meeting the costs of this scheme within those savings is entirely within the capabilities of local government.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="1002234000019"></a>We cannot accept Amendment 38. The current position under Section 15 of the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Act 2003 is that regulations made by the Secretary of State are subject to the negative resolution procedure. Despite the impassioned plea from my noble friend on this issue, we listened to what the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee had to say about the matter. On 22 January this year, the committee reported:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="1002234000101"></a>"There is nothing in the Bill to which we wish to draw the attention of the House".</p>

<p><a name="1002234000096"></a>We have made available a working draft of the regulations. If at all possible, we intend to publish the Government's response to the consultation when the Bill reaches its next stage; in other words, at the earliest opportunity. Noble Lords will know that I will keep them informed and make that available as soon as I am able to do so.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="1002234000020"></a>Amendment 44 would require the Secretary of State to commission an independent review of the costs of delivering personal care each year, the estimated costs of delivery in the next five years, the savings made from decreased use of residential care each year and the estimated savings in the next five years. It would require an annual report to Parliament of this information. In the impact assessment for the Bill we have committed to reviewing the implementation of free personal care within the first 12 to 18 months of the policy coming into force. After this review it will be possible to reconsider the predicted costs of delivering free personal care and the conditions for eligibility if necessary. If our costings for the first year prove to be accurate, it would seem to be an unnecessary burden on local authorities to have to produce data to enable the Secretary of State to report to Parliament annually on this matter. Such a report would require a much greater volume of data collection by local authorities than we had envisaged.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="1002234000021"></a>Amendment 45 seeks to delay the commencement of the provisions within the Bill until a review of their affordability has been carried out and reported to Parliament. Such a report would achieve nothing because the Bill's provisions themselves simply concern the enabling powers for regulations on free personal care, not the substantive provisions on free personal care themselves, which would include the circumstances in which free personal care is to be provided. It seems to me that the review at 12 to 18 months would deal with that issue also.</p>

<a name="100222-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="1002234000022"></a>Amendment 46 is another attempt to delay the coming into force of the Bill and the provision of free personal care to those who need it. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has examined the memorandum which we sent it and which reflects our views on the appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny for any secondary legislation that is to be made under Section 15 of the 2003 Act.</p>

We think that six months is too short a period for a meaningful review to be undertaken and I ask her not to press her amendment.</p>

This amendment addresses those two critical issues which determine whether or not many people are deemed eligible for free personal care. The first part of this amendment would ensure that somebody who is in need of personal care is fully and properly assessed and is given a choice over the type of service that they may be given.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="1002234000026"></a>There have been frequent references to Scotland. This is one of the areas on which the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, and I have more profound differences than we do on many others. The evidence from Scotland-from a Joseph Rowntree Foundation-funded study-is not that carers have abandoned the people they care for; they have not given up caring for their relatives. They have, in a number of cases, changed what they do in order to make sure that life is more bearable for them and for the older people, and I think that that is an entirely right thing to do. This part of the amendment, building on that experience, is absolutely clear that the presence of a carer should not be taken as part of an assumption about somebody's eligibility.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_901"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 901</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100222-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="1002234000027"></a>The second part is about qualifying services. At the heart of the Bill is something that we all know to be fundamentally out of step with the way in which many older people and their relatives now think. Their lives are very different from the lives of people when personal care at home was originally conceived. Many more people now work full-time or part-time.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="1002234000028"></a>The purpose of this part of the amendment is to enable people to be more imaginative in finding services that meet their needs. I was struck by what the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said about one particular group of carers: spouses, usually the wives of older men, who do not have any choice about whether they care for their husbands. There is an assumption that they will, even though they might themselves be frail and have a number of health difficulties. Often, those carers can perform personal care tasks but need help with other things to enable them to care for somebody with whom they have spent their lives. Having somebody come and do the washing or the housework once a week enables them to carry on with the task of delivering personal care. Many older people who are cared for do not want personal care to be delivered by a stranger; but in order for that to happen, their carer must be supported.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="1002234000029"></a>The amendment probes the extent to which, first, a carer's existence is not taken into account as part of the assessment of eligibility; and, secondly, how imaginative and free local authorities can be, working in partnership with service users and carers, in understanding the context in which personal care happens, and what the service needs may be, even though that service need may not be personal care itself but something that allows personal care to be delivered by somebody else. I beg to move.</p>

As the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, rightly said, there has been no sign in Scotland of carers abandoning their relatives because free personal care is available. However, it is important that we do not wrongly assume that family members are willing and able to provide care; or that the care would be sustainable if it were imposed on family members at a particular time. If you do that, you will often force families to give up work, putting at risk their own health and their financial future. Therefore, you will possibly end up with more people being a charge on the state, or needing residential care or home care, than would otherwise be the case.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="1002234000031"></a>Some local authorities' self-assessment forms for disabled people ask whether any of their care is being provided by a family member or friend. So far so good; but they then do not include a provision to check with that person whether they are willing or able to provide the care. I remind noble Lords that that goes against current legislation such as the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act and the Carers and Disabled Children Act. It also raises issues under the Human Rights Act. I seek an assurance from the Minister that she agrees that we should always remember that caring takes place within an existing relationship, and that the  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_902"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 902</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nature, history and quality of that relationship should always be taken into account before any assumptions are made about a family's willingness to care.</p>

<a name="1002234000032"></a><b><a name="100222-0014.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="1002234000122"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, Amendments 22 and 41 in my name are grouped here. I echo a great deal of what the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said. I also take fully on board the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley. However, the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, is not quite right because it is ambiguous. Before a person can be deemed eligible to receive free personal care at home there are three assessments which he or she must undergo. The first is an initial assessment that will usually be the precursor to a course of intensive reablement. The second is a community care assessment designed to identify the range of the person's needs and what level of banding they fall into under the FACS definitions. The outcome of that assessment will in part be influenced by the result of the reablement exercise. Anyone placed in the highest FACS banding, "critical", would be assessed on the number of activities of daily living for which they required personal care to be delivered to them by social services.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="1002234000033"></a>In practice, as I understand it, the second and third assessment legs will often be rolled into one. However, for decision-making purposes they are quite separate. The single assessment tool which the Government are bringing forward will be designed to inject national consistency into the assessment of need-in other words, whether a person's needs are critical, substantial, moderate or low. It will not be able to take account of the particular living conditions in which the person finds himself.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="1002234000034"></a>To take a simple example, a man whose needs are assessed as critical may need help with four activities of daily living if he is living in a house with stairs. If he then moves to a bungalow his needs will remain critical under the national assessment process but he may only require assistance with three ADLs. This means that complete portability of benefits, which, in the abstract, many of us are keen on, cannot be delivered because it will always be necessary to assess someone by reference to their actual living conditions. So the noble Baroness's amendment is flawed because it fails to draw a distinction between the single assessment to be carried out under national criteria and the assessment of eligibility for personal care which depends on the person's individual circumstances and is a matter for the local authority concerned.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="1002234000035"></a>The question is whether the presence or absence of a carer should have any relevance in the various processes of assessment. My own view-and I hope the Minister will confirm this-is that in the assessment of a person's overall level of need, which is what the national assessment tool will be used for, the presence or otherwise of a carer has no relevance or bearing whatever. The level of someone's need is their level of need. However, when it comes to that person's entitlement to personal care, whether free or paid for, it could well be that the presence of an unpaid carer affects the person's eligibility for some elements of personal care.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="1002234000036"></a>For instance, if an unpaid carer were able and willing to supervise a person taking their prescribed medicines at certain times of day and the person  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_903"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 903</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>himself was happy with that, there is no good reason for social services to assume responsibility for this task. So when deciding on someone's eligibility to receive free personal care it is not unreasonable to take account of any assistance which can readily be provided by an unpaid carer. On the other hand, we do not want to see situations arising in which unpaid carers are unfairly exploited. Local authorities should not be able to impose unreasonable demands on carers as a way of avoiding their legal obligations to provide personal care. After all-and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, effectively made this point-it is often when carers feel that they can no longer cope with looking after somebody on their own that local authorities are requested to provide help.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="1002234000037"></a>To what extent are would-be service-users entitled to insist that their eligibility to receive personal care in the home should take no account of whether a carer is willing and able to provide help with activities of daily living? This seems to be quite a difficult question because, if, as I believe, there is a difference between reasonably relying on a carer and unreasonable exploitation of that same carer, there is at the same time no obvious or easy way of making that distinction clear in regulations or guidance.</p>

The National Carers Strategy includes a 10-year vision for carers, a commitment to move carers' issues to the "centre of family policy", and to reflect this by promoting the concept of whole family care planning following separate assessment. Undertaking effective carers' assessments is a key part of making this a reality. But while we will continue to rely on carers to contribute to the wider package of care, we do not want to place unreasonable caring burdens on them.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="1002234000039"></a>The planned White Paper is addressing longer-term issues, and it may have future implications for the way that social care is delivered. However, given that any fundamental system reform is unlikely to take place for some time, we have recently consulted on revised FACS guidance which will be published shortly in recognition that more immediate action can be taken to improve the current system. Compared with the previous guidance, the new FACS guidance will address the key role that carers can play in meeting people's care needs and how their needs can be addressed at the same time if they are to continue in their caring role. In determining an individual's eligibility for care, account will be taken of the input that the carer is able and willing to make. In that sense, it will not be "carer blind", nor should it be, but this will help to establish whether someone is in the highest band for help with social care-FACS critical. For those with critical needs, the assessment for personal care will be based on activities of daily living and that will be carer blind, focusing only on what the individual themselves can or cannot do. That might be the opposite way around from how it was related by the noble Earl. I think I will check on that, but the Box tells me that that is what this says. A practice guide and online learning tools  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_904"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 904</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for FACS are being developed by the Social Care Institute for Excellence to help frontline staff and their managers apply the criteria in a more consistent way.

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="1002234000040"></a>In relation to Amendment 18, I wish to stress that it is important that we properly reflect the role of carers, as outlined by my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley. At this point, I wish to pay tribute to the work that unpaid carers are doing up and down the country day in and day out. It is also important, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, pointed out, that we make sure when undertaking assessments that the role of a carer is not taken into account inappropriately. So, for example, when undertaking assessments, professionals should seek to establish whether a person can carry out a particular task such as washing or bathing, and that they are assessed on their own ability to do that, not the ability of the carer to assist them. Taking into account a carer's role to a greater extent could inadvertently affect the outcome of the assessment for eligibility for free personal care. However, while I recognise the sentiment expressed in this amendment, we are committed to addressing this issue in statutory guidance. I therefore do not consider it necessary to have this on the face of the Bill, although clearly we will need to discuss the issue further as the guidance unfolds.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="1002234000041"></a>I turn to the point raised by the noble Baroness about "qualifying services". Section 15 defines qualifying services as a range of services provided under community care legislation. This amendment would seek to extend the range of services provided free to any services needed by a person in receipt of personal care, not just services to meet their personal care needs. This would be uncertain and beyond the policy, which is limited to personal care for those in the highest need.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="1002234000042"></a>Amendment 22 aims to ensure that regulations may specify the extent to which a carer's practical assistance can be taken into account when determining an individual's eligibility for free personal care. We will be setting out the assessment process for deciding whether or not an individual is eligible for free personal care in statutory guidance and, as I have said, we will also be providing local authorities with a national assessment tool to help them make this judgment. The revised FACS guidance sets out how local authorities should take into account the practical support of a carer when they are carrying out a community care assessment and judging which FACS band an individual sits within, based on their level of risk. The additional assessment of personal care needs which will determine eligibility based on requiring significant help or prompting to carry out four or more of the activities of daily living will, as I have already said, be carer blind.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="1002234000043"></a>Finally, I note that Amendment 41 is consequential on the other amendments tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, which use the term "carer", and is only necessary if these amendments are passed. In itself, the proposed definition of "carer"-that which is set out in the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000-is unobjectionable. However, since those amendments to which Amendment 41 is consequential are being resisted, this amendment should also be resisted; I ask the noble Earl to withdraw it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="1002234000048"></a>It is often the way in politics that Governments receive no thanks at all for the good things they do. Here, I think we have on our hands the potential for good intentions to bounce back in Ministers' faces. The way the Government are setting up this scheme is, I am afraid, bound to lead to disappointed expectations on quite a large scale. They have led the public to think that people who have been through a reablement process, and whose needs are assessed as critical, will be eligible to receive free personal care at home-we know that is not so. Free care will only be available to those in critical need who require significant assistance with four or more activities of daily living. So then, is it correct that someone whose needs are critical and who requires significant assistance with four or more activities of daily living will be eligible for free personal care in the home? They may but, on the other hand, they may

For example, cleaning, laundry and driving someone to the doctor are services for which a charge will continue to be made. To some people that will not come as a welcome piece of news; to others it will simply be confusing.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="1002234000049"></a>The issue of potential public disappointment and discontent is wider than this because, whenever lines in the sand are drawn and definitions set in stone, someone will always end up on the wrong side of one or other of them. The difference between someone having care needs that are substantial and care needs that are critical is often quite small. The difference between needing help with an activity of daily living and needing significant help with that activity can be equally tenuous and is often quite subjective. What is meant by "significant"? It could be a significant amount of help or it could be help which achieves a significant result. Neither the regulations nor the current guidance provide clear and simple answers to these key questions of eligibility.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="1002234000050"></a>The scope for disputes between local authorities and service users will be much greater than it is at the moment because much more will be at stake. A lawyer who deals in this field of the law said to me that he knew solicitors who were rubbing their hands in anticipation of dealing with the litigation that lies ahead. Let me make clear that I repeat that remark with no relish whatever. Disputes and litigation will be a tremendous distraction for all concerned, other than the lawyers, and a waste of resources. However, it looks like coming about because the Government have rushed at this policy and have not allowed themselves and everyone else to make sure that it is deliverable without unintended adverse consequences.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="1002234000051"></a>The Equality and Human Rights Commission and a number of other organisations have questioned the definition of personal care contained in the draft regulations. They have pointed out that the categories of personal care listed do not dovetail with the six categories of activities of daily living. For instance, the definition of personal care makes no reference to helping people with mobility problems, or managing and monitoring medication, or basic food preparation, even though these things feature in the activities of daily living. What is the reason for that mismatch? Should not the draft regulations be clearer about what is intended? I beg to move.</p>

Alongside social care and health, housing represents the equally important third leg of the stool; without the housing leg the stool falls over. It is no good assessing an individual's personal care needs and switching funds from health to pay for personal care if the critical problem is the unsuitability of that person's home. You cannot discharge someone from hospital safely if the fall that they are recovering from is likely to recur when they get back to the unsafe premises that they came from: if they cannot get up the front steps; if they cannot get upstairs to the

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="1002234000053"></a>This amendment calls first for an assessment of the individual's eligibility for free care to have alongside it an assessment of the suitability of the home for that individual to receive their personal care. This would do the joining-up which the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, as Minister, did so helpfully in the government report, <I>Lifetime Homes, Lifetime Neighbourhoods: A National Strategy for Housing in an Ageing Society</I>. It also builds on the new report from the audit commission, <I>Under Pressure</I>, which explains that money is extremely well spent on the home in preventing people from requiring more care or a move into a residential establishment.</p>

<a name="100222-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="1002234000054"></a>We may well argue that it is the extra-care housing that the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, referred to earlier that is the ideal, or retirement villages and retirement communities, but these will serve only a very small minority of people. For the great majority, it will be aids and adaptations to their existing accommodation that will mean that care can be provided safely, sensibly and happily within the home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="1002234000055"></a>Perhaps I could just take a moment to give your Lordships an illustration from my own life, as I suspect that a lot of other people will have similar stories surrounding their lives as well. After Christmas, I had an elderly relative move into residential care. She was not actually receiving any formal care and was getting very little informal care in her own home, being a fiercely independent woman, but it was the house that drove her out and required her to move into expensive residential care. It was just unsuitable. It was a cold house and one with steps in every possible direction-upstairs, downstairs and all around. She is suffering from quite severe arthritis, finding it extremely difficult to get around and to turn the taps. There are no grab rails on the walls. I could see the expenditure that might do the trick, but it is too late as she has gone into residential care. The real problem that she faced was a housing problem, even though she now finds herself in an institution, receiving expensive care. I think this joining-up of housing with health and social care is an underlying principle that this piece of legislation with its words "personal care at home" should embrace.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="1002234000056"></a>I recognise that this is something of a probing amendment. I would argue for more funding for the disabled facilities grant programme, which is very underfunded, and more resources for the home improvement agencies, such as Care and Repair. Money can be so well spent in housing in its relationship to care within the measures enshrined in this legislation. I understand that it is in the reablement section that one finds the opportunity for some funds for aids and adaptations to people's homes, including telecare censors and alarm systems that can alert care providers elsewhere. However, on looking at the numbers, I note that the funding for reablement at £130 million for 130,000 people at £1,000 per head, based on 30 hours at £30 per hour with £100 to spare for little extras, does

<a name="1002234000057"></a><b><a name="100222-0015.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="1002234000130"></a>Baroness Greengross:</b> I rise to speak to Amendment 33. I want to speak particularly about people suffering from dementia. There is quite a concern that many people with dementia will not meet the four ADLs or the critical criteria for an inability to carry out vital personal care or domestic routines, as described, despite having a substantial level of need. That is obvious when one thinks about the symptoms of dementia in its various forms. Your Lordships will recognise that one of the key reasons for this is that many people with dementia find that they can carry out some personal care routines with various degrees of difficulty, but only when they are prompted by care staff or carers. Providing personal care to someone with dementia is often very different from providing care for a frail older person, because the person with dementia can easily become confused and distressed and very often resists the essential care that he or she needs.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="1002234000058"></a>Careful prompting and supervision play a critical role in the care of many such people. There are all sorts of things that they can do-they are very simple things when you are well-such as swallowing medication, chewing properly, preparing food for themselves, washing properly, and dealing with and maintaining continence, if they are carefully prompted by trained people. The amendment would ensure that dementia is recognised as the illness that it is. It is essential that it is inserted. I hope that the Government take it seriously, so that the supervision and prompting that are necessary can be provided.</p>

<p><a name="st_232"></a>
<a name="1002234000059"></a><b><a name="100222-0015.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="1002234000131"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> I shall speak to Amendments 37 and 42, which stand in my name. I am pleased, as always, to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross. It is fitting that I, too, want to talk about people with dementia and the importance of having staff who are trained and who understand the nature of dementia in the delivery of services.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="1002234000060"></a>I used to have an office whose window looked across the street. Twice a week, a little van would turn up from social services. A lady would get out and ring the door of a house that was divided into flats. She would wait for quite a while while the gentleman inside came to answer. All the time, she would continue to talk to the driver of the van. When the gentleman came to the door, she would hand him his package of dinner while continuing to talk to the driver. She would then turn around and walk away. That gentleman had dementia. She did not even know whether he ate that dinner, fed it to his dog or threw it in the bin. She had no idea of what his life was like inside his house. It was the absolute epitome of a service being delivered so badly and so wrongly for somebody who had dementia. I would hope that that sort of thing would not be so common these days, but who knows? Hard-pressed staff might find themselves in a similar position.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="1002234000061"></a>I wanted to table the amendment because it is important that we remind ourselves that we are talking in this Bill about two very distinct groups of people. There are adults with disabilities who for the most part will have conditions which are life-long and stable. Their needs may change, but probably not much over  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_909"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 909</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>time. We are talking also about older people whose conditions can change quite rapidly, and older people whose conditions might be limiting and long-term, and change gradually. Their needs are very different. I hesitate to say it in front of the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, but, in lay terms, the needs of people with dementia can change. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, was absolutely right: the distinction between substantial need and critical need is very difficult to determine, particularly when people have fluctuating needs.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="1002234000062"></a>When speaking to an earlier group of amendments, I asked the Minister how many of the FACS-critical criteria one would have to meet. Those criteria include:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="1002234000104"></a>""Life is, or will be, threatened".</p>

<p><a name="1002234000097"></a>That is a comparatively easy thing for a member of staff or an assessor to find out. However, there is also the criterion that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="1002234000105"></a>"There is, or will be, an inability to carry out vital personal care or domestic routines".</p>

<p><a name="1002234000098"></a>Is that so clear and easy to determine, and are the consequences of it so great? Therefore, I tabled this amendment and Amendment 42, which is similar to that of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, to determine exactly what is meant by personal care. There is, as noble Lords are aware, no definition of personal care in primary legislation in England. As several noble Lords have already spotted, the definition in this amendment is the definition in the Scottish legislation from the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002, as amended in 2009. The significant amendment in 2009 was the consideration of the preparation of food. When looking at an amendment such as this, it is perhaps very easy to dismiss as insignificant each individual sub-clause of each individual part. However, in terms of the life of a person who is likely to be eligible for free personal care-and for their carers-each and every one of these small things is an extremely important part of life.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="1002234000063"></a>The Government have always resisted having a definition of personal care in primary legislation, and I am sure that they will do so now. I would be staggered if they did not. However, one of the excuses that they have always run in the past is that putting a definition into primary legislation would by its very nature be exclusive and would probably be unworkable. In Scotland, however, that has proven not to be the case; it has proven that the lawyers, sadly, have not made that much money from bringing cases to contend what is meant by an unclear definition.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="1002234000064"></a>I also wish to echo the points made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that the definitions proposed in the Bill and in the regulations do not equate to the six basic categories of activities of daily living. That is pretty well bound to cause confusion, if one is not being too generous.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="1002234000065"></a>As I did at Second Reading, I echo the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. Help with the provision of medication is a critical part of life for these people, and it therefore seems to me that it is a major omission. The prompting and supervision of people who have dementia to do some of the personal care tasks of which they are capable but which they cannot do if they are not prompted seems to me to be a critical part

I echo the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, that prompting somebody to do that must be one of the areas of personal care.</p>

<a name="1002234000066"></a><b><a name="100222-0015.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="1002234000132"></a>Baroness Gardner of Parkes:</b> My Lords, I strongly support Amendments 32, 33, 37 and 42. I was very interested in the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, who knows so much about dementia; her remarks were very sad. Amendment 37, tabled the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, also deals with dementia. It is important that there should be special provision for dementia, because there has to be recognition that people suffering from dementia have different requirements.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="1002234000067"></a>I like the way in which Amendment 42, tabled by the noble Baroness, set out a great catalogue of things-that is practical. I am not sure, however-I am only speaking from my past experience of Bills in this House-about that approach. Usually, when someone sets out a provision listing everything that one could possibly think of, someone else says "Oh no, you should not make it like that, because there will be other things that you have not thought of, so you should put it in some other way to cover that". Moreover, there should perhaps be a code of practice or something like that, which would include all of those things-this might not be completely appropriate even for a schedule. However, it is right that people should view those topics that she has listed there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="1002234000068"></a>Having made those comments, though, I want to say that I really stood to support the noble Lord, Lord Best, on the provision of appliances and adaptations in a home. I repeat my comments from Second Reading: it is important that if a home is completely unsuitable and cannot be adapted in the way that he described for that elderly relative of his, then other housing should be available. Going right back to my social services days on the council, we were aware that housing, health and social services must be linked-a point that has been made now-and until they were linked it was pretty hopeless trying to run any of them, because each was affected by the others. I strongly support the point that has been made about linkage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="1002234000069"></a>The housing issue is wider than just this Bill. I read in this morning's paper of some family that has lived in a tiny flat for 12 years waiting for a house-or it might have been five years, with an estimated wait of 12 years. Many people are looking for more space, and it should be possible to provide the ideal space for older people in great need in order to free up some of this other space, particularly in terms of social housing, where large properties are often occupied. People cannot be forced out of their houses but they should be persuaded that there is merit in the idea of leaving. If an attractive alternative were available that was better in health terms, I think that they would be willing to accept that.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="1002234000070"></a>The noble Lord's relation opted for a home simply because that was the only thing available. I am sure that if she had had the offer of a small self-contained warden-covered area, she would have been very happy to accept that. As I have said, in other countries, and

<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="1002234000071"></a>These are interesting amendments so, although they have come up so late in the day, I felt that I had to say something about them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="1002234000073"></a>The other amendments all go to the difficulties of the definition of the problem and how it relates particularly to people suffering from mental health problems in addition to physical health problems. Activities of daily living were originally used to assess people's physical states.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="1002234000074"></a>It is not just dementia; dementia is merely the commonest and most obvious condition. Take, for example, an older person with a depressive illness or a paranoid disorder who is not eating or drinking without help because of ongoing delusional beliefs about food-or, even commoner, a person with cerebrovascular disease who apparently has nothing wrong with them at all but sits all day and does nothing as the result of profound motivational difficulties that are of cerebrovascular origin. The latter is a remarkably common complaint from families: "Me mum seems all right but she doesn't actually do anything, doctor", is how it is usually described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="1002234000075"></a>It is a devil of a job sometimes to get this right. I refer to attendance allowance because that has been one of the great banes of the help that people have had available to them. I worry that we will have a rigid interpretation in the guidance that will make it easy to tick boxes and do the assessment, but will not be sensitive enough. So much will depend upon it. If we are going to have a dividing line between three ADLs, four ADLs and five ADLS, we have to be sure that this is a sensitive way of assessing people and that people have clear guidance. Personally, I think it will be a nightmare to make decisions of this nature. We should have some sort of definition in the Bill, and I support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and her intention to get some support for people with more difficult assessment problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="1002234000077"></a>As the Government made clear in their excellent strategy report, <I>Lifetime Homes, Lifetime Neighbourhoods</I>, housing adaptations are an essential component of the triangle of support, with heath and social care, in enabling people to remain living independently in their own homes, a point that has been made by a number of noble Lords. Many noble Lords will have had the experience of breaking their leg or their ankle and finding how difficult it suddenly becomes to do the basic essentials of washing and going to the loo

Sadly, many noble Lords will have had the experience of finding that the home they have lived in happily for many years with their partner suddenly becomes the major barrier in helping them to care for that partner, when they become seriously ill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="1002234000078"></a>By chance, this Committee falls on the day that will no doubt always remain a significant anniversary in my life, as it was 44 years ago today that I fell off a carnival float and broke my neck. If my parents' home had not been adapted to provide a bathroom and a bedroom downstairs, the amount of personal care which I would have needed would have been considerable, and would then have been a continuing and recurring cost. The ODI report of 2007, <I>Better </I><I>O</I><I>utcomes, </I><I>L</I><I>ower </I><I>C</I><I>osts</I>, by the University of Bristol, reviewed the evidence of the implications for heath and social care budgets of investment in housing adaptations. It set out a wide range of evidence and states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="1002234000106"></a>"Adaptations that remove or reduce the need for daily visits pay for themselves in a time-span ranging from a few months to three years and then produce annual savings.

I admire the thoroughness with which the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, conducts herself in proceedings such as this, but I wonder if she has perhaps gone a step too far in this amendment. Despite the fine provenance that she quotes for much of the material, there will inevitably be gaps-for example, there is no mention of insulin injections, which some would regard as fundamental. I do not want to see that added to the list; I am just making the point that there will always be gaps if you make a list. I would prefer a series of general points that have to be covered.</p>

I have taken out about two-thirds of my notes because I am conscious of the time, so if I seem a bit truncated that is because I am.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="1002234000082"></a>I start by saying that the proposals in this Bill are for England and are not the same as they are in Scotland. In Scotland they offer a much different system, which is about the provision of full care free of charge, not personal care, as we are proposing, which is a much more targeted approach.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="1002234000083"></a>The Government entirely agree that a range of services and support needs to be available to help people to maintain their independence and, crucially, to help prevent their care needs from increasing. We know, for instance, that an older person who is losing some of their mobility, but is otherwise capable of looking after themselves, can be helped by the provision of home adaptations to continue living independently in their own home.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_913"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 913</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100222-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="1002234000084"></a>As well as these sorts of adaptations, early intervention and support services, such as balance training to help someone recovering from a fall, are known to be a worthwhile investment which both helps people to get back on their feet and continue living independently, and saves money in terms of preventing admissions or readmissions to hospital or residential care.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="1002234000085"></a>We know that prevention and early intervention are not only good for people but make absolute economic sense. However, we are not starting from scratch. The Government have been promoting and supporting this approach in a variety of ways. In the Putting People First programme we defined prevention as one of the essential elements of what a transformed social care service for adults would look like. We have given local authorities more than £500 million to support that transformation and, all around the country, have been developing preventive services to support people's independence. Where this involves adaptations to the home, it is often done in partnership with housing providers, who can draw on disabled facilities grants. The allocations for 2010-11 will be announced shortly. We have also specifically promoted the development of telecare and other technologies through the £80 million preventive technologies grant made some years ago. On top of this, the Bill offers further support for reablement services, which include home adaptations and technologies. We are not just talking about the amount of money allocated by the activities of this Bill, but about building on other resources which are already available for adaptations to people's homes.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="1002234000086"></a>Amendment 19, moved by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, seeks to insert a power for the definition of personal care to be included in the regulations. Of course, the noble Earl is right: it is necessary that we clarify our definition of personal care but it is not necessary to do so in the Bill. The definition is in the working draft, which reflects our current thinking. It may be subject to change following the close of the stakeholder consultation tomorrow and our review of the responses. I ask the noble Earl to withdraw his amendment on the basis that we will include a definition of personal care in regulations, as indicated in the current working draft.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="1002234000087"></a>Amendment 32, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Best, raises several different issues. The first part of the amendment would require regulations to give local authorities the power to assess the suitability of an individual's home for independent living where they have been determined to be eligible to receive free personal care at home. Clearly, it is important that, while many people wish to stay in their homes for as long as possible, they should not be living in an inappropriate setting. We would expect councils to look at the impact that suitable alternative housing or adaptation would have on helping to keep people in their homes. We completely agree with the noble Lord about both the importance of housing and the necessity of including it in the assessment. We would expect local authorities to check whether there are any needs that could be helped by aids and adaptations or additional services when they carry out their community care assessment. That is one of the reasons why we include reablement in these proposals-to encourage councils  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_914"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column 914</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to think more broadly about the type and range of support that they should provide. The second part of the amendment refers to the need for personal care to include the provision of aids and adaptations. I think I mentioned our view on this in my previous remarks on this amendment. We agree with the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="1002234000088"></a>I turn now to Amendment 33. In the draft regulations, which we have made available to Peers, we have set out the eligibility criteria which we propose will determine who has the highest care needs and will qualify for free personal care. Our proposals require that, to be counted as having the highest needs, a person must first be within the Fair Access to Care "critical" band, and-as we have proposed and already discussed-need significant help when prompted to carry out four or more activities of daily living. The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, is rightly concerned that any assessment of a person's ability to carry out activities of daily living should be able to capture whether they have difficulty because they need prompting in addition to any physical difficulty that they have. I reassure the noble Baroness and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, who voiced their concerns on this matter, that, as part of our wider discussions with stakeholders, the regulations will need to cover supervision and prompting in relation to daily activities as part of the eligibility criteria.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="1002234000089"></a>Amendment 37 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, would insert a requirement for local authorities to ensure that staff have an "understanding of dementia" when delivering personal care to those with a dementia diagnosis. The noble Baroness and the House will know that the Government have already taken major steps to transform the quality of care for those with dementia through our strategy and through the start we have made in building on that strategy.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="1002234000090"></a>Section 15 of the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Act 2003, which the Bill amends, is about the free provision of services and not about particular types of service provision. The guidance accompanying the regulations enabled by the Bill will need to consider how local authorities may best ensure the delivery of free personal social care at home and ensure that it takes into account the Dementia Strategy. We think it is unsuitable to place this in the Bill, but we completely take on board the concern raised by the noble Baronesses, Lady Barker and Lady Greengross, on this issue. We are absolutely in sympathy with it.</p>

<a name="100222-0015.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="1002234000091"></a>Amendment 42 by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, inserts the definition of personal care into the Bill. As I have already said, the definition of personal care is included in the consultation document which is currently open for comment. We have been working with stakeholders to ensure that this definition is accurate and appropriate and meeting the Bill's aim of providing personal care to those with the highest needs. Following our analysis of that consultation we will look to amend the definition of personal care that we have set out in our working draft. However, we do not believe it is appropriate to put this in the Bill. We ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

For the 80 per cent of us who still read our local newspaper, they are not just a source of information and news about what is happening in our local community, a sounding board for local views and gossip and a public square for campaigns fought locally. A local newspaper is also a companion that walks with us down our street when we leave our home for work, the shops, the match or the pub. It arrives through the front door and lies around the house for the next seven days, like a next-door neighbour who is always ready for a cup of tea and a chat.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000004"></a>For those of us in local politics-maybe all politics is local-the local paper is the cornerstone of democracy. It offers a fairer report of real hand-to-hand politics that matters more to local people than ever do the less-read national papers, cut off and isolated as they are in the overall hothouse atmosphere of the Westminster village. I certainly owe my political career to my local newspapers during my three decades on Cheshire County Council, in the European Parliament and in the House of Lords. My only regret is that we in the Lords are seldom asked to write newsy columns for our local papers reporting the Lords, as once, as an MEP, I reported the European Parliament to my local electorate.</p>

<p><a name="1002226000005"></a>Britain's 1,300 local newspapers-an unsung national treasure-now face their own cycle of hatch, match and dispatch, so I introduce this afternoon's debate on their future. Claire Enders, an acknowledged industry analyst, suggests that half of those 1,300 titles may disappear in the next five years due to both cyclical and structural threats. Indeed, some 60 titles closed in 2009, although most were just free weeklies. The  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC194"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>precipitous fall in advertising, the expansion of the internet and online advertising, the increase in local councils publishing their own quasi-local papers, and finally the competition from local radio and TV, including the BBC's sometimes clumsy encroachment on traditional local newspaper territory, have all combined to undermine our local papers' future viability.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000006"></a>The Newspaper Society offers a more sanguine view, asserting that print readership has remained remarkably stable. It rightly points out that local newspapers will have a crucial role in encouraging digital Britain's development within the new, multimedia landscape. In this fast-changing panorama, do the Government have a role in not only promoting the independence, reliability and viability of local news, but also supporting and perhaps funding the traditional values of local and regional newspapers while encouraging fresh and innovative thinking on the role of the local press? The pivotal <I>Digital Britain </I>report published last June by my noble friend Lord Carter suggests that they have. I turn to the Government's role and obligations.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000007"></a>The <I>Digital Britain</I> review charts the accelerating and vertiginous 30 per cent fall in local advertising revenues since 2008 for our local papers. Given that advertising provides 80 per cent of those revenues, does my noble friend the Minister recognise the need to staunch the haemorrhaging of such traditional income while encouraging the discovery of new revenue streams? Will he give guidance, for instance, to local councils now producing in-house newspapers, financed by the council tax, which thereby undermine and undercut local newspapers? While local councils must communicate effectively with their electors, is my noble friend nevertheless alarmed when local council papers include not only factual information but regular news stories? They also siphon off valuable local advertising revenues from the private sector. Where do the Government draw the line?</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000008"></a>Secondly, will the Government continue to resist the repeated proposals to remove the current law obliging statutory notices to be posted in the local paper? Its abolition would imperil revenues, as well as depriving the local public of a trusted and familiar source for such notices. Local newspapers' advertising revenues have been further undermined by the downturn, and are unlikely to be restored in the upturn. For instance, local estate agents now typically pay only a tenth in fees to papers to advertise homes for sale. "For sale" signs are now found typically on the web, not in the paper.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000009"></a>Will the Government also ensure that their own advertising in the local media is maintained, given the unparalleled reach and trust that the public have in their local newspaper? Moreover, the Government should not neglect those of us older and less technologically adept, who are not part of the Gadarene rush to the web and the internet. We, too, have a right to be properly informed through the familiar channels.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000010"></a>Is my noble friend alarmed by the loss of experienced journalists, formerly embedded in the community, the closure of high-street offices, the indifferent salary structures and the redundant road blocks placed in the path of trainees eager to enter this vital profession? One local editor explained to me the distinct advantage of having his newspaper office visible in the high  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC195"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC195</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>street, as well as having most of his journalistic staff living on the patch that they report. Cutting down on local offices saves money but deprives good reporters of their vital contact with the news-giving public. The sad result of all this is the temptation to report by press release; it may save the expense of an experienced journalist but it impoverishes the trade of good journalism.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000011"></a>Will the Government cast a cold eye over the standards of training for entrance into the newspaper and media industry? Some university courses are perhaps less than adequate, and placements in local newspapers, which present the real learning curve for budding journalists, are drying up. Moreover, such placements are essential for trainee journalists to gain their seniority.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000012"></a>Is my noble friend satisfied that we are laying down firm foundations for the next generation of young journalists, who should be well trained, paid and motivated to face the sharp challenges of this fast-changing industry? Does he support the NUJ's call for direct support for such training opportunities, and will he note that the tight funding in our local public institutions also hampers local papers? Thus, overzealous centralising of magistrates' courts can stymie local newspapers' ability to report local cases. An important public function that they perform is not only that justice is done but that it is seen to be done in the local papers. Curtailing police resources presents similar problems and so it is, too, with local councils, which sometimes shovel off public functions to non-transparent subsidiaries. For example, the former open local housing committees are being replaced by closed housing associations. Will my noble friend attend to these unfortunate restrictions on local newspapers in performing their essential function of holding our public institutions to democratic account?</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000013"></a>On a wider canvas, it is clear that the interpretation of competition law has not kept up with the changing news media industry. While in the past the current competition law worked to prevent unhealthy monopolies, it is becoming clear that unless we widen the notion of competition to include other forms of news media it could result in some areas of Britain being deprived of a vibrant local newspaper. Bedworth, a town in the Midlands, already lacks a local paper and, indeed, its own local radio. The Government should redefine competition law to allow other forms of local news media to be considered as rival competitors, even if that means that a "one town, one paper" policy becomes the norm.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000014"></a>While we all revere the BBC, should we not ensure that its local reach does not smother the local paper? Indeed, do we not need some different business models, as suggested in the Digital Economy Bill? Those include, for example, developing teams of local journalists to sell on their local newsgathering to the appropriate local, regional and national outlets. In this model, the BBC might buy in such services rather than wastefully duplicating them. Alternatively, tax breaks might be offered to local papers to perform functions under a public interest remit.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000015"></a>Would the Government consider direct support to help establish new and genuinely local media organisations, including community trusts similar to the model developed  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC196"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC196</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by the Guardian Media Trust? Should not media organisations be required to sell on the names of titles that they close down to such community trusts for a nominal fee, and should not a levy be exacted from commercial operators that benefit from quality service content, including local news, but who have had no hand in its production?</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000016"></a>This is an important debate, especially as an election draws near, where it is vital that the public gain the very best information that they can about a local candidate. As I say, I am not always sure that the national media perform that function well as opposed to local journalists.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000017"></a>Each and every one of us here could pencil in our own lives by reflecting on the different local newspapers that we have had over the years. In my case, those were the <I>Oxford Mail and Times</I>, the <I>Coventry Evening Telegraph</I>, the <I>Brighton Argus</I>, the <I>Hanley Sentinel</I>, the <I>Manchester Evening News</I>, the <I>Chester Observer</I>, <I>Chester Chronicle </I>and <I>Chester Standard</I>, the <I>Wirral Globe</I> and <I>Wirral News</I>, and even the <I>Garstang Courier</I> and the <I>Lancashire Evening Post</I>.</p>

<p><a name="1002226000018"></a>I hope that this is a successful debate and I am very grateful to the other noble Lords who are participating, but I feel that we are Stendhal's happy few this afternoon. I wish that there were more of us to contribute to this important democratic debate.</p>

<p><a name="1002226000020"></a>We have seen such a reduction in the number of local papers over the past 50 years. In my own area, the weeklies then were the <I>Conwy Free Press</I>-that went many years ago-the <I>Llandudno Advertiser</I>, which others will perhaps remember, the <I>Llandudno Circular Press</I>, the <I>North Wales Pioneer</I> and the <I>North Wales Weekly News</I>. Those were the local papers that were a talking point at that time.

The <I>Western Mail </I>tended to be, and I think still is, largely a south and mid-Wales paper, so we relied on both evening papers: the <I>Manchester Evening News</I><I></I>and the <I>Liverpool Echo</I>.</p>

The <I>Liverpool E</I><I>cho</I> and the <I>Manchester Evening News</I> arrive a day late and, I believe-but I could be wrong-they sell very few copies. The Welsh edition of the <I>Daily Post</I> sells well, especially in Welsh-speaking areas. The whole scene for Welsh-language newspapers has changed.  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC197"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We have lost many of the weeklies, but we now have nearly 60 Welsh-language community papers throughout the whole of Wales: papurau bro. There are also some, not as extensive, English-language local community papers, all run by volunteers. They keep the local spirit alive. The Welsh Assembly Government fund Welsh and English local papers. The effective news and comment come from the <I>Daily Post</I> and the <I>North Wales Weekly News</I>, which are owned by Trinity Mirror. The <I>North Wales P</I><I>ioneer</I> is independently owned. There is no real competition to the two sold newspapers, one of which is daily and the other weekly.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000022"></a>The same is true in the rest of the United Kingdom. I believe that 80 local newspapers closed last year. Hundreds of journalists have lost their jobs, photographers have lost their contracts and the high street offices have closed. We have a debt to those companies that have kept the flag flying and their newspapers alive, but it can be dangerous to have only one local paper. If an extreme right-wing consortium took that paper over, it could be very bad news indeed, far worse than having to rely on Fox News and claiming that it gave us balanced news coverage.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000023"></a>In 1890, in the old Caernarvon Boroughs constituency, there were more than two local newspapers. That was the year of the by-election that returned Lloyd George to Westminster. If we had relied on Herald Newspapers of Castle Square, Caernarfon, we would have thought that Lloyd George was the Messiah. As a Liberal Democrat, I might say that he might well have been. According to the paper, his victory procession was composed of all the most upright, honest, sober and chapel-going young men. The Tories were very different. Songs were sung-I will not risk singing for the Committee:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002226000052"></a>"Hurrah! Hurrah! We're ready for the fray.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002226000053"></a>Hurrah! Hurrah! We'll drive Nanney away-</p>

<p><a name="1002226000050"></a>Ellis Jones Nanney-</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002226000054"></a>The grand young man will triumph,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002226000055"></a>Lloyd George will win the day,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002226000056"></a>Fight for the victory of Cambria".</p>

<p><a name="1002226000051"></a>Wonderful! It was not unbiased in any way at all. The <I>North Wales Chronicle</I>, based in Bangor, redressed the balance with a Conservative anthem, but I do not know the words.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000024"></a>If we had a monopoly of newspaper ownership, it would be a threat to democracy. The people who are able to help the weakest are those who have strength. Would relatively prosperous newspaper companies, such as Trinity Mirror, take a lead on this issue and encourage competition and having two viable newspapers serving a community?</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000025"></a>We know that this is a difficult time and a time of great change for the newspaper industry. We do not entirely rely on newspapers. We can choose not to buy a paper and to get all the news on the internet. I was astonished to learn of the decline in newspaper readership. Between April and September 2008, at the height of the American presidential election campaign, in the USA, there was an average decline in sales of 11 per cent and in some areas, it was as great as 22 per cent. In recent months, sales of the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I> declined by 25 per cent. The net is taking over.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000026"></a>However, like the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, I contend that local newspapers make an essential contribution by providing news of what happens in local communities. They are part of what holds a local community together. You can even attack the stories. I have often heard people say, "Have you seen what the front page of the <I>Pioneer</I> says this week?"; or "I don't agree with the editorial comment in the <I>North Wales Weekly News</I>". At least you can have a discussion. Very rarely do you hear people discussing what appears on the internet. The paper in our hand is vital.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000027"></a>Are local and regional newspapers tending to emulate the format of the red-top national newspapers? I am not sure that is welcome. No more do you get news of what the local Women's Institute is doing or where the Young Men's Christian Association went last week on a trip. For a number of years, I was a local councillor and, occasionally, a journalist used to attend our debates. How many smaller council chambers now have a journalist attending their debates? That is something of the past, so local news is neglected.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000028"></a>The Assembly Member Joyce Watson says that, in the late 1970s, the <I>Tenby Observer</I> was in difficulties. To save itself, it was renamed the <I>West Wales Observer</I>, reporting news from across the region. But that did not do the trick, so the Tindle group stepped in and stipulated that any story which did not mention Tenby was not to be printed; it had to be a local newspaper. The result was that over a number of years the sales have risen from 3,700 to more than 7,000. People want the local element.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000029"></a>Mention has been made of advertising revenue and how local council newspapers-freebies-are welcome, but how they use funds that could help to support local newspapers. We have to ask whether councils need to print their own newspapers.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000030"></a>It was put to me earlier that it is time to consider relaxing the regulations between the involvement of the printed media with, say, television and radio and other factors mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Harrison. That might provide local newspapers with the additional support they need.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000031"></a>Local and regional newspapers are vital for a thriving and democratic society. However, they need to be truly local, reflecting the life in their communities, as intended. Steps also need to be taken to ensure that there is true competition because I would hate to think of some of the right-wing organisations taking over one of the newspaper groups. That could be disastrous.</p>

I also remember my early years in local government and being terrified to see the chap sitting in the gallery watching and listening to every word and worrying that I would make a mess of my speech. That was a long time ago.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000033"></a>I do not wish to say too much about how important local and regional newspapers are, but they are an essential public service of which we should be proud and fiercely protective. At the moment, there is no doubt that local newspapers are in crisis. Many believe  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC199"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC199</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that they are in the greatest crisis that the industry has ever faced. It has been estimated by one of the most respected industry analysts that, at present, half the country's 1,300 local newspapers will be out of business within the next five years. That is an extremely concerning prediction. In many aspects, local newspapers are the bedrock of the media industry. Much journalistic investigation and news content is collected by local newspapers and filters up to national newspapers, to radio, to online newspapers and even to television and the BBC. It is very important that local papers have the chance to continue their great and valuable work. Furthermore, it is imperative for democracy and local accountability that local and regional newspapers survive.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000034"></a>However, due to severe commercial pressures, such as we have already heard today-for example, a decline in advertising revenues, reduced circulation, the emergence of online newssheets to name but a few-many papers have been forced to close altogether. Between January 2008 and July 2009 alone, 66 local newspapers were forced to close. But even where papers have not closed, their offices on the high street are being shut, the number of journalists employed is falling and the number of photographers, as we have heard, is no longer the same. Between July 2008 and September 2009, more than 900 journalists lost their jobs. Is the Minister concerned that the decline in journalist positions will lead to a decline in applicants and specialist journalists, which will lead to a decline in the standards of journalism overall? What are the Government doing to support local and regional newspapers so that they can keep standards high?</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000035"></a>In June 2009, the <I>Digital Britain</I> report acknowledged the negative impact on independent local newspapers of local authority newspapers. However, nothing concrete has been done to investigate this. Does the Minister agree that an investigation needs to begin so that solutions can be sought and enacted before more damage is done? When will the Audit Commission, Ofcom, the Office of Fair Trading, and the Government stop passing the buck and take some decisions? Does the Minister believe that newspapers produced by councils should have to be clearly distinguishable from commercial newspapers so that the public are not misled as to the independence of the reporting? Is the Minister concerned that if council-run papers replace their independent counterparts, it will lead to a less rigorous scrutiny of local officials at the price of democracy? Do the Government support council newspapers and have they any plans to tighten up the local authority publicity code?</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000036"></a>As I said earlier, it is tremendously important that we see the decline in local news companies as a very serious problem. Their influence is huge and their likely disappearance will have much more dire consequences than I think many appreciate. Like others, I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

I am glad that the importance of local media as regards local democracy and local representation was emphasised from all parts of the Committee. There is no doubt that local and regional newspapers lie at the heart of the democratic process. As my noble friend indicated, they are critical to the expression and the opportunities for the expression of views on behalf of the community.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000038"></a>I listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts. I am not too sure that the 21st century can quite replicate the circumstances which led to the emergence of Lloyd George in north Wales. But I understand entirely the way in which he has supported my noble friend Lord Harrison in emphasising the importance of the opportunity for expression from localities. It is not for us to comment on the other place in a significant way, but there is one matter on which I think we take public opinion with us and on which we can therefore speak assertively and with some real concern; namely, that a greater number of candidates for national positions as Members of Parliament should have local roots. There is a great danger in having a preponderance of people-I speak as one who may have been guilty of this-who are mobile and able to present themselves across the country. A substantial percentage of the House of Commons ought to be represented by those who come from their local communities and can best reflect their perspectives. That is at the heart of representation, and why the local media are important to the whole concept and health of our local democracy.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000039"></a>Of course the Government share the anxieties that have been identified this afternoon. We certainly made it clear in the <I>Digital Britain</I> White Paper that strong, diverse and viable news media are integral to our democratic life. A diminution of the regional and local press affects the choice and plurality of information sources and editorial opinion, as well as the people employed in the sector such as editors and journalists.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100222-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000040"></a>I accept the point made by my noble friend Lord Harrison, and reinforced by the noble Lord, Lord Luke, about journalists' training. There is no doubt, as we know, that a significant proportion of those who reach the high ranks in journalism in this country, particularly in political journalism, have done so through the ranks of local reporting, so there is concern that if those opportunities decline, the structure of training and the development of skills in journalism will also decline. I emphasise that the Government are concerned about this. There has been an inquiry into journalism skills and an expression of the need to examine those skills and how they should be nurtured. There is no doubt that this is an issue of real concern, and I am grateful to noble Lords who have emphasised the need in the case of the regional and local press.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000041"></a>The Publishing Skills Council carried out a skills survey last year that identified real gaps in training, which noble Lords have reflected in this debate. The skills sector has since produced an action plan that is now being implemented, so I can say that the Government have anticipated the concerns that have been reflected in this short debate and that action on the necessary training of journalists is in hand.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC201"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000042"></a>It is clear that there is real and significant pressure on local and regional newspapers at present. The decline in advertising and in circulation is real and urgent. There are two factors. We cannot disregard the recession and the fact that the decline in resources in our communities has an effect on the public's purchasing of newspapers as well as of other goods over which people have a choice. The downturn in the economy means that much less advertising is available to support newspapers. We know how important advertising is. We should not underestimate the concerns that are caused by the downturn in the economy, but we can look to the recovery from that, and we hope that local newspapers survive so that they can participate in that recovery.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000043"></a>My noble friend Lord Harrison emphasised the principle underlying cause in his opening contribution, and the noble Lords, Lord Roberts and Lord Luke, reflected it in their remarks: the growth of the internet and online advertising as a direct competitor to newspapers and the news media. I shall cite some statistics. The value of regional newspaper advertising fell from £2.8 billion to £2 billion between 2002 and 2008. At the same time, the value of internet advertising grew from £0.2 billion to £2.8 billion. That is a real competitive challenge, which is having a dramatic effect on newspapers and helps to explain a great number of difficulties that they face.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000044"></a>Nevertheless, many local and regional newspapers across the country continue to remain viable and to provide an essential service for their readers. Noble Lords have been kind enough in their contributions to reflect on their local press. I will not miss this opportunity to reflect that the <I>Oldham Chronicle</I> is an evening daily that has been going for over 150 years. I attest to the obvious fact made by other noble Lords that, were an organ of such significance to go, so would a crucial linchpin of local democracy and community. Fortunately, despite its financial difficulties, the <I>Chronicle </I>is presently still printing each weekday.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000045"></a>There have also been amalgamations. We note that Trinity Mirror has announced that three of its west London titles are to be distributed free, extending their reach to far more homes than their current, paid-for editions. Noble Lords implied that it is all right for big companies to sustain free editions and that this shows that the market has declined for paid newspapers across the country. However, these are important initiatives in the areas they are viable, where the advertising is significant and the group is big enough to sustain the position to extend a local newspaper.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000046"></a>We have been concerned to take certain steps in what is a genuine problem with local and regional news media. We are concerned about opportunities to introduce local and regional news consortia that can deliver an innovative and multi-platform news offering. That is clearly going to need some support, which is why the Government have identified the underspend on digital switchover of the BBC licence money. It is important that these consortia provide effective, accurate and dispassionate local news in their areas. There is no doubt that otherwise the pressures could prove so great that some areas would be devoid of that service.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000047"></a>We are also inviting the Office of Fair Trading to examine whether the media merger rules and market  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC202"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>definitions properly reflect the current state of converged media. The OFT has amended its guidance to ensure improved synergies between itself and Ofcom in their approach to media markets. We are concerned with increasing Ofcom's sensitivity to the challenges to the industry. We are bringing forward at the earliest opportunity proposals to address media ownership rules. These proposals, which will of course be subject to scrutiny by both Houses, follow Ofcom's review last November. The noble Lord, Lord Luke, emphasised this point, raised also by my noble friend Lord Harrison. We are looking at the Audit Commission's recent review of local authority publicity and how the Government's code of recommended practice on local authority publicity might be amended. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the DCMS, on whose behalf I am speaking at this Dispatch Box today, has written to his counterpart in the Department of Communities and Local Government, drawing his attention to this important question.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000048"></a>I do not want to exaggerate the issue. None of us would deny the right of local authorities to communicate effectively with their local communities on the services they provide. However, when these perhaps stray into more tendentious comment and are sustained by advertising which, as the noble Lord, Lord Luke, hinted, might otherwise be available to local news media, then an element of unfair competition might come in. We are concerned about the relatively small number of cases. The number of local authorities where the line has been overstepped is not much more than a handful. We are asking the Secretary of State with responsibility for local government to look at practice and to evaluate the position against this changing situation. I have no doubt that if emendations are effected, local authorities will pay due regard to any changes in advice.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1002226000049"></a>As is his wont, my noble friend Lord Harrison has raised an enormously important issue. A debate of this short duration and limited participation can scarcely do justice to a linchpin of local democracy. However, I emphasise that the Government are fully seized of the financial and economic challenge to local and regional press. It is important that action is taken to sustain local news as effectively as we can. None of us has any doubts that this is the basis of effective participation in local democracy and local interest, and is at the heart of the greater democracy represented by Parliament. That is why we need to cherish the grass roots of our democracy. I am grateful to my noble friend for having introduced this important debate.</p>

<p><a name="1002229000001"></a><b><a name="100222-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="1002229000029"></a>Lord Carlile of Berriew:</b> My Lords, I declare an interest as president of the Howard League for Penal Reform. I welcome the opportunity today to debate the report from the Howard League's Commission on English Prisons. I look forward to a constructive reply by the Minister and am grateful to the distinguished noble Lords who have put down their names to speak in this debate.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000002"></a>The commission was an independent review of the prisons crisis by some of the country's leading experts and practitioners who were asked to look radically at the purpose and limits of our penal system early in the 21st Century. The final report, <I>Do Better D</I><I>o </I><I>L</I><I>ess</I>, was published last July. Key ideas in the report, such as introducing a model of localism in the criminal justice system and advocating the concept of justice reinvestment -to which I will return later-have been echoed in subsequent reports by the All-party Parliamentary Group on Local Government and a recent report from the Justice Select Committee entitled, <I>Cutting </I><I>C</I><I>rime: </I><I>T</I><I>he </I><I>C</I><I>ase for </I><I>J</I><I>ustice </I><I>R</I><I>einvestment</I>.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000003"></a>The time is now ripe for urgent reform. In summary, the report advocates a new approach of penal moderation and fundamental reform. One headline is a significant reduction in the prison population and the closure of establishments. Another is localisation, of which more later. Thirdly, there is the replacement of short prison sentences, which achieve little if anything, with community-based responses. Fourthly, there is the dismantling of NOMS, including the break-up of the centrally managed prison service, save for retaining some centralisation for the most serious and dangerous offenders.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000004"></a>The commission's signal contribution to the debate was to link the penal crisis in our prisons to wider economic conditions and requirements. This was not new, but it re-emphasised that radical reform of the prison system can provide value for money-and save money. With prison numbers almost doubling in the past 15 years, it is fair to say that the imprisonment industry has been booming. Yet, as with many bad businesses, booming turnover has been accompanied by a bust in profit. Our prisons, groaning under the weight of more men, women and children than ever before, are simply unfit for purpose, particularly in being able to achieve any goals other than containment.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000005"></a>The commission identified that the need to reduce public spending over the coming years brought with it an opportunity to inject some sanity, permanence and stability into the penal system. The message at the heart of the commission's report is in its title: <I>Do</I><I> Better Do Less</I>. Instead of more legislative hyperactivity in the field of criminal justice and ramping up ever higher the use of costly imprisonment, the commission argued with force for a principle of moderation.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000006"></a>At the core was some well founded research, for plenty of information is available abroad. In its visits to other countries, the commission found that it was entirely realistic to have less crime, safer communities and fewer people in prisons. Surely that is the formula that we should adopt, yet here we are, bumping along towards 85,000 in prison, a figure that will increase as a result of the announcement, which I understand has already been made in another place today, that the early release scheme is to cease in March.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000007"></a>Germany, with 20 million more people than the United Kingdom, jails around 72,000 people, France only 64,000. Yet in both those countries campaigners say that there are too many in jail and call for reform. Are the English and Welsh really any more criminal or likely victims of crime than the French and Germans and our other neighbours? Why do we feel the need to imprison so many more people and what does it achieve?</p>

<p><a name="1002229000008"></a>Worse still than the sheer numbers, the prisons have become warehouses for dumping people with problems that should have been dealt with elsewhere. I would highlight the number of mentally ill people in prison, practically none of whom are dealt with in the way in which they would be in the community, were they to go through conventional clinical systems. In an overcrowded and overwhelmed prison system, those people will never get the help that they need to move on beyond the ever-revolving door. Reoffending rates speak for themselves; for young people leaving prison, the rates rise as high as 75 per cent.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000009"></a>The commission espouses the vision of less crime, safer communities and fewer people in prison. The real key to that lies in the communities approach. The commission advocated a more localised criminal justice system, particularly for communities where crime is of most concern and the public simply do not understand why things are as bad as they perceive them to be. The commission's report advocates devolving criminal justice spending and giving local authorities in partnership with the police the lead role in the fight against crime. It argues that localism should lead to less money spent on process and more on actions, which produce beneficial outcomes for the whole community. What is missing, among other things, is a sense that the public and those elected to represent them have any local ownership of the criminal justice system, a feeling that would be especially useful in producing effective restorative justice.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000010"></a>A more responsive devolved system would allow local areas to shift resources smoothly from funding prison places to funding community needs. That is what is described as justice reinvestment, a concept that has come from the United States of America. Some states were unable to balance their budgets because of the very extensive use of prison. Those budgetary crises opened legislators to cross party lines and share together new ideas. They mapped neighbourhoods to prison populations, and as a result experts were able to identify what have been called "million-dollar blocks", so called because it costs $1 million a year to incarcerate a high proportion of the block's inhabitants. The question that justice reinvestment asks is why we should not spend that $1 million not on prisons but on the area. In states that are pioneering justice reinvestment initiatives, that means reducing the use of prison and closing jails to free up funding so that it can be spent on dealing with the underlying causes of crime in these neighbourhoods. The Government have shown enthusiasm for the community court initiative in Liverpool-and I am delighted to see the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool in this Committee. It has proved to be very successful. The same can occur if they show similar enthusiasm for localisation of imprisonment.</p>

<p><a name="1002229000011"></a>Justice reinvestment is not about alternatives just within the criminal justice system; it is about making partnerships within and outside the criminal justice system. It recognises that the criminal justice system as we have it can be a very blunt instrument, and nowhere is that felt with more frustration than by judges and magistrates as they send people to jail and know that they will be back again, certainly in magistrates' courts in city centres, probably within a few weeks.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000012"></a>Justice reinvestment, as advocated by the report, also enables localities to tackle issues of education and training, poor mental health and better public amenities, even stairwells, playgrounds and safe places for young people to hang out. Justice reinvestment, as advocated by the Howard League commission, advocates new local strategic partnerships and involves trusting local authorities and communities with responsibility but, I would argue, trusting them with the responsibilities and opportunities that they are best at. Thus, prison and probation budgets would be devolved to their control, giving them funds for justice reinvestment initiatives. If pilot projects were created, as has happened in the United States, I can see no argument contrary to the view that we would see benefit. I urge the Government, and the Minister in his response, to recognise that this report has made a useful and constructive contribution to the debate and that not to adopt it, at least on a test basis, would be an act of neglect.</p>

It is extremely valuable and worthy of a discussion at least as long as the one we will have.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000014"></a>I shall deal with the point mentioned in paragraph 1.14. The page is headed "Wales" and has a green paragraph about Wales, but I do not see much connection between that paragraph and what happens later. It may be a compliment to the president to do it that way, but I am not sure. The point is about the terrific increase there has been in the number of 10 to 14 year-old children in custody in the period studied: 1996 to 2006. There has been a 550 per cent increase in the number of children in custody in that time. That is a very sad and extraordinary situation and, like the report as a whole, it requires urgent attention from Her Majesty's Government. The independent president of the commission was the president of Barnardo's during part of her time at the commission. I am a member of Barnardo's, and my wife was on the council for a considerable number of years, although she retired a considerable number of years ago. I take an interest in what Barnardo's says. As your Lordships will know, the chief executive of Barnardo's is Martin Narey. He was a senior official at the Home Office, and therefore speaks with a great deal of authority.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000015"></a>Over the period referred to, the number of 10 to 14 year-olds in custody increased by 550 per cent. The principal reason for that is that the detention order, which was introduced in the Bill of, I think, 2000, has greatly opened the possibility of custody for young children and not for serious offences only. For example,  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC206"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>you can find yourself in custody for failing to turn up at the times fixed by the board for interviews. The cost of keeping a young person of this order in custody rises up to about £185,780 per annum. As someone remarked, you could have a student at Eton College for six years for that amount, and I humbly believe that, notwithstanding the criticisms that have been made of that venerable institution, the benefits of being there are probably rather greater than those of being in Her Majesty's custody for a year.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000016"></a>The answer to this question is quite difficult, but the majority of young people in this position have been in the care of the local authority or under the charge of the social services, so people who have already been failed by the system are being failed again, at great cost to the nation. The sooner this stops, the better.</p>

I have only two locus standi for being here. First, I chair my party's working group on localism and how to decentralise Britain. Secondly, I was involved in the Offender Management Bill some years ago, and spent some time talking to people in prisons and probation services around Yorkshire on what the Bill would mean for the prison system. I became less and less convinced of the case for NOMS as we went through the Bill, and more and more sceptical of the entire ideology of new public management.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000018"></a>I viewed with immense enthusiasm a quotation from Geoff Mulgan, of all people, in this report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002229000023"></a>"There were never any serious theoretical, empirical or popular arguments in favour of centralisation ... overcentralisation tends to be associated with poorer performance, and decentralisation with better performance".</p>

<p><a name="1002229000022"></a>That is one of the more important messages of this report.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000019"></a>The other important message is that giving way to what the report calls "penal populism", and which I would call the clamour of the <I>Daily Mail</I> simply to lock people up and forget about them, leads to greater expenditure and worse outcomes. I note that the United Kingdom now has the highest spending on law and order in the entire OECD-a point to consider when we think about future cuts in spending. Social care is cheaper; probation is cheaper. Above all, local management not only is cheaper but has much more effective outcomes. Many of us have seen local magistrates' courts being knocked down and moved away from towns to region centres.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000020"></a>The whole process of justice and social care is becoming less and less local, and it is now quite evident that we need to localise justice, offender management and looking after those who have started in care and are likely to go on being in care until they enter the prison system. I met a number of people in Leeds prison who were called POPOs-prolific and persistent offenders whom the prison officers assured me they had seen before and expected to see again and who would go on being recycled through the prison system until, in their mid to late 30s, they would finally grow out of it. I was also shocked to discover how much prisoners were moved around the system out of

They lost touch with their families and were therefore likely to come out of prison without the framework that they needed to prevent reoffending.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="1002229000021"></a>I strongly support the report. I particularly support the whole idea that the offender must be seen not just as an individual but as a member of a community, and must be encouraged to go back into that community. That community also needs to be involved in the whole process. Liverpool has been mentioned. I should also mention Chard in Somerset, in which the Liberal Democrat-led council has done a great deal to experiment usefully with restorative justice. That seems to all of us to be the way forward. We welcome the report. Sadly, we also welcome its condemnation of one of the greatest failures of new Labour over the past 12 years.</p>

You looked up all the recommendations that had been made, what had happened to them, and why, after all those other reports-there were usually a dozen-you still had to do the same thing.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000003"></a>The first thing I opened was the bibliography. I looked in vain for two documents which I very much hoped would be there: one was the wonderful report on the riots in Strangeways Prison and 23 other prisons, written by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, in 1991, and the other was a White Paper, <I>Custody, Care and Justice</I>, agreed to by all political parties, which took the Prison Service into the 21st century, based on a real crisis. I looked for those documents because there were 12 objectives in that report with which, at the time, everyone agreed. I shall quote four of them: to end overcrowding; to improve co-operation with other services and institutions by working closely with the probation service and by membership of a national forum and area committees; to increase delegation of responsibility and accountability to all levels with clear leadership and a published annual statement of objectives; and to develop community prisons which will involve the gradual realignment of the prison estate into geographically coherent groups, serving most prisoners within that area.</p>

I welcome the four ideas, including the significant reduction in the prison

<p><a name="1002231000005"></a>Three weeks ago, I was in Libya advising the Libyans to do exactly the same thing. The Libyans have now gone further than we have as a result of our advice based on this document. To the dismantling of the National Offender Management Service I say, "Hear, hear"; it is a monster and it is a bureaucratic disaster. However, I have one problem with the break-up: it is about to appoint a new chief executive. It is very dangerous to appoint a new chief executive to an organisation which has clearly failed without being quite clear what that chief executive is to do, particularly as the Conservative Party has already announced that it intends to do something about NOMS as well. That is another matter.</p>

The Commission on English Prisons Today offers us detailed statistics, robust analysis and radical recommendations. In my visits to prisons, bail hostels and community sentencing programmes as bishop for prisons, I often hear people echoing what is in this report. Why, then, is this not already public policy? We know that prison has the threefold function of punishment, protection and reformation but unfortunately we allow the media focus on punishment to distort our public policy. The punitive element seems to obscure every other aspect. As this commission demonstrates, we are left with a criminal justice system that is financially wasteful, educationally ineffectual and socially negative. In other words, a better system, as proposed here, would save public money through greater and better community sentencing, reduce reoffending with local programmes on restorative justice and enhance social stability through local, strategic interventions. These are the messages that all of us concerned with community justice need to get out through the media and bring to bear on public policy.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000008"></a>It is extraordinary that millions of pounds can be found to build more prison places, while budgets are squeezed and purposeful activity in prison is reduced. We are putting more and more damaged people into prison regimes that are less and less restorative. That is not a recipe for a stable society, let alone a humane one. This is not about being soft on crime. It is about understanding why and how people get into crime, and why and how they get out of it.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000009"></a>In the faith sector, huge independent and voluntary resources are already being deployed in the rehabilitation of offenders. They would have a key role to play in the commission's proposal for local strategic partnerships. But if we look at interventions to prevent criminal behaviour, we cannot ignore the role of the family. On listening to prisoners, I am constantly struck by how much of their behaviour can be traced back to parental neglect and family dysfunction. We need bold, new initiatives that will target the hard-to-reach parents.</p>

This is a government initiative and a government success on which they should be congratulated. However, when you ask why this approach cannot be adopted everywhere, the same issue-that of money-arises. Surely, as this commission suggests, it is profligate spending to build prisons and to incarcerate at huge public expense, when you could spend less money by diverting from prison those who could be punished and rehabilitated in other ways.</p>

But I thank him for doing so, because it is something he might not have done. It has provided us with an occasion on which to discuss this extraordinary and important report, although I recognise what the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has said about it being, in a sense, an echo of something that has been said previously. However, it is said in a different voice and has a different scale of detail. It lays much more emphasis on the most important aspect of this issue; namely, the role of the community.</p>

<p><a name="1002231000012"></a>Seeing a right reverend Prelate behind me tempts me to say that when God asked Cain where his brother was, Cain said, "Am I my brother's keeper?". The answer should certainly have been yes, because that is the basis of community. People are built by their homes-we have heard references to failed parents-and by the communities in which they live. They should be able to be safe in their streets, to know each other and to look out for each other's children. That is the basic pillar on which society rests.</p>

<p><a name="1002231000013"></a>When someone gets damaged and is not supported by the system, they are taken out of their community, put into a prison miles away and then shunted around. The answer to this is to localise the prison service and its management; to stabilise and reduce its population; and to have recourse to the community to pick up the results and make a far better answer of it.</p>

<p><a name="1002231000014"></a>Page 145 of the House of Commons Justice Committee report refers to the experiment in the Deschutes County of Oregon, USA. The experiment devolved the management of youth offenders, excluding violent offenders, to the local authority and, to a certain extent, delegated the funding thereof. The report only summarises the statistical findings. The detail can be found on an Oregon website. The cost of incarceration by the county per day was greater than that provided by the state-$202 a day as opposed to $166. But the average length of stay in the correctional facility was 4.4 months, as opposed to 8.3 months. Therefore, it costs a good deal less. The cost of aftercare/parole was $62 a day, as against $20 when administered by the state, so it cost a great deal more. The average stay in aftercare/parole was 11.5 months, as opposed to 14 months-so, again, the cost was much less. The total cost per case was $48,396 when locally done, and $65,866 when done state-wide. The approximate saving

If you add into it all the localism in this report, you will have a fantastically improved system.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000016"></a>The report shows that our policies on imprisonment over the past 30 years have been laced with inconsistencies and misconceptions. The central irony is that while crime that is recorded by the British Crime Survey has fallen by 45 per cent in the past 15 years, the prison population has gone in exactly the opposite direction, more than doubling between 1992 and the present year. That is a very sobering central irony in the whole situation.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000017"></a>Parallel with this development, and certainly not unassociated with it, is the fact that Her Majesty's Government have, in each of the past 13 years, added on average 100 brand new offences that carry a custodial sanction: that is, something in the order of 1,400 offences in the past 13 years. Since 1997, Parliament has passed no less than 23 criminal justice Acts. It is worth noting that between 1925 and 1985-a period of 60 years that included a world war and all the disruption of its aftermath-only six criminal justice Acts were regarded as necessary: one every 10 years.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000018"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, and others have mentioned, we incarcerate 153 persons per 100,000. That is more than any other country in western Europe bar Spain, which has a figure of 160, and Luxembourg, for some reason-presumably because of the number of banks that it has every acre-which has a figure in the order of 155. We incarcerate 60 per cent more people per hundred thousand than France, Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Irish Republic. I ask the same question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile: are we 60 per cent more wicked, more criminally disposed, than the people of those countries, or is there another reason? I believe clearly that there is. There is mass hysteria in the community about imprisonment that has been brought about by successive Governments, who have led people to believe that you can wave a magic wand and that crime will simply disappear.</p>

<p><a name="1002231000019"></a>Opposition parties have shown that that is wrong, as they are entitled to do, but have given the impression that the Government of the day are presiding over a mounting crime wave. That is not the case. The ordinary citizen could certainly be excused for believing that we were going headlong down the path to disaster in relation to crime. Tabloid editors have predictably seen it to be to their profit to perpetuate these myths. Yet, for all the hysteria, the system has failed. Nothing shows that so remarkably clearly as this report. The system has failed to reform or assuage public fears, and in every respect. The statistic of two-thirds of persons being reconvicted within two years clearly shows that.</p>

<p><a name="1002231000020"></a>There is an alternative, as shown in this report. The situation calls for change not only in policy but also in the psychology of the whole community. It is possible to reduce the prison population in a sensible and safe way. It has been done before. Between 1908 and 1939, the prison population was halved. That was done by long-sighted people with vision and resolution. It is exactly what has to be attempted now. Whichever public leader stands up and advocates this policy will be traduced and vilified. He will be said to be a namby-pamby, starry-eyed romantic-but he will be sane. He will be putting forward a better idea and vision than what we have today in our brainwashed society in relation to imprisonment.</p>

<p><a name="1002231000024"></a>A survey by the Muslim Youth Helpline highlighted that 63 per cent of reoffenders felt that they did not have the help they needed upon leaving prison. Some 82 per cent stated that faith-based support networks in the community would have prevented them returning to crime. It is therefore important to encourage and increase the number of prison volunteers from all faiths, while recognising that there is an important role to be played by religious leaders in our communities. Does the Minister agree that a greater emphasis should be placed on helping communities to develop faith-based projects that specifically target offenders?</p>

<p><a name="1002231000025"></a>The commission's research shows that between 2004 and 2008 the number of foreign national prisoners rose by 29 per cent. I believe that those who enter our country and breach our laws have lost their right to a place in all areas of British society. We should therefore

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000026"></a>There is a correlation between overcrowded prisons and the number of inmates who are committing suicide. This tragic state of affairs calls for greater attention concerning the mental health of inmates as well as their overall well-being. Prison is a deplorable sanction for young people, and should be reserved for only the most serious youth offenders. This view reiterates the ardent belief that child welfare is paramount to reducing youth crime and curbing reoffending rates. Our justice system should be fundamentally based on the principles of enforcing punishment and educating prisoners. Investments made in crime prevention measures will pay dividends in efforts to counter reoffending.</p>

I have never been attracted by the sort of sentencing policy that tests the machismo of the current Government. Rather, I regard a willingness to work at the harder options-community-based responses are not a soft option, if properly structured-as a test of a community's dignity. We must not underestimate the need to win the hearts and minds of the community, nor the difficulty of that task. Community-based responses need to be accepted.</p>

<p><a name="1002231000028"></a>This morning, in a local shop, I overheard a discussion about a number of burglaries that had taken place locally, where someone commented: "Lock 'em all up, that's what I say". That is an instinctive reaction from both a victim and a potential victim. As the report says,</p>
<ul><a name="1002231000217"></a>"once the punitive genie is out of the bottle, it is not easily put back".</ul>
<p><a name="1002231000195"></a>The report refers to a characteristic of a more,</p>
<ul><a name="1002231000218"></a>"moderate approach to penal policy",</ul>
<p><a name="1002231000196"></a>being,</p>
<ul><a name="1002231000219"></a>"a mass media relatively uninterested in crime and punishment".</ul>
<p><a name="1002231000197"></a>That could not be said of the media in this country; they carry a heavy responsibility, and the right reverend Prelate's term "distortion" was a temperate one.</p>

<p><a name="1002231000029"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Wallace for covering the issue of localism. I hope that stronger local partnerships are ideas whose time has come; they have been bubbling up for a little while, with other organisations looking at the same issues. We know that the risk of reoffending is much reduced by stable housing, employment, drug treatment planning and programming and family and local contacts-all things that are the very stuff of local partnerships. Education and training are vital; an offender needs skills to go straight. Partnership work between business and prisons or other penal schemes can help to achieve purposeful activity. I have one specific question for the Minister; do the Government recognise all this as an appropriate component in the Total Place work that is now being carried out, up and down the country, and is sponsored by the DCLG?</p>

<p><a name="1002231000030"></a>The report also mentions prisons built under the public-private finance initiative, an issue presently being considered by your Lordships' Economic Affairs Committee. A good privately financed prison should be not just about bricks and mortar but also about facilitating a modern, productive regime through the bundling of building and services.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000031"></a>I was also interested in the report's references to New York City being,</p>
<ul><a name="1002231000220"></a>"in the midst of national mass incarceration",</ul>
<p><a name="1002231000198"></a>but it has reduced crime and the prison population. I wonder whether that goes with the broken windows approach of tackling crime at the lowest level to seek to stop it escalating. That was pioneered in New York. </p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000032"></a>I congratulate the Howard League. If prison does not work, then more of the same will not work either. I believe that the report has identified and described what is far more likely to work.</p>
<h5><a name="1002231000236"></a>5.16 pm</h5>

<p><a name="1002231000033"></a><b><a name="100222-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="1002231000261"></a>Lord Henley:</b> My Lords, like my noble friend Lord Elton, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, for giving us the opportunity to debate the Howard League report. Sadly, we have only four minutes each to speak and only an hour for the whole debate. Perhaps the usual channels would consider a fuller debate on this matter in due course. We will also be debating some of these matters later in the Chamber, when the Minister repeats his Statement on prisoners' early release. At this stage, we are debating a much broader strategy about prisons and, on that occasion, we should be able to listen to what the Government are doing or claim they are doing.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000034"></a>In the time available, I shall not set out the entire opposition policy on prisons, which was set out very ably by my honourable friends in another place in their report of last year, <I>Prisons with a Purpose</I>. I commend that to the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, and others and I hope that they will look at it. In the title of that document, <I>Prisons with a Purpose</I>, my honourable friends made it clear what they thought prisons ought to do: for example, that people should emerge from prisons in a better state than when they went in. One of the problems, which will be addressed in the Statement later, is gross overcrowding within the prison system, which makes it is very difficult for prisons to achieve much in the way of improving the lives of prisoners and making them more fit to face society when they are released.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000035"></a>Our brief debate has been very useful and a great many ideas have been put forward by all who have spoken. My noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern was quite right to highlight the dramatic increase in the number of 10 to 14 year-olds in custody. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, was also right to draw attention to the problems of NOMS, with which virtually everyone who has spoken in the debate would agree. The Minister will have to address the defence of NOMS when he replies, if he can.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000036"></a>We would agree with the vast majority of the report's recommendations and the general direction that it takes. It is an excellent report. However, in some respects it is perhaps a little optimistic in that it goes further than we would as regards closing prisons. We are in a very strange state where the Government are

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000037"></a>We offer broad support for the report, while being careful to state that implementation would be possible only when resources allowed. Some speakers referred to the very severe constraints as a result of our current economic position-I think particularly of my noble friend Lord Elton, who referred to the Oregon experiment with localism, to which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, also referred. That is a way of looking at things in other ways, which might lead to a reduction in the costs that this will impose on the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000038"></a>I welcome the chance that we have had to debate these matters briefly, and look forward to the Government's response.</p>
<h5><a name="1002231000237"></a>5.20 pm</h5>

<p><a name="1002231000039"></a><b><a name="100222-gc0003.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="1002231000262"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My Lords, I start by paying tribute to the Howard League for Penal Reform and to its president, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile. I thank the Howard League for the chance to discuss the important and radical report that it produced last summer and the noble Lord for introducing the debate. I also thank all other noble Lords who have spoken.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000040"></a>We very much welcome the contribution that the report has made to a continuing debate, although we do not of course agree with all its conclusions. The report argues for "penal moderation". The Government agree that the use of prison must be effectively targeted, but we are in no doubt about the important role that prison continues play in delivering a fair and just society for victims of crime, the general public and communities. Prison remains the right option for dangerous, serious and the most seriously persistent offenders. To that end, we have increased prison capacity by more than 25,000 places since 1997, and are committed to increasing net capacity to 96,000 places by 2014, following the report of my noble friend Lord Carter. We will always make sure that there are enough prison places for those the courts sentence to custody or place on remand, and we make no apology for that. Resource spending on prisons was 42 per cent higher in real terms in 2007-08 than was the case in 1996-97.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000041"></a>One consequence of providing that additional capacity is that we can now withdraw the end of the custody licence scheme, as my right honourable friend the Justice Secretary told the other place earlier today and as we will discuss later. That scheme was introduced in 2007 as a temporary measure to ease pressures on the prison population, and we now have sufficient headroom in the estate to withdraw the scheme. We have always made it clear that the scheme would be temporary and it is right that we have ended it as soon as it was safe to do so. However, we do not believe that the Government are engaged in unthinking "hyperactivity", as the report and some noble Lords have alleged. We are thinking through carefully the establishment of this new capacity, with a close eye on the needs of offenders. The new prisons, each of around 1,500 places, that were announced a few months ago, will be built in areas where places  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC215"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are most needed. That will ensure that prisoners can be held closer to home and will reduce the number of times an offender is transferred between establishments, which we know disrupts rehabilitative and educational programmes. We have increased investment in education provision, which is a critical part of rehabilitation, from £57 million in 2001-02 to more than £175 million in 2009-10. In 2008-09, nearly 38 per cent of offenders entered employment, training and education on release, and the figure into this year shows continuing increases each month.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000042"></a>We are also committed to providing alcohol and drug treatment for offenders in prison. The Committee will know that since 1996-97 funding for prison drug treatment has increased 15-fold with the introduction of the integrated drug treatment system, in particular. We are working with the third sector and the private sector further to improve the drug treatment framework available to offenders, as well as strengthening the continuity of support between prisons and the community. We have also done good work on alcohol offending.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000043"></a>In our view, prison remains a key, valuable and necessary element in our criminal justice system, but the Government agree that less serious offenders can often be better dealt with in the community. Therefore, we have programmes in place to divert offenders from custody when appropriate, including vulnerable women offenders. The female prison population decreased by 5 per cent between June 2008 and June 2009. Following the report by my noble friend Lady Corston, we committed to reduce the women's prison estate by 400 places by March 2012. We are providing £15.6 million of new funding over two years to provide additional services in the community for women offenders who are not a danger to the public and for women at risk of offending.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000044"></a>We are also committed to action on diverting offenders with mental health needs, where that is appropriate. In response to the Bradley report, we published a national health and criminal justice delivery plan in November last year. We are committed to develop those policies further. Offenders with mental health needs and vulnerable women are not the only groups where we have seen the population falling or where we are putting into place measures to reduce the population. We have seen a decline of more than 600 in the population of under-18s in custody in the past 16 months.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000045"></a>We cannot be accused of treating prison as the be-all and end-all of the criminal justice system. We have ensured that the courts can use tough community punishments in place of short custodial sentences where doing so is justified and proportionate. Community sentences allow for direct payback to the community, while interventions that help offenders tackle the causes of their behaviour are provided. These sentences are enforced rigorously, with more than 90 per cent of offenders who fail to comply returned to court.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000046"></a>Within this broader approach to the promotion of community sentences, we are doing some important focused work on seven intensive alternatives to custody pilot projects currently under way around the country. They are targeted at offenders who would otherwise receive short custodial sentences. Nearly 1,000 offenders

The projects have developed innovative partnerships with the police and the third and private sectors to give offenders opportunities to turn their lives around or face swift and tough sanctions. The projects, which are being evaluated, have engaged with the courts to build sentencer confidence in intensive community orders as a robust, demanding and effective alternative to short-term custody.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000047"></a>The commission argues that local communities should have a role in managing offenders, and we agree. We introduced community payback, enabling the public to have a say in what unpaid work offenders carry out in the local community. Local agencies must work together to tackle what is a shared problem, to reduce the social and financial costs of offending and to improve life for local communities. The integrated offender management model, local commissioning and the introduction of probation trusts increase the scope for local flexibility and innovation. Crime and disorder reduction partnerships, working within local community justice boards, play a key role in reducing re-offending, bringing together and co-ordinating the actions of housing providers, health services, local authorities and other key players. Restorative justice has the potential to be an important part of community engagement, and we are moving actively towards a culture of more visible justice with a stronger focus on encouraging offenders to be more directly accountable to communities. We have also seen restorative justice being used in a pioneering way in the youth justice system.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000048"></a>If I had time, I would talk about the justice reinvestment programme in the United States. We have the Diamond Initiative programme in London, which we believe shows real promise. I do not have time to go into that today.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000049"></a>Moving on from the use of prison and community sentences to the institutional framework, it will not surprise the Committee that we do not agree that NOMS should be abolished. The recent reorganisation means that the prison and probation services are working together more closely than ever before.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000050"></a>If there are any questions that I have not answered- I am conscious that I have not answered all of them- I will write to noble Lords with answers.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000051"></a>I finish, first, by reminding the Committee that crime has dropped by more than a third and that the chance of being a victim of crime is at an historic low-these are important considerations; and, secondly, by reiterating our thanks to the commission, to the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, and to all who have contributed to such an important and thought-provoking report and debate.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002231000207"></a>"Iranian society is a successful model of brotherly and amicable coexistence".</p>

<p><a name="1002231000199"></a>He was almost alone at the meeting in believing this. Here is what others said. The French ambassador, Jean-Baptiste Mattei, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002231000208"></a>"The authorities are waging bloody repression against their own people, who are peacefully claiming their rights ... France recommends that Iran accepts the creation of a credible and independent international inquiry mechanism to shed light on these violations".</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000053"></a>The United States and Britain called on Iran to open up visits by the UN investigator into torture, as well as by other human rights experts who have been barred from the country since 2005.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002231000209"></a>"Grave human rights violations continue to be committed",</p>

<p><a name="1002231000200"></a>said the British ambassador, Peter Gooderham.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000054"></a>Mr Michael Posner, the US assistant secretary for democracy and human rights, said that Washington,</p>
<ul><a name="1002231000221"></a>"strongly condemns the recent violent and unjust suppression of innocent Iranian citizens".</ul>
<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000055"></a>Western nations said collectively at that meeting of the Human Rights Council that they wanted to see a halt in the execution of child offenders, in the disproportionate use of the death penalty against political opponents, in violence against women, in discrimination, and in the clampdown on free speech.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000056"></a>The facts deny Mr Larijani's claim, and the appalling human rights record of the mullahs' regime has been condemned by the United Nations on 57 separate occasions. His country hangs more people than all the other countries put together that still use capital punishment, except China. Since the 1979 revolution, more than 120,000 political prisoners have been executed and 600,000 tortured. Officially allowed torture includes the amputation of limbs without anaesthetic, the gouging out of eyes with a spoon-like instrument, and the stoning to death of both women and men.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000057"></a>A year ago last month, 59 people were hanged, including a 35 year-old woman after 12 years on death row in Rafsanjan prison. In September and October last year, 15 male and four female prisoners were hanged. Iran has also hanged the highest number of children in the world, and now has about 70 awaiting the rope. It is hard to imagine, but human rights abuses have worsened since the stolen presidential elections of June 2009. The anger of millions who protested about that has now turned into demands for an end to absolute clerical rule, and for democracy and human rights.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000058"></a>On 11 February, when the mullahs organised a rally to mark the anniversary of their 1979 takeover, more than 70,000 security personnel, including the corrupt Revolutionary Guard, stood watch. Some 500 pro-democracy demonstrators were arrested in one district of Tehran alone. They taunted security officers with shouts such as, "The uprising will continue", and, "You can't make the country a garrison forever". The speech of phoney president Ahmadinejad was greeted with shouts of, "Down with the dictator", and "End absolute clerical rule". A crowd of 10,000 marched on

There were protests in other parts of the country. More than 60 journalists are among several hundreds awaiting mass show trials.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000059"></a>Doubtless, as evidence of Larijani's claim of brotherly and amicable co-existence, the mullahs have decreed that those demanding democracy and human rights are guilty of waging war on God-"mohareb"-because of their support for the PMOI, the main opposition group inside the coalition, the National Council of Resistance of Iran. On 28 January, two men were executed for waging war on God and at least 10 others have been found guilty on the same charge. The <I>Guardian</I> reported on 4 February that the Foreign Office was urgently seeking information on reports that a 24 year-old with joint British-Iranian nationality was among 16 people on trial. What response, if any, has there been from Iran on this?</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000060"></a>A surprising aspect of the demonstrations in December and since has been the regime's acknowledgement that the PMOI has been leading them. For years, the regime has denied the PMOI's existence and derided any support it claimed inside the country. On 29 January, no less a figure than Ahmad Jannati, head of the powerful though unelected Guardian Council, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="1002231000222"></a>"those who try to shatter the structure [of the regime] ... and enemies of the revolution who intend to topple [it] ... must not be treated with compassion. There can be no room for mercy; it is now time for toughness".</ul>
<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000061"></a>On 18 January, Mr Salavati, the mullah's prosecutor in Tehran, said that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002231000210"></a>"Since the core of the PMOI has not been eradicated, Article 186 of the Islamic Punishment Act would still apply to the PMOI".</p>

<p><a name="1002231000062"></a>In accordance with this article,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002231000211"></a>"As long as the core of that organisation remains in place, all of its members and supporters ... are mohareb"-</p>

<p><a name="1002231000063"></a>that is, enemies of God. Overall, in the course of the demonstrations following that stolen election, it has been estimated that more than 10,000 people have been arrested with many facing torture in prison.</p>

<p><a name="1002231000064"></a>On 17 February, the UN Human Rights Council said Iran had rejected calls for the release of all political prisoners and refused to accept an international inquiry into the recent violence. It also refused to end the death penalty and said it would not make torture an offence under its laws. It also refused entry to the country to the UN special investigator on torture. Other recommendations by the council included the ending of discrimination against women and stopping the harassment of journalists and bloggers.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000065"></a>We should not seek to interfere in Iran, despite the human rights abuses. It is for Iranians to find their own way to democracy and respect for human rights. Yet we should make clear that we applaud those millions bravely demanding democracy so that they know that they do not stand alone. We need to tighten economic sanctions until the regime ends its nuclear defiance and ceases torture and executions. As former Prime Minister Tony Blair told the Chilcot inquiry on 29 January,</p>
<ul><a name="1002231000223"></a>"the nature of the Iranian regime makes me even more worried about the prospect of them with a nuclear device".</ul>
<p><a name="1002231000201"></a>That worries me as well.</p>

<p><a name="1002231000066"></a><b><a name="100222-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="1002231000265"></a>Lord Archer of Sandwell:</b> My Lords, I begin by congratulating my noble friend on securing this timely debate. We do not have as many opportunities for considering the situation in Iran as that situation deserves, and he is to be very much congratulated on this. My purpose in intervening is not to produce a list of human rights abuses; we have done that time and again, in meetings in this Palace and in debates. It has been done so often that it is almost pointless to repeat it-the repression, the torture, the killing of children and the discrimination against women. As my noble friend said, the situation in Iran has been condemned by human rights bodies of the United Nations 57 times. I find it very difficult to catch up, because every time we have a figure for the number of times that it has been condemned, the figure is already out of date, because it increases again with the next meeting.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000067"></a>Condemnation does not seem to be working. The Revolutionary Guards and the mullahs are indifferent to world opinion and impervious to argument. The question that we might consider is what the international community can do. The charter of the United Nations had much to say about human rights, but did not spell out any specific sanction. It was a different world, so the question of sanctions was felt to be unnecessary. Everyone felt that, once something was put to the test before a tribunal established by the charter, that would be sufficient; it would be respected-as it would be by almost every other regime in the world. However, that does not work here. At that time there was an overwhelming feeling that the governing factor was national sovereignty. It was felt that what went on within the borders of a nation was between the Government and the people: that it was not the business of the rest of us and we should not be interfering. That is all right if the people not silenced, but when they are not in a position to participate in the discussion and when every attempt to protest meets with brutal repression, it can hardly be said that this is a matter between the Government and the people. We saw on 11 February that the people of Iran are crying out for change, but their protest was brutally repressed.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000068"></a>The question still arises of what the international community can now do, given that Article 2.7 of the charter of the United Nations emphasises that what goes on within the borders of a nation are peculiar to that nation. One thing that we should be doing is revise the charter, because we know now the importance of international opinion in maintaining the almost universal standards incorporated in the charter and the subsequent human rights articles. But there are two possibilities, of which my noble friend mentioned one.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000069"></a>The first possibility that springs to mind is military intervention, although that is not something that I would seek to recommend, as it would do more harm than good to those who are already the victims of the infringements, and would probably not achieve anything at the end of the day, because what would be left would be a wilderness.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000070"></a>My noble friend suggests economic sanctions. I hope to see our Government recommending economic sanctions at the Security Council, but they would have

What we would not want to see are sanctions that would make worse the poverty that already exists in Iran where 85 per cent of the population are living below starvation level.</p>

I would like to see something much more forthright from our Government.</p>

It is of the most obnoxious kind. Next month, we celebrate International Women's Day. The brave women and girls of Iran, who face up to the mullahs day by day, are a shining example to us all. I hope that they will be remembered on International Women's Day. Our Government must bravely oppose this regime. It is obvious that it is anathema to the majority of the Iranian people.</p>

I wish to raise the relationship of Iran and the United Nations Human Rights Council. We are now in a somewhat surreal situation, but we should remind ourselves that human rights abuses did not start with the mullahs and the Islamic Republic. The last days of the shah were also pretty grisly, and when two opposition activists were executed a few weeks ago, it was a reminder of what happened then.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000075"></a>It is possible that Iran may soon be elected as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council because the Islamic Republic is a candidate as part of the Asian regional group. That council is, among other things, charged with making recommendations about human rights violations. As my noble friend said, on 15 February Iran was subject to a periodic review of its human rights record and showed the importance it attaches to that body by sending a large delegation headed by Mohammad Larijani, the brother of the Speaker of the Majlis. If Iran were to be elected in May, it would have serious implications for the credibility of the United Nations Human Rights Council, which is already, and quite properly, assailed from a number of directions. I understand that there are currently five candidates for the four places on the Asian regional group: Qatar, Malaysia, Thailand, the Maldives and Iran. There is, as yet, no indication that any one of the other four will withdraw but, if one were to withdraw, Iran would be elected automatically. It is clearly an important objective of the Islamic Republic to be so, and it is said that it is bringing pressure on at least one of those countries to withdraw

Thus, we are in a remarkable position. Iran is currently in the dock, alongside other malefactors such as Burma and North Korea, because since 2005 it has excluded all UN rapporteurs investigating human rights violations. Yet it is now, at least possibly, on the verge of becoming a member of the council.</p>

There is no doubt about what is happening in Iran. It has been going on for so many years, with so many people suffering, that the catalogue is endless. The recent report of 17 February by the Human Rights Council clearly said that Iran rejects all calls to release all political prisoners or to accept an international inquiry into the recent violence. It also refused to end the death penalty and said that it will not make torture an offence, so personally I cannot see what else people would want to see to condemn this regime without any conditions at all. We have already seen what is happening in Afghanistan when people have gone in there to help a democratic system. Iran is going even further than that in making life difficult for all Iranians who live there.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000082"></a>It is quite clear that appeasement is not going to work. I was listening to the television yesterday and I think that Mrs Thatcher, when Argentina was invading, said that dictators like those in Argentina never understand the word "appeasement". She was totally right, and the same applies in this particular case. We should really try to put some sanctions in-not sanctions in name, but in a proper format-so that they can do something to help the Iranians. Obviously, we have also learnt, to our cost, that any military intervention in other countries seldom works. In the case of Iran, the opposition party and the people of Iran are really struggling to make their viewpoint known and are

It is very obvious that there is a vicious circle in which the regime can play the external threat alongside more and more internal repression. How does my noble friend the Minister-along with Russia, America, France and China, et cetera-see the relationship between nuclear non-proliferation, and all those other questions, and the need not to find ourselves in the worst of all possible worlds, where there is more and more internal repression? If there could be a revolution without other consequences, that would be one thing, but could my noble friend put the jigsaw together in some way, however difficult that might be?</p>

We are all grateful to him for that.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000085"></a>I am absolutely sure that the situation worries anyone who has any knowledge of the region, and, for those of us who have many friends there, the situation is particularly poignant. Indeed, we in the United Kingdom have very high expectations of Iran to follow the ways of living, the cultural modalities and the diplomatic and civil society rights to which Iran has so successfully signed up over so many years. Iran is one of the most ancient of civilisations, and the UK has a magnificent history of co-operation in all aspects of life. Many citizens of the United Kingdom come from the Islamic Republic of Iran or from the Shah's regime before then. Indeed, we have a large number of Persian-British citizens who talk about these issues almost daily whenever we meet them.</p>

<p><a name="1002231000086"></a>I must immediately put my cards on the table and say that I do not share the pessimism of the noble Lord, Lord King, about the possibilities of dialogue. Today, the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union, under the chairmanship of the European High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, is discussing both the nuclear issue and political and human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000087"></a>Our position as a key member of the European Union must be this: that the EU must be willing to consider new restrictive measures against Iran unless it responds favourably to the international community's offer of engagement on the nuclear issue, and at the same time be willing to seek a negotiated solution with Tehran. In other words, this is not the either/or situation to which the noble Lord, Lord King, has perhaps

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000088"></a>Only a week or so ago, on 11 February, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, who is also Vice-President of the Commission, declared:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002231000212"></a>"On the anniversary of the Islamic revolution, which for many in Iran should symbolise progress in fundamental freedoms and rights, the European Union notes with great concern that a large number of Iranians have been prevented from expressing their views".</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000089"></a>Earlier, under the Swedish presidency following the elections, the EU perhaps put on record our complete position:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002231000213"></a>"The EU reiterates its commitment to human rights and democratic values, not least freedom of expression and association. These are universal human rights, and the EU recalls that Iran has committed itself to these rights as a State Party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The EU deplores the violations of freedom of expression and freedom of the press-national as well as international-in connection with the events following elections day. Restrictions remain at an even higher level than before the elections".</p>

<p><a name="1002231000202"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Corbett of Castle Vale, has already made these points.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000090"></a>I also recall the statement by Robert Cooper, the General-Secretary of the Foreign Affairs Council, which is also how I see the situation:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002231000214"></a>"We urge Iran to reconsider the opportunity offered by this agreement to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to engage seriously with us in dialogue and negotiations. This remains our consistent objective".</p>

<a name="100222-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000091"></a>These are sad times when we think about human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Condemnation will not necessarily provide us with enough progress to resolve these issues. We need to remember when we talk about and contextualise common values that different points of reference arise in the thinking of those on the other side of the dialogue which bring in connotations quite different to those we intend. Perhaps background knowledge or bitter historical memories may arise. I recall briefing both the Islamic Council of Iran representative, Dr Larijani, when he first came to Brussels and Javier Solana, the predecessor of the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton. I felt concerned before they went into their dialogue that they were talking completely different languages. One great problem is that the Islamic Republic has been so isolated for so long and so far away in every single way. Eurospeak is not easy anyway, but even the language of human rights as we interpret them does not somehow bring in the same connotations and values that we identify.</p>

I believe strongly that certain components of human rights are absolutely fundamental, such as the right of freedom of expression or to practice whatever faith you wish freely. They are fundamental human rights to which all nations of the world have signed up, including the Islamic Republic of Iran. Yet their implementation is sometimes understood in different contexts. We have to understand more clearly the cultural identity of the people to whom those rights are being ascribed. In other words, we need to organise our approach towards the Islamic Republic of Iran to make it absolutely clear that we are not dictating. Rather, we are reminding both them and us of our shared cultural identity, which over many decades and generations has brought us closer together.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000094"></a>We believe in human rights, but a society in transition, such as the Islamic Republic of Iran, may prefer to take our particular analysis of what is a human right in a completely different way. The vital thing now, if we are to avoid an absolute confrontation, is to go back to the table and try to work out some sort of context where dialogue can take place. We are discussing human rights in Iran at a time when mistrust between the Muslim world and the West is probably at its height-I hope it goes no higher. This is a difficult time. It is paramount upon us to open up these blocked channels of communication and start again. Britain has a special position: we are part of the European Union and we have the transatlantic alliance. Far from thinking that the time is now passed for proper dialogue and bridge-building internally and externally, it is never more important than now to try again.</p>

Iran is not a country that can be easily caricatured. It is blessed with vast natural resources, the world's fifth largest global oil reserve and an intelligent population with a long and impressive history and now with a thirst for change and development. Yet it has one of the worst human rights records, ranked 145 out of 167 in the Economist Intelligence Unit's democracy index.</p>

There have been reports of extra-judicial killings, scores of civilian deaths during peaceful protests and of the rape, ill treatment and torture of prisoners in detention, many of whom have been detained without just cause, access to justice, medical care or their families.</p>

On 15 February, Mohammad Larijani, secretary-general of Iran's high council for human rights, told the United Nations that Iran was,</p>
<ul><a name="1002231000224"></a>"in full compliance with the relevant international commitments it has taken on in a genuine and long-term approach to safeguard human rights".</ul>
<p><a name="1002231000203"></a>But Michael Posner, the United States assistant secretary of state, said that Iran's statement to the council was,</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000098"></a>Furthermore, Iranian officials have ruled out the notion of an external investigation into the state of their domestic human rights. No Human Rights Council official has visited the country since 2005, and numerous requests from special investigators have remained unanswered. As long as this type of woeful behaviour continues, Iran's human rights record should never disappear from our radar.</p>

Secondly, does he feel that recent clashes between opposition supporters and government forces following the deaths of the dissident cleric, Grand Ayatollah Hoseyn Ali Montazeri, have further undermined the legitimacy of the Iranian regime? Thirdly, what discussions has the Minister had with his Iranian counterparts to end the on-going persecution of the Baha'is in Iran? Fourthly, what discussions have the Government had with Iran and our allies about reducing Iran's nuclear projects?

That is in response to my noble and learned friend Lord Archer. We believe that it is vital to keep the issue separate from human rights to ensure that the sanctions are effective and achievable. We continue to lead the international community in condemning repeated violations of human rights in Iran and we will continue to assess the appropriate forums for further action on human rights. I shall return to that a little later. It is important to bear witness to the efforts of the Government of Iran to force their people into silent acquiescence and yet to acknowledge the very brave refusal of many of those same people to accept that.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000103"></a>On an important point made by my noble friend Lord Corbett, and referred to by a number of other noble Lords, clearly it is not for the British Government to decide who runs Iran; however, we must defend the basic principles of human rights and governance. These are not western principles; they are universal. My noble and learned friend Lord Archer made that point on the desire to investigate further the issue of economic sanctions.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000104"></a>In a very thoughtful contribution, the noble Baroness, Lady Nicholson, talked about cultural differences. The key is that there are cultural differences in Iran. I think the cultural difference is entirely between those who see a modern, democratic country looking forward-I agree with everything said by the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, for it is a country with enormous resources and enormously talented people, who want the opportunity to expand-and those who would look backwards. In that sense the cultural differences are not between Iran and the neighbouring countries, Britain, the UN, the EU or any other country, but concern those within the country. We have seen that since the elections of last year. It is not for the British Government to determine the outcome of elections in that country.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000105"></a>My noble friend Lady Gibson made a point about the role of women in Iran. Women have played a prominent and courageous role in the post-election protests, and dozens connected with the campaign for equality and the Mujahedin movement have been sentenced to imprisonment and flogging on charges of acting against national security and propaganda against the system-something which must, in any circumstances, be condemned. Yet Iran signed up to international commitments, which this regime continues to abuse. The treatment of demonstrators, as the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, said, bodes ill for any improvement in Iran's human rights record in the short term. You only have to look at the detention of people during December's Ashura protests and the February revolutionary commemoration.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000106"></a>The Iranian Government are cynical in their response to the universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council. Its response testifies to a complete state of denial by Iran's leaders, who pretend that there are no significant problems whatever. Yet observers, not only British observers, would say that the human rights situation in Iran is probably the worst that it has been in 20 years. Freedom of expression has been curtailed, and the Iranian Government have sought to crush any form of dissent from their own people. Newspapers

Access to the internet is sporadic, mobile phone networks are intermittently switched off, and satellites carrying international news have been jammed.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000107"></a>According to the International Press Institute, Iran now leads the world in jailing journalists. On the weekend preceding the 11 February Revolution commemorations, some 65 were reported detained. Those journalists who are tried often receive lengthy prison sentences for attempting to bring information to their fellow citizens and the outside world-information which in most countries of the world, not just western Europe or North America, would be expected to be available. Two recent examples of this persecution include Bahman Ahmadi Amouie, sentenced to seven years and four months and 32 lashes and Saeed Laylaz, who was sentenced to nine years for maintaining ties with foreigners and working to overthrow the Government-which means that he had contact with someone outside Iran or outside Iran's leadership.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000108"></a>The 10 days of dawn leading up to the anniversary on 11 February were marked by a chilling campaign of mass arrests, executions and calls for public hangings. This culminated in a heavy security presence on 11 February to deter any opposition protests during the regime's show of defiance. Since June, countless demonstrators have been beaten on the streets by police and plain-clothed government supporters for peacefully exercising their right to assembly. Many were arrested and have subsequently appeared in televised show trials, making what are widely seen as forced confessions and self-denunciations. The Iranian people are all too aware of the means by which such sham confessions are elicited. Widespread allegations of torture and abuse of detainees have emerged widely.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000109"></a>Iran has committed itself to internationally accepted standards of justice, and has signed international protocols to that effect, which should extend to safeguarding the treatment of detainees and the right to a fair trial, but clearly does not. These show trials are deficient in many ways, and it is all the more concerning that a number of death sentences have been handed down during these trials. On 28 January, the Foreign Secretary expressed his appal at the execution of Mohammad Reza Ali-Zamani and Arash Rahmanipour, sentenced to death during these grotesque parodies of justice. Rahmanipour was just 19 at the time of his execution, but he is by no means the youngest Iranian to have faced the noose. As my noble friend Lord Corbett emphasised, juveniles are not in any way inviolate. Forty juvenile offenders have been executed in Iran since 1999, and an estimated 130 young offenders await a similar fate on death rows. This is simply wrong. It is also in clear violation of internationally accepted norms and standards. The Iranian Government cannot avoid knowing this, not least because they have ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000110"></a>As my noble friend pointed out, these death penalty issues are of major concern, as Iran is second only to China in the number of people it executes. We know of 388 executions in 2009, at least 100 of which were carried out in the days immediately following the June  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC228"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>presidential election. The Iranian government have started 2010 in the same deplorable vein, sentencing a number of protesters to death for the crime of mohareb, acting against God. Many of those convicted of capital offences for non-violent activity in defence of their rights are members of ethnic minority groups, who represent a convenient scapegoat for a Government desperate to deflect responsibility for their failings. Iranian regions with large minority populations, such as the Kurds in the northwest, the Arabs in the west and the Baluchis in the south-east suffer long-standing repression and economic disadvantage.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000111"></a>A number of points were made. First, on the point my noble friend made about the Baha'i faith, it has been subject to mounting persecution since the elections. The authorities seek to vilify the faith, deeming it responsible for recent violence on the Tehran streets. The prolonged incarceration and psychological torment of individuals is unacceptable. It provides a strong example of a flawed judicial process.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000112"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Corbett, raised the question of a British dual national who was in court in Iran earlier this month. When we saw reports of this, our embassy in Iran immediately sought clarification from the Iranian Foreign Minister, who subsequently informed us that no British citizen had been in court on those dates. We pressed that and the Iranian authorities, based on the understanding that an individual may be a British-Iranian dual national, do not recognise that dual nationality and therefore would not accept any British interest in the case.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000113"></a>On the question of the Human Rights Council, raised by my noble friend Lord Anderson, there are five candidates-as he rightly said. We have received no indication that any of the five candidates wish to withdraw. We encourage contested elections to ensure that the human rights credentials of members running for election are under scrutiny. We encourage all UN states to consider the human rights record of candidates when voting. That is set out in the founding resolutions of the Human Rights Council itself.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000114"></a>Finally, my noble friend Lord Lea asked how we deal with the issue of nuclear sanctions. The position is that the IAEA board in November signalled yet again the international community's concern about Iranian nuclear progress and expressed its regret that Iran refused to meet with the E3+3 countries to discuss its nuclear programme. We are now pushing for multilateral sanctions that will affect decision-makers in the regime, with the aim of bringing Iran to productive and sensible dialogue. We would consider tightening existing sanctions and extending them to other sections targeted in the regime. This probably echoes the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Nicholson. We are looking for a change of heart, bringing a dialogue to the table.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000115"></a>Even at this late stage, we hope that the external pressures applied-even by debates in a Committee of your Lordships' House-will have some impact and that we will move forward so that that great country can be restored. It has had 100 years of blight in one form or another. It is about time it was able to emerge. The democratic movement within Iran is making it clear that it is determined to emerge.</p>

<p><a name="1002231000120"></a><b><a name="100222-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="1002231000283"></a>Lord Mawson:</b> My Lords, there are nearly 50,000 church buildings in England; 16,200 of them belong to the Church of England, and the rest are mostly owned by the Catholic Church, the free churches and other denominations. Many sit on prime sites at the centre of their communities, yet they are often large and underused. There is a growing trend to return church buildings to their original function not just as places of worship, but places of assembly, service and celebration for the whole of their community. This ancient tradition, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of London reminds us in the report <I>Churches and Faith Buildings: Realising the Potential</I>, has in more recent times been overlaid by distaste for mixing sacred and secular, but this dichotomy is increasingly being challenged. This underused asset base is considerable and, because of shortness of time, I want to focus my words today on church buildings, not on properties owned by other faith communities. As socio-economic conditions get tough and public finances are inevitably reduced, we need to relook at this property portfolio.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000121"></a>I know from many years of experience working with churches across the country, today as a non-stipendiary minister in the United Reformed Church, that the users of these buildings can often be small elderly congregations who find it very difficult to maintain or use effectively the asset that history has bequeathed to them. As many noble Lords will know, the Bromley-by-Bow Centre, which I founded in East London, began in such unpromising circumstances. Twenty-six years ago, I arrived as the minister to be greeted by 12 elderly people, all over 70, in a 200-seater church, sitting where they had always sat. It looked as though the dead had been carried out and no one had noticed.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC230"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC230</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000122"></a>By applying more entrepreneurial business principles and developing partnerships with the business, public and voluntary sectors, today we own a three-acre site that is run by 177 staff. The centre manages over 125 different activities each week, and on site there is a polyclinic, which brings together not just the biomedical model of healthcare but a wider range of other public services through an integrated approach. Two thousand people each week pass through the site, and with our partners, the housing company Poplar HARCA and Leaside Regeneration Ltd, we are putting together a £1 billion regeneration programme on an area of land the same size as the Olympic park on the other side of the road. Today, this church-based project has demonstrated new ways of delivering public services that are breaking new ground and challenging the traditional silos of government whose old-fashioned, expensive, bureaucratic approaches have so often failed to engage effectively with local residents and raise their quality of life.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000123"></a>Three years ago, I was approached by the then general secretary of my small denomination, the United Reformed Church. The church was becoming increasingly concerned about the scale of the problems it was facing with the condition and efficient use of its 1,700 buildings. I was told that many of them were listed and were a drain on limited resources. It was a serious problem that called for a new solution. Three and a half years later, my colleagues and I have created a new property agency for the United Reformed Church, called One Church, 100 Uses, and here I must declare an interest as a director of the company. This community interest company, a social enterprise, is now actively involved in the redevelopment of more than 30 church sites across England. Working with the Church of Scotland, we find that it shares similar problems. Yet underneath the apparent difficulties, we are discovering opportunities. We have discovered the rich rewards that appear when local communities begin to provide services for themselves. Not only does it save money, it creates healthier, more responsible people and stimulates an enterprise economy, which in turn encourages social cohesion. That is not a bad win-win scenario.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000124"></a>The church is fundamental to this outcome. Indeed, it has always played a central role in the care and service of local communities. The idea of the servant church goes back 2,000 years. The successful recent amendments to the Equality Bill illustrate that there is still a stomach in the Christian churches for us to play this important role. In past times, the church was coming to this caring/provider agenda from a position of authority and power. Today, it comes to it from a position of weakness and vulnerability. Perhaps that in itself is an opportunity.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000125"></a>If the church stops hiding behind committees and archdeacons, and instead shows strong business-like leadership, it can play an important neutral role in bringing partners to the table and in opening up conversations with the health provider, the local authority, the school, the housing provider and the shop. We are doing that on a number of sites across the country.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000126"></a>The church, the local school and the health centre are often the only long-term stable players in a local community, as governments change and countless new  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC231"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC231</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>policies pass our door. Successive new policies can often further fragment local partnerships in practice and can prevent positive action. But few Ministers stay around long enough to observe the practical consequences of all this activity.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000127"></a>Politicians on all sides have been talking the language of joined-up thinking for some time now, but often it is not happening where it is most needed. Building partnerships is a complicated business, especially given the contradictory and disconnected commissioning processes that are in place. The connections and partnerships that could bring these buildings to life, deepen community cohesion and use limited funds far more efficiently, are just not happening. I could illustrate this in Glasgow, Bradford, Oldham, Gainsborough and Poole in Dorset, but there is not time. Believe me, it is a serious issue.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000128"></a>After 60 years of the state promising and often failing to provide, let us encourage choice and diversity. Let us not assume that the public sector will deliver it all. It will not. In hard economic times people have to huddle together for warmth. In rural communities, the pub, church, post office and village hall are often not sustainable on their own, which is why there are now 12 post offices in Anglican church buildings and in one of our developments we are looking at a police base in the church.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000129"></a>Perhaps I may describe just one example of a working partnership on the ground where we hope to develop some of these themes; namely, Harmans Water, Bracknell. The community centre across the square from the church closed due to health and safety concerns. A small library next to the church is open only 16 hours a week. A new housing development brings some Section 106 funding and a whole new community. The church, which is home to both the United Reformed Church and Anglican congregations, already hosts a range of community services and has insufficient space. With the support of the local authority and Bracknell Forest Homes-the local housing association-our plan is to build a new centre for the community with a wide range of community facilities, services and a new library. There will still be a librarian for probably only 16 hours a week, but it is hoped that the library, which perhaps will be next to a new cafe, will be accessible for more hours with self-service and will be joined by many other information providers. The police want a help point and the local children's centre, the primary school and the college need a kitchen where families can learn about healthy living, et cetera.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000130"></a>So what are the key messages I should like the Minister to take from this debate? First, the credit crunch has caused many large-scale regeneration projects to stall. I know that because I am involved in one of them. However, often smaller-scale local developments involving church buildings and the clusters of buildings around them are being missed. Developments such as this are less risky and can provide a real opportunity to lift the local quality of an area. But they can happen only if everyone huddles together and pools their budgets.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000131"></a>To grasp these kinds of local opportunities we require focused leadership in the public sector and the churches. These projects do not happen by chance. We  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC232"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC232</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>also need practical politicians experienced in the workings of the world. Church-based developments can provide them with an opportunity to redefine the role of the politician as the practical person and the bringer of partners to the table. This is where our politics will be renewed; not here in Westminster.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000132"></a>New Labour says that it believes in community, but this Government have often produced lots of strategies, policies, committees and legislation rather than getting involved in the practical realities of a local neighbourhood. I see little evidence that any future Government have woken up to this opportunity either. Politicians need to be grounded in real projects; the micro and the macro are connected, as any business person knows. I seek to present to the Minister today an opportunity that can enable us to use limited public funds more efficiently, to bring life to underused assets and to create social cohesion and a spirit of enterprise in some of our most vulnerable communities.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000133"></a>Finally, I encourage the Minister to take a closer look at these local opportunities to use public money more effectively. I ask Her Majesty's Opposition whether it is not developments such as this that provide a practical opportunity in communities to explore what statements about a post-bureaucratic world might actually mean in practice.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000134"></a>I thank the Minister for taking part in this debate and the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, for a helpful discussion of this subject, and I look forward to hearing what they both have to say.</p>
<h5><a name="1002231000248"></a>6.41 pm</h5>

<p><a name="1002231000135"></a><b><a name="100222-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="1002231000284"></a>Lord Roberts of Llandudno:</b> My Lords, I venture into this field as someone who has been a Methodist superintendent minister for more years than I care to remember. I am still an active supernumerary minister on the local Methodist circuit, and I welcome the opportunity to think things through which the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, has given me this evening.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000136"></a>There are many, many answers to the question because buildings, areas and congregations differ a great deal. Many church buildings, as we have already heard, are already in community use in one way or another. Three years ago, I went to close one old Methodist chapel in the village of Glan Conwy and found 16 people there. They did not want it closed because on Monday it was the place for the playgroup, as it was on Thursday. The local choir met there on Tuesday, and Wednesday night was bingo night. I do not think that John Wesley would have approved, but we just have to accept that this all helped in the community.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000137"></a>Other things happen in our churches: arts classes, language centres, play schools, elderly citizens' meeting places, youth clubs and police help points. I do not often look on the dark side-I may be known as a bit of an optimist-but I can see a dark side with which I cannot come to terms. We hear that there are many opportunities in town centres, but rural areas are different. Who wants a chapel that is in a field and literally miles from anywhere? There is no real opportunity to use such a chapel for a community or government purpose.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000138"></a>I know that English Heritage, and Cadw in Wales, are aware of the various situations and how the listing of buildings can create difficulties-we have already heard about some of them-in planning, in the change of use, in the sale of property, in maintenance costs and in costs to make over a building. The development of church buildings can sometimes be restricted because of listing regulations.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000139"></a>The local Methodist church in the Conwy Valley village of Penmachno was listed about three years before it was decided to close it. It had been a thriving church in a quarrying, rural area, but as the quarries had closed and farm labourers were few there was nothing else to do except close it. Yet it was a listed building and after all these years is still not adapted for any other use, because they are fighting planning and listing regulations-immense problems for purchasers who would want to make it into a home. In many rural areas, I honestly do not see either central or local government having any realistic alternative for the use of church buildings. Populations are few and widely scattered. They commute to work, if there is any and if they are of an age to work-after all, we have a very ageing population in our villages. The community that was not able to support a chapel is also the community that faces a lack of vision. I do not have a vision of what we could realistically use those buildings for.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000140"></a>We know about falling numbers at services. There are few to keep a local church or chapel going. Possibly, it is a denomination that is unable to provide pastoral care or ministerial oversight. In another chapel that I am thinking of, there is one officer left-and that officer is of a good age and is not able to take responsibility for that building. He will, possibly, open the church door once a month, but they cannot cope; even with ministerial oversight, there are not the people there to shoulder the burdens and responsibilities.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000141"></a>I do not know whether you have been phoned up at two or three o'clock in the morning to hear, "Ah, Mr Roberts, the slates have been blown off the roof of the chapel". That would be because they have landed in somebody else's back garden. What do you do? I must say that I did not go to attend to it in those dark hours. There is nobody there to take responsibility, but the tiny congregation sometimes does not want to close the chapel.

<p><a name="1002231000142"></a>I would like to see churches of all denominations working together-and they are, much more than in the past-to solve some of those questions. It has happened; we know that some church buildings are used by two or three different denominations. Yet then, instead of that one individual having to face the burden, we need some outside advice. I do not know whether we could work together-it must be on an ecumenical basis-because they struggle with, "How can we afford to repair the roof? How can we even afford the insurance premium?". I do not know whether some other churches are like my own Methodist church; some communities with a congregation of six have an insurance premium on their chapel of £1,200 a year. They cannot possibly meet that sort of demand, so I suggest that the Government could somehow lead on this. We want expert guidance, helping sometimes

The painful decisions can be shared, but someone other than me must look at whether there is a way to tackle insurance premiums.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000143"></a>A younger membership with more energy and vitality might be able to maintain buildings and have the vision to adapt demand to the 21st century. I know that it happens in some places. Only last week, I was in one local church converted from a warehouse where it was standing room only. That was wonderful, but the previous Sunday, a week yesterday, I gave the closing service in a little village chapel in a part of Llandudno called Penrhyn-side. When I became a minister there, many years ago, there were six places of worship. One by one, they have closed-I am going to try to do something about this-and the last service in the village was held a week yesterday. It was very sad, but the people keeping it going were all over 80 years of age, and there was a limit to what they were able to do. So there is a different pattern. People, not buildings, make churches. But if the building is in a state of disrepair or needs special attention, we have to meet that need. Of the six chapels in the little village, one has become the village hall. Three chapels have become houses. The one that I closed the other day has not yet decided what it will do-it will probably be put on the open market-and one has been demolished. You need only one village hall, not five or six. They cannot all be adapted. Perhaps local councils or the Welsh Assembly Government can give some leadership. But, in many instances, I do not think that there is any realistic proposal that could save our buildings.</p>

<p><a name="1002231000144"></a><b><a name="100222-gc0006.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="1002231000285"></a>The Lord Bishop of Leicester:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, for bringing this issue to our attention. It must be 35 years since, as a youngish curate in East London, I found myself in a post-war restored Victorian church that seated 1,100 people. On my first Sunday morning, I counted 48 people in the congregation and more than 1,000 empty seats. We spent the next five years working hard on completely rebuilding that church and redeveloping the site. Now, there is a multi-purpose centre with provision for sheltered accommodation for the elderly, a general practitioner facility, language teaching for Bengali women and counselling rooms, as well as a place of worship.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000145"></a>That set me out on a path which I have sought to follow in my ministry over the years since. In the 1980s, I found myself as the parish priest in Canvey Island. There was a transplanted East London population of 40,000 people, many of whom were young families detached from their extended family networks in London and often with very severe family pressures and difficulties. We adapted the church buildings, in partnership with Essex County Council social services department and the Children's Society, into a family centre which provided all kinds of provision for needy, young families. That provision has endured for 25 years.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000146"></a>The issue which the noble Lord has brought to our attention is very close to our hearts. For most of its history, the Church of England has had a vision for its church buildings as the centres of community life.  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC235"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC235</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Medieval church buildings were designed to be places of education, social care and community cohesion. Part of our mission as churches is to work among and for the benefit of the whole local community, and not just for the benefit of those who attend. The two biggest assets which the churches bring to this task are our buildings and volunteers. As has been mentioned, the Church of England has 16,200 parish churches across the country. In many places, they are not only the oldest public space, but the only remaining public space once the shop, post office, school, pub and so on have disappeared.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000147"></a>The Church of England, for which I speak, is especially well placed to serve as a potential service delivery point as it has a presence in every community. Its unique legal status means that its churches provide a service to all who live within the parish-whether people want to get married or to use its facilities for funerals or in other ways. My colleague, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of London, in his opening presentation to the recent Church of England synod debate on the potential of church buildings, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002231000215"></a>"We are the custodians of a countrywide infrastructure which would take billions"-</p>

<p><a name="1002231000204"></a>of pounds-</p>
<ul><a name="1002231000226"></a>"to replicate and which has huge potential at a time of financial stringency".</ul>
<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000148"></a>There is much research available to show that churches, as well as other faith groups, have a special contribution to make. They are deeply rooted in community life, able to reach out to the most vulnerable groups and are well placed to provide high-quality local public services. In recent years, many surveys have been carried out-funded by regional development agencies, government offices and local authorities-to map the contribution of faith groups in their local communities.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000149"></a>One such survey has been done in my home city of Leicester and demonstrates that more than 400 different community groups, sponsored by the various faith communities in a highly ethnically diverse city, are reaching the most hard-to-reach communities across the city. The Church of England is already playing its part, and churches are increasingly becoming vital partners in building strong communities. Examples have come to the Cathedral and Church Buildings Division of the Church of England of the many varied and different ways that church buildings are being used by and for the community. They include churches as locations for major civic events; as locations for social and community activities, including support for the elderly, the homeless, asylum seekers and so on; and as places of education, attracting school visits, UK online centres, Sure Start centres, nurseries, adult education centres, classrooms, after-school clubs, libraries, heritage centres and conference centres. These are all examples of provision already in place. Post offices, doctors' and dentists' surgeries, health centres, gymnasia, community shops, police stations, cafes and farmers' markets have already been mentioned.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000150"></a>In my own diocese of Leicester, the St Philip's Centre is at the forefront of resourcing the church and public and private sector organisations, including the police, teachers and health workers, in faith literacy, a vital skill in public service today. It is based in an  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC236"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC236</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>inner-city church in a largely Muslim neighbourhood. In the Church of Christ the King in Beaumont Leys, a white outer estate, the church is used extensively by groups supporting large numbers of transient asylum seekers and other destitute people. Leicester Cathedral plays host to the Welcome Project, which assists asylum seekers, and is presently planning for a major new diocesan centre reaching out to those not in employment, education or training. All these activities are taking place in living churches that are still parish churches, part of the parochial church system and still first and foremost places of worship.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000151"></a>The 2005 parochial returns register found that 44 per cent of churches now have lavatories and 37 per cent have kitchen facilities. Four years on, the figures are likely to be considerably higher. Such amenities enable churches to host a wide range of community events. The Pastoral (Amendment) Measure 2006, which came into force in January 2007, allows the lease of part of a consecrated church building, provided the church continues primarily to be used as a place of worship. This enables longer-term occupancy by outside groups and allows them to meet additional funding conditions. This is a role that we want to encourage national, regional and local authorities and other bodies to recognise, and it is a role that we are encouraging our churches to welcome, for example, by encouraging parishes fully to engage with the development of their local community plan and dioceses to participate in local strategic partnerships, local area agreements and local action groups. There is an increasing number of area or regional Christian and multi-faith groupings, as well as individuals at diocesan level, already actively participating in LSPs and other local, community and voluntary sector networks and alliances. This is beginning to create new partnerships and give us increased access to a more level playing field in terms of access to existing and new areas of funding. This in turn has strengthened the church's capacity to develop the use of its buildings for worship and mission to the wider community.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000152"></a>However, we cannot continue to sustain all this activity or reach the full potential of church buildings as community resources without increased support from various partners, which must include government at all levels. That is why this debate is so important. The 2004 report, <I>Building Faith in our Future</I>, set out to celebrate church buildings and the contribution they make to their local communities. It called upon government and the community and voluntary sector to work with us in partnership. The report sets out many ways in which those partnerships can be built.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000153"></a>In January this year, St Peter's Church, Peterchurch, in the diocese of Hereford completed a project to refurbish the interior of this grade 1 church. Obviously, it will not be possible for every church to be so adapted nor, due to location or other factors, will it be possible to find such important extended uses but, where they arise, it is vital that we pursue the possibilities. By using these buildings to their full potential, they can become a real resource for their local communities. They can build social capital, serve community building and be a vital resource to the people of England. They are precious to the whole community and an asset beyond price that deserves all our interest and investment.</p>

It has certainly stimulated in me considerable thought. Prompted by the debate, I have looked at and learnt more about the organisation of which he is part-One Church, 100 Uses-and was taken with the excellent and innovative work it is doing and the many excellent projects which he did not have time to develop. In this debate, I would have been more interested to hear of some of the problems to which he alluded but also did not have time to expand on. Here, we need to address problems and find solutions rather than simply congratulate ourselves on a number of excellent projects, wonderful though that is.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000155"></a>I reread the 2008 report referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, entitled <I>Churches and Faith Buildings: </I><I>R</I><I>ealising the </I><I>P</I><I>otential</I>. I hope that the Minister will be able to bring us more up to date on some of the government actions which were recommended in that government report. The report was primarily about enabling faith groups, and the third sector in general, to learn about and have better access to funding. It is a hugely important subject, which I do not diminish at all, but it was rather less full on how to get access to the levers of power, particularly at local level.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000156"></a>Here I declare my interest, not as one with diminishing congregations but as a London borough councillor for 36 years-I still am a London borough councillor. I have rather different experience from my noble friend Lord Roberts. In London, we do not have too many chapels in the middle of fields but we have an increasing number of underused church buildings of all denominations where there is very real potential. The noble Lord, Lord Mawson, referred to considerably underused property assets. They are more than property assets: I think we all recognise that churches are very much more than simply buildings and often are very historic buildings. They are, always have been and always should be the centre of a local community. The initiative to put churches at the centre of communities more than perhaps they have been in recent years is greatly to be welcomed.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000157"></a>We in local government know that there are bad times ahead and that, whoever wins the general election, we shall be facing a very severe financial time over the next few years, probably the like of which I have not known in my 36 years. There have been some good times and a few bad times, such as when Anthony Crosland told me, within a year of my being elected, that the party was over, and it has been like that ever since. We are in for some difficult times which will require all of us in local government to think outside the box and to be very much more innovative in our approach to how we provide services for our communities. It is of particular interest to me that we should be much more innovative in the way in which we engage with our communities. In a period of financial cutbacks it will be especially difficult but important to engage with the communities, otherwise the mismatch and the disengagement will be all the more severe.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC238"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC238</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000158"></a>One point that perhaps strays a little from buildings and is much more about the churches is how local government engages with faith groups and churches and vice versa. In my view, faith groups should always be represented effectively in local strategic partnerships-I think the Minister would agree that that is the case on good LSPs. I stress the word "effectively"; they should be there not simply because it is good to have them listed among the membership but because they can play an effective role as partners. Inevitably, there is always a mismatch between the statutory partners with all their resources, even in hard times, and any community or voluntary group that simply does not have that infrastructure readily available to it.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000159"></a>Nevertheless, a good partnership will work as a good partnership. That will inevitably lead to more innovative thinking, new and different ways of providing services for and with the local community, and to returning church buildings very much to the sort of use for which they were originally intended, as the noble Lord has said-not just in their important role as a centre of worship but in the equally important role as a centre of the community.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000160"></a>I have two particular interests in the way in which some of this might happen. I have the responsibility in my local authority for the public library service, which is a great interest of mine. Indeed, I ought to declare an interest as vice-chair of the All-Party Group on Libraries, Literacy and Information Management. At all times, but particularly at financial times, the library service, particularly branch libraries, come under enormous pressure. There is a great fear that they will be in the forefront of financial cuts, and sometimes it is right and appropriate that branch libraries should close simply because they are in the wrong place. I would prefer to say that they should be relocated rather than closed.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000161"></a>I wonder whether in some cases relocation to an underused church building could be very appropriate for a branch library. I do not have time to wax eloquent-if I could-on libraries, but they are very much more than just places for books and the use of the internet, important though those core businesses are. Several branch libraries in my own borough are self-service-the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, referred to self-service libraries-enabling them to stay open for much longer.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000162"></a>I shall give two brief examples. In the first couple of months of this year libraries in my borough have been issuing freedom passes in London to anyone over 60 who wishes to renew their freedom pass. My borough is one of the few that are using public central and branch libraries to do this, and the libraries have been packed with people who have not been to a library since they were children and who note that libraries have changed just a little in the past 50 or 60 years. Many of them are going on to use libraries. That may be an innovative use for some underused church buildings. At the other end of the age scale, we use our library every Friday evening for what would otherwise be called a youth centre. This Friday is live music and open mic night for young performers, which is rather different from the traditional image of the "shh" public library.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000163"></a>The other issue to which I want to allude is very much a London issue and on a rather larger scale. Over the next seven years, London education authorities will have to find an additional 50,000 primary school places. That is a huge problem. Normally we talk about a funding problem-the Minister may be pleased to know that I will not allude to that particularly-but this is also a space problem. In many schools, there is the physical problem of where to put additional classes, even if you can afford them. If you add to that my party's aspiration for smaller class sizes, it is even more of an issue. It is clearly not possible or appropriate for many church buildings to accommodate primary school classes, but it must be possible for a number of church buildings to do so provided that the buildings are properly built and designed for use as a classroom and are properly equipped. Any problems can be overcome, and probably more cheaply, than by trying to build new classrooms.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000164"></a>Those are two brief examples. We know that we are in hard times and that local government will need to be a lot more creative and innovative in its thinking over the coming years, and I hope very much that it will start to work much more closely with the churches, particularly in respect of the huge underused property asset to which the noble Lord referred.</p>

The first two speakers were ministers and the third a Bishop, so it was of huge comfort when the noble Lord, Lord Tope, said that he was a councillor.

<p><a name="1002231000166"></a>I thank and congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, not only on introducing this debate, but for the excellent work that he has already done on co-location of public services and utilising underused churches. His portfolio is truly outstanding, and I hope that we can develop and expand his project across the UK. There are thought to be 46,500 churches, chapels and meeting houses in the United Kingdom, of which 37,000 are in England alone, so the scope for co-location of public services is enormous.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000167"></a>Many churches are used, if they are lucky, for a couple of days a week for various services, and others maybe once a week. The church in my village in Norfolk is used once a month; otherwise, it remains locked. Maybe there is a difference in rural areas, as we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Roberts. Examples of the successes that we have heard of this evening are all about urban churches; so there is probably a difference due to the size of the communities involved. It may be easier to do it in urban areas than in small rural parishes. But there is scope there too, no doubt.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000168"></a>There are many other more everyday co-uses for church buildings, such as cafes, cyber-cafes, shops and farmers' markets; they can also be used for cultural activities, such as exhibitions, drama performances, lectures, rehearsals and concerts; or for community  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC240"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC240</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>services such as mother and toddler groups, playgroups and drop-ins for youth groups or elderly people, to name but a few. Some churches may not like the idea of having a commercial activity under their roof, but there are many non-commercial activities to think about. At a time when our essential public buildings and services are being scaled down or closed altogether, we are fast losing these vital spaces and opportunities for our daily activities, or to just come together to meet and talk. Co-locating key public services on the same premises offers benefits to service users in terms of lower journey times to get to a service that they require, and to providers, in that they would benefit from reduced overhead costs, such as the duplication of rent and building maintenance.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000169"></a>Often churches are on large, central plots of land, which can be used and developed to provide vital community activities. For example, the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, has developed a garden centre on excess church land. Many churches support that idea, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester said. In 2004, the Church of England published a Green Paper on its ideas for facilitating such a development, and in March 2009 the Government outlined a blueprint to help churches and local authorities work closer together to deliver a greater range of community services. What progress has been made since then? Maybe this question would be better directed at the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester, but can the Minister say of the 16,000 Church of England churches, how many have started offering public services and what measures have been taken to engage other denominations and faiths so that they can open up their places of worship to local communities? What is being done to ensure that church and public alike are properly informed and supported about these possibilities?</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000170"></a>Sadly, we now live more and more in a secular society. The church used to be one of the hubs of the community, a vital component in community cohesion. The church today is continually looking for ways to engage with its communities. Surely this would be an excellent way to achieve that and one way to bring the church back to the centre of community life. This might ruffle the feathers of the right reverend Prelate but all too often, especially in the rural areas that I see, the church is rather distinct from the communities. That is sad.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000171"></a>The best if not the only way of achieving the required results is probably at a grass-roots level. At my church in Norfolk, for example, there would need to be discussions between the parish council, the parish priest and maybe the local school. As chairman of our parish, I have heard nothing of the Government's plans to help churches and local authorities work together. Maybe I missed it. Have the Minister's plans filtered down to parish levels and, if not, should he not ensure that this happens?</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000172"></a>As for the church, the local vicar is in a difficult position. Presumably he would need to ask permission from his superiors for other approved activities to take place in his church. In the same vein, if the bishops think it would be a good idea, as I believe they do, and a good way of bringing communities together in the

It may well do. I am looking now at the right reverend Prelate. What better way is there to get the church back into the centre of the community?</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000173"></a>Some churches and cathedrals already provide venues for many other uses, as we have heard. Yet the percentage is too small. The portfolio of the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, is testament to the potential success of this programme. We on these Benches support any proposal aimed at developing communities and bringing people closer together. The co-location of public services in underused church buildings is a great idea if properly thought out and supported. I hope the Government will support it.</p>

Perhaps we can find time outside this debate for a discussion of this, as I am interested in feeding that back to colleagues.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000176"></a>I begin by referring to an earlier debate on a similar theme. In October 2008, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford introduced a debate entitled <I>Welfare: </I><I>C</I><I>hurches and </I><I>F</I><I>aith </I><I>C</I><I>ommunities</I> by asking Her Majesty's Government,</p>
<ul><a name="1002231000227"></a>"what future role they envisage for churches and faith communities in voluntary sector and welfare delivery partnerships".</ul>
<p><a name="1002231000205"></a>In his opening remarks he stated an important principle:</p>
<ul><a name="1002231000228"></a>"this is not simply a pragmatic issue about how, in times of scarce resources, we cajole agencies such as the churches into filling the increasing number of gaps in the welfare state. Churches and voluntary agencies are not a backstop for the public sector".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 9/10/08; col. 363.]</ul>
<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000177"></a>Let me put this another way. At the heart of every tradition of belief is an integrity that cannot be simply co-opted to serve the ends of the powers that be at any one time or place. If government, national or local, is to work in partnership with faith communities, respect for this integrity is a fundamental principle, but it would be unfortunate, to say the least, if this principle were misinterpreted to mean that there can be no common ground between the public sector and faiths. Of course there can.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000178"></a>All communities need resources if they are to be thriving, cohesive and sustainable. They need reliable public services, particularly during such times that we  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC242"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC242</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have been through recently, when economic conditions are less favourable. As the noble Lord, Lord Tope, said, this is the time to be innovative, particularly at local authority level. The days are gone when the public sector could deliver virtually all these services in a top-down manner. If services are to meet the needs of communities, communities themselves have to be engaged. Faith groups are deeply rooted in their local communities and are often better placed than public agencies to reach people who might otherwise be marginalised. This engagement is a great deal more than mere consultation; it is sometimes correctly referred to as co-production.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000179"></a>I began by referring to the important principle of respect for the integrity of faith communities. I now want to stress another principle at the heart of faith communities-the principle of service to others, to which the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, referred. This can be about working for a better quality of life in a local community or it can be about global issues of justice or the environment. It is on the basis of this principle that the public sector can build a working partnership with faith communities.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000180"></a>There is a straightforward conclusion to be drawn from all that I have said so far. We cannot afford to overlook the important community assets represented by churches and other faith buildings, and we certainly cannot afford to allow them to be underused. I think that the right reverend prelate referred to the fact that they are custodians of a significant infrastructure.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000181"></a>A key element of my department's current partnership with faith communities is the shared desire to build strong and positive interfaith relations. We are currently taking forward the major programme of work and investment announced in <I>Face</I><I></I><I>to</I><I></I><I>Face and Side</I><I></I><I>by</I><I></I><I>Side</I>, published in July 2008. It aims to release the greatest public benefit from the resources of faith communities through partnership working, especially through partnerships between faith communities and the public sector. <I>Face</I><I></I><I>to</I><I></I><I>Face and Side</I><I></I><I>by</I><I></I><I>Side</I> recognises that buildings are among the most significant resources of faith communities. I quote from Section 2 of the framework on shared spaces for interaction and social action:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1002231000216"></a>"With 54,000 places of worship in the United Kingdom, faith communities are essential providers of sacred and secular spaces for people to interact and pursue shared activities. These spaces are found in all parts of all our communities from large cities to small rural villages. They are used by local people for local events and activities".</p>

<p><a name="1002231000206"></a>We have heard of a huge array of things that go on in faith buildings in our short debate this evening. They,</p>
<ul><a name="1002231000229"></a>"often function as the primary resources and buildings for community spaces and essential meeting places".</ul>
<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000182"></a>Much of what I want to say today simply expands on this quotation, drawing out in more detail its implications and setting out what is being done to tackle the challenges that lie behind it. There certainly are challenges to be faced if the full potential of the resource is to be realised. A key challenge is the relationship between faith communities and the wider third sector. The third sector itself can often face barriers when working in partnership because of inadequate understanding of its scope and diversity. The work of faith communities is no different, ranging for example from a neighbourhood-level lunch club  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC243"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC243</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>once a week to nationwide support for people with problems such as homelessness and drug addiction. Without their stock of buildings across the country in every community, as well as dedicated volunteers, faith communities would not be in a position to deliver this impressive range of services.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000183"></a>The Government have continued to invest in the capacity of the third sector over recent years, especially through the programmes of the Office of the Third Sector, which are worth more than £515 million over the 2007 CSR years. It is vital that this investment reaches faith communities, who are, simply and straightforwardly, eligible for it; I must emphasise that to eliminate any doubt. This principle has underpinned an important recent paper on faith buildings. <I>Churches and Faith Buildings: Realising the Potential</I>, which has been referred to already, was published jointly last March by the Church of England and five government departments. It confirmed the position of faith groups as significant contributors to society, and outlined the different sources of funding and other resources which faith communities could draw on to ensure that the potential of faith buildings is realised.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000184"></a>One important source of funding that faith communities could apply to to support similar approaches to the use of their buildings is the DCLG's Communitybuilders programme. That provides support for community anchors: organisations that operate locally, at the heart of their communities, and are able to respond holistically to local problems and challenges. Through the Communitybuilders programme we are investing £70 million to help anchor organisations work towards long-term financial stability, so that they can meet the needs of their communities for generations to come. Clearly, many faith buildings may be seen as community anchors.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000185"></a>However, central and local government funding for community-focused organisations will be increasingly strained in the current economic climate. For this reason, my department wishes to make it easier for all community groups to develop the resources and finance they need to make better use of their buildings for the good of their local communities. The DCLG recently launched its community enterprise strategic framework, outlining the department's direction of travel in supporting community-focused organisations. Community enterprises represent a distinct and important part of the third sector. They operate not just as a not-for-profit deliverer of local services, investing any surplus back into their communities, but as focal points for local people to identify the unmet needs of their communities and to respond with help from their own income-generating activities.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000186"></a>Many faith buildings already host community enterprises-cafés, room hire and nurseries, for example-all of which have enhanced the community and provided important income for the building. We want to see that approach extended. Just this month, it was reported that a church in Carmarthenshire is looking to run its own tenpin bowling alley, would you believe. Not only will it be used to create important local jobs, but the profit that it makes will allow the church to undertake important community projects, such as developing a food bank and debt counselling.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC244"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC244</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000187"></a>Money cannot do everything; we also need to equip people by helping to change cultures and changing the way people think. Churches and faith communities have to learn how to work effectively with the public sector, and vice versa. This culture change cannot simply be decreed, either by the public sector or by faith communities. Like any relationship, it has to be worked at. We have consistently promoted that key message, not least in supporting the publication by the Church Urban Fund of <I>Believing in Local Action</I> alongside our <I>Face </I><I>to</I><I></I><I>Face </I><I>and</I><I> Side by </I><I>Side</I>. <I>Believing in Local Action</I> uses practical case studies to demonstrate the benefits of partnership between local third-sector organisations and local faith groups. It shows consistently that local faith communities are better equipped to work in public partnerships, and therefore have better access to appropriate resources when they align themselves with wider third-sector networks.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000188"></a>As I have said, this is a two-way process. I want to affirm the efforts that faith communities are making to equip themselves, such as the Church of England's Crossing the Threshold programme, which is aimed at helping dioceses and parishes to get the best from their buildings for wider community use. It began with a conference in the Hereford diocese last November, where one of my officials was the main speaker and a toolkit was launched, aimed at supporting parishes in beginning the process of developing their churches as a resource for the whole community. I hope that the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, will see that as one route into helping parishes to understand and engage in the process.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000189"></a>My officials are also currently planning a conference to take place next month, whose working title is "Faith and Social Action: Innovation and Expertise". The conference will highlight examples of good practice and use workshops to explore some case studies in greater depth. I am pleased to say that two of the case studies deal explicitly with public service delivery by churches: the Springfield Centre in Birmingham and St Peter's, Peterchurch, in the diocese of Hereford. Incidentally, St Peter's is a listed building and English Heritage is very much involved in encouraging and helping in these situations.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000190"></a>The intention is to produce a conference report that will be a resource both for faith communities and for the public sector, supporting them to co-operate effectively in delivering the services that local communities need and deserve. One of the main speakers will tackle directly the collocation of services, such as village shops and post offices, in churches, especially in rural areas, and will show how his own organisation, the Plunkett Foundation, is offering resources to churches wishing to go down this social enterprise road.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000191"></a>I shall try to deal with one or two of the points raised, but I hope that noble Lords will forgive me if I do not deal with them all. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, talked about buildings, areas and congregations differing. We very much recognise that, which is why local engagement is important. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Tope, that having faith communities as an effective part of the local strategic plan is entirely appropriate and should be encouraged. One can understand the dilemmas when places of worship  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC245"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC245</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could be closed. As the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said, people have memories and do not want churches to close. The right reverend Prelate talked about all the uses that are being made of living churches; we do not have to empty a church for this to happen.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000192"></a>The right reverend Prelate talked about the vision of the Church of England to be at the heart of the community-the whole of the community. That is supremely important. He referred to the 16,200 churches, but I am afraid that I do not have any data for the noble Earl on how many of those are engaged in some form of community use. The idea of public library services being collocated seems an interesting example. Then there is the issue of urban areas that are running out of spaces for new school places. There are some interesting concepts there. It is part of the theme of having an innovative approach, which will certainly be the watchword for the local government.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000193"></a>The LGA completed a survey of local authorities' engagement with faith groups in 2008 to inform, update and resource local authorities to work with faith and interfaith groups in their area. It is hoped that the next step towards producing this updated resource will be taken in the near future. Both the LGA and the  


<notus-date day="22" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC246"></a><b>22 Feb 2010 : Column GC246</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Improvement and Development Agency are actively engaged in this. There was the interesting example from the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, of the church that is used just once a month. His concern about the rural community was not so much that the building was isolated in a field but that the church was isolated from his community. He was talking on the same theme of the benefits of collocating services.</p>

<a name="100222-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="1002231000194"></a>I hope I have demonstrated that the Government are actively supporting the collocation of public services in churches and other faith buildings, both in principle and in practice. The Government have no magic wand that will transform things overnight. Indeed, I have argued that a top-down approach would be counterproductive. We are not complacent; we acknowledge that more can be done. We will continue to work with faith communities in the spirit of partnership, which as well as being about mutual support is equally about mutual challenge. In doing so, we must keep before us the aim of partnership, which is not about scoring points off one another but about improving outcomes for local communities.</p>

<a name="10022210000003"></a><b><a name="100222-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="10022210000041"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State (Maria Eagle) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="100222-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="10022210000004"></a>I am today announcing that the Government have awarded a new national contract for the Bail Accommodation and Support Service to Stonham.</p>

<a name="100222-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="10022210000005"></a>This follows a competitive tender conducted in accordance with the public sector procurement directive (2004/8/EC). Stonham offered the best overall bid in terms of quality of service and cost relative to the other bids received and will take over the service from ClearSprings on 18 June 2010 for an initial three years.</p>

<a name="100222-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="10022210000006"></a>Stonham is a third sector organisation and registered charity and one of the UK's largest providers of housing and support for vulnerable and socially excluded people.</p>

<a name="100222-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="10022210000007"></a>The primary aim of the Bail Accommodation  and Support Service is to provide accommodation and support services to enable the courts and prison governors to make greater use of conditional bail and early release on home detention curfew, in appropriate cases. The scheme allows defendants without an appropriate address, who would otherwise have been granted  bail by the courts, to be bailed. It helps to ensure  that prison is reserved for people who really need to  be there, and not people whom the courts judge to be suitable for bail or who prison governors judge may  be placed on home detention curfew.</p>

Copies of the revised code have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<a name="100222-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="10022210000014"></a>The code was last revised by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in 2004 and it has now been updated in order to take into account recent changes in law and practice, as well as the merger between the Crown Prosecution Service and the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office.</p>

<a name="100222-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="10022210000015"></a>The fundamental evidential and public interest considerations have not changed. However, the code has been amended to include: some additional public interest factors tending both in favour of and against prosecution; provision for exceptional situations that allow a decision to be made not to undertake a prosecution on public interest grounds before all the evidence in the case is available for consideration by the prosecutor; an explanation of how the CPS takes decisions in cases that require the DPP's consent; greater clarity on the prosecutor's role in considering out-of-court disposals; and the introduction of an explanation of the threshold test and the circumstances in which it should be applied.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="10022210000016"></a>The revised code also makes it clear that, for the maintenance of public confidence in the criminal justice system, in rare cases where a new look at the original decision shows that it was wrong the CPS will consider reversing a decision not to prosecute. The current wording of this aspect of the code updates and brings greater clarity to the undertaking given in a Written Answer on this issue by the Attorney-General on 31 March 1993. I am particularly pleased to welcome the DPP's decision to take a more robust approach to correcting prosecution decisions that were wrongly taken.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="10022210000026"></a>The priority on aviation security was to discuss the additional security measures introduced in member states post Detroit and the future evolution of aviation security within the EU. The UK, along with most member states, highlighted the need for a review and reinforcement of EC current baseline measures and the application of new technologies, including but not limited to advanced imaging technology (AIT), subject to appropriate safeguards. It was noted that the European Commission would shortly be producing a report on the use of new technologies (including AITs), as a first step to a future legislative proposal to allow their use as a primary screening technology within the EU, a move supported by the UK. The presidency emphasised that the threat posed a global challenge that required a single response and that technology must play a fundamental role in EU strategy to protect the public. The presidency expressed satisfaction at the consensus reached, which would be developed in a joint strategy within the framework of the European Union. The UK will be participating in further EU, ECAC and ICAO meetings over the next few weeks and months to continue to work internationally to build on existing aviation security standards and using and developing new technology, in order to make things harder for the terrorist but to continue to facilitate and protect genuine passenger journeys.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="10022210000027"></a>On the action plan on urban mobility, the priority was to prepare draft conclusions which will be considered at the Transport Council in June. The UK joined several other member states in supporting the principles of the action plan, in particular the Commission's

The presidency emphasised the need to implement sustainable plans to promote greater integration of infrastructure planning and to find alternatives to the use of private vehicles through the use of public and non-motorised means of transport. The UK agreed that there is a role for the Commission to play in overcoming the lack of evidence surrounding urban mobility and facilitating the exchange of best practice. An observatory, as suggested in the action plan, could achieve this goal, but it is vital that it has clear terms of reference, objectives and a work programme agreed by member states. The UK position remains clear that the action plan should not lead to further legislation and that cities and city regions should retain the freedom to pursue and implement locally relevant solutions.</p>

<a name="100222-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="10022210000029"></a>I am today publishing a new strategy entitled <I>Protecting our Border, Protecting the Public</I>. Copies will be available in the Vote Office and in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<a name="100222-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="10022210000030"></a>Since its creation in 2008, the UK Border Agency has become one of the UK's largest law enforcement bodies, operating across the UK and in 135 countries overseas. It stands at the forefront of efforts to protect the United Kingdom from overseas threats posed by dangerous people, goods and materials, while at the same time enforcing our Immigration Rules and facilitating the flow of legitimate travel and trade on which our economy depends.</p>

<a name="100222-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="10022210000031"></a>This document both clarifies the extent of our law enforcement activities and sets out our vision as to how, over the next five years, we will develop our capability to protect the public from the harm caused by illegal immigration and smuggling. It also sets out how the agency will support the work of its criminal justice partners in tackling non-immigration crime committed by foreign nationals in the UK.</p>

<a name="100222-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="10022210000032"></a>In support of the wider government priority of tackling organised crime, the document identifies tackling organised immigration and smuggling crime as a key priority for the agency, with particular focus on the detection of class A drugs at the border and the targeting of groups that facilitate illegal entry or stay in the UK. The underlying themes of the strategy include encouraging compliance with our Immigration Rules, the benefits of disrupting criminal activity before it reaches our shores and greater targeting of the assets of criminal groups.</p>

<a name="100222-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="10022210000033"></a>Tackling border and immigration crime and protecting the public are a responsibility that the UK Border Agency shares with law enforcement partners, such as the police and the Serious Organised Crime Agency.

We already have strong partnership arrangements; our regional immigration crime teams, for example, comprise both border agency and seconded police officers. We also have local immigration teams across the country that work alongside the police, HM Revenue and Customs, local authorities and other local partners to ensure compliance with, and enforce, our immigration laws.</p>

<a name="100222-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="10022210000034"></a>This strategy explains our relationship with the wider law enforcement community and sets out how we will work more closely together to deter, disrupt, detect and deal with crime, in order to make the UK a hostile environment for criminals and a safer place for the public.</p>

While honours are considered on a case-by-case basis and awarded according to individual merit, commanders are guided by a flexible quota system based on the number of people deployed on each mission and the intensity  of combat. Gallantry awards recognise the bravest of the brave and are only given in extraordinary circumstances, therefore, their numbers will be limited. These decisions are outside of ministerial remit, but I understand there are no plans to change the current system.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_3"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of the estimate in the report by the International Action Network on Small Arms, Oxfam and Saferworld, Africa's Missing Billions, that the cost of armed conflict in Africa since 1990 was equivalent to the money given in aid during the same time.

This is why HMG have steadily increased, over the past decade, the amount of their budget allocated to resolving and preventing conflict in Africa. The Department for International Development's (DfID's) 2009 White Paper, <I>Eliminating World Poverty: Building our Common Future</I>, set building peaceful states and societies as one of its key objectives. The White Paper pledges to allocate at least 50 per cent of its new bilateral funding to fragile countries and those affected by conflict and triple its direct project funding for security and justice.</p>

<a name="100222w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="10022236000010"></a>Conflicts in Africa can only be managed and resolved in a sustainable manner by people and institutions on the continent, so HMG continue their support for African conflict prevention and resolution capability. HMG also seek an international treaty to regulate  the arms trade, one of the key elements in reducing the flow of small arms in Africa. The UK has played a lead role internationally in arguing for an arms trade treaty (ATT). We are committed to working for a strong and transparent ATT over the next two years. We very much welcome the UN's approval of the ATT resolution which, for the first time, sets a clear timetable for negotiation of a treaty.</p>

CCTV can assist in the detection of crime in public places, provide evidential material in identifying offenders and help in bringing them to justice. A recent report by the Campbell Crime and Justice Group: (<a href="http://db.c2admin.org/doc-pdf/Welsh_CCTV_review.pdf">http://db.c2admin.org/doc-pdf/Welsh_CCTV_review.pdf</a>) which includes UK membership and whose review was part-funded by the Home Office, included the observation that CCTV is more effective in reducing crime in the UK than in other countries.</p>

This work will be used to assist in further consideration of the criteria that should be applied in other areas of England and Wales by police, local authorities and others in assessing the contribution of CCTV to crime detection, crime reduction and public confidence.</p>

We also worked with our EU partners to ensure that his case was raised as part of a case list at the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue on 20 November 2009. The Chinese responded with details of Gao's arrest and imprisonment. They stated that Gao himself had accepted the judgment and was on probation and that he returned to his home town in Shaanxi Province for the tomb-sweeping festival in June 2009. Gao Zhisheng's case was also raised at the EU-China Strategic Dialogue in December 2009. We will continue to raise his case at every opportunity.

In the financial year 2008-09, eight of the nine forums received additional financial support for specific items amounting to a total of almost £200,000. During the current financial year all nine forums were allocated a further £5,000 each to enable them to support last November's Inter Faith Week across their region.</p>

While RDAs take account of community cohesion issues, RDAs do not record expenditure according to community cohesion as a category of corporate spending. Furthermore, to separate out this data would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

<a name="100222w0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2129"></a><a name="10022236002165"></a>The estimate of 23 per cent relates to an estimated effect in the first year of operation of the NCRS. No similar estimate was made for subsequent years as changes continued to be bedded in. However, the Audit Commission undertook substantial audit work on crime recording in the years following NCRS introduction up until 2006-07, this indicating a generally increasing level of NCRS compliance across forces. Furthermore, it is known that some forces had taken steps to make their recording of crime more victim-oriented prior to the formal introduction of NCRS.</p>

A CAS, which replaces the visa letter, cannot be forged and cannot be tampered with. This is a security feature to further reduce the potential for abuse of Tier 4. As all students require a passport to apply for leave under Tier 4, either overseas or in the UK, it is not unreasonable for this information to be entered on the CAS.

These individuals were not members of HFEA staff and, therefore, were not covered by the document referred to in my Written Answer of 8 February (<I>Official Report</I>, col. <I>WA 81-2</I>). One approach followed an HFEA inspection and resulted in the individual meeting with members of the HFEA Executive. The outcome was an unannounced inspection and subsequent consideration by a HFEA licence committee. The other disclosure was anonymous, so it was not possible to pursue in the same way. The HFEA has also advised that it is unable to provide any information regarding disclosures which may have been made to all other chief executives since 1991.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2140"></a><a name="10022236002190"></a>The HFEA has advised that of the five cases of misconduct mentioned in my Written Answer, four were unauthorised absence and one was misuse of email. One person was charged with misconduct in each of these cases. One case resulted in an oral warning, two cases resulted in the individual leaving the employment of the HFEA and in the two remaining cases, where the individuals involved appealed the findings of the misconduct inquiries, their appeal was upheld. Those concerned were employed for periods ranging from five months to three years and six months. The HFEA is of the view that it is not appropriate to provide further detail on these cases, due to the risk of identification of those involved.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2141"></a><a name="10022236002191"></a>The HFEA has advised that providing information on the number and nature of licence conditions or other sanctions, requested by the noble Lord, would involve scrutinising every licence issued since 1991 and cross-referring to licence committee minutes, inspection reports, incident reports and press cuttings.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2335"></a><a name="10022236002392"></a>HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) now generally uses the term "admitted to trading on an EU Regulated Market under Title III of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)", to determine which securities would meet the HMRC definition of "listed". AIM is not an EU regulated market under Title III of MiFID, and so shares traded on it do not meet that definition.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2336"></a><a name="10022236002393"></a>No estimate is currently available for the cost to the Exchequer of permitting AIM shares to be eligible for ISA tax relief, given the wider considerations noted below.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2337"></a><a name="10022236002394"></a>To enable AIM-listed shares to be included within an ISA, the Government have to amend the ISA regulations. In doing so, the Government would have to consider the risk to ISA investors of allowing not only shares held on AIM, but potentially all other secondary markets worldwide, to be eligible for ISA tax relief. The Government would also have to review the wider tax reliefs currently available to AIM-listed shares, which would mean reconsidering advantageous treatment for AIM shares around inheritance tax, and access to the enterprise investment scheme (EIS) and venture capital trusts (VCT).</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2345"></a><a name="10022236002413"></a>Until November 2009, the European Union (EU) provided €9 million per month for the supply of  8.8 million litres of industrial diesel for the power station in Gaza. The EU has clarified that the ending of this support was the subject of a comprehensive discussion with the Palestinian Authority (PA), in which it was agreed that EU funds should be focussed on other priorities. The PA has since undertaken to bear the cost of fuel from its own budget.</p>

In health facilities, increased disruptions to the power supply mean that important medical procedures need to be put on hold; they also result in greater wear and tear on hard-pressed back-up generators. Water supplies are irregular as pumps do not work during power outages, and the capacity of the waste water system to deal with sewage is affected leading to overflows and discharge of raw and partially treated sewage into the sea.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2347"></a><a name="10022236002416"></a>Cooking gas is used for both the preparation of food and heating. In the last two months the amount of cooking gas imported into Gaza has varied between 24 per cent and 42 per cent of the pre-blockade levels. NGOs have highlighted this shortfall as a significant humanitarian concern, particularly during winter. Periodic consignments of petrol and non-industrial diesel are allowed into Gaza for UN Relief and Works Agency use, but supplies for the open market thorough the crossings have been sporadic. The bulk of Gaza's diesel and petrol needs are met by supplies brought through tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border.</p>

Because of these treaty obligations, we have been discussing the possible creation of a marine protected area with the US. Neither we nor the US would want the creation of a marine protected area to have any impact on the operational capability of the base on Diego Garcia. For this reason, and as has been set out in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office public consultation document, it may be necessary to consider the exclusion of Diego Garcia and its three-mile territorial waters from any marine protected area.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2528"></a><a name="10022236002634"></a>Identity interviews were added to the passport process primarily to address first-time application fraud through deterrence and fraud detection arising from a personal interview. In addition to the two instances of confirmed fraud mentioned in the Answer of 19 January 2010, Official Report col. WA 242, applications have also been withdrawn when customers are advised that an identity interview is required. From September 2007 to June 2009 which is the latest information available, 1,816 applications were withdrawn at this stage. Together this information underlines the usefulness of the interview as a deterrent to those attempting to make a fraudulent passport application.</p>

One of the main costs of patenting in Europe is the cost of translations. The UK therefore supports a reduced language regime for the EU patent which will significantly cut patenting costs. An approach based on one international and one country of origin language does not relate to any formal proposal currently being discussed in the EU and has not been assessed by the government. However, we will judge all detailed proposals on their merits as they emerge.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2615"></a><a name="10022236002728"></a>The Department for International Development (DfID) is developing a number of new or expanded programmes to meet this commitment. We have already agreed multi-year programmes in the Democratic Republic of Congo (£60 million), Bangladesh (£37 million), Nigeria (£30 million), Sudan (£20 million), Nepal (£12 million) and Yemen (£7 million). We are also updating our programming guidance, based on the latest evidence and lessons learnt, to maximise the impact of this increased spending.</p>

The majority of education delivered in prisons in England and Wales is delivered by trained teachers though there are a number of officer instructors who work and supervise prisoners in workshops. Prison officers have a number of tasks to fill which will change depending on their existing role. But a key component of the vast majority of an officer's role will involve interacting, supporting and encouraging prisoners. Part of this process will be to encourage and motivate those prisoners who will benefit from education.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2672"></a><a name="10022236002794"></a>However, it should be emphasised that average time figures are not directly comparable between Northern Ireland and England and Wales on account of different practices regarding charging, summonsing and committal which have arisen for historical reasons. The Northern Ireland Criminal Justice Board has recently approved an extensive programme of work covering case preparation, case progression and governance / accountability arrangements to secure significant improvements in the timely progress of cases.</p>

Following the recent presidential election in Sri Lanka my right honourable friend the Prime Minister wrote to President Rajapakse urging him to use his mandate to take forward genuine reconciliation. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary also discussed this issue when he spoke to Foreign Minister Bogollagama on 5 February 2010.</p>
