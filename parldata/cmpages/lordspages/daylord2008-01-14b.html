We have tested our plans in major national and cross-government exercises such as &#147;Winter Willow&#148; in early 2007 and &#147;Shared Goal&#148; in 2006. Various regional and local exercises have also been conducted and the UK participated in the EU-wide simulation, &#147;Common Ground&#148;. Lessons learnt from those exercises have been considered in the development of our national framework and other guidance, as well as in local planning.</p>

As, in the worst case, some millions of people could seek that treatment, how is that to be made available to patients? What is meant by a &#147;simulation exercise&#148;&#151;the phrase used by the Secretary of State for Health&#151;and was &#147;Winter Willow&#148; an example of a simulation? Did it involve real doctors, real nurses and a real national flu line manned by lay people?</p>

A simulation is an exercise in which participants are based in their own organisations and the control sends information and actions to participants to test communication flows and decision-making between those organisations. More than 5,000 people participated in &#147;Winter Willow&#148;, including GPs, people from SHAs and many outside operations. We also do many real-life exercises in terms of distribution and so on. In respect of Tamiflu, I believe that it should be administered within 48 hours. We will have the national flu line to which the noble Lord referred. When people think they have flu, they phone that line and someone arranges to collect the Tamiflu to be administered to the patient. We will also have some vaccines available.</p>

However, he will no doubt agree that a completed apprenticeship is enormously valuable to the individual and to the country as a whole. Last year, the All-Party Group on Arts and Heritage met employers in constructional skills and heard that most of the expertise is in the small firms. Those firms are very willing to train apprentices but find that they lose out badly when they do; not only do they incur a financial loss in

However, a great many small employers have said that they would rather group their activity because they do not find it administratively efficient to do it directly themselves. That has been the overwhelming evidence from the small and medium-sized business sector. I think we will find that one size does not fit all and that we will need to respond to the different kinds of business case in the ways that those businesses think are most effective.</p>

We have the general introduction of diplomas and other arrangements in further education, a matter on which I know the noble Baroness is an expert, and it is critical that the outcome of an apprenticeship should be recognised within a scheme that bears relationship across all of those. Fortunately, the preparatory work is being done by the same groups and we have every reason to think that an alignment of qualifications will be achieved.</p>

The entry qualifications to get into an apprenticeship either at the basic level, level 2, or the advanced level, level 3, are boundaries that employers are setting in terms of the outcomes they seek. I would prefer that that was decided by employers rather than in Whitehall as I think that we are likely to get the people we need in the economy more effectively that way. I do not think that people going into higher education per se makes the difference, but I certainly would like to see schools consider alternatives to higher education where that is more appropriate for the young person involved.</p>

It is essential that the work that the CBI and other partners are doing to encourage more employers into the sphere is undertaken with great energy. At the moment, about 130,000 employers are engaged in the scheme. We believe that that number can be increased considerably. With the leadership of businesses such as Tesco and Rolls-Royce, which are putting in a good deal of effort, for which I commend them, into growing the number of employers, there are good prospects that we will increase those numbers considerably.</p>

My Question derived from the experience of a man who was convicted of murder at the age of about 20 and given a tariff of 15 years. He has now been in prison for 27 years, consistently denying the offence. I understand that the rehabilitation of such long-term prisoners is based very much on acceptance of their guilt. Does the Minister accept that rehabilitation needs to be aimed especially at those who, like the man I mentioned, deny their guilt? Secondly, does the Minister accept that, with more lifers in British prisons than in the whole of France, Germany, Russia and Turkey combined, the very high levels of recidivism among prisoners and the Government&#146;s need to double their planned expenditure on prisons to &#163;2.5 billion to accommodate an extra 10,000 prisoners, we have an urgent need to review the amount of money that we are spending on the successful rehabilitation of prisoners so that they become good citizens rather than stay in prisons?</p>

The release of prisoners such as the ones he mentions is a matter for the Parole Board and is done on the basis of risk of harm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="08011414000076"></a>On access to programmes for people who deny their offence, some offender management programmes will not be suitable because they are concerned with discussions about the offence itself, but other educational and training programmes are available, and people who have denied their offence are regularly released by the Parole Board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="08011414000077"></a>On the noble Lord&#146;s general question, we are due to debate that.

There is indicative funding for the National Offender Management Service, from which the Prison Service is funded, of a 2.5 per cent cash increase per annum over the CSR period. Extra resources will be made available for the expansion of prison programmes. I do not deny that this is a challenging budget, but we will do everything that we can to ensure that the kind of programmes to which the noble Lord has referred will remain funded in the future. It is worth making the point that, in the past few years, we have seen a considerable expansion in those offender management programmes.</p>

It contained figures produced by the then Lord Chief Justice that showed that 60 per cent of all lifers were exceeding their tariff by at least a year before being released. That is not to say that they should all be released but, hidden among this, in addition to those in denial, were a large number of people who never got into any programmes. The administration in the service for seeing them out was inefficient. Will the Minister say what the percentage is now? Surely in times of heavy overcrowding, you want to get rid of the people who should not be there, including the people who are of no risk and with a tariff that has expired.</p>

I am not aware of lifers with problems getting on accredited offender behaviour management programmes, but we will continue to keep this matter very much under review. It is worth making the point that there has been very encouraging progress in increasing the number of programmes that have been made available.</p>

That is part of the changes and developments that have now taken place in the Prison Service. As far as the Parole Board is concerned, there have been issues around oral hearings, a significant percentage of which have had to be deferred for one reason or another. We are very concerned to see that those difficulties are ironed out. A current National Audit Office study is looking at this matter and we will take that forward with a great deal of enthusiasm.</p>

There has been an increase in prison population, but part of that is because more offenders have been brought to justice. The aim of my department is to ensure that prison is available for those serious offenders who ought to be in prison. The other side of the policy is to encourage the use of community sentences, which can be hard sentences but none the less do not require the use of prison. We are getting the balance right at the same time as crime levels are coming down.</p>

In other words, he is being kept in preventive detention in all but name.

The release post-tariff of prisoners serving life sentences is a question for the Parole Board, as it must be. Its decisions are taken on the basis of its assessment of the risk. As far as indeterminate prison sentences are concerned, there is concern about those short-term sentences where the kind of programmes that noble Lords have mentioned are not yet available. We are putting our energies into that area at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08011414000097"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 122. We now turn to Part 2 and look in more detail at the structure, role and functions of the Committee on Climate Change. Much of our discussions on the Bill have concerned that key body created by the Bill, the Committee on Climate Change. In particular, there has been much discussion and debate on how it will fit in with the roles of government and Parliament. I think that Members of the Committee will agree that there has been widespread acknowledgement of how important it will be to get right the triangular balance between the Secretary of State, who will represent the Government, Parliament, which will represent the people, and the committee, which will represent science and expertise.</p>

<a name="80114-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08011414000098"></a>There have been differences. The Minister, while taking much of our argument, has been cautious in conceding executive power to the committee, although as the Bill has progressed through the Committee stage, he has acknowledged that much determination of the targets and budgets will rest with the committee. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, has expressed concern that the committee should not become politicised. We in the Opposition agree with him. However, we see that the success of this legislation is very much dependent on getting the role of the committee right. We have pointed out repeatedly that as the Bill is currently drafted, it too frequently draws back from putting the committee centre stage, as we believe it must. In this we have been widely supported by noble Lords from all sides of the House who were involved in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill through the Joint Committee of both Houses.</p>

<a name="80114-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08011414000099"></a>We have been saying since Second Reading that the Committee on Climate Change needs to be beefed up in its role. I was pleased to hear that this view has widespread support across the House. We have also emphasised&#151;and again I believe this is a shared objective of all noble Lords who have contributed to the debate&#151;that the committee needs to be independent, authoritative and expert. Its activities need to be based on the science of the issue and its decisions need to reflect the science on which they are based. My vision is that in this way it will be a more effective and useful partner to the Government and Parliament in achieving the success of this legislation. I have frequently drawn  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1064"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1064</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>attention to the difficulties. This is why the committee&#146;s authority is so important. It needs to be of consequence and it needs to be seen to be of consequence. I believe that this view is widely shared.</p>

<a name="80114-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08011414000100"></a>For this reason we have tabled these two amendments which change the name of the committee to reflect its role and functions, to reinforce its status and authority, and to proclaim its independence. The change would create the Commission on Climate Change, which we believe is a more appropriate name for the body. The name &#147;committee&#148; applies to a body set up to undertake a function and which receives its authority from an existing body. For example, we are sitting here as a committee by virtue of the fact that we have had the business of the House committed to us. Similarly, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, a body performing functions comparable in importance with the Committee on Climate Change, is rightly so called because it is constituted by the higher authority vested in the Bank. Though the importance may be similar, its status is different. A commission is a task or a duty derived directly from the authority of the Crown or statute. Thus it is exactly the right term for our purposes in this Bill. It reflects the role and function, status and authority, and independence of this key body.</p>

<a name="80114-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08011414000101"></a>This change is not mere semantics and it is certainly not cosmetic. It would give its members the status of commissioners and create a public sense that this is not just an exclusively advisory body. To this end we move this amendment. It will in a very real way ensure that the Government and Parliament can draw on the strength and authority of the body they have created to assist them in stopping climate change. I beg to move.</p>

I have had time to reflect on his words and I understand perfectly where he is coming from.

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08011414000106"></a>As I understand the relationship, there is no statutory basis for the principle of agreeing reports. It seems to have its roots in customs and practice. A Treasury publication entitled <I>Managing Public Money</I> states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08011414000270"></a>&#147;The PAC expects that [the] NAO will agree the texts of these reports with the Accounting Officer(s) of the organisation(s) concerned ... What this means in practice is that the factual content of every report is taken by the Committee to be undisputable. There are occasional disagreements&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011414000257"></a>if we were to translate those into the circumstances we are talking about today, it might well be the case that there would be disputes here&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08011414000277"></a>&#147;between the NAO and a Department about the interpretation of the facts, but these are clearly signalled. This in part, according to the NAO, arises from a report on <I>Redundancy Compensation Payments to University Staff</I>. At the first hearing on this, in January 1986&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08011414000258"></a>a hearing which I attended&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08011414000278"></a>&#147;the PUS at the DES appeared to dispute a point of fact in the report. The Committee postponed consideration of the report until April that year, to give time for the NAO and the Department to agree a joint minute to the Committee&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011414000259"></a>The minute deals with the relationship which is at the very heart of this debate, and I want to refer to it. It was provided for the Public Accounts Committee on 23 April 1986 and in paragraph 4 stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08011414000271"></a>&#147;In agreeing the Report there was, as DES have said, extensive correspondence between NAO, DES and UGC and discussions that went on for quite some time (Q781). Throughout these exchanges the NAO assumed that departments understood that, in agreeing his Reports with departments, the C&amp;AG&#146;s intention was to establish that:</p>
</ul><ul><a name="08011414000279"></a>(i) all material and relevant facts had been included;</ul><ul><a name="08011414000280"></a>(ii) the facts were not in dispute;</ul><ul><a name="08011414000281"></a>(iii) their presentation was fair;</ul><ul><a name="08011414000282"></a>(iv) where the Report stated any NAO views or conclusions which the Department were unable to agree, this was made clear and the NAO&#146;s and Department&#146;s reasons properly represented, with all necessary balance&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011414000260"></a>This is important because here we are talking about the relationship between the department and the committee, where I believe that there is scope for amending the Bill.</p>

<a name="80114-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08011414000107"></a>The minute went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08011414000272"></a>&#147;DES, however, understood that they were required only to satisfy themselves that the Report&#146;s presentation of the relevant facts was fair. They did not consider they had been invited to express a view on the C&amp;AG&#146;s findings. It would clearly be unsatisfactory if there were continuing differences of understanding between departments and the NAO in clearing Reports. Action is therefore being taken by the NAO to remove any uncertainty that may exist, and to clarify the objectives of the clearance arrangements on the lines set out in paragraph 4 above. As a result, although there should always be agreement that the Report fairly presents all the material and relevant facts, it might disclose difficult differences of view between the C&amp;AG and the Department over the interpretation of the facts and the conclusions to be drawn from them. This has long been accepted by PAC and does not stand in the way of agreeing that a Report is an appropriate basis for subsequent PAC consideration&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08011414000108"></a>In other words, an accommodation was found.</p>

<a name="80114-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08011414000109"></a>If we were to apply that principle, which works in this relationship between the NAO and departments, to the debate we are having here, it would mean, effectively, that both sides would have to agree. We are not saying that the committee only would be able to veto a government view; it would mean that they would have to put their heads together to agree facts, findings and conclusions&#151;and, indeed, in our case, recommendations. It would create within this committee&#146;s relationship with the Government a dynamic tension that would concentrate the mind of the committee on taking realistic and right decisions. At the same time, it would concentrate, within Government, the need to compromise with the committee&#146;s objectives. In the event that they could not agree a position, no action would be taken. In those circumstances, it might well be referred to the committee. Last week, I proposed that there be a sort of climate change ad hoc Select Committee, which would intervene to deal with issues where agreement could not be found and try to take the whole process forward.</p>

<a name="80114-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08011414000110"></a>Effectively, we would have two vetoes: the right for the Government to veto and the right for the committee to veto. In those circumstances, they would seek to agree. I believe that we should be going down that kind of route, as against giving the Government, with all the pressures I have referred to on previous occasions, the right simply to block what Parliament and the committee might feel to be a very constructive way forward in implementing policy on climate change.</p>

<a name="80114-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08011414000111"></a>I have, perhaps, slightly abused debates in the Chamber today, but this is the only opportunity that remains for me to set out an alternative way of dealing with the problem of this relationship. The reality is that those of us who want to give the committee power are, at the moment, losing the argument because the Government insist on saying no. I understand the departmental decisions that will have been taken. I am trying to feed in an alternative approach and I ask my noble friend to consider it seriously.</p>

I will go back through that before Report stage. I wonder whether we are talking about similar things, even though I am sure that there are differences. The National Audit Office is very useful, in that we on these Benches see a stronger role for the Committee on Climate Change than is in the Bill at the moment. We will, I hope, come to this amendment later this afternoon. The Committee on Climate Change should have a very positive role in auditing, assessing and judging the policies of the Government in meeting the budgets and targets that it has set itself. In that area, the Committee on Climate Change has a huge responsibility, one that is not in the Bill at the moment. The noble Lord will know all this far better than me, given his deeper experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08011414000113"></a>The National Audit Office would not, therefore, take forward something in, for example, education, saying which policies are needed, and that we should go 100 per cent down the route of academies, or whatever. However, I do not see that as coming within the body&#146;s role. It assesses what is going on, the areas

In the end that has to be resolved. These Benches agree with that and may come back to that debate later this afternoon.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08011414000114"></a>As regards the amendment, we have thought long and hard about this area. We fully agree with the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, about the need to strengthen the climate change committee in all sorts of ways. I regard the name issue slightly more subjectively and do not reject his analysis of the derivation of the word &#147;commission&#148; and the various rights that that normally confers. Over the weekend I put &#147;commission&#148; into Google, which came up with the Forestry Commission, the Gambling Commission, the Sustainable Development Commission, the Human Genetics Commission, the Low Pay Commission&#151;noble Lords could probably do with its help occasionally&#151;the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the Electoral Commission. One could compare the gravitas and fear of government that those bodies induce with that induced by the Monetary Policy Committee; I know which one has real power within the nation state of the United Kingdom&#151;the Monetary Policy Committee has far more power than the others. It has a different style of governance to many of the commissions that I mentioned although they are extremely varied in that respect. Nevertheless, I consider that the Monetary Policy Committee has the most power, and certainly the most authority, of the bodies that I listed. The electoral&#151;</p>

<a name="08011414000115"></a><b><a name="80114-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08011414000627"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> Does the noble Lord agree that the full title of that body is the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England? It is of the Bank of England. The climate change committee is not a committee of anything. That is the inconsistency in its name that I am trying to point out.</p>

<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="08011414000116"></a><b><a name="80114-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08011414000628"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> I thank the noble Lord for that intervention. I clearly do not disagree with him but, as I said in my opening remarks, I am talking about gravitas, respect and a subjective view of how these things are looked at. From my early political days, when I thought of a UK commission I considered a royal commission. Royal commissions have a reputation for dealing with worthy causes that are kicked into the long grass. The word &#147;commission&#148; arouses such connotations in many cases. However, there are exceptions: for example, the Electoral Commission. Noble Lords may not be in awe of that body because they do not stand for election but that is not the case with people who do stand for election. Certainly, life Peers do not stand for election in this House; I apologise for having omitted the others.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08011414000117"></a>The European Commission is extremely important and authoritative but does not operate in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, &#147;commission&#148; is French for committee and I believe that the climate change committee is the best title. The title of the Monetary Policy Committee does not in any way lessen that body&#146;s authority. I accept that I speak from a subjective, political point of view but I do not like &#147;commission&#148;, which to me conveys within the British political culture the concept of long grass, arm&#146;s length and a matter that government will ignore unless they really have to do otherwise.</p>

At that time, it was extremely important that the Manpower Services Commission was seen to be completely separate from the Department of Employment. When the Secretary of State for Employment came to the commission, he came because it had invited him or he had asked whether he could come and it had agreed to that. He could not just walk in because he was in charge of it and it was a committee of his department. I therefore, think that my noble friend has a point.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08011414000119"></a>The public may be mystified by what &#147;commission&#148; means. That is not surprising because the noble Lord from the Liberal Front Benches made rather a muddle of his speech in that he mixed up the European Commission and much lesser bodies in this country, which all have separate functions. Politically, however, my noble friend has a good point and I I look forward to hearing what the Minister will say. The Government ought to consider it seriously.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08011414000120"></a>I hope the noble Lord, Lord May, will contribute&#151;no, he has disappeared. The authority of the body is critical. If it is going to advise in the way described in this part of the Bill, it must have authority and must be accepted as having that authority. For that reason, my noble friend is making a good point.</p>

I share his doubts about the effectiveness of the word &#147;committee&#148;. Having listened to the noble Lord from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench, I suggest&#151;perhaps out of a sense of nostalgia&#151;that if &#147;commission&#148; is not acceptable, we might consider &#147;authority&#148;. I was chairman of the National Rivers Authority. There were those who argued that it should not have been &#147;national&#148; because it did not cover Scotland, but it did give us an authority from the start that a lesser title would not have provided. I believe that, as a consequence, we proved to be a very effective organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08011414000122"></a>I support my noble friend&#146;s amendment because it is important to strengthen the authority by giving it a more powerful name. When we come to Report, if there is some doubt about &#147;commission&#148;, I put forward a possible alternative of calling the body the &#147;climate change authority&#148;.</p>

I will do that myself because I feel that we have been with the Committee on Climate Change since we started the Committee stage, to be honest. As this is the first of the debates on the committee, I want to use the opportunity to set out our vision for the role of the Committee on Climate Change. The name of the body is relatively unimportant, but I realise that what is being bandied about here are different views on its function, which we will probably come to in other amendments.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1069"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1069</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80114-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08011414000124"></a>We are establishing the Committee on Climate Change for two reasons. First, it is being set up to provide independent and expert analytical advice to the United Kingdom Government and devolved Administrations on the pathway to 2050. Secondly, the committee, with Parliament, will help hold the Government and, for that matter, the country as a whole, accountable for the progress we are making towards our 2050 target. Balancing all the factors that influence the optimum pathway to 2050 is a complex and technical task. The implications of the route chosen for the UK&#146;s economy and society will be far-reaching; we have accepted that in our debates so far.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08011414000125"></a>We are talking about big numbers; the impact assessment for the Bill talks about tens of billions of pounds. That is why it is important that the committee is able to provide independent, expert, transparent and credible analysis. That is also why it is so important that we get the balance of power between the different institutions exactly right. We have talked a lot so far about the relationship between the Government, the committee and Parliament; today we want to add &#147;the public&#148; to that list. If we do not have a system that is accountable to the public, we will have failed. I will come back to that point shortly.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08011414000126"></a>First, I want to set out how we see the committee. It is an arm&#146;s-length, advisory, non-departmental public body. By definition, therefore, it is independent of government. We have listened to the views of the Joint Committee of both Houses and others, and we have taken even greater steps to ensure the committee&#146;s independence, as set out in our response to the pre-legislative scrutiny process.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08011414000127"></a>Secondly, the Committee on Climate Change must be expert. Recruitment to the shadow body is well advanced. We are looking for world-class experts, who will be backed by a strongly analytical secretariat. We have increased the budget for the committee secretariat by about 50 per cent since the publication of the draft Bill less than a year ago. The quality of the committee&#146;s analysis will be key to its credibility; it must balance all the relevant factors&#151;scientific, social and economic&#151;in coming to its advice.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08011414000128"></a>Thirdly, the committee must be transparent. As I indicated in our discussions on Part 1, we are looking again at whether that can be strengthened further. We have already discussed the committee extensively during our previous discussions on Part 1, and it has become clear that in some important respects the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, takes a different approach to that of the Bill. I apologise for taking some extra time now, but I want to set this out clearly ahead of our debates on the rest of Part 2.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08011414000129"></a>We need to ensure that the system that we design in the Bill is democratically accountable. The proposals put forward previously would mean that the Committee on Climate Change would essentially be responsible for taking decisions. The Government&#146;s only options would be to do what the committee said or to do nothing at all. As I said previously, the decisions about how we reduce our carbon emissions will have far-reaching consequences and therefore, as the Joint Committee noted during pre-legislative scrutiny, it is only right   


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1070"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1070</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that those are made by an elected body. Delegating such decisions to an unelected committee would undermine democratic accountability.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08011414000130"></a>The history of the Bill demonstrates the importance of ensuring that we have a democratically accountable system that responds to public demand for action. If the Committee on Climate Change were responsible for taking decisions, how would it be accountable to the public? For instance, if the public wanted to reduce emissions more quickly than the committee, how would they ensure that the committee listened? Could they vote the committee out of office? Obviously not. For that matter, how would Parliament be able to hold the committee to account? We have well established mechanisms for Parliament to hold the Government of the day to account, and we would need to duplicate those so that Parliament could hold the committee to account. Ultimately, such decisions are for the Government of the day, who are accountable to Parliament and ultimately to the people of this country.</p>

I am sure that all advice and suggestions are welcomed by the House and by the Government. I have made it clear that it is an advisory committee. I digress, but I remember that when ACAS was set up it was not called ACAS&#151;I was on the Standing Committee in the other place&#151;and the &#147;A&#148; was added during the course of the legislation. The suggestion made by my noble friend is welcome, but I cannot comment on it today.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08011414000133"></a>The climate change committee&#146;s role is to provide the best possible advice on the level of budgets and to hold the Government and the country accountable for progress towards them. The Government&#146;s view is that the committee should not have a role in choosing the policy mechanisms most appropriate for meeting the budgets. I admit to agreeing with the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, when he said in last Tuesday&#146;s debate that if the committee starts making major policy recommendations to government, it would not depoliticise the decisions but would utterly politicise the committee.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08011414000134"></a>I will comment briefly on the contribution of my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. With him, I had the privilege of serving on the Public Accounts Committee in the other place&#151;the only Select Committee I ever served on, and I did so for two years&#151;and our period on it overlapped. I much enjoyed it and learned far more about the machinery of government in two years on that committee than I learned in 16 years on the Opposition Front Bench. I freely admit. I am also a strong supporter of the NAO. One of the reasons why the Public Accounts Committee never has a Minister as a witness is that it does not do policy. There is that distinction about the role of the NAO and the PAC, which does not do policy, although I know it comes across in the media as doing policy. In fact, a Minister is nominally a member of the committee. I fully take on board the point of my noble friend about the agreement on the publication of the reports. It is an  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1071"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1071</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>important point and one that is usually ignored and underrated by those who comment on the work of the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08011414000135"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said, there are already a number of bodies with expertise in specific areas to which the Government can look for recommendations on suitable policy instruments. What we need from the Committee on Climate Change&#151;this is why we are creating it&#151;is an entirely new body that provides independent, expert and credible advice on the science and economics involved and on how quickly, from a practical point of view, we can move towards our 2050 target.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08011414000136"></a>For the advice to be credible, it must be formulated outside the political arena and therefore above decisions on the particular choice of policy mechanisms. We should also bear in mind that any attempt to depoliticise decisions about policies by delegating them to the committee, for example, would also&#151;here again I am fully in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Teverson&#151;de-democratise them. We could take, for example, the question of nuclear power. The Government have set out their position. We know that there are a range of views within the country on the issue but it is important that the Government are held accountable by Parliament and the people for their decisions on matters such as this. We would not want the Committee on Climate Change to be responsible for these sorts of decisions. We strongly believe that our vision of the role and the functions of the committee is right. We need a body that is independent, transparent and influential with a strong focus on analysis and evidence. I very much expect that is what we will be able to create. As I have said, we have raised the budget for support by 50 per cent. It will be almost if not directly equivalent to the backup provided for the Stern committee; the House of Lords and the country received its valuable report just over a year ago.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08011414000137"></a>I turn to the amendments, which this debate hangs on. They involve simply changing the committee&#146;s name. So far as the name is concerned&#151;this is the advice I have received&#151;there is absolutely no legal significance within the machinery of government in which it will operate or in the context of the Bill itself. I am almost saying that it does not matter; the argument might therefore be, &#147;If it does not matter, do it&#148;. However, noble Lords have hung on the proposed change of name things other than a change of name. There has been an attempt to hang changes of functions, of authority and of power&#151;those involve going beyond the advisory role on the change of name. On that basis, of course, it is not an argument that the Government can accept. We believe that referring to the organisation&#151;it is a non-departmental public body&#151;as a committee is perfectly fine and we do not consider the amendment would add anything of value. I say that in the context of what we want the committee to do. If those who want to change the name are happy to accept the parameters of the vision of what we want it to do, that is one message. But that is not the message of the speeches of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor: they are hung with changing the functions and the nature of the committee. We want to keep it as it currently is,

In principle, I suspect that there is nothing wrong with that. The argument is that the facts and transparency of the Committee on Climate Change are inevitably going to have to lead to an agreement. It is not reporting as the NAO reports; it is reporting on a specific department&#146;s activities, looking at value for money, and economy, efficiency and effectiveness. In order to get the debate right, there must be some agreement on either the budget and how the money is being spent&#151;or mis-spent. When the NAO report is published, we do not want, as my noble friend says, the accounting officer of the department saying, &#147;Well, these conclusions and recommendations are all very well, but the facts in the report are wrong&#148;. Well, no Permanent Secretary is ever in a position to say that, because the reports are only published after getting the department&#146;s agreement.</p>

It is interesting that the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis&#151;in all innocence, I think&#151;revealed the weakness of what the Government are seeking to achieve when he suggested putting the word &#147;advisory&#148; in the title. As the Minister rightly said, all the Government want is an advisory committee; they do not want it to have any executive power.</p>

<a name="80114-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08011414000141"></a>There is a real argument between the Opposition and the Government on this issue. I suspect that when the Bill was first proposed the climate change committee was probably seen as being much more executive and powerful than has subsequently been presented in the Bill and the words of the Minister. Looking at how the Bill will operate, it creates great difficulties for future Governments if it has a purely advisory body with no executive function. I suspect that driving climate change initiatives across all government departments will be a momentous task which will need authority and direction. That is why a climate change committee&#151;or, as we prefer, &#147;the commission on climate change&#148;&#151;is central to this purpose.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08011414000273"></a> Schedule 1, page 32, line 5, at end insert &#147;not fewer than seven and not more than 12 members of which&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08011414000152"></a>The noble Lord said: This group of amendments changes the nominations procedure for and the composition of the Committee on Climate Change. The adjustments to the structure of the committee are designed to make it more able to deal with the added duties we have placed on it and to make sure that it is more independent and scientific.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08011414000153"></a>Amendment No. 123 increases the size of the committee. We feel that eight people are not quite adequate to cover the extra responsibilities that our other amendments confer on the committee. In addition, we have some concerns about the nature of the issues that the Bill obliges the committee to consider and investigate. We believe that the scope should be slightly widened to include environmental science, the actual impact of climate change on people and wildlife and a host of other matters. We have tabled amendments to that effect that will be discussed later. I mention them now because we feel that it is important to ensure that the committee is able to give its due attention to those issues as well as to nominate people with the relevant expertise. We therefore feel it is important to increase the size of the committee to not fewer than seven or more than 12 members.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08011414000154"></a>The next amendment in this group relates to the nomination procedure. To ensure the independence of the committee, we believe that about half the appointments should come from the Royal Society. That would depoliticise the committee so that it would not be formed of people potentially beholden to Ministers, political parties or special interest groups. I expect there will be criticism and that it will be said that the Royal Society has its own internal politics. In previous debates, it has been said that the world of science is not monolithic in terms of agreement and unified opinion. We take the view that a body such as the Royal Society will not wish to do other than seek the nomination of the best individuals available if it wishes to retain its reputation. I hope that noble Lords will agree with the intention of this amendment to provide a mechanism, which is lacking in the Bill, to ensure that appropriate experts and scientists are appointed to the committee through an apolitical, independent and credible process. The body has work to do, and it needs the best.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08011414000155"></a>What assurances can the Minister give that people appointed to the climate change committee will be the best available to serve the body? Even if he can explain that nominations and appointments will be made with the utmost care and conscientiousness&#151;and we do not doubt the Government&#146;s commitment to ensuring that the committee members are of the appropriate sort&#151;there needs to be a provision in the Bill regarding these authorities. However, the responsibility for appointing the chair should rest with the Secretary of State. Can the Minister give any indication of when the appointment of the chairman of the shadow climate change committee will be announced?</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08011414000156"></a>The Bill applies to the whole of the United Kingdom. The final decision in these matters, notwithstanding the role of national authorities, should rest here in Westminster. In addition to the material advantage to the workings of the committee and its increased independence&#151;indeed, perhaps because of these things&#151;our amendments would go a long way to increasing public confidence in the committee and its independence. That factor will allow the recommendations to carry more weight and have more impact. I beg to move.</p>

I understand the Minister&#146;s difficulty: this is a new committee that will be meeting an objective that has not been set in political terms before, and there will be a range of vastly different views about how it should be set up. The Secretary of State will say that they picked the numbers and that any further changes will be almost as random as the original numbers.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08011414000158"></a>There is a case for increasing the number of committee members. I have a slight issue with the selection of committee members from the Royal Society. It is an eminent body that has done an enormous amount of work in the area&#151;I know that many noble Lords have been to its debates on climate change&#151;but the world of science is multifaceted and there are areas that might not be represented by the membership of the Royal Society.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08011414000159"></a>The role of political interference needs to be looked at. The membership of the committee, even though it is advisory, will affect vastly different areas within the business and social community. We need only look at the debate on the role of Heathrow at our previous sitting to realise that that will be the case. There might be a call for a member of the CBI to be one of the committee members; that would have its own consequences&#151;maybe positive, maybe negative.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08011414000160"></a>I know that the Minister will set out the reasoning on why some of these amendments will not meet his favour, but I hope that he can give one assurance. Most of the amendments are to sub-paragraph (1). However, Paragraph 1(6) of the schedule states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08011414000274"></a>&#147;Any such order is subject to negative resolution procedure&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011414000261"></a>It is very tempting to table an amendment stating that there should be an affirmative procedure. I hope that, if the Government are to reject the amendments, this is an ongoing process that is to be looked at regularly. Although I would not table an amendment saying that there should be an affirmative resolution, I very much hope that, because of the unique nature of the

This is not the only Climate Change Bill that we will ever debate; I believe that we will come back to the subject extremely regularly. If the Government could give the assurance that government time may be made available to debate the membership of the committee, some of the concerns that we have set out in the amendments could be met.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has emphasised, the authority and standing of the Climate Change Committee is crucial. That will depend on the perceived quality and independence of its members. In particular, it must contain some members with real clout in the sciences of climate, environment and energy, along with the associated technologies&#151;the technologies for adaptation and for mitigation.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08011414000162"></a>The Royal Society is the UK&#146;s main academy of sciences and it is routinely consulted by the Government on appointments to research councils and the like over the whole range of science and technology. Its involvement in proposing members of the committee would send a signal that the Government value independent input and expertise.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08011414000163"></a>I have two provisos. First, it would not be reasonable to expect that a body such as the Royal Society could actually appoint members; its role could solely be to make nominations, to be consulted and to advise. That is the current situation with respect to appointments to research councils and similar bodies where the Royal Society is consulted. Secondly, if just one scientific body were singled out as an interface with government in this context, I think that the Royal Society would be regarded as the most appropriate one. It spans the whole range of science and technology. However, its expertise is spread thin in some areas. Were the society to be entrusted with any special role, it should consult not only among its own fellowship but also with the Royal Academy of Engineering, relevant professional institutions and specialised societies.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08011414000164"></a>The motivation behind the amendment&#151;that the Government should be obliged to draw on the best independent advice&#151;would surely have the wide support of all of the scientific community, because the standing of the Climate Change Committee is a pre-requisite for achieving the Bill&#146;s aims. But when the Bill comes back, the wording might perhaps spell out more explicitly that the national authorities should be obliged to seek and note the best independent advice, even if the society cannot be expected actually to make nominations itself.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, spoke just now of a committee that is independent and transparent, with a strong focus on analysis and research&#151;I think that he said the latter. Can this do it? I am not at all sure. We have just heard the comments about the potential role of the Royal Society, which is worth considering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08011414000166"></a>The committee is balanced between parts of the United Kingdom. It addresses business, the economic impact of changes that might be recommended, and so on. However, is there sufficient depth for original analysis of the problem and what ought to be done? I really doubt that there is proper balance on that. Is there deep knowledge of the problem and its worldwide impact? Again, I doubt it. I am especially worried about its potential analytical abilities. It therefore seems to me that the composition of this committee needs serious further work. We will be addressing other important aspects of the committee&#146;s composition, on international development, in the next group of amendments. I will return to the subject then, but we need to look again, thoroughly, at improving the committee&#146;s effectiveness and analytical power.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08011414000168"></a>I turn to the noble Baroness&#146;s remarks. These issues were carefully considered by the Joint Committee, and I do not share her view that the committee will be inadequate. Various suggestions have been made during our proceedings on how it might be strengthened. I see no reason why, given the right resources, its analytical powers should have shortcomings. My own experience of chairing such a public body is, I am glad to say, that as soon as it is in position, its members become strongly independent, wherever the nominations came from, and come together to act as an effective body. I hope that the noble Baroness will be surprised at how quickly it will start to be an effective team, wherever the representations come from.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08011414000169"></a>It is a great privilege, in a short debate, to follow the president of the Royal Society&#151;and the master of my old college. We need to listen carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Rees, said about exactly how the Royal Society might perform its task. He made it clear that he does not think its role is simply to nominate, but that it can play an even more effective role by putting forward and consulting on the names in the manner that he suggested. We shall have to look carefully at his proposals before we come back on Report.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08011414000170"></a>I have some doubt about only one of my noble friend&#146;s amendments, the one that refers to the need for appointments to</p>
<ul><a name="08011414000283"></a>&#147;be considered by a relevant select committee of the House of Commons&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1079"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1079</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08011414000262"></a>My doubt about that is simply one of timing. We are faced with an acute timing problem at present, because we all agree that there is an urgent need for the committee to get on with the tasks that it has been given. Indeed, if it does not get on quickly, it will not be able to fulfil some essential tasks in the timescales that we are setting. That is why it was such good news when we were told during the Joint Committee proceedings that an advisory committee was to be set up exactly as one was set up on the National Rivers Authority. I chaired that committee during the transition phase. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us a little more about how we are getting on with the appointments and the advisory committee.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08011414000171"></a>It will therefore not be possible, unless we seriously delay the proceedings in a way that might be very damaging, to have a great parliamentary approval process on this occasion. I can, however, see the advantage of building such a process into the legislation so that when further appointments are made in later years, Parliament has a role. That is my only qualification of the various amendments that my noble friend has tabled. I am absolutely certain that it is essential, if we are to have the kind of skills and knowledge that we need to be represented, to increase the size, as the Joint Committee proposed. I therefore hope that my noble friend will press the amendments to a vote at an appropriate moment, if not today.</p>

I have already identified six committees that would want to influence events, including the Transport Committee; the Trade and Industry Committee, with its responsibilities for energy; the Agriculture Committee; the Science and Technology Committee; and the environmental protection committee. All I am saying is that unless you create a new structure in the form that I suggested in my amendment last week&#151;a sort of joint ad hoc Select Committee that combines all these committees, which are influencing this particular appointment, on the basis of the Quadripartite Committee in the House of Commons&#151;some competitive differences might develop among committee chairmen in the other place.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08011414000173"></a>More widely, the amendments are premature. I am not altogether convinced that the model&#151;which this House appears to be approving at this stage&#151;for the powers and the structure of this committee and the way in which it relates to other committees in the tripartite arrangement to which the noble Lord refers and which my noble friend has qualified as an almost quadripartite arrangement by bringing the public into the equation as well, will work. When the House of Commons deals with these matters, it may want to amend these areas&#151;hopefully. If it does, the amendments as a series may look very different.</p>

My first point is about numbers. In the draft Bill, the committee, if we include the chairman, is six to nine people. The inevitable social pressures will tend to make the number nearer the upper limit. If  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1080"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1080</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>my arithmetic is correct, the amendment would make this eight to 13. This is not a make-or-break decision, but I am in favour of the smaller committee for a reason that is science-based. Many people think of Northcote Parkinson as a writer of comic prose; I think of him as one of the more substantial contributors to social science. One of the things that he did was to trace from the cabal to the Star Chamber and to Harold Wilson&#146;s &#147;kitchen cabinet&#148; and outline the fact that as committees inevitably enlarged beyond about eight people, they began to condense out an inner core so that they could function. I strongly believe that &#147;fewer is more&#148; in this context but, as I say, that is a minor point.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08011414000175"></a>My second point concerns the idea of embedding in the Bill the requirement for broad consultation on the constitution in putting together the Committee on Climate Change. One might think that this is already covered in the protocols for science advice and policy making that were issued way back in 1996 and that have gone through successive rounds of strengthening in the hands of the regimes of two Chief Scientific Advisers. These enjoin that in any enterprise such as this there should be such consultation with appropriate experts. Writing it down and doing it are two different things. A deliberately vague but none the less specific example is one really important committee that was put together not that long ago to deal with scientific aspects of a particular debate for which there was another committee dealing with the general public consultation. The putting together of this committee was in the hands of a junior official who consulted within the DTI and Defra. He put together a committee of 20 people&#151;they were invited without any further consultation outside&#151;on a subject for which genetics and ecological science were extremely relevant. In its first instance, the committee ended up with no geneticist and no really front-rank ecologist. As this was perceived, six people were added ex post facto, which, going back to my first point, made a committee of 26 people. I thank my stars that I was not part of it.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08011414000176"></a>My third point is how you spell out this consultation. While I very much respect what my noble friend&#151;my genuine friend&#151;Lord Rees said, I do not think that it is a very good idea to mention any one institution, partly because that would not be totally appropriate even if we were to think of one institution. In this context, the science does not mean only physical and biological science; it also involves, importantly, and arguably more importantly, social and economic science. I derive a good deal of narcissistic satisfaction from the fact that during my presidency we somewhat enlarged the ambit of the Royal Society to begin to include the harder edges of social and economic science, but we still could not claim to be representative of it.</p>

<a name="80114-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08011414000177"></a>Beyond that, I am reluctant to see the society included like this. Although you could get round it by putting the Royal Academy of Engineering alongside us, whenever you take such action you are drawing a line that has a lot of dissatisfied people on the other side. I should like to ask the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, in whom I have faith in these matters, to take this under advisement and think about how most wisely to incorporate in the relevant place in the Bill a firm injunction for outside consultation. In the first instance  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1081"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1081</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of putting this together and tentatively beginning to think about it, even as the Bill goes forward, competent head-hunters have been consulting widely with the Royal Society and private individuals. We have made a good start, but let us make sure that it continues by appropriately and non-institutionally specifically spelling it out in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="08011414000178"></a><b><a name="80114-0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08011414000646"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> The noble Lords, Lord Rees and Lord May, mentioned engineering as a subject which has not yet been raised as necessary to the expertise of the Committee on Climate Change, and it is a serious omission. Whether it can be corrected by incorporating a requirement for the national authorities to seek advice from the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering, or whether it would mean, as the noble Lord, Lord May, just said, that you then would have a queue of other very distinguished bodies asking why they were not included, I am not competent to say. But I urge the Minister that, if anything is written in the Bill about consultation, it should certainly be broader than the Royal Society and should include the Royal Academy of Engineering.</p>

None the less, the discussion is extremely interesting. Like the noble Lord, Lord May, I think that, on the whole, small committees are good when they are executive committees. When they are advisory committees, you want the widest possible circle of advice that it is reasonable to obtain. On balance, I am very much in favour of my noble friend Lord Taylor&#146;s suggestion that the committee might be slightly larger, but, as I say, we do not know with any certainty what the Government&#146;s thinking was. The important bit will come when the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has to justify what is written in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08011414000180"></a>It is, as I say, difficult to know how the Government arrived at their conclusions. We do not know their thinking. I agree that to nominate just one body to have the right to nomination, however erudite and widely spread its membership might be, would probably be wrong. I like the comment by the noble Lord, Lord Rees, if I understood him correctly, that he felt that the appropriate role for the Royal Society is to advise the Government in this field. But, again, we do not know whether that was the Government&#146;s thinking. Until we get those answers, we are all going to be wandering round with our own opinions. On that happy thought I am going to sit down.</p>

I have two minor points and one more substantive one. The first minor one relates to the size of this committee. I would give some support to the idea of having a slightly larger committee. This committee is going to have to have quite a lot of close, tight argument and discussion. On the other hand, it is going to have to cover a fairly wide area. I would have thought that both of those objectives could be met with the committee going up to about 12 members. I

<a name="80114-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08011414000182"></a>The second minor point is that I am slightly alarmed at the thought of a Commons committee scrutinising the composition of this committee. It is awfully reminiscent of confirmatory hearings, of which there is experience in the North American context, and there would be scope for some politicisation. Although it probably would not happen, the possibility is there.</p>

<a name="80114-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08011414000183"></a>My main point relates to the proposal, which has already been raised, for nomination by the Royal Society or other bodies. As soon as you have multiple bodies making nominations, you no longer have a team. This committee has to work as a team. If you have different bodies nominating different members, they will come to represent constituencies. That is not the way to establish a coherent body that covers the bases. It is extremely important that nominations are made as part of one coherent operation, with all the advice suggested by my noble friends and others Members of the Committee, but it will have to be a coherent whole to create a working team.</p>

If so, the size of the committee as currently proposed is almost certainly inadequate. I would suggest that the adaptation issues are of a different order, requiring different skills and different expertise, and that they are dealt with elsewhere, but it would help the Committee considerably to know whether the Minister thinks that that falls within the committee&#146;s remit.</p>

He mentioned adaptation, and Amendment No. 129 will require the inclusion of another member of the committee. However, my feelings are more in line with those of the noble Lord, Lord May&#151;the smaller the better. If you have two lawyers in a room you will get three arguments. I have no doubt that if you have nine scientists in a room you will have many fewer arguments than you would if you had 12 in a room together.</p>

<a name="80114-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08011414000186"></a>I come back, however, to the practicalities of some of the amendments before us. My question relates to what happens if the national authorities do not agree. At the moment they are due to appoint the chair. If the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, advises the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State that the ideal man to chair the committee happens to be very pro-nuclear power, what is Mr Salmond, the First Minister of Scotland, going to say to that? Will there be endless arguments? Given that, I support my noble friend Lord Taylor in saying that the chair must be appointed by the Secretary of State. However, where my noble friend may have missed a point is that if the national authorities are going to appoint the deputy chair, surely the Secretary of State ought to appoint that person as well.</p>

<a name="80114-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08011414000187"></a>I go back to my main point. Can the Minister tell us what is to happen in the case of a disagreement between the national authorities? Further, on Amendment  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1083"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1083</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>No. 126, tabled by my noble friend, why should it be a Select Committee of the House of Commons? If it is necessary at all for there to be any parliamentary scrutiny, it should be undertaken by both Houses. However, I would prefer for there to be none.</p>

I rise to commend the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. Later we will debate in a series of amendments what is to happen about adaptation as opposed to mitigation and how that is to be scrutinised independently. Although I certainly would not favour the climate change committee being given that role because I think that it should be dealt with by a small, focused and specialist committee, nevertheless if adaptation were to be given to the climate change committee in order to ensure that that important and growing element of climate change is given proper prominence, that would have an impact on the membership of the committee.</p>

<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="08011414000189"></a><b><a name="80114-0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08011414000652"></a>Lord Turnbull:</b> I stand with those who favour a larger committee. The Monetary Policy Committee has nine members and deals with one branch of one science. Given the breadth of scientific, social and economic issues that this committee will have to deal with, if the MPC requires nine members, it is almost certain that the climate change committee needs more.</p>

<a name="80114-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08011414000190"></a>I am puzzled that the original text of the Bill uses the word &#147;appoint&#148; while the amendment we are discussing uses &#147;nominate&#148;. That word usually means that someone puts forward a name and someone else decides it. I do not think that &#147;nominate&#148; is the right word if it is intended that someone else should have the right of choice. Either we should go back to the word &#147;appoint&#148; or not at all.</p>

<a name="80114-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08011414000191"></a>A further argument that has been put forward is that we are in such a hurry that if we believe in the principle of parliamentary approval of appointments&#151;I am not sure that I necessarily do&#151;at least the chair of the committee should be covered by it. We are engaging here in a 50-year endeavour and I do not believe that it can honestly be said that the few weeks which will be taken up by the approval process is material relative to the gain we believe that we will get from it.</p>

<a name="80114-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08011414000192"></a>Lastly, we have to remember that this is not all the work of these eight or 12 people. The committee will have a staff with a chief executive and will require experts in many disciplines&#151;indeed, broken down into the subsidiary parts of those disciplines. The actual expertise of the body will not reside solely in its members, commissioners or whatever we like to call them.</p>

I should declare an interest in that while I am not a scientist, I am probably the most out of date engineer in the House. I still pay my subs, but it is a long while since I last practised. However, I still have that attachment. Some of the points that have been made jump ahead of  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1084"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1084</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>where we are. In particular, the comments of my noble friend Lord Puttnam apply to Amendment No. 158. However, by and large we are talking about the numbers to make up the committee. I am not going to go to the stake on the size of the committee, but I shall stick to the line today.</p>

<a name="80114-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08011414000194"></a>It is a fair point. We want a smallish committee rather than a grand forum, and that is probably the thinking here. The thrust of the amendments, as has been said, is to increase the size of the committee. We are dealing with a couple of things here. The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, pointed out that this group of amendments takes away the input of the devolved Administrations into the appointment of the committee&#146;s chair. The amendments also have an aim that relates to the nominations from the Royal Society. My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours pointed out that the relevant Select Committee at the other end is not clearly available to everybody, whatever subject you look at, simply because the committee structure down there has changed over the years.</p>

<a name="80114-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08011414000195"></a>The practical effect of the amendments is to create a larger committee of between seven and 12&#151;or eight and 13, as the noble Lord, Lord May of Oxford, pointed out&#151;who have been approved or appointed. The intention of the amendments is to create a larger body with a focus on climate change, to reduce the discretion of national authorities and the role of the devolved Administrations, and to bring further transparency and rigour to the process by giving Parliament a role in approving the appointments. I am not in a position to discuss hearings for confirmation of roles. There is a role for that and I have my own views on it. They are not matters covered by the present arrangements in another place, although from time to time I hear ministerial colleagues complaining that people have been appointed to roles but are completely incapable of answering both to the media and concerned experts. Going before a committee of MPs might sometimes sort out whether someone can explain what they are doing. Half the battle is not the doing but the explaining and being accountable. That is an issue.</p>

<a name="80114-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08011414000196"></a>The Committee on Climate Change will be the first body of its kind to bring together different areas of expertise among its members, from the fields of climate science and policy, economics and, of course, business competitiveness and financial management. As I mentioned in a previous debate, we are talking about effects that run into tens of billions of pounds. The areas of expertise broadly mirror the matters that the committee is required to take into account in its advice on the level of the carbon budget, listed in Clause 10 of the Bill. The committee will have a chairperson and between five and eight members appointed jointly by the Secretary of State, Scottish Ministers, Welsh Ministers and the relevant Northern Ireland department. It will be a UK-wide body. There are plenty of examples I could give of UK-wide bodies like this that are now appointed with the devolved Administrations, where we have discussions and find perfectly acceptable solutions. I am unaware of major clashes. I have not come armed with a list, but the system of collective appointments has worked extremely well since devolution came onto the scene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08011414000197"></a>By definition, the approach in the Bill has been agreed with the devolved Administrations. I put this on the record. We certainly cannot accept Amendment No. 125, which would remove the devolved Administrations&#146; input from the process of appointing the chair. On Amendments Nos. 121 and 131, on the size of the committee, we think five to eight, plus the chair, strikes a balance between ensuring that the committee retains a good mix of relevant expertise and creating a committee that is focused and dynamic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08011414000198"></a>Should the committee, once established, consider it necessary to increase its size, we have made provision in the Bill for the Secretary of State to amend the number of committee members, with the consent of the devolved Administrations, recognising that the volume and type of work given to the committee is bound to vary over time. This is a long-term process and we do not see why the number of members needs to be changed now before the committee has even been appointed&#151;I shall come on to that in a moment&#151;or begun its work. Nor do we see why the flexibility to vary the size of the committee as its workload fluctuates over time needs to be removed from the Bill. I believe that Amendment No. 131 would take away the flexibility to change the size of the committee, so it must be a probing amendment by definition. The relevant subsection is in the Bill for that very reason&#151;to take account of the committee&#146;s workload over time.</p>

This is fully in line with the Nolan principles. I regret that I have nothing further to report today. For what it is worth, I have advised that I will be in an extremely difficult position if there is no designated shadow chair by Report. Clearly, that is the first appointment because the chair would appoint the members. That is the normal process which works extremely well in a range of other bodies in Whitehall. I do not know when Report will be but we are keen to get the Bill on the statute book as soon as possible so that there is no undue delay. However, the appointment is being overseen by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. Advertisements were placed and an executive search agency was also used. However, I do not know when the appointment will be made. I suppose that it will be made shortly. I hope that it occurs as soon as possible and before Report but I cannot guarantee that. I am not saying that it will occur then because I have no evidence that that will be the case. However, as I say, I will be in an extremely difficult position if it does not occur by Report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08011414000200"></a>The appointments are being conducted in an independent and transparent manner. That is the main message. They are not being decided by Ministers behind closed doors. As the Green Paper, <I>The Governance of Britain</I>, highlights, public appointments that are subject to oversight by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments should not usually be subject to additional scrutiny by a Select Committee. As an expert independent body, the committee will play a vital role in advising government on how to manage

The science is fundamental and clearly this aspect of expertise must be reflected on the committee but that does not mean to say that the committee should be composed predominantly of scientists. As I said, it will look at a broad range of issues and get the right balance of scientific, economic, business and, indeed cultural issues. So we are not convinced that asking a scientific body&#151;and one as esteemed as the Royal Society would be an obvious one if that were the route to be taken&#151;to nominate half the members would be the best approach.</p>

<a name="80114-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08011414000201"></a>When the Committee on Climate Change is up and working, its members and secretariat will be bound to consult all kinds of outside bodies with the necessary expertise, including, I imagine, both corporate and individual members of the Royal Society, engineering institutions, and business and finance. It is not a case of the committee, whatever the number of its members&#151;which may be small, as we suggest&#151;doing everything itself. It will have to touch base with a range of expertise across society. I am absolutely certain that the bodies that have been mentioned with regard to nominating members will be involved in this work. However, we cannot accept the amendments on nominating members. As I set out on the previous occasion, Clause 27 already requires the committee to set out reasons for its advice on carbon budgets so it will be clear how it has balanced climate science with the other issues which it has to take into account.</p>

<a name="80114-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08011414000202"></a>I repeat that the process of appointment is being regulated and monitored by the commissioner. There are some parliamentary Questions that I understand will be answered on Wednesday. That is the advice I have been given. I have not seen them or the draft Answers yet but I understand that I will be in a position to answer them on behalf of my ministerial colleagues on Wednesday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08011414000203"></a>As for the devolved Administrations, in some ways&#151;I am thinking aloud here&#151;the noble Lord gives an example about how the chairman might be pro or anti something. The fact is that this is an advisory committee, not an executive one. The example I gave in my previous speech was on the nuclear power issue. The Government have set out their position clearly. The climate change committee is an advisory committee, not an executive one. What the First Minister in Scotland has a view on should not figure. It will be the merit of the science and the quality of the individual because the Government are taking the overall decision, as was clearly indicated by the White Paper last week. To the best of my knowledge, there have been no issues where we have not been able to reach agreement with the devolved Administrations over the appointment of people to bodies. That was set down in the protocols at the time of devolution and it is working quite satisfactorily.</p>

The amendment would ensure that that responsibility is integrated into the committee and into the Government&#146;s overall strategy on climate change. A few months ago, I was in America meeting political and religious leaders about the environment. The faith communities have a major role in changing hearts and minds about the threat of global warming in America, Europe and throughout the world. In Orlando and Washington, I was involved in leading seminars with evangelical leaders, imams and rabbis, whose increasing concern is focused on the impact of climate change on the poor of the world. I also had meetings on Capitol Hill, facilitated by the British Embassy, with officials in Speaker Pelosi&#146;s office and with the staff of Senator Boxer, who are closely involved in the climate security Act that is going through Congress.</p>

That has been the position adopted by the Government in both the Kyoto Protocol, where they took such an effective lead, and in the Bali negotiations. The amendments seek to bring to the heart of the committee&#146;s work this international dimension. To do so would strengthen Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s standing on the international stage and give an example to other nations that we cannot and must not take decisions without regard to international negotiations and international development.</p>

I regret that, because of duties in Liverpool, I had to withdraw from the debate at the last moment, but I heard the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. Noble Lords will remember that he made an impassioned plea that this was at heart a moral issue. He compared the Bill with the legislation to abolish the slave trade. One of the turning points in the parliamentary mood that helped to secure the votes to pass the legislation was when the parliamentary commission heard evidence from a former slave ship commander, John Newton. That brought not just the facts but the experience of slave trading to the heart of the legislative process. The amendments seek to bring the experience of climate change to the heart of the Government&#146;s decision making. I know that the Committee on Climate Change will include an expert on climate science and that person will certainly bring facts, but someone with expertise in international development would bring the human experience of the impact of climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08011414000217"></a>The tragedy of the present situation of global warming is that the poor in developing countries are already feeling and suffering disastrously from the effects of climate change. They do not, however, have the power to do anything about it. Those of us who possess the power do not as yet feel the full impact of our actions and have therefore been slow to bring in the necessary measures. These amendments and the proposal to have on the Committee on Climate Change someone with expertise in international development will ensure that the voice of the poor and the plight of the powerless are heard and seen at the heart of Government and, most importantly, will underline the urgency which is still lacking in the popular mood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08011414000220"></a>I fail to understand, therefore, why it is necessary to include this particular provision, much as I have sympathy with the points which have been raised.</p>

I am glad that they have been put down and also separated out, because this is a useful reminder of what the Bill is all about. As so many speakers made clear at Second Reading, and as the right reverend Prelate has said so effectively, climate change is likely to have the greatest impact on developing countries and is already doing so. Given that the poorest people are less able to withstand the additional pressures and shocks of climate change, they are at the forefront of the impact of climate change. It is therefore extremely important that what we do in Britain is also assessed on its impact on developing countries in terms of whether we are doing enough and what we are doing. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08011414000222"></a>To address what the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, has just said, there has been some discussion in previous sittings about climate credits. These could be adopted as a way forward; they might benefit the United Kingdom in tackling climate change and  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1090"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1090</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>meeting its targets but they might not have a beneficial effect on developing countries. Therefore, we need to look at this in an international context. Climate credits could be positive or negative in developing countries&#151;there are examples of both. We need that expertise in international development on the climate change committee to take this into consideration and to be sure that we are doing that.</p>

<a name="80114-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08011414000223"></a>As I mentioned in the debate on the previous amendment, it looks to me as if this committee is rather weighted towards business, economics and industry. I worry about the depth and nature of its expertise; we addressed a number of those issues just now. To be honest I did not feel that that was totally addressed by the Minister in his concluding remarks. International development is also an area which the committee must address, and we need to see that represented on it. I therefore argue that a more balanced composition should include expertise on the impact of climate change in the developing world.</p>

<a name="80114-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08011414000224"></a>We will later come to the subject of adaptation, raised by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, in the previous group. That is obviously extremely important and must be rapidly developed, particularly for the benefit of developing countries. Again, there are opportunities for us here in the United Kingdom, and the committee&#146;s expertise must include that as well. That should benefit developing countries.</p>

<a name="80114-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08011414000225"></a>Having a committee member knowledgeable about climate impacts in developing countries might also help to provide a strong international perspective, which is clearly critical in what the committee is doing, to ensure that purely domestic economic factors do not dominate what the committee decides. It is of course not sufficient to suggest that climate scientists on the committee will themselves adequately address and safeguard this area; it would obviously depend entirely on the expertise and interest of those particular climate scientists and whether they had in interest in international development. The Bill is about a global problem. The climate change committee should undoubtedly have expertise in this area among its members.</p>

We decided last September to commission a report from Dr Catherine Cameron&#151;one of the advisers to the noble Lord, Lord Stern, in the preparation of his report&#151;on the likely impact of climate change on children in the developing world.

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08011414000235"></a>In the same speech, Mr Brown mentioned the Iwokrama project, which is an area of 360,000 hectares dedicated by the people of Guyana as a research station for the benefit of humanity as a whole, to be administered by the Commonwealth. This is a good example of the need for the committee to have knowledge and experience of international development. Although, as the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, has said, its duties are primarily concerned with emissions in the United Kingdom, it has a duty under Clause 27(1)(c)(i) to advise the Secretary of State on the contribution towards meeting the carbon budget that should be made by trading schemes. Although initially only the ETS is set for implementation, others which may be developed in the future will cover activities by the United Kingdom in developing countries. There are activities under the Kyoto Protocol&#146;s clean development mechanism under which, according to the Government&#146;s helpful briefing paper 5, $7 billion was invested in 2006 with another $25 billion in the pipeline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08011414000236"></a>It might be argued that, so far, rainforest preservation is not covered by the clean development mechanism, but in his reply to me last week, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said that the Government&#146;s priority was to reduce emissions from deforestation and that, to achieve this, agreement had been reached at Bali for a framework of positive incentives. Deforestation accounts for between 18 and 25 per cent of global carbon emissions according to the Global Canopy Programme, and that has to be compared with the 3 per cent for which aviation is responsible, on which Members of the Committee rightly focused attention last Wednesday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08011414000237"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, also mentioned the Government&#146;s review of financing mechanisms to reduce deforestation, which was announced last September and is expected to be fed into the next UN climate change conference in Copenhagen in 2009. Meanwhile, under Clause 30(2)(a), the committee might be asked to advise on the limits that are proposed to be set by any trading scheme that may be proposed involving measures to prevent deforestation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08011414000238"></a>In another answer, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said that we were discussing a proposal by President Jagdeo, in a speech to the Commonwealth finance Ministers in Georgetown last October, to make Guyana's rainforests a carbon sink for the rest of the world. Mr Jagdeo reminded his audience that the Stern review had described avoiding deforestation as a highly cost-effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Since then, the Brazilian environment Minister, Marina Silva, has suggested extending the Jagdeo plan to include the Brazilian and Venezuelan parts of the Amazon rainforest, which is an excellent idea from several points of view. One is that Brazil is the fourth largest contributor to global warming because of the way in which it is now burning up its forests and if

<a name="80114-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08011414000239"></a>An international Amazon carbon sink scheme, on the lines of what is already happening with British help in the Congo basin, could be financed by the rest of the world, along with the Essequibo Peace Park, under which it is suggested that a band of forest on both sides of the Venezuela-Guyana border should be reserved for the indigenous peoples who straddle the frontier. The maintenance of peace between the two neighbours, and the protection of indigenous people, could thus be added to the reduction of global warming as benefits to be achieved by halting deforestation in the Amazon basin.</p>

<a name="80114-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08011414000240"></a>Considering that every hectare lost increases the height of the carbon mountain that the world has to climb, it is alarming that we have to wait until the Copenhagen meeting in December 2009 before a comprehensive mechanism is launched. Surely it would be possible to look at interim solutions that would match regional needs and put together international consortia to finance viable proposals, as we do, for instance, in the case of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which is financed by contributions from member states.</p>

<a name="80114-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08011414000241"></a>The Norwegians have announced funding of $500 million a year for the next five years on forest projects and if all other states made proportionate contributions, the total would be more than enough to cover the $20 billion a year that Stern estimates is needed to halt deforestation altogether. We talk about $20 per hectare per year, as compared with $300 per hectare per year spent by the European Union on the conservation services provided by Europe's farmers. So, the problem should not be finding the money but determining the basis on which it is to be allocated. If the committee had that necessary expertise, it could provide advice on President Jagdeo's scheme or, better still, on the expanded Brazilian version. I strongly support the amendment. I believe that it has great practical value in the Bill as it stands and would have even greater value if we were to expand the functions of the committee, as has been suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08011414000243"></a>The noble Baroness talked about food. Of course, food security is greatly affected by climate change. The Centre for Global Development has done some important research on the impact of climate change on declining agricultural productivity in a range of developing countries. This is obviously a vital part of any analysis of the weight of the dangers we face. There is the question of the analysis and its credibility. There is also the question of the very particular role that the

For example, it is charged with not putting undue burdens on UK business or unduly reducing UK competitiveness. That is a proper role and object for the committee, but who will make the case for developing countries? Who will make sure that their safety is not risked by an inadequate reduction? There has to be a capacity to put that case strongly within the committee as it comes to its advice.</p>

<a name="80114-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08011414000244"></a>I listened very carefully to what the Minister said about the duties of the committee and I believe that even as it stands now the amendment is entirely consonant with what we have heard this afternoon about its role. I hope that as we all try to work to ensure that the UK has some international leadership role in this matter, we will strengthen that by being specific. It may well be that the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, is entirely right and that it is the Government&#146;s settled intention to build this dimension into the membership of the committee. It would be good to have an indication from the Minister about whether that is the intention because this amendment would strengthen one of the purposes of the Bill, which is to confirm the international leadership of the UK.</p>

<a name="80114-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08011414000249"></a>A lot of the work funded at institutions such as Kew recognises the seamless nature of the science in addressing these climate change issues. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, talked about the work in the Congo basin; that is not Kew work, but Kew is working in Borneo, Madagascar and many other countries. I find it inconceivable that the Committee on Climate Change would not be well plugged into this science. It may come under the category of environmental or climate change science, but there must be knowledge of how relevant these natural carbon sinks are, to what extent they are threatened and to what extent that therefore impacts on procurement or land management policies in this country, and much else besides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08011414000250"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, deserves credit for supporting Kew and other institutes in developing this international portfolio. He will recognise that it is inconceivable that the committee would not be aware of this work going on around the world and how we lock into it. I accept, with the right reverend Prelate, that as it is inconceivable that the committee would not be aware and have a degree of expertise in this, it should not also be included in the Bill. That is why I support the amendment.</p>

Noble Lords are right about the work of Kew. From my limited knowledge, it would be inconceivable that the climate change committee and its secretariat were not aware of the international work that goes on and is led from Kew. I honestly do not think that there is a great deal of difference between us on this. I will briefly set out comments on the amendment by explaining Paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 1. It gives a useful context, because there are further amendments to the paragraph in the next group. Then I can avoid having to make the same speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08011414000252"></a>Paragraph 1(3) gives a list, in alphabetical order, of the areas of expertise and knowledge that are desirable in the overall composition of the committee. As will be seen, the areas of expertise broadly mirror the matters set out in Clause 10, which the committee is required to take into account in its advice on the level of the carbon budget. The list of expertise is not meant to be exhaustive. It is the make-up of the committee &#147;as a whole&#148;, as it says in the Bill. It is the expertise and experience that are provided collectively that are important. The list of expertise is drafted broadly to provide scope for the national authorities and the chair to appoint members with specific expertise as the committee&#146;s work demands. The list does not prevent national authorities appointing members with expertise in areas that are not on the list, if they and the chair believe that that will help the committee&#146;s work. Specifically, Amendment No. 130A seeks to add international development to the list of expertise. I and my ministerial colleagues are sympathetic to the intention behind the amendment. I am conscious that

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08011414000253"></a>It is worth reminding the Committee that Clause 10(2)(h) makes it clear that the climate change committee can look at any issue it wants to.

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08011414000254"></a>It is vital that our approach to tackling climate change is considered in the context of the wider international effort and impacts. It must take the widest possible perspective. For instance, the committee will need to consider international developments in climate science and technology, as well as emission reduction commitments made by other countries and the European Union. All those issues will be relevant to the committee's work. Therefore, we are not convinced that there is a compelling case for a specific reference to international development, as proposed in the amendment, although we understand what that means.</p>

As I said, there is a reference to it in Clause 10, which does not carry over to Schedule 1. I am not saying that that should be the exact wording, but the reference is not there. I say that not in the context of international development, but it is quite important to get the message into Schedule 1. That is the message from this debate.</p>

It is extensive and, by and large, we feel that it is a good list. However, there seems to be one rather important gap: the environment. The aim of the Bill is to stop climate change. Surely the aim of stopping climate change is to protect the environment and the inhabitants of it. Thus, we feel that it is very important for the nomination process to consider environmental science, which we know is a very broad term, when selecting members.</p>

<a name="80114-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08011436000007"></a>Because the efforts to reduce carbon emissions will be immensely wide ranging, it will be important to have expertise on the committee able to give advice and make decisions on the impact of climate change and our efforts to stop it on the environment. As the list of different kinds of experience already includes many of the areas on which proposals on climate change and its reduction will have an impact, we expect that adding this extra one should not create too much controversy. If the Minister feels that the committee should not seek to find someone with experience in environmental science, I should be very interested to know his reasons why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08011436000008"></a>Amendment No. 130 in this group, which is tabled by Liberal Democrat Members, seeks a similar goal, but it is far more prescriptive. We certainly support the spirit of that amendment, but we feel that having a more open term would give those involved in the nominations procedure more flexibility. Is the Minister willing to comment on the degree of flexibility on appointments that he hopes will exist in the nomination procedure? Is the idea behind the clause to provide rather strict guidelines on appointments, such as that only people who are genuinely qualified for the specific tasks are nominated, or is it more flexible? I note the comments made by the Minister in response to previous amendments this afternoon. Which does he think the more desirable? I beg to move.</p>

I absolutely agree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach. How can we have this list here without the environment, however described, included? We are being completely consistent here. The Minister mentioned Clause 10, which has its own list. We tabled an amendment to Clause 10 to the effect that the committee had to consider the area of conservation of biodiversity, organisms, ecological systems, and so on. At that point, I remember that he admonished me, saying that it was already an obligation on all government departments and public bodies to consider that. If that is included in the list of attributes of the people on the committee, I am sure that it will help to ensure that any Secretary of State or future Minister is not subject to judicial review and will protect that area.</p>

The UK's emissions are, very roughly, one-third from households, one-third from industry and one-third from transport. We also had a long discussion about aviation and shipping in their international as well as their national context. Although we might disagree about when the provision comes in and how it is counted, as I was reminded by the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, everyone was on board, including the Government, in making sure that it appeared at some point. It is therefore important that there is some expertise in that broad area of transport, whether passenger or freight, as well. The need to have that expertise on the committee as well deserves careful consideration.</p>

Of the two amendments, Amendment No. 128 and Amendment No. 130, I greatly prefer Amendment No. 128, because it is a catch-all. I must agree that not having environmental science expertise is inconceivable, as I said in debate on an earlier amendment. At one stage, I wondered whether one should try to include expertise in land management on the committee. I recognise that that would sound too much like special pleading&#151;as a land manager myself, I would have to declare all sorts of interests. I would be quite content, providing that there is expertise in environmental science, that that would include all such expertise and include under its umbrella land management.</p>

The difficulty with Amendment No. 128 is that for many professional scientists, climate science would be an example of environmental science. Therefore, there may be a taxonomy error in thinking of environmental science as a separate category. If one were going to add to the expertise in the spirit of the points made by others in this debate, I suggest that the term should be &#147;ecology and conservation&#148;, because those are the areas of expertise currently missing from the proposed committee.</p>

I apologise also for not putting down a probing amendment on the subject that I am going to raise, and I hope that I am not covering old ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08011436000016"></a>I am raising effectively the issue from that Sherlock Holmes episode, in the Silver Blaze case, of the dog that barked in the night. The significance of the dog was of course that it did not bark. The various listed paragraphs being debated, to which these amendments seek to add, cover different elements of experience, whether in industry, science or activity. They are comprehensive, and I have listened to the efforts to add to them.</p>

<a name="80114-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08011436000017"></a>Nearly 50 years ago, I was the first head-hunter in the United Kingdom, and in effect I can be held responsible, or guilty, for creating that profession in this land. When talking to our clients, one thing that preoccupied us from the beginning was the specifications that would underlie the purpose that the organisation sought to achieve by an appointment. The Minister may well tell me that it is not relevant to this list&#151;although I would welcome knowing where else it might appear in the Bill, if it is not&#151;but there is also the issue of being a change agent. Great organisations may require change from time to time: I cite as random examples the BBC or the National Health Service. On the whole, you would be making a mistake to embark on achieving those changes without having somebody who had previously been responsible for managing change involved in the process.</p>

<a name="80114-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08011436000018"></a>I realise the difference between the advisory role here and that of the Government, and it may well be that the Government feel that they have within their ranks that sort of person. I am not asking the Minister to repeat all that he said on the previous amendments about the rationale of the list. I also recognise that nothing prevents this particular quality from being added without it being mentioned in the Bill. However, does the Minister consider that experience, in human terms, to be desirable or even necessary? I would welcome knowing that. Secondly, how does the Minister think that it will work its way into the fabric of the process if we have nothing specific about it in the Bill?</p>

It may be that change managers are involved in the practical effects of implementing advice from the Committee on Climate Change. I do not know that, but what I am about to say might satisfy the noble Lord. I want to make it clear that what is written in the Bill should, and must, be read in the broadest possible sense. We are not being prescriptive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08011436000020"></a>Amendment No. 128 proposes adding &#147;environmental science&#148;, but &#147;climate science&#148; is already included in the list of expertise. I am not certain whether environmental science would include climate science, and, on the point that the noble Lord, Lord Krebs made, perhaps environmental science should have been there and not climate science, as it would have covered everything. In other words, the Bill is to be read in the broadest possible sense. That is not an excuse for not having an answer; that is just how the list has been put together. It looks at the make-up of the committee as a whole.</p>

<a name="80114-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08011436000021"></a>As I said, the list in paragraph 1(3) is purely in alphabetical order and broadly mirrors Clause 10. I am not going to the stake for ruling numbers out, but for its smooth functioning the committee has to be kept to a manageable size. We think that the extended sizes proposed are certainly too large, but there is flexibility in the Bill to change the numbers. On Amendment No. 128, then, our view is that since climate science is there it should be read in the broad sense. That would ensure that the committee&#146;s recommendations are based on the best and most relevant scientific expertise. We are not clear what would be added to the Bill&#151;since this amendment was not proposing a substitute but an addition&#151;by putting in &#147;environmental science&#148;.</p>

<a name="80114-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08011436000022"></a>Amendment No. 129 proposes the inclusion of,</p>
<ul><a name="08011436000093"></a>&#147;all modes of passenger and freight transport technology and operations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011436000081"></a>Frankly, we cannot see how that is a useful addition, as the committee is already required to look across the economy in providing its advice on the level of carbon budgets. A detailed consideration of all modes of transport is thus likely to be undertaken as part of that work; indeed, transport is one of the work streams already being considered by the shadow secretariat.</p>

<a name="80114-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08011436000023"></a>While I am on the point, I apologise to the noble Baroness, who may chastise me for not answering her question about food in the previous debate, although she is not here now and did not make her point clear. Clearly the committee&#146;s areas are not ruled out and it may want to give advice about the growing of bio-crops and on the issue of flying in crops from the third world. Food miles is one issue that the Committee on Climate Change, rather than me, can deal with; yet &#147;food miles&#148; is in fact a misnomer. It has been conclusively proven that some products from New Zealand have less carbon content than they would if grown in this country, or so the scientists tell us. It is therefore no simple issue, but the committee would not be precluded from looking at it since its remit is wide enough.</p>

<a name="80114-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08011436000024"></a>The expertise on the committee that will be set up already includes &#147;technology development and diffusion&#148;. Technology is relevant to the analysis that the committee will undertake on transport, buildings, power generation and other technologies from which abatements can occur. We do not believe, therefore, that mention of a further technology&#151;transport, in this specific context&#151;adds to that. In other words, our inference is that it will be covered.</p>

<a name="80114-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08011436000025"></a>On Amendment No. 130, the Government and the devolved Administrations are, as I have said before, strongly committed to protecting and improving the environment. That is already embedded in government policy and strategy. Defra&#146;s natural environment public service agreement builds on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08011436000087"></a>&#147;The Government&#146;s vision ... to secure a diverse, healthy and resilient natural environment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011436000082"></a>To ensure a more strategic approach to policy and delivery on the natural environment, the Government also recently published <I>Securing a </I><I>H</I><I>ealthy </I><I>N</I><I>atural </I><I>E</I><I>nvironment</I>, an action plan for embedding an ecosystems approach.</p>

Yet we are also talking about an independent body that has to have its own expertise to decide its policy. Within the debate on this part of the Bill, which is on the committee&#146;s expertise, I do not see that the responsibilities of the Government and government departments are relevant here&#151;although they might be embedded&#151;because it is not up to people in those departments to influence the climate change committee. It is up to the committee itself to fulfil that function.</p>

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="08011436000027"></a><b><a name="80114-0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08011436000111"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I am not saying that for one moment. It is not the job of the climate change committee to run the world. Nor, indeed, is it the Government&#146;s. All I am trying to do is to put this into context. We are not starting with a clean sheet of paper. We are looking at the expertise and the role of the climate change committee. I am simply making the point that Amendment No. 130 seeks to embed in the Bill an effect on the devolved Administrations, but the climate change committee can advise on government policy and say, &#147;By the way, we think things should change&#148;. That is fine, but things are already going on now. It is not as though we are starting with a blank sheet of paper. We question whether these are issues which the committee would consider in a meaningful way in its advice on the overall level of the carbon budget, so we do not consider it necessary to have a member on the committee with expertise specifically in those areas. The committee as a whole can encompass that, but that is not to say that it is being ignored. That is the only point that I am making in respect of what is happening in government at present.</p>

<a name="80114-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08011436000028"></a>We do think that some of the issues will be more properly considered by the Government in the development and delivery of policies because the policies will be delivered by government and by business and not by the climate change committee. That leads into the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke. Change management means change in families as well as in businesses and government. Nevertheless, the climate change committee will have to take account of the changes in technology and advice and the practicalities of that advice, so it is a highly relevant question. I will probably get an answer to it at some point but I do not have one at the moment.</p>

I do understand that, as said in the debates so far, there is support in the House for making the committee independent, scientific and apolitical. Yet I hope the Minister will appreciate my scepticism when there are so many commissions and quangos stuffed with party members appointed by the Government. A six-year commitment would mean not only that the members would outlast a Government but that they would be locked in for the long haul such that they could not be replaced in a year or two by a Government who wanted to defend their own interests. It would prevent too much government interference in the committee. A longer term would help to ensure impartiality and, indeed, continuity.</p>

<a name="80114-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08011436000034"></a>There are also a number of practical reasons for a long minimum term. For a start, the nature of climate change is such that monitoring it as well as our progress is a long process. Long-serving members will be better equipped to serve the committee. The amendment would mean that committee members would sit for longer than a budgetary period, guaranteeing that they would be on the committee when it made at least one of the reports for the five-year budget period. Indeed, because of the number of different reports that the committee will be responsible for preparing, continuity is certainly advantageous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08011436000035"></a>Will the Minister explain what mechanisms are in place in the Bill to ensure the continuity of the committee? Does he think that a committee member can serve for more than one term? I beg to move.</p>

Before I respond briefly, I should say that the point made is valid because, it may surprise Members to know, it is not normal practice to specify terms of appointment in a Bill. There is nothing in the Bill about the length of appointment. It is not there, and there is a reason for that, as I will explain.</p>

<a name="80114-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08011436000038"></a>A number of important issues need to be considered before the terms of appointment are agreed. Our current working assumption is that the first committee members should be appointed for a term of five years to marry with the carbon budget cycle. We are presently looking at how the appointments can be staggered to ensure that there is sufficient continuity between budget periods so that committee member appointments do not all end at the same time. Nor do we want the timing of members&#146; terms of office to affect the committee&#146;s work on formulating advice on carbon budgets; that is another factor. Six years is a particularly long term for such an appointment. Public appointments are usually, although not exclusively, for three years. Whatever their duration may be, they are restricted to two terms in total, which cannot exceed 10 years. Much of this flowed from the work of the Nolan commission. This is another reason why we are still considering whether five years is appropriate.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1103"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80114-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08011436000039"></a>I should also note that it is possible that the length of the carbon budgets may need to change at some point in the future. As I have said, it is important to build the flexibility to follow international practice into the working arrangements. There is therefore a risk to stipulating a precise term of appointment in the Bill. For instance, if the international community or the European Union were to switch to, say, an eight-year or four-year budget period, we would want to do this within our domestic system. Clause 18 allows us to alter the length of the budget period in these circumstances, so it is important that we retain the flexibility to alter the length of the committee members&#146; terms of appointment. This system is consistent with that of other committees, so there is nothing unusual about not having the length of appointment in the Bill. I hope that I have given enough of a flavour of our current thinking, which would of course be clear on the appointment of the members. The point about the appointments being staggered is obviously very important.</p>

I think I said that we do not want the timing of the members&#146; terms of office to affect the committee&#146;s work on formulating advice on carbon budgets.

I draw some comfort from the fact that the first members will be there for five years and that there will be some sort of staggering process. That will produce some continuity. The Minister went on to refer to Nolan and three years. Three years is too short because of the very nature of what we are trying to achieve with the committee, but no doubt he will take all that into consideration. I like the idea of having two terms.

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08011436000053"></a>I am using this opportunity to clarify that, in Clause 19, the definition of the word &#147;expedient&#148; we are opting for is:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="08011436000090"></a>&#147;Conducive to advantage in general, or to a definite purpose; fit, proper or suitable to the purposes of the case&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011436000085"></a>which I believe was option 2. I hope that the Committee will understand my desire to clarify that point now. Rather than writing to everyone, I thought that this would be more helpful, especially as we have had a mention of dictionaries again.</p>

<a name="80114-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08011436000054"></a>In resisting the amendments proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, I hope that I can offer him the clarification he is looking for and pick up on a couple of other points that were made in the debate. As we have heard, paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 sets out the circumstances in which the national authorities may remove a member from the Committee on Climate Change. I should like to point out that this is a power which we would expect to be exercised only in exceptional circumstances, but it is important to make sure that the Committee on Climate Change is able to carry out its functions properly.</p>

<a name="80114-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08011436000055"></a>Amendment No. 133 adds little to sub-paragraph (a). I cannot see how &#147;6 months&#148; could be interpreted as anything other than a consecutive period. In the absence of any other definition, &#147;6 months&#148; should be interpreted through its natural and ordinary meaning, unless defined otherwise. Members of the Committee will be aware that it is not declined otherwise, so I resist Amendment No. 133.</p>

<a name="80114-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08011436000056"></a>Amendment No. 134 proposes an addition to the list of circumstances in paragraph 5. This amendment also would add little, because consideration of a relevant criminal offence&#151;I emphasise the word &#147;relevant&#148;&#151;already would be covered by the existing wording in paragraph 5(d); that is, the use of the phrase &#147;unable or unfit&#148;. We are emphasising there the use of the word &#147;relevant&#148; criminal offfence. Paragraph 5(d) states that members may be removed if, in the opinion of the national authorities, they are otherwise unable or unfit to carry out their duties. We believe that this wording already covers the situations outlined by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, but it picks up on the sensitivities highlighted by my noble friends with regard to time served and so on.</p>

<a name="80114-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08011436000057"></a>I shall also resist Amendment No. 135, which proposes that when forming an opinion that a member is unfit or unable to carry out his or her duties under paragraph 5(d), the national authorities must reach an opinion which is &#147;reasonable. This kind of discussion comes up quite often in your Lordships&#146; House. This amendment is unnecessary. It is a well established principle of public law that national authorities have a clear duty to act reasonably and, in this case, to form a reasonable opinion. It is therefore already implicit in this clause.</p>

<a name="80114-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08011436000058"></a>Amendment No. 136 relates to specific circumstances in which national authorities may remove a member and proposes to define the meaning of the words &#147;unable&#148; and &#147;unfit&#148; in the context of mental and physical obstruction. That is clearly an important clause which allows for a member to be removed in a number of very limited circumstances. It is important that we do not restrict these circumstances too much. This is a very standard clause. As I have already said,  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1106"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it is important for the proper functioning of the committee that any member who cannot fulfil his duties for whatever reason can be removed. But it will be exercised only where there is an inability to carry out the job. It is not a power to sack members on a whim. As we have already heard, it has to be used reasonably.</p>

<a name="80114-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08011436000059"></a>The words &#147;unable&#148; or &#147;unfit&#148; may cover certain circumstances which inhibit the member&#146;s performance, such as serious health issues. However, it could mean others; for example, a conflict of interest that the member did not have when he was originally appointed. There may be other unforeseen circumstances. I therefore propose that this amendment should be withdrawn. I hope that I have given the Committee the reassurances that it seeks. These provisions must be used reasonably. These standard clauses are designed to ensure that the committee can function properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08011452000006"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment to question the Government over the independence of the staff of the committee. The Minister said earlier that the chairman of the committee would have to be agreed by the national authorities. We on these Benches do not have a difficulty with this because the committee will represent all parts of the United Kingdom. However, we have a slight issue with the wording of paragraph 11(1), which says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08011452000032"></a>&#147;The Committee must appoint a person to be chief executive, but may only appoint a person who has been approved by the national authorities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011452000027"></a>This may well come into conflict with sub-paragraph (2), which says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08011452000033"></a>&#147;The chief executive is an employee of the Committee&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011452000028"></a>If the chief executive is to be employed by the committee, is it right that other bodies can censor whom the committee is to be employed by? If we are saying that the committee is independent of outside interference, should it not be the case that other bodies should not be given the option of veto?</p>

<a name="80114-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08011452000007"></a>Although people have talked about the independence and scientific base of the committee, if it is to be effective in reducing the amount of carbon released in the atmosphere it will affect every aspect of people&#146;s lives. Therefore, every aspect of the committee&#146;s work is highly political. That has many implications for the national authorities. It has already been stated that different energy and planning policies are being looked  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1107"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>at by different constituent parts of the United Kingdom. The Minister might say that this has already been agreed with the national authorities. But, if we are talking about the independence of the committee, it is a fundamental flaw to say that the chief executive can be held as a political pawn if one moves on and another is to be appointed by the national authorities to prove a point over one particular aspect of any decision which is difficult at that time. I beg to move.</p>

It is essential that the constituent parts of the United Kingdom should be happy with the chief executive of the committee. It seems to me very unlikely that there would be political wrangling about this. We are talking about a committee of experts. The time to resolve any problems is before the appointment. It will be difficult enough for the committee to think through its recommendations in such a way as to maximise the possibility that the different parts of the United Kingdom can happily carry them out. Some of these things will be very difficult politically for the different parts of the United Kingdom to implement. Some will be more difficult in one part, some in another. But it is absolutely essential that there should be contentment at the start with the person who is appointed as chief executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08011452000009"></a>I think that this amendment is a great mistake and I hope my noble friends will not pursue it after this discussion. I do not know what the Minister is going to say but presumably, as the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, has said, the various parts of the United Kingdom have agreed to this and feel it to be wise. It is not a case of politicising the appointment but of depoliticising it by getting rid of any problems before the appointment is made. I cannot support the amendment.</p>

I acknowledge the Minister&#146;s testimony in speeches on previous amendments to the Government&#146;s success in reaching agreement with the various national authorities in putting together teams on issues such as this, but I would be interested in hearing how the Minister thinks approval of particular candidates will be secured under the present wording.</p>

We discussed this in the Joint Committee. The argument is fairly concisely set out in paragraph 156. We recommended that that role of the Secretary of State should be removed from the Bill.

<p><a name="08011452000029"></a>It did not go on to state then that the appointment was to be subject to the approval of the national authorities. One of the key arguments deployed in the Joint Committee was that people on a committee should choose the chief executive. That carried the weight at the end of the day.

As we have been saying, the committee should be genuinely independent. This process of approval by the national authorities of the chief executive diminishes its independence. Our motivation for having an independent committee is twofold. Not only does it ensure that the committee can make its decisions without regard to political expediency&#151;and I use the word &#147;expediency&#148; again&#151;but it is essential that the committee does not even appear to be making decisions that could be interpreted as political manoeuvres. The second reason alone should be enough to remove the provision for national authority approval. It should not appear that this choice was made in such a way that it would be politically palatable. The choice should be made resoundingly on the merits of the person for the job.</p>

My killer line is the fact that the chief executive of the climate change committee will be the committee&#146;s accounting officer. Bearing in mind that the committee is a UK body but comes with the other bodies, leaving aside the appointment of the chair and the actual members, the other Administrations can take comfort in the accounting officer function anyway and the ability of a person to lead the organisation. There is nothing unusual about this. I have a couple of examples, but I think that they are both unsatisfactory because to the best of my knowledge neither is a UK body. That presents me with a bit of a problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08011452000014"></a>I was thinking about the noble Lord, Lord Krebs. I cannot remember the details because it is so long ago, but I have a feeling that the same may have applied to the chief executive of the Food Standards Agency. It is a UK body but all the appointments are made in conjunction with the devolved Administrations. I am not going to rest my case on that, but on the fact that the chief executive will carry the accounting officer function for the climate change committee. It is not a veto and no politics are involved here. The climate change committee will make the appointment and simply get approval. It is not a question of the members working from a list of people who have been vetted by the authorities beforehand. It will not be like that at all because this is a normal process with other bodies. I am only sad that I do not have a list to present to Members of the Committee.</p>

The committee would talk about the shortlist with the other bodies. To have someone on the shortlist who is not fit for purpose according to the other authorities would not make a lot of sense. It would probably be done at that point, and therefore the committee would choose from a perfectly acceptable shortlist. That is the practical way of doing it, but if I am wrong I will come back to the Committee.</p>

The Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir David King, has pushed and won the argument in Government circles on the case for more nuclear power stations for climate change reasons. Of course, we on these Benches are not great advocates of nuclear power. If Sir David or someone of his standing was put forward, would that be acceptable to the Scottish Executive, which has just come out with a non-nuclear policy? I put that hypothetical example to the Minister because he said that that would not be the case. If the purpose of an amendment is to look at a case which could arise, in the example I have suggested, could the Scottish Executive have a veto on Sir David&#146;s appointment?</p>

We are now talking about the chief executive rather than the chairman or members of the committee. The chief executive will implement and run the organisation. The argument about what the candidates believe in and what their views are is irrelevant. The person will be appointed for managerial expertise and other factors. I do not know whether the noble Lord was in his place at the time, but I answered the questions put to me by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. At that point I used the example because it was in my original speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08011452000019"></a>As I have said, one of the reasons that the climate change committee is advisory is that as of last week, the Government have made their views clear on the issue of nuclear energy. It would not be a relevant factor in the process because policy decisions are made by the Government. The climate change committee is an advisory body. So that would not be fair in terms of the question asked by the noble Earl, but here we are discussing the appointment of the chief executive&#151;the professional manager and administrator of the organisation. What the chief executive&#146;s views are on particular policy issues are not, I think, the most relevant points for the national authorities to consider. They will be looking for competence, sound financial management, human resources skills and other professional factors required in the management of an organisation.</p>

However, as the Bill stands, our understanding is that the committee is empowered to create sub-committees to carry out any of its functions. We feel that certain functions must be reserved for the committee itself. Indeed, all the functions of the committee set out in Part 1 relating to setting and amending the targets and carbon budgets should be executed by the committee. Considering that the Bill is going to empower the committee to such a great degree, and subject the appointment of its members to such heavy scrutiny, it should be the responsibility of the committee itself rather than a sub-committee to tackle the primary issues.</p>

<a name="80114-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08011452000025"></a>Part of this amendment specifically references the duties placed on the committee in Clause 28, related to reporting. We do not want the committee&#146;s report on progress to be able to be presented by an appointed sub-committee. We are not against the regular use of sub-committees and outside individuals, agencies and organisations in assisting in formulating decisions.

It will be appropriate for the committee to delegate functions to a sub-committee, member or employee, when it undertakes a special task or to facilitate the organisation&#146;s governance arrangements. An example would be an audit committee arrangement. That is a perfectly standard model for non-departmental public bodies and there is nothing new about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08011436000061"></a>It would be surprising if the committee were to delegate a principal function or a sensitive issue and we think that that is most unlikely to happen. The committee as a whole is responsible for how it discharges its functions. If, for example, it decided to delegate a core function set out in Parts 1 or 2, such as its annual report on progress, to a junior member of staff or a single member, it would risk the report not being very good. This relates to the nature of the committee. We have to believe that we will appoint quality people who run a quality organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08011436000062"></a>On the point made by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, it should be perfectly possible for the committee to have a sub-committee that deals with the interests he mentioned and to take advice on them in the way he elucidated. As I said at Second Reading, all that will be within the ambit of the climate change committee. However, I do not think that we should set down rigid rules for how it operates and manages its governance procedures. Again, there is nothing new about this. It is perfectly normal for a non-departmental public body to operate in this way.</p>

I emphasise that I was not suggesting for a moment that sub-committees were almost de rigueur. It is necessary and highly specialised work that they will be undertaking. My concern was they that it should not use the structure of sub-committees to bypass its fundamental responsibility for the work of its sub-committees. Indeed, material presented to the Secretary of State or Parliament should come with the full authority of the Committee on Climate Change. Nothing specifically suggests that in this wording, so I would be grateful if the Minister could take note of what has been said in this brief debate. I hope there might be a form of words that could make that element clear so that we can be reassured on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08011436000068"></a>The noble Lord said: The effects of climate change are wide-ranging. We have touched on this many times during these debates. So, too, are the proposals and measures that will be taken to stop it. The climate change committee needs to take into account the effects of its proposals and strategies on the public. For this reason, we propose an amendment that requires an element of public consultation on the proposals. It was the Minister himself who presented the fourth side of the triangle, giving a quadrilateral element to our geometry, when he talked earlier this afternoon about public participation. The extent of  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1112"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this can be determined by the committee itself. However, we still feel that there needs to be some way in which there can be some public input into the ramifications of scientific investigation.</p>

<a name="80114-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08011436000069"></a>We understand that the climate change committee should be able to assess what needs to be done from a scientific perspective. That is the purpose of our efforts to increase its independence. This amendment does not seek to water down this objective, or to weaken the idea of a committee that makes decisions based on scientific necessity. The amendment simply reflects that these necessities do not exist in a vacuum, and that the strategies developed should be open to consultation from the people that they will affect. I beg to move.</p>

I think I heard the noble Lord correctly when he talked about the ability of members of the committee to relate to a parliamentary committee, in the sense of being able to put their case competently. I am a little worried about that idea being in the minds of those carrying out these appointments. In my lifetime I have found some of the most effective people to be the most inarticulate. Very often they find it hard to string two words together, yet they were brilliant. I would not like us to exclude from membership of the committee people who may well be scientifically superbly confident, but not particularly articulate. Competence is more important than presentation. I use this amendment to raise this for fear that wrapped up in this whole issue of effective public participation is the idea that only the articulate may be able to present a case on behalf of the committee. It might well be that the role of people who work within the Executive might be the means by which a lot of information from this committee is communicated to the wider public.</p>

The effectiveness of the climate change committee will depend not only on its authority and expertise, about which we have heard very much, but on public confidence and trust in the committee, particularly the link between the advice provided by the independent committee and the action the Government take upon that advice. Openness and public engagement will be essential in building and maintaining that trust. However that is achieved by the committee, it is important that it makes its workings completely transparent. My own suggestion, based on my experience as chairman of the Food Standards Agency, would be for the committee to hold its meetings in public so that public engagement could be direct, with the public not only observing the deliberations and recommendations of the committee, but perhaps being able to ask questions at the end of, or during, committee meetings. This amendment raises a very important point about transparency and trust.</p>

The example of the Food Standards Agency is a good

The work that the agency has done in developing public engagement could provide some very interesting lessons for the secretariat.</p>

<a name="80114-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08011436000073"></a>We have also been engaged in very important debates about the independence of the Committee on Climate Change; with that in mind, I will make a few points. I stress that we want to consider Amendment No. 140, which calls for the committee to ensure effective public participation in exercising its functions. I agree that the committee is likely to benefit, as noble Lords have stressed, from engaging with the public, including those in business, industry and academia. I am confident that the committee will follow best practice in its dealings with these sections of society. It should be for the committee to decide when it might be appropriate to engage with the public. This is true for any independent organisation. However, as I have just said, I see the merits of the suggested amendment and agree that the committee should take reasonable steps to engage the public effectively. Therefore, we will consider this amendment further and bring forward some new thinking at the next stage.</p>

<a name="80114-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08011436000074"></a>Before I move on to the next amendment, I would pick up the point made by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. I have some experience of working with the scientific community. I understand the anxiety over the trend to suggest that communication is somehow more important than expertise. It is absolutely right that a balance should be struck between all the necessary skills that my noble friend Lord Rooker has discussed in some detail with the House of Lords Committee. There should be a real balance between expertise and the need for executive skills, as the noble Lord suggested, to ensure that the work of the committee is communicated effectively. We are not unaware that scientific expertise does not necessarily embody communication skills, so a balance is required. Whether we are talking about triangular or quadrilateral relationships or a pyramid, emphasis has been placed today very much on the independence of the Committee on Climate Change. Therefore, it would be wrong to be prescriptive about how public engagement should be undertaken and the skills necessary to achieve that.</p>

<a name="80114-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08011436000075"></a>Amendment No. 141 would introduce a new clause which would give the committee a duty to make timely recommendations to the Secretary of State in relation to Part 1, and require it to consult the public on what recommendations should be made. This amendment seems to repeat a lot of the issues we have already discussed and I am therefore not sure what it would add. As we have just discussed in relation to Amendment No. 140, the Committee on Climate Change should engage the public in its work. In our discussions before Christmas the Government agreed to consider further the transparency of the work of the Committee on Climate Change, which is also covered by this amendment. The proposed new Subsection (1) of Amendment No. 141 would place a new duty on the Committee on Climate Change to make timely recommendations. However, noble Lords are probably well aware that Clause 30, which we shall come to shortly, already places a duty on the committee to provide advice, analysis, information or other assistance when requested by a national authority in connection with the authority&#146;s functions under the Act or climate change generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08011436000076"></a>Therefore, with the reassurances that I have given as regards looking further into public engagement and transparency, which we have already committed to look at, and taking into account the comments made by my noble friend and the importance that your Lordships' House&#146;s Committee attaches to public engagement, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, will consider withdrawing the amendment.</p>

I rather hope that she is saying that. I suggest that the Government think fairly hard about the rather new situation we are in now where public consultation and relations with different parts of the United Kingdom sometimes involve people in different parts of the country holding different opinions, and the fact that some of these issues will become somewhat politicised. This is new. Living, as I do, north of the border, I see this possibility increasing. I am sorry about it but I think that it is increasing. If the Government are thinking of designing an amendment, they should remember that there may be problems when the committee engages in public consultation or information dissemination. I am sorry if I go on about this but I feel that the Government must pay attention to this increasing trend.</p>

Therefore, we do not believe that it should be the instrument for delivering policy. That is the area where we perhaps disagree with some of the other amendments. What we believe fundamentally is that it is a vital role of the climate change committee not just to measure and set targets with Government, but to judge and audit. In these amendments we are saying that it must be a role and a duty&#151;perhaps one of its most important functions&#151;of the committee to look at the targets that have been set through its own work and judge whether government policies are likely to meet those targets.</p>

<a name="80114-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08011450000024"></a>From that point of view, going back to the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, at the beginning of the debate today, it is a little like the Audit Commission looking at the work and the policies of the Government and asking whether the current trajectory is going to be met by them. It does not then suggest what those policies should be instead. That is the political judgment made by a Government accountable to Parliament. We strongly believe that that must be the major role of the climate change committee and that it will hugely increase its importance and relevance if it is able to judge whether the Government are likely to meet those targets and to be full in its reporting. I beg to move.</p>

I was just reminding myself of the evidence we received at the time from Mr Jonathan Brearely of Defra, who suggested that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011450000032"></a>&#147;the Committee needed to &#145;make recommendations to the Government that are sensible and cost-effective&#146;. This in itself would require a thorough examination of a policy mix. Nor can the Committee make sectoral recommendations, or carry out modelling work, without also evaluating the policies necessary to achieve the carbon reductions. It will need to analyse the effectiveness of existing policy and potential policy instruments and ways these might be improved&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08011450000027"></a>The committee went on to comment in paragraph 144 on page 48 of the report:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="08011450000031"></a>&#147;There is no question that this sort of work will lead the Committee into areas which are more political than the current framework for the Bill provides for. When we put the prospect of the Committee having a policy role in this way to Jonathan Brearely, he replied: &#145;I think the Committee on Climate Change are going to have to take into account existing policy, and what they are going to have to ask themselves is how much we think the existing policy is going to deliver&#146;. Greater clarity in the statutory duty of the Committee on Climate Change would assist both the Government and the Committee itself. It is essential for the legislation to give the Committee a wider policy evaluation role, and therefore we recommend that the draft Bill include a power for the Committee to carry out an evaluation of current and potential policy when advising the Secretary of State&#148;.</p>

<a name="80114-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08011450000026"></a>In a sense, the amendments&#151;although they are specific and address particular areas&#151;attempt to take us down this road. In light of the clarity of the Joint Committee&#146;s recommendation on this point, this is perhaps an opportunity for the Minister to respond and to make clear how the Government react to that recommendation. I am not clear whether they have included anything in the Bill that covers that point. I, for one, would be grateful to know the Government&#146;s attitude.</p>

That the advice on the budgets should include some indication of whether the budgets will meet targets might be implied in the Bill. However, we support the amendment to give the Bill greater clarity on this point.</p>

<a name="80114-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08011465000003"></a>We also support Amendment No. 145. In our conception, the committee should not just set the budget and then watch from afar, perhaps altering the next budget to be in line with the success or failure of the Government&#146;s policies; it should also give advice on the effectiveness of the Government&#146;s actions. Once again, although this is perhaps implied in the Bill&#146;s provisions on the committee&#146;s role, we welcome the more explicit language.</p>

My point has been perfectly well put by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, but I will go even further. The entire thrust of the Joint Committee&#146;s recommendations was to ensure that the Government had at their elbow a committee that was sufficiently respected and sufficiently empowered to recommend things that may well not be electorally popular. It was a constant refrain in our committee&#146;s discussions that it was important that the Government had support for, and sometimes could even hide behind, unpopular recommendations from the climate change committee. As I have listened to the progress of this Committee stage, I have genuinely come to believe that the Government may well be climbing on to the horns of a dilemma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08011465000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has been extremely reasonable in consistently attempting to enhance the powers in respect of the committee&#146;s responsibilities.

I suspect that on Report the Government may well come to regret that they did not enhance the powers of the Committee on Climate Change and will instead be required to take on board amendments that they are currently resisting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08011465000007"></a>I support the principle behind what my noble friend Lord Crickhowell and the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said. If we lay a statutory duty on the Secretary of State in the long distant future, Governments will be tempted in the near future to say, &#147;Oh well, actually we do not have to do this. Someone else can do it later and they can catch up&#148;. This provision would help to stop backsliding. People are always tempted to backslide; it is the most comfortable thing to do as opposed to taking difficult decisions. This process will take a lot of difficult decisions. A duty is being laid on a Government in the quite distant future to do something, and this provision will help intermediate Governments to continue the process towards fulfilment.</p>

I cannot accept particular amendments, but we want to get this as clear and precise as possible. We are happy to look at aspects of the amendments, particularly regarding the way in which the reporting mechanism works.</p>

<a name="80114-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08011465000009"></a>Clause 27 in some ways gets to why we are setting up the Committee on Climate Change in the first place. We are asking the committee to provide the Government with independent advice on the level of the carbon budget to strengthen transparency and accountability on how to reduce emissions in the UK. The committee&#146;s advice on the level of the carbon budget will be a key element in assisting the Secretary of State in making decisions on the level of each carbon budget. The committee will have to give advice that is fit for purpose to the Government, so the committee will have to make an assessment on the best trajectory to meet the 2020 and 2050 targets and give advice on budget levels that are consistent with that trajectory.</p>

<a name="80114-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08011465000010"></a>However, Amendment No. 143 would require the committee to advise on whether the 2050 target will be met through a budget. As we discussed earlier in relation to Amendment No. 43 to Clause 8, the decision on the level of every carbon budget must be made with a view to meeting the targets in the Bill. So there is already a statutory requirement on the Government to set budgets in such a way that it leads to the long-term targets being met. But as I have said before, it is not possible for a single budget to deliver the target. We are not talking just about the budgets for 2018-22 or for 2048-52 but about all of the budgets in between as well. Therefore, Amendment No. 143 does not enhance the framework set out in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08011465000011"></a>Amendment No. 145 would seem to ask the committee not only to provide its advice on budgets but to assess whether the Government were on track to meet them. Amendment No. 151 proposes an identical requirement through the committee&#146;s annual progress report. We are not clear why the committee is being required to provide the assessment twice, possibly within six months. In terms of the committee&#146;s advice under Clause 27, we see this as a focused task&#151;the committee will be required to look across the economy in providing its advice on the level of carbon budgets. This will not be a simple matter, and we therefore think that under Clause 27 the committee should focus on advising on the most appropriate level of carbon budgets needed to achieve the long-term goals.</p>

<a name="80114-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08011465000012"></a>Amendment No. 151 relates to the committee&#146;s annual reporting function under Clause 28. We agree that, when carrying out this role, we should ensure that the committee has sufficient discretion to report on matters that it considers appropriately within its remit. We should not underestimate the strength of the existing reporting provisions in the Bill. The committee&#146;s annual report to Parliament under Clause 28 is required to set out the committee&#146;s views on the progress made towards meeting both the carbon budgets and the 2050 target. In writing its annual report, the committee will inevitably take the Government&#146;s report under Clause 11 into account and form its own view on the proposals and policies that it contains. If the committee&#146;s annual report to Parliament says that the UK is currently off-track, we would expect that the Government of the day would be under huge parliamentary and public pressure to say what they are going to do to get the UK back on track.</p>

<a name="80114-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08011465000013"></a>We will also discuss the committee&#146;s report under Clause 28 in greater detail under another group of amendments that we will come to shortly. As I indicated earlier, we are willing to look at ways of strengthening the reporting requirements in the Bill. We will consider the best way to do this before Report, taking account of the debate that we have just had on this group, including Amendment No. 151, and the debates to come. I hope that, with that assurance, the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

I know that we have had this debate about final targets and meeting each individual one, but, as I said, Clause 1 makes absolutely clear what we are talking about. What we on these Benches are looking for at a strategic level is a duty and a responsibility&#151;which is in this general section of the Bill&#151;on the Climate Change Committee to assess policy in relation to outcome and targets.

<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1121"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08011465000016"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, specifically asked about the committee&#146;s role on policies. Although I alluded to that in what I just said, I have a specific note which may be useful in our deliberations. Our view is that the committee should look at progress overall in reducing emissions. As part of that, it will need to look at emission trends&#151;whether they are going up or going down. However, we do not expect the committee to recommend future policies. The committee might say that more needs to be done, but it will be for the Government and the other authorities to decide how to fulfil it. This comes back to the issue which others have raised about nuclear energy: it is for the Government to decide how to get back on track. As I said, however, we are willing to look at Clause 28 to see how this can be achieved.</p>

<a name="80114-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08011465000017"></a>There is a role for the committee on policies, but its role would not be to recommend future policies. The committee has to have a role in the assessment of the overall effect of reducing emissions and the effect of policies, but we do not see that its role would be to recommend future policies. It will be for the Government to come up with policies to give practical effect to advice from the Committee on Climate Change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08011465000022"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment, because we are not entirely sure how this element of Clause 27 will work in practice. Clause 27(1)(c)(i) currently states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="08011465000125"></a>&#147;It is the duty of the Committee to advise the Secretary of State, in relation to each budgetary period, on ... the respective contributions towards meeting the carbon budget ... by the sectors of the economy covered by trading schemes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011465000023"></a>Yet it specifies that this be considered as a whole. Could the Minister explain the logic behind looking at the sectors of the economy that are covered by trading schemes only in the aggregate?

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08011465000024"></a>Our amendment changes this language to place the duty on the committee to give advice relating to sectors of the economy individually and as a whole. It is not enough simply to advise on the parts of the economy that are trading credits and those that are not. It could be very important to have regard to the contributions to the carbon budget from individual sectors of the economy, however defined. Any information or specificity surely should be welcomed.

I am going to ask and then answer the question as I think that it goes to the heart of what the noble Lord has just said. The question is: will the Committee advise on how much different sectors of the economy should do. The answer is: the committee will advise on the correct distribution of effort across time of the carbon budgets to meet the 2050 targets, and between the sectors of the economy covered by trading schemes, taken together, and other sectors, taken together. The committee&#146;s assessment of effort across the economy will focus on the balance of effort between sectors of the economy in trading schemes and other sectors. It will also advise on the spread of effort between reductions in UK emissions and reductions in overseas emissions.</p>

<a name="80114-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08011465000026"></a>The committee will be expected to assess where carbon savings might be made to keep emissions within budget and on course to reach the legislated targets. However, this will not be tantamount to suggesting specific carbon budgets for specific sectors. There is likely to be a great deal of flexibility about where cost-effective abatement may occur. It is up to the Government to take on board the committee&#146;s advice and ultimately to develop policies to achieve savings in particular sectors. Making significant carbon reductions is a process which, while cost-beneficial in the long term, will require some tough political choices, as I think everyone understands. The committee&#146;s role is to shine an independent light on the analysis informing these choices.</p>

<a name="80114-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08011465000027"></a>I think that that is a much better answer to the noble Lord. He asked a specific question, and that is more precise than my actual note.</p>

In order to give its advice on the trading sectors as a whole, as opposed to the non-trading sectors, the committee and its back-room staff would have to form a view about the way in which the overall trading sectors broke down. Surely the credibility of the advice it gave would depend on the support it gave by indicating the kind of areas that it would expect to come about over the next five to fifteen years. I understand entirely the slight dilemma that that would create for a Government faced by the breakdown provided by the Climate Change Committee. After all, the breakdown is only advice and indicative and the Government might not pursue it exactly in its policies.</p>

I hope that I again made the distinction in my initial remarks between the committee&#146;s role in providing overall analysis and the Government&#146;s role in deciding on the precise policy mix to take advantage of the potential to reduce emissions. It must be for the Government to make the decision on the right mix of policies for setting caps for emissions trading schemes and for other policy measures as well. We do not want the committee to duplicate effort or to go into the detail of what the Government&#146;s policy should be on individual issues, such as whether a policy on renewable heat needs to be different, as that would dilute the committee&#146;s core function, on which we want it to concentrate, which is to advise on the level of the carbon budget as a whole.</p>

We are not talking about wire-cut bricks, but dealing with situations in which there will be certain areas of the economy&#151;certain sectors&#151;where progress can be made quite quickly and things will move fast, and other areas where things will be more stubborn. There will be no one-size-fits-all solution. If the Committee on Climate Change is to have any credibility, it must have a sectoral approach built into its whole thinking process and into its dialogue with the Secretary of State, the wider public and Parliament. It will need to have a position on these matters. I do not see that as duplication. I see the Climate Change Committee as the place from which all this originates.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="08011465000126"></a> Clause 28, page 15, line 7, leave out from &#147;report&#148; to end</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08011465000038"></a>The noble Earl said: The amendments in this group are very similar to some that we have already debated today, but they go a little further. They are an attempt to clarify the language in Clause 28, which deals with reports on progress, such that a genuine report on our progress is what emerges as a result of this clause. The wording of the Bill places a duty to report on the way in which the budget was or was not met. That is too weak and ambiguous. Our language, which is in the  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1124"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>spirit of the Government&#146;s intention in this clause, is better in that it calls for a report on the extent to which the budgets have or have not been met. It also mandates that the report be not just a progress of past action but an assessment on the impact of this action for the future. Thus instead of simply reporting on how the budget was or was not met, we propose to include in the report the extent to which the budgets have been or will be met. Indeed, the report should include an assessment of the effectiveness of the action taken in meeting the budgets and recommendations for further action that should be taken to ensure that budgets are met.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08011465000039"></a>We are trying in these amendments to strengthen the Bill&#146;s reporting mechanism so that we get a genuinely accurate picture of our progress, so that we understand the reasons for our progress and get an idea of how to make future progress. I beg to move.</p>

I again make the point that what still worries me is that it moves the clause into recommendations on government policy. One of the key characteristics of climate change policy is that there is no one policy mix, no one route to get to where you want to be. The balance between different energies, between energy production and energy saving, between technological standards and all these other areas of a very complex policy mix leads as near as possible to an infinite range of possibilities. We on these Benches find it difficult to understand how the climate change committee could then say, &#147;This is the way you must move forward from here&#148;.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08011465000041"></a>We back the amendment on the basis of the Government&#146;s justifying a gap between aspiration and actual performance. However, on policy, we find it difficult to understand how the climate change committee could come down to particular recommendations on how to move forward.</p>

To get the good news out of the way first, Amendments Nos. 153 and 155 will certainly be taken away to be looked at again. We cannot accept the other two for reasons which I have given before, because they go into policy recommendation.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08011465000043"></a>As I said, we are keen to ensure that the overall framework of the Bill is transparent, and the system of annual accountability through the committee&#146;s progress report to Parliament and the Government&#146;s response is an important part of that. The provisions in Clauses 28 and 29 will help to ensure that there is a well-informed public and parliamentary debate on our progress towards the 2050 target. Before Christmas, during other stages, I made it clear that we did not support annual targets but were willing to look again at how the annual reporting provisions in the clause could be strengthened. We will therefore look at the two amendments in the same way. We will also look at Amendment No. 151, which was just discussed. I am happy to give detailed reasons for that if required.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08011465000053"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, it is my pleasure this evening to open this short debate on the important subject of the Social Fund. I fear, looking at the list of speakers, that it is the same small group of hard-bitten men and women who will man the barricades for the duration of this short session, but I hope that the Treasury Bench will accept that it is an important subject. I know that there are colleagues in other parts of the House who are also interested in the development of the Social Find.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08011465000054"></a>I will concentrate my introductory remarks on the discretionary element of the Social Fund more than anything else. At the weekend, because I am a sad person with nothing better to do, I went back to the 1985 White Paper&#151;the moment of glory for the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, when, as a young radical, he introduced the 1986 Social Security Bill. I was there to observe it. The 1986 legislation, introduced in 1988, brought in the Social Fund, and the 1985 White Paper set up the policy rationale for that fund. I shall sketch two or three things that were the policy objectives at that time. First, it said it would be better able, as a Social Fund, to respond to individual needs as they arose, as opposed to the system of single payments which had been in place since 1980. You could ask yourself whether, over the past 20 years, that objective has been met; it is questionable. Secondly, the rationale suggested that the Government would be able to consider developing the scope and operation of the scheme as experienced was gained. There have been some useful changes made since, particularly those in 2006 dealing with double debt and all the rest of it. Yet the case  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1126"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could be made that, in the 20 years since 1988, the structure of the scheme has not really changed as much as it should have done, and certainly not at much as its authors perhaps anticipated. Thirdly, the documents said that they hoped that decisions would be made locally by specialist officers with the minimum of formality. The personal advisers who are making these decisions now are certainly not local. I understand that they are being withdrawn to a system of 20 specialist benefit processing centres, so the locality of the original scheme is now in question.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08011465000055"></a>The fourth aim&#151;I like this one the best&#151;was that Social Fund officers would, as part of their job, provide a focus for liaison with social services, social work departments, health authorities and voluntary agencies. That would be a land far from the reality of the everyday work of the hard-pressed people who are trying to deal with crisis loan applications these days. My initial proposition, then, is that the original founding principles and elements of the policy of the Social Fund have not been met. The Social Fund is not now doing what it was designed to do, nor what the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and his team aspired to do when they put it into legislation. There is now a case for long-term change.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08011465000056"></a>In fact, I have been waiting for some time for the department to bring forward long-term change because it was presaged by no less a person than the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 2003 Red Book. It was clearly said then that the Government were considering the case for &#147;further&#148; change of the Social Fund. That was in 2003. We now have 2010 poverty targets, and we know the Government have a challenge in trying to meet those. We have got a brand new public service agreement dealing with socially excluded adults, a group that requires the services of the Social Fund. We have also, rightly, got a lot of heavy consideration of financial inclusion through the Thoreson review. We have had the interim review&#151;I did not think it added up to much and I am looking forward to February or March when the final report comes through. Financial inclusion may well be a new element that the Social Fund moves into, rather than anything else. Yet still nothing has happened.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08011465000057"></a>We have had no shortage of ideas; we have even had David Blunkett, a Member of Parliament, writing a pamphlet in October 2006 for the Resolution Foundation, <I>Ladders Out of Poverty</I>, which had a lot of good ideas&#151;I commend it to the Minister as bedtime reading. Various Ministers have talked about seasonal grants&#151;the last one I remember was Jim Murphy MP, when he was Minister, at the back-end of November 2006. I got excited about a story in the <I>Observer</I> for a short time because I thought that it was at least some evidence that there was something going on in the undergrowth of the department, and that if I just contained my patience something would emerge which would fit the bill in terms of long-term reform. I do not think we have seen anything. It would help me and the rest of the House enormously if, in this debate, the Minister said something about what the Government have up their sleeve in the future on where the Social Fund will be in five or 10 years&#146; time.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1127"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80114-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08011465000058"></a>I want to spend most of my time this evening looking at more operational end resource issues; they are by definition more short-term, and deal with some of the pressures being experienced both within the Jobcentre Plus bureaucracy and by the claimants outside who are trying to get access to the services offered by the Social Fund. I am particularly concerned about crisis loans and community care grants.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08011465000059"></a>First, the new Jobcentre Plus standard operating model is a good thing. I am in favour of the general principles behind the system that requires and enables people to make claims for their benefits by telephone, by and large. Yet this has been running over the last two or three years, and the more I look at it the more I come to the clear conclusion that there is a percentage of the claimant customer base that cannot reasonably be expected to successfully negotiate the telephony system we have. There are various estimates about how big a percentage that is, and my best guess&#151;it is no more than that&#151;is that something of the nature of 10 per cent of the client base of Jobcentre Plus are at risk of failing to properly access these services in the way that would be reasonable, unless other things are done in addition to what we have in the standard operating model at the moment. There are some real concerns in trying to deal with that operational issue.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08011465000060"></a>We have got until March 2008 before the model is finally rolled out. The centralisation process has worked for the vast majority of people, particularly the service available to pension credit and all the rest of that, but there are emerging issues that are not going to go away, which suggests they are problems still to be addressed. If we need any evidence, the citizens advice bureaux report produced last summer, <I>Not Getting Through</I>, captures all the difficulties that bureaux advisers had in dealing with customers&#146; and claimants&#146; problems in accessing community care grants and crisis loans in particular. I also lodge as evidence to support my case the Social Security Advisory Committee&#146;s Occasional Report Series No. 3, which raised some concerns about telephony services as well. These are serious people, they know what they are doing and they have put their finger on a real problem which is not going to go away unless we do something about it.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08011465000061"></a>My first plea for operational and resource issues of a short-term kind is, then, to get a much higher level of efficiency across the board in how these crisis loans and community care grants are administered. I have access to Independent Review Service figures relating to community care grants for the period from 1 April to 31 December 2007. From this evidence, the Minister should not just accept at face value some of the target average figures, because the averages mask and disguise some really appalling delays being visited on some customers and clients, who are not in a strong position to be able to withstand the financial consequences of not having the money.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08011465000062"></a>In the course of the initial decisions that the IRS received from April to December 2007, the headline total comes through that 68 per cent of cases were decided within 10 days. That sounds fair enough. If one looks behind that, performances within that 68  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1128"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>per cent range from 95 per cent in Northumbria, which is very good, to 21 per cent in Norwich which is not at all good. Looking at the longer target, 98 per cent of cases were decided within the 30 days. Again, Ministers might be lulled into a sense of complacency and think that that is not a bad score, considering that the system has not yet bedded in properly, but 11 offices achieved 100 per cent, which is really good and at the other end of the scale, Norwich again achieved 51 per cent within 30 days, which is only half.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08011465000063"></a>Looking at review decisions&#151;not initial decisions&#151;the problem is worse: 40 per cent of cases were reviewed within the 10-day standard period and there was a range of 92 per cent in Lancashire West to 9 per cent in the West Midlands. Looking at the 30-day average for review decisions, 86 per cent of cases were reviewed within that period, with two offices reviewing 100 per cent within that time, which is great. Again, the worst performing office was Norwich which achieved 41 per cent in that 30-day target&#151;I do not know what is going wrong in Norwich.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08011465000064"></a>The figures get worse for November and December. The most recent figures are trending in the wrong direction. The outstanding work in Jobcentre Plus, according to the IRS, is at the review stage, but at the end of November 2007 Jobcentre Plus allegedly had 26,000 initial applications awaiting decision which is about two weeks&#146; work, as I understand it, and 11,500 outstanding reviews, which represents about six weeks&#146; work. Those are bad figures.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08011465000065"></a>If the Minister is not prepared to take my word for it, I hope that he will look very carefully again at the review by Sir Richard Tilt, the IRS Social Fund commissioner, for 2005-06. Sir Richard Tilt is a very serious man and he has been doing this work for six or seven years now. In his summary of issues for consideration he lists certain points, but I do not have time to go through them in great detail this evening. However, seeing the kind of figures that I have just raised and having access to Social Fund inspectors who find individual cases that sometimes are much worse than the figures I have just quoted, Sir Richard is very aware of the difficulty. Three times in his set of 10 or so issues for consideration at page 7 in the 2005-06 annual report, he stresses the need to, &#147;take urgent action&#148;. He talks about the need to identify accurately the demand levels for crisis loans made by telephone, about which I have just spoken&#151;as with community care grants&#151;and taking urgent action to ensure that staff at Jobcentre Plus comply with the policy of accepting written applications for crisis loans, because there is some confusion about that. He goes on to suggest that we might introduce a facility of applying by telephone for reviews of crisis loan decisions at the earliest opportunity to try to cut down on some of the backlogs and delays. There is a menu of action for the short-term under the heading of more efficiency across the board in terms of the standard operating model in Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08011465000066"></a>A couple of other things need to be attended to and they are more of a resource and budgetary nature. The discretionary part of the budget needs to be increased because we still have postcode and calendar lotteries. The Select Committee which I had  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1129"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the privilege to chair in 2001&#151;the old social security Select Committee&#151;made a special feature of that in its recommendations in 2001. The position has not changed and arguably it is getting worse. Postcode and calendar lotteries need to be wrung out of the system. That will require a fresh look at the way in which the budget is deployed.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08011465000067"></a>Eligibility needs to be widened. I am saddened and distressed to discover that alignment payments are still being used. People who do not get an early benefit decision apply for a crisis loan because they do not have the benefit in time. That attacks the crisis-loan budget in a way in which it was never designed to operate, so that people who need crisis-loan help do not get it because others need help as negotiating their benefit payments has taken too long.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08011465000068"></a>We really need to reduce some of the existing exemptions; for example, I have never understood why people cannot claim for a deposit for a house. People can claim for rent, but they cannot claim for a deposit which secures the tenancy and sometimes that needlessly leads to homelessness.</p>

<a name="80114-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08011465000069"></a>The final point I want to make on the operational issues that need to be considered in the short term is that the telephony and the system of application for Social Fund applicants, particularly those trying to get access to crisis loans and to community care grants, are just not working. I think all that background adds up to a compelling case both for urgent consideration of the short-term issues and remedial action in the longer term for fundamental reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08011465000072"></a>Crisis loans give immediate help with day-to-day living costs or help in an emergency, as the CAB points out, to people who really are in desperate need. I think it is fair to say that there is a very worrying trend of incompetence in how the decisions are made. The percentage of crisis-loan decisions that have to be changed has been rising steadily from 50.8 per cent in 2004-05 to 52.9 per cent in 2005-06 and to a shocking 58 per cent last year according to the most recent report. Can the Minister tell us why that is deteriorating? Does he accept that that is a completely unacceptable position? What action is he taking to deal with it? You can apply for these loans if your emergency could put the health and safety of you or your family at risk, as the DWP official guidance states. There were 1,448,000 applications last year. That is a lot of people in crisis and a lot of people with problems: 334,000 were initially refused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08011465000073"></a>From reading the commissioner&#146;s excellent report, I believe that part of the problem is access. Although he acknowledged that Jobcentre Plus dealt with more than 1 million applications for crisis loans, the IRS has continued to receive complaints from all over the country about the difficulties that people face accessing the scheme. The main reasons for complaint were inability to get through on the crisis-loan telephone lines, despite trying constantly, officers refusing to accept applications made in writing or face to face and a failure by officers to record and issue a written decision if refusing an award, thereby preventing the applicant pursuing a review.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08011465000074"></a>All the evidence indicates that difficulties that people experience getting through on the crisis-loan telephone lines are widespread. They did two samples. Between 1 November and 22 November 2006, only 10 per cent of the calls made were successful in getting through; 41 per cent found the line engaged; 5 per cent had no reply; 27 per cent got a recorded message; and 17 per cent were placed in a queue. Those are people in desperate need. When we come to the most recent figures&#151;for February to March 2007&#151;only 4.8 per cent of calls were successful in getting through and no less than 54.4 per cent got a recorded message. That is unacceptable. Can the Minister tell me what he is going to do?</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08011465000075"></a>The conclusion of the independent report states,</p>
<ul><a name="08011465000129"></a>&#147;there is considerable evidence to show that serious and widespread difficulties remain for people trying to apply for crisis loans&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011465000118"></a>The Social Fund Commissioner suggests that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011465000130"></a>&#147;the Department takes urgent action to identify accurately the demand levels for crisis loans by telephone, provides the resources needed to meet that demand and publishes a standard for this service&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011465000119"></a>He also suggests that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011465000131"></a>&#147;the Department takes action to ensure its staff comply with the duty to accept applications and issue formal decisions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011465000076"></a>There is worrying evidence in his report of extreme regional disparities in performance. I am not quite as sad as my noble friend Lord Kirkwood, but I, too, have done a little study and looked at back reports. Why was it that in 2005-06 only 22.5 per cent of crisis-loan decisions in the south-east were confirmed&#151;in more than three-quarters of cases the office got it wrong&#151;which is less than half the level in some of the better areas? In 2006-07, the correct assessment rate in the north-east, the best region, was two and a half times higher than that in the south-east. What is it about the south-east that makes for these persistently poor results? What action will be taken?</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08011465000077"></a>As my noble friend Lord Kirkwood said, there is an unfortunate randomness and unfairness, and I shall talk about that a little more. There is a postcode lottery in the way the Social Fund works depending upon where one lives in the country. It works very fairly, but why should it be as the independent review service reported to the House of Commons Select Committee? It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="08011465000127"></a>&#147;The formula by which the budget is distributed to districts leads to significant inequity between different parts of the country. This contributes to wide disparity in decision-making  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1131"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and different outcomes for people depending on where they live. This can affect the amount of award and indeed whether an award is made at all&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011465000120"></a>In the highest-demand areas, restrictions mean that even people who meet the highest criteria of qualifying need are not receiving payments or are receiving insufficient payments. Out of 78 Social Fund districts in 2006-07, only 23 were able to grant all high priority need applications without restrictions. It is not surprising that the House of Commons Select Committee concluded:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="08011465000128"></a>&#147;We agree with the Social Fund Commissioner that it is &#147;unacceptable that someone can qualify [for a Grant] and have the items assessed as high priority and still not get a payment because there is not enough money&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011465000121"></a>That highlights the most immediate and urgent problems that I want to take up, following my noble friend. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

In one sense, nothing has changed since it was fully introduced in April 1988 by its insertion in the Social Security Act 1986, which was introduced by my noble friend Lord Fowler. I say that because it was, as it still is, severely cash-limited, even though, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, absolute poverty is now rising again. The Government regularly speak about financial inclusion and what they are doing to encourage it, but as things are at the moment, it appears to be failing the most vulnerable, the very people whom the Social Fund was set up to help.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08011465000079"></a>I note an answer given by the Minister responsible to the Treasury Select Committee of another place on 16 November 2006. He said,</p>
<ul><a name="08011465000132"></a>&#147;the social fund does not punch its weight in terms of the financial resources the government puts behind it&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011465000122"></a>That means even those resources that the spokesmen for the party on my right have described as, if not quite &#147;disgracefully limited&#148;, then verging on that. Later, the Minister said that he thought it was possible for the Social Fund,</p>
<ul><a name="08011465000133"></a>&#147;to do a good deal more in terms of sustainable support for people and more in terms of affordable credit lines than it does at the moment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011465000123"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s Question for Short Debate is timely indeed, and both he and I will expect to hear what more is being done, given that a year has passed since those comments were made by the Minister.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08011465000080"></a>It is not, to be fair, that the Government have been doing nothing over the past few years. They have abolished the double-debt rule whereby someone&#146;s available budgeting loan award was his maximum amount minus&#151;for some unknown reason&#151;twice his existing budgeting loan debt, and have replaced it with a single-debt rule. However, I would be grateful if the Minister would tell me how that works. Does it mean that loans are cumulative, as they should be? In other words, can loans be taken out in tranches, up to the maximum allowance? The Government have introduced just three rates for the budgeting loan  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1132"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>maximum amount: for single people; for childless couples; and for families, whether with one or two parents. They have increased the minimum budgeting loan that can be awarded from &#163;30 to &#163;100 and doubled the amount of capital an applicant can have to &#163;1,000 for the under-60s and &#163;2,000 to those over that age. They have also reduced the loan repayment rates and increased the loan repayment period. Lastly, they have increased the overall debt limit from &#163;1,000 to &#163;1,500.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08011465000081"></a>All these are positive measures, which we on this side of the House welcome, but&#151;and it is a big but&#151;they are useless if the people who need Social Fund loans cannot get access to them. Therein lies the problem that has beset the fund ever since its inception. The first problem is the uneven spread across the country of applicants and of the available finance in each social security office. Following Gershon principles, the Government are in the process of reducing the number of access points from the 120-odd social security offices that there used to be to just 20. They cover 23 areas, three of which are in London and one of which, for some unknown reason, is in Milton Keynes&#151;perhaps the Minister could explain that one. That means that for almost all clients, access to the Social Fund officer has to be by telephone, as we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, who pointed out some of the difficulties that that entails. During my research updating my knowledge of this subject, I heard of one client who gave up after two hours on the telephone. That is not uncommon, but is clearly a disgrace and needs to be rectified. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, that the problem does not necessarily lie at the door of the potential client: it is much more likely to lie at the door of the administrative facilities and the equipment of individual offices.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08011465000082"></a>This reduction of offices also means that Social Fund officers do not know the area from which the client is calling, so can no longer give advice about other appropriate sources of finance or whatever other help is required, as good officers were wont to do in days gone by, and the White Paper has suggested will become the norm. Furthermore, Leslie Strathie, the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus has confessed that telephone calls are neither recorded nor monitored. How does this help the client, or indeed those parliamentarians trying to understand what is going on? I have been told of a West Bromwich man who was unable to get through to the crisis loan number and spent the last of his money on fares to a jobcentre office to apply in writing, only to be told to keep trying the phone lines because written claims were no longer used, which is nonsense. That is totally unacceptable, and such statements can only be made because of a lack of training, or perhaps, in that particular case, retraining.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08011465000083"></a>Talking of training the officers, like the noble Lords on the Liberal Benches, I ask why there is such variation in decision times. The IRS informs me that for cases received from 1 April to 31 December, 68 per cent of initial decisions on community care grants were decided within 10 days. That is an average figure, and we all know that averages are the mean of extremes. As the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood said, in this particular case, performances ranged from 95 per  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1133"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cent in Northumberland to 21 per cent in Norwich. Why? Is it that there not enough staff in Norwich, that the budget is inadequate, that staff are taking too long to make a decision, or what? I do not regard there being more applicants in Norwich&#151;if there were&#151;as an excuse. As we have heard, when in the same period these decisions went to review, 40 per cent were reviewed in 10 days, again hiding wide variations; performances ranged from 92 per cent in Lancaster West to only 9 per cent in the West Midlands. The same two questions apply.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08011465000084"></a>The resolution of the levels of staffing is self-evident and can be dealt with; however, the question of money is not. I am not advocating injecting more money into the budget, but with only 20 area offices, the department should be able to do the same as I did when I was responsible in Northern Ireland. We had 21 or 23 social security offices&#151;I cannot quite remember&#151;and each one had already been given a monthly budget by the time I arrived. Inevitably, some offices overspent and others used nothing like the amount that they were allocated, so I took executive action to even this up by transferring money from the haves to the have-nots. Would that the Minister were working in a department where he had such power, but he clearly is not. Does he consider that that could become the norm in this country now there has been this drastic reduction in numbers of offices dealing with the Social Fund?</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08011465000085"></a>When a Social Fund application is refused, the would-be client turns to other sources of finance. Because banks are usually unwilling to lend money to such people for fear of non-repayment, almost their only recourse is to loan sharks and others with unacceptably high interest rates. They are often unaware of what they are getting into, even though annual percentage rates are published. The Institute of Financial Services published a study in 2006 saying that 79 per cent of the population did not understand the term &#147;APR&#148;, and, even more alarmingly, 50 per cent did not understand what &#147;50 per cent&#148; meant. If these figures are to be believed, and I have no reason to doubt them, that is hardly a plaudit for the expression &#147;education, education, education&#148;. What are the Government doing about financial education? The pressure on the Social Fund might decrease if people knew that they could afford other sources of finance. Those other sources include, but are not limited to, credit unions. These are, alas, not as numerous or as widespread as we would like. Will the Government seek to encourage their formation? The more available they become, the more we will encourage thrift in our society.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08011465000086"></a>Finally, I understand that most loans are for broken domestic appliances. Some offices, I am told, are giving loans of less than the replacement value of a bed, cooker or washing machine. It seems odd in this day and age that a refrigerator is still an excluded item&#151;I understand that loans are not given for them. Why will the Government not take up the suggestion of the Social Fund Commissioner who believes that with their purchasing power, the Government could get permitted items considerably cheaper, even at cost? The client could go along to the shop or manufacturer of his choice, and the local Social Fund officer would  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1134"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be sent the bill. All the client would need would be the authority to purchase&#151;up to, clearly, a certain limit. In case the Minister is frightened of a voucher scheme, recent research, I am told, has shown that more than 70 per cent of clients would find vouchers totally acceptable.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08011465000087"></a>So there are several low- and no-cost things that the Government could be doing to improve the Social Fund. I wait, with eagerness, to hear what is being done to improve its operation, over and above what has been done in the past 18 months or so.</p>

<a name="08011465000088"></a><b><a name="80114-0012.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08011465000161"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, for initiating the debate and for giving us an opportunity to discuss the Social Fund. I also thank the noble Lords, Lord Oakeshott and Lord Skelmersdale, for their contributions.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08011465000089"></a>I will start by outlining the Government&#146;s view on the Social Fund and reform. Noble Lords will know that the Social Fund was introduced over the period 1987 to 1988 to replace the old supplementary benefits single payments scheme. I am impressed that the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, was there at the birth of the arrangements. The scheme plays an important role in helping people on low incomes who are likely to have difficulty in coping with large one-off expenses. In particular, the discretionary part of the scheme provides a vital safety net for vulnerable people at times of pressure or crisis, as well as a budgeting tool for handling more routine expenditure.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08011465000090"></a>Overall, during 2006-07 the discretionary Social Fund provided help in the form of more than 2.6 million awards, mainly to people on qualifying income-related benefits. We paid 1.3 million budgeting loans amounting to nearly &#163;600 million, together with a further 1.1 million crisis loans amounting to a further &#163;100 million. That was in addition to more than a quarter of a million community care grants at a cost of &#163;140 million. From the start of the Social Fund until the end of November 2007, more than 35 million loans&#151;worth more than &#163;7.6 billion in cash terms&#151;and more than 4.9 million community care grant awards have been made. Whatever the challenges of the Social Fund, it is clearly meeting need in significant measure. The Social Fund plays a unique role in giving our customers a source of both discretionary and regulated grants, and of interest free credit. Unsurprisingly, it provides most assistance to people who are most vulnerable to financial pressures&#151;lone parents and disabled people.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08011465000091"></a>The Government have signalled a clear commitment to continue to help people on low fixed incomes to budget for their needs. We have made a number of significant improvements to the scheme. Between April 2003 and April 2008 we will have invested an additional &#163;300 million in the discretionary Social Fund to provide more help to more people and make more improvements, particularly to the budgeting loans scheme. In 1999, the Government transformed budgeting loans from a wholly discretionary scheme, where applicants had to justify the need applied for and the priority of that  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1135"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>need, to a scheme based on simple factual criteria that operates on a consistent basis throughout the country. We have built on these early changes, and in 2006, as has been acknowledged, we made further simplifications so that people could easily understand what they might expect to borrow and have a higher degree of certainty that they could get a loan. We recognised concerns about repayment terms and, as has been acknowledged by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, reduced the standard repayment rate from 15 per cent of benefit to 12 per cent, and extended the maximum repayment period from 78 to 104 weeks.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08011465000092"></a>Jobcentre Plus has undertaken a significant programme of change to modernise its services to customers and to improve efficiency. As has been recognised, Social Fund delivery has been centralised into 20 benefit delivery centres, pulling together expertise and providing opportunities for standardising procedures and improving the quality of decision-making. Jobcentre Plus is also looking at how to remove the need for a customer to visit an office to sign paperwork. That will provide better customer service and, in many cases, avoid the need for a customer to travel. We continue to look for ways to make improvements to the scheme and to its operation, where we can.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08011465000093"></a>Successive Ministers have made no secret that we want to change the budgeting loan element of the Social Fund to link it more closely with the Government&#146;s financial inclusion agenda. Many of the people we deal with on income-related benefits&#151;the people who apply to the discretionary Social Fund&#151;are financially excluded. They have little access to, or confidence in, their ability to handle mainstream financial services. As we know, exclusion from mainstream financial services can impose costs on those who can least afford them. The poorest in society can pay very high charges for credit; we are aware of 183 per cent or more from some home credit providers, and much more where someone has to resort to loan sharks. That is totally unacceptable.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08011465000094"></a>The Government&#146;s financial inclusion strategy is about ensuring that everyone has access to the services that they need to manage their money on a day-to-day basis, to plan for the future and cope with financial pressure, and to respond effectively to unexpected events. There is a clear link here with our employment goals. We see work as the best route out of poverty for most people. However, there is a problem if they do not have a bank account that wages can be paid into. Starting work means that they lose access to budgeting loans; and they may see little prospect of reasonable low-cost alternatives.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08011465000095"></a>The Government would like the significant resources that we have invested in the Social Fund to make a more effective contribution to helping people to overcome financial exclusion. The Government are trying to bridge the gap through helping to increase access to alternative forms of affordable credit for people on low income&#151;whether or not on benefit. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked about the third sector. We recognise the valuable role already played by third-sector lenders in providing low-cost services and loans to financially excluded people. I am referring, as he did, particularly to credit unions and  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1136"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>community development finance institutions, which operate on a not-for profit basis, especially in areas of high financial exclusion and deprivation.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08011465000096"></a>However, coverage is limited and in many areas people do not have access to those services. There is need for a larger capital and consumer base for the sector to grow and become sustainable. The Government launched their financial inclusion strategy in 2004. As part of that strategy, &#163;42 million was made available from the &#163;121 million financial inclusion fund for a growth fund to help make more affordable loans available to more people on low incomes in areas of high financial exclusion.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08011465000097"></a>Up to 30 November 2007, more than 53,000 loans worth more than &#163;23.5 million had been made from the growth fund to financially excluded people. The Government&#146;s financial inclusion action plan for 2008-2011, published in December, included a further &#163;38 million to support the growth fund. That action plan also announced plans to conduct a feasibility study to look into whether the private and third sectors could be brought into partnership with the Government in delivering a reformed Social Fund budgeting loans scheme.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08011465000098"></a>I believe that that could be a very important and significant step along the path to reform, but we must not underestimate the problems and the step change that would be needed. The study will need to assess a number of tough issues and we would have to be sure that any replacement scheme would deliver real advantages and would continue to provide the type of protection needed by the most vulnerable.</p>

<a name="80114-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08011465000099"></a>I turn now to some of the more specific points raised. All three noble Lords raised the issue of crisis loans and customers who are unable to make their application by telephone. Jobcentre Plus prefers to take applications for crisis loan living expenses by telephone. It is the quickest way for customers to have their application processed. However, Jobcentre Plus accepts that there are some customers who, for legitimate reasons, are unable to make the application by telephone and it will continue to accept applications made in writing and submitted through one of its offices. I acknowledge that that has not been the case in the past in every instance. Training is absolutely necessary to ensure that there is no recurrence of the instance to which the noble Lord referred.</p>

Specifically on crisis loans, which were the focus of some attention from all three noble Lords, in October 2007, the monthly number of applications reached about 200,000, which is up from about 100,000 per month in April 2006. There has been a large increase in crisis loan applications. There has been a response to that. There has been a doubling of the resource deployed on the Social Fund by asking staff from the contact centre directorate to get involved. There has

We have changed the opening hours of the telephone arrangements from 8.30 am to 4.30 pm and we have changed the internal processes, so that only a short call is needed once it becomes clear that a customer will not qualify for a crisis loan. That reduces the overall time. Clearly, we need to keep focused on those matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08011465000102"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Kirkwood and Lord Skelmersdale, referred to the Norwich benefit delivery centre. All three noble Lords referred to the disparity of outcomes across the various centres. We are aware of the need for action in Norwich in particular but, in mitigation, should mention that that is a centre to which we have only recently moved that work. Therefore, to an extent, that might be seen as teething problems, but we are not complacent and need to ensure that there is good performance right across the piece.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08011465000103"></a>On tackling arrears&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, focused on this&#151;community care grant applications rose during the summer months. Action was taken region by region to get those applications back on track. During October, the backlog was reduced from 24,000 to 13,500. The usual weekly intake is about 12,000, so an outstanding figure of about 13,000 means that we are nearly up-to-date. However, during November, there was another large increase in the number of crisis loan applications. Alongside the unusually high intake of community care grants for this month, that meant that we fell behind again. There are continuing challenges to meet the targets that we have set.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08011465000106"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, raised the issue of alignment payments. Of course we want to ensure that new claims to income-related benefits are paid as quickly as possible and that the minimum use is made of crisis loans in bridging the gaps. Jobcentre Plus has recently reviewed the guidance issued to staff on interim payments or payments on account, with instructions to ensure that those, rather than crisis loans, are paid when there is a delay in processing the main benefit. In addition to the written guidance, the process has been captured in the emergency payments component of the standard operating model.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08011465000107"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, referred to the quality of decision-making. The Social Fund Commissioners report for 2006-07 raised as an issue the development of a quality assurance framework. We have been pleased to address that issue and in response set up a joint IRS and Jobcentre Plus working

The framework was implemented in the Inverness and Newcastle benefit delivery centres in November 2007, with those sites acting as trailblazers, with full evaluation taking place before national rollout.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08011465000108"></a>A number of points were raised asserting that there is a postcode lottery. There is no such lottery for budgeting loans, and since 1999 it has been possible to ensure consistent national outcomes by ensuring a national steer on the borrowing loan for budgeting loan awards, and making any adjustments needed during the year. That has meant that people in the same circumstances get access to the same award wherever they live. Crisis loans, which are of course payable only in cases of extreme urgency, are payable if other qualifying conditions are met irrespective of where someone lives, or the time of year.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08011465000109"></a>The variation is most frequently raised regarding community care grants. We are keen to ensure that the availability of community care grant funding is fairly distributed between Jobcentre Plus operational units to achieve as consistent an outcome as possible in proportion to demand in those areas. In recognition of the concerns of the Work and Pensions Select Committee and the Social Fund commissioner, my colleague James Plaskitt gave an undertaking to that committee to review the current methodology of allocating the budget. That work is currently under way, and we will feed back to that committee once it has been completed.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80114-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08011470000004"></a>The noble Lord said: Our amendments seek to have adaptation issues included in the report on progress. It is illogical to focus the report purely on meeting the budgets for carbon emissions. If the intention is to get an accurate picture of our progress towards stopping climate change, we need to have a real picture of the effects of our proposals and the effects of climate change on the environment. Meeting the budget, although important, is not the only yardstick by which our attempt to save the environment should be judged. It is important that the report has some regard for the fact that proposals that are meeting the budgets might also be damaging the environment in other ways. It should be the aim of the annual report to monitor our progress in a more holistic fashion.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08011470000005"></a>If proposals to reduce carbon emissions are having a negative effect on the environment in other ways, this can be stopped only if it is monitored and reported on. Admittedly, this is not as easy to measure as carbon emissions. However, it is still important to include the more wide-ranging effects of our proposals to ensure that all aspects of climate change are being addressed. If they are not, we risk hearing yearly a false picture of our attempts to safeguard the environment. We should not forget that stopping global warming must not come at the price of ruining the environment in other ways. As we on this side of the Chamber have mentioned before, the deforestation of the rainforests for biofuels is a perfect example of the way in which even well intentioned attempts to stop climate change might be counterproductive. We intend through our amendments to avoid this sort of tunnel vision, and thus think that it is important to include in the report consideration of the adaptation to climate change and proposals to stop it. With that in mind, I beg to move.</p>

The climate change committee has an extremely important role, and it should concentrate on it. We have spent some considerable time describing what it should do and how it should work.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08011470000007"></a>Although it does not need to be of the same stature and importance per se as the climate change committee, an independent scrutiny committee for adaptation is needed. In terms of climate change and climate change policy, there is a natural divide between adaptation and policy concerning stopping carbon and other greenhouse gases that cause climate change. A climate change committee can do one thing, but an independent scrutiny committee can do the other. We believe very strongly that there needs to be a mirror committee of statute concerned with adaptation. It would let the climate change committee get on with its area and this committee could look at adaptation.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08011470000008"></a>In this amendment, we have listed the areas that this committee should look at. We also would want to add it&#151;I have not included them at this stage&#151;ecology and biodiversity in relation to adaptation, which are key areas in addition to those I have listed in the amendment. Adaptation is a key, but small, part of this Bill, yet we know that if the world was perfect we would not need adaptation. Through flooding, rising sea levels and the other indicators of climate change that we see nationally and globally, we already know that we need to have a very active adaptation programme and strategy. It is right that it is part of this Bill&#151;the Government have put it in&#151;but we need it to be stronger and to take up a much greater role in this legislation. As part of that, we want in a way to copy the Government&#146;s ideas for an independent committee, but to have this for adaptation as well. This is key to the combating&#151;perhaps not the mitigation&#151;and the tackling of the problems that we have already stored up for ourselves over the past 50 years of industrialisation.</p>

<a name="08011470000009"></a><b><a name="80114-0013.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08011470000094"></a>Baroness Young of Old Scone:</b> I support Amendment No. 183B, which is tabled also in my name. The previous two contributors have almost made apology for adaptation, but it is not only as important as the task of reducing greenhouse gases and climate change; it will become increasingly important. We already know that the carbon out there will increase the amount of floods, heat waves and droughts. Indeed, we are seeing floods again this week. This will become an increasingly important set of impacts with great public salience and relevance. They will be the immediately visible elements of climate change for the public.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08011470000010"></a>Adaptation will be important, not only to avoid some of the major economic, social and environmental impacts of climate change, but also to avoid the political impacts of an increasingly impacted upon and concerned public. It is important that the Bill is strengthened in terms of the adaptation agenda. One way to do that would be to provide for independent scrutiny of the Government&#146;s risk analysis and the adaptation programme in a similar way to the independent scrutiny to be exerted by the climate change committee over the targets issue.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08011470000011"></a>Specific skills will be needed for that; namely, skills in risk analysis, technical skills in water supply, flood risk management, public health, contingency planning,  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1141"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>economics, asset management and infrastructure, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said, ecology and biodiversity. Not only would these skills be necessary to do an appraisal of the risk assessment and the programmes, they also would enable the Government to gain from an appraisal of the adaptation agenda a background, a context, for successive carbon budgets. That would be a useful analysis to feed into the work of the Committee on Climate Change. Clearly if the impacts of climate change were getting worse, we would need to be a lot more stringent about how fast we were approaching the budgets and targets.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08011470000012"></a>The amendments that you have before you are threefold and to some extent they encapsulate the range of options open if there was to be a process of independent scrutiny. Amendment No. 158 talks about giving that role to the Committee on Climate Change. We have already talked about the fact that that would extend the role of the committee and diffuse it from its key focus, which needs to be targets in greenhouse gas reduction. It would mean another set of skills and the committee would probably have to be bigger, which would not be a good idea.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08011470000013"></a>Amendment No. 175 gives a role to the Environmental Audit Committee but really what is required is independent scrutiny on the basis of scientific expertise. The Environmental Audit Committee would be parliamentary scrutiny but would not be in the position of having specialist expertise. We would need to bring that in. Again, that does not quite do the trick.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08011470000014"></a>The proposal in Amendment No. 183B for an adaptation committee would bring in that specific expertise and would allow for an independent assessment of the Government&#146;s risk assessment on the adaptation plan and progress against it on an expert basis, not on a political basis. If that was seen as more bureaucracy, more committees and more cost, it could be done on a periodic basis rather than having a Standing Committee. That would reduce all of those concerns but it would be a bit cheeseparing, to be honest, in the face of the real economic and social impacts that climate change is going to produce in terms of our requirement to adapt. The figures for flood risk management and flood damage alone are astronomically large. Quibbling about the cost of a small expert committee is too much. An adaptation committee, given a very tight focus on technical assessment of the adaptation agenda, would provide a real focus that could feed into the considerations of the Committee on Climate Change. It would give a reassurance to the public and above all would probably give defence to the Government of the day when climate change impacts start to really produce major public concern about the floods, droughts, heat waves and desertification that we are inevitably going to see as climate change bites.</p>

I agree that we are going to need a committee to

As has already been indicated, there is a difficulty about my noble friend&#146;s amendment in the sense that he or the committee are looking at future policies&#151;the effectiveness of policies to reduce future carbon emissions and progress in that direction. When we come to adaptation, we are not dealing so much with those future policies. We are dealing with the consequences of what has already happened over the past couple of hundred years. We are now facing the need to respond to what exists at present. There will come a moment when the two things interlock as we move into the future but for the foreseeable future, we have to adapt to the consequences of past actions. There is a legitimate question of whether, by giving it this task, it should really be for the climate change committee to look at future policies in addition to its existing heavy burdens.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08011470000016"></a>On the other hand, I am not sure that Amendment No. 183B goes far enough. If we are to have an independent scrutiny committee, it certainly will have to do what is suggested in that amendment, but it does not actually suggest that it should report on how things are going and the achievements so far. The new clause provides that the committee should consider the adequacy of assessments and of any programmes, but does not seek the progress report that my noble friend seeks in his amendment and what I think we should require.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08011470000017"></a>Curiously, Clause 49 provides the Secretary of State with a reporting function, but with no indication of how frequently that should happen and whether there would be regular updates. The clause states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="08011470000085"></a>&#147;It is the duty of the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament from time to time a programme&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011470000079"></a>It then provides for the proposals and policies employed to meet the objectives that have been set. Later the clause provides that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="08011470000086"></a>&#147;The second and each subsequent programme under this section must contain an assessment of the progress made towards implementing the objectives, proposals and policies set out in earlier programmes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011470000080"></a>But it does not say how frequently new programmes and policies should be developed. We could go for many years before the Secretary of State brings forward a set of new policies and proposals or any report at all on how well these matters are being dealt with.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08011470000018"></a>My conclusion from all this is that we have to have a regular system of reporting. It is highly desirable, and when we come to the later clause, I shall support amendments that address the need for thorough policies; we will debate them later. I do not think that either of the amendments before us fully meets the need for regular progress reports. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say and I hope he will agree that there is a need for such reports. It may be that on Report we shall have to come back with something like Amendment No. 183B to the relevant part of the Bill and make sure that regular reports are produced and are not dependent on how frequently the Secretary of State comes forward with fresh proposals. Indeed, if the noble Lord who moved the amendment were to come forward later with a suitably adjusted proposal, I certainly would support it.</p>

It is particularly useful to see the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, in his place, because I have two points that I wish to make. The first is that the only deficiency in the Joint Committee&#146;s report was the passage on adaptation. That had absolutely everything to do with time pressure. We were up against almost insane time constraints to get the report out, and we did not do that part justice. Indeed, all that has been said by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, is accurate.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08011470000021"></a>Secondly, the only Member of the Committee who, so far as I am aware, has any real experience of the issue of adaptation is the noble Lord, Lord Fowler. When he was Secretary of State for Health, he moved with great speed and effectiveness on the issue of AIDS. The situation was similar in that it arose as a consequence of actions that had in some cases taken place years before; there was an awareness of the dangers, and the need to move swiftly. Adaptation will be expensive and complicated, and will involve people and expertise quite unlike those of the climate change committee itself. It is going to be a very important part of the Bill and I can only hope that we learn from the experiences of the past. We must take on board many of the actions taken so promptly and brilliantly by the Government of the day; frankly, that put Britain in a better place in the fight against AIDS than any other country in the world. If we can achieve the same with climate change, we could be very proud of ourselves.</p>

<a name="08011470000022"></a><b><a name="80114-0013.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08011470000097"></a>The Earl of Selborne:</b> Amendment No. 183B brings us to Part 4 of the Bill. We are discussing adaptation slightly out of context; we are still on the Committee on Climate Change. I accept that these three clauses may need amendment, but what needs to be discussed at this stage is whether the work of advising the Secretary of State on how he can fulfil his responsibilities in Part 4 can adequately be fulfilled by the Committee on Climate Change or one of its sub-committees, or whether it would be better to have a separate advisory body with different expertise. We have already heard from all around the Committee that the case for having a separate conduit is strong. The timescale is different, the expertise is different and the immediacy is different&#151;although one could argue about that, perhaps.</p>

<a name="80114-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08011470000023"></a>I am quite clear that it would be helpful to have expertise that was specifically encouraged to advise the Secretary of State&#151;in the widest sense, meaning the whole Government. Just about every department and, indeed, the rest of the economy, will have to address the sort of issues that the committee envisaged in Amendment No. 183B, will be advising on. Although I accept that any amendment that imposes yet further committees has an onus to justify its position, in this case I would go along with the proposal.</p>

It is important to realise that an immense amount of carbon is already embedded in the infrastructure, in roads, power stations and water treatment plants. What if they are destroyed by flood? The housing stock is built to retain heat, rather than to be cool, which will be a major issue in the future. We have already talked about the enormous amount of carbon that has been put into the atmosphere over the past 200 years. We have to start thinking about preserving infrastructure, because replacing infrastructure is incredibly carbon-expensive. It is an issue that we will move back on to, but I very much hope that the Minister will realise that the committee should look at embedded carbon costs. If we lose the infrastructure and need to replace it, we will add yet more carbon.</p>

At that time he persuaded the then Cabinet to put that leaflet&#151;some 20 million of them&#151;through every door in the country. I do not think that a Labour Cabinet would have done it at the time. His powers of persuasion over the need for change were vital. This translates across; this is also a powerful argument that works in more than one policy area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08011470000026"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, rightly demanded a timetable for the reports. I draw his attention to Clause 48, because the timetable is there. It says that the first report must be laid within three years of Royal Assent, with subsequent reports at least every five years after that. I know that most of the noble Lord&#146;s remarks were on Clause 49, but it is linked to Clause 48; both are about adaptation. The timetable is in Clause 48 because the Clause 49 report responds to the risks identified in Clause 48. In other words, something is set out in the Bill in respect of a timetable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08011470000029"></a>The comments we have heard recognise that the Government&#146;s work on adaptation needs independent scrutiny, and we agree. We do not think that any of the amendments meet this need. However, I am more than happy to take away this issue and this package and consider them before the next stage. This comprises a separate issue in the Bill. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, made the point that the range of expertise required here is slightly different from that required in the rest of the Bill. This matter requires further work. We shall certainly consider independent scrutiny of the Government&#146;s work on adaptation.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08011470000081"></a>However, what we are looking for here is a report on progress made in dealing with the matter. Therefore, we are trying to take the matter slightly further forward than Clause 48 provides for.</p>

I realise that the Committee seeks to take the Bill further forward. The status quo is not acceptable to most Members. We are happy to look at this package comprising Amendments Nos. 158, 175 and 183B. We shall see whether we can find a satisfactory way of dealing with this. However, we baulk at an issue in Amendment No. 175. It is not appropriate for government to require Parliament to do things when Select Committees are their own masters. They are the House committees. Further, they may not always comprise their present form so there is a danger in including such a measure in primary legislation. We ought to be wary of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08011470000032"></a>As regards Amendment No. 183B, setting up new independent committees on an ad hoc basis could be resource intensive and we are not clear what such committees would do in between time. However, I am not knocking the amendment on these technical grounds. I am conscious that I forecast at Second Reading that the Government would bring forward an amendment with regard to what they intended to do about adaptation, and that we have not done so. However, we hope to do so very shortly. It is an area on which we want to move in Committee if possible so that people can see how the land lies. We shall come back to this matter on Report when we have considered it further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08011470000037"></a>This section relates to the duty of the committee with regard to its annual reports. It makes special mention of its report in the second year after the end of a budgetary period. That will have to take account of the final statement from the Secretary of State who, under Section 14, will have had five months&#151;until 31 May&#151;to produce it. If we assume that, in any year where 31 May is a Saturday, a Sunday or a Bank Holiday Monday, the Secretary of State will have completed his report beforehand and the committee will have had between 20 and 22 days in which to produce the section reviewing the progress that has just been summarised by the Secretary of State. That reflects five years of a budgetary period.</p>

That will not, however, necessarily be adequate to allow, in four weeks, a full appreciation of the Secretary of State&#146;s justification for the work of the preceding five-year budgetary period. Should the Secretary of State be unable to complete his report until, let us say, 1 or 2 June, the time available to the committee will be reduced by 5 or 10 per cent. There can very quickly be a significant erosion of the time to deliberate properly.</p>

<a name="80114-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08011470000039"></a>As things stand, the Secretary of State will receive the report of the committee on or before 30 June and will then have three and a half months in which to draft his response, and discuss it with the other national authorities, prior to laying it before Parliament not later than 15 October.</p>

<a name="80114-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08011470000040"></a>It seems to us that the balance on these dates is not quite right and that the committee should be given adequate time in which to evaluate the Secretary of State&#146;s assessment of each budgetary period. In our view such an evaluation is likely, every five years, to take considerably longer than the four weeks allowed in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80114-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08011470000041"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 159, having just expressed our concern that the committee is not being given sufficient reporting time in the years where they have to include a commentary on the outcome of the preceding budgetary period, it would appear that the Government share our anxiety and are prepared in principle to allow the committee extra time in which to complete its statutory duties. Unfortunately, the wording in the Bill does not specify any circumstances in which that leeway will be applied. Our concern is that the only cause for extending the committee&#146;s reporting period will be where the Secretary of State is unable to meet his statutory time limit and the committee will find itself at the end of each five-year budgetary period with a scant four weeks in which to assimilate the final figures, assess their meaning, review the measures that gave rise to them and evaluate the outcomes.</p>

<a name="80114-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08011470000042"></a>Few assemblies could contain a greater collective knowledge of the ways committees function than your Lordships&#146; House, but experience tells me that if the secretariat can do all of the analysis and suggest a commentary that appears to all committee members to be logical, comprehensive and positive there will be little need of many meetings or further research. If, however, the situation is not so clear&#151;if there is a range of opinion among the members of the committee or if the results to be assessed are not more or less as expected or desired&#151;there may be a need for several meetings with a fair amount of preparation in between. In such circumstances, the final wording is also often seen as being critical. At such times, the four weeks allowed to the committee would be impossibly constraining. Our view is that this section, as it stands, is likely to lead to unnecessary stress and missed deadlines. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08011470000082"></a>Is there any limit to which that response can be extended, because many of us who have waited for Government responses to Select Committee reports and other such documents find that the Government&#146;s timetable can be slightly elastic in certain cases? I say that because it will obviously have major impacts on policy if the response is to be shifted over a long period, especially if you are dealing with a five-year period. Does that eat into the next year&#146;s budgetary period, or does it affect only the period in which the Government are responding? Does it have any effect on the budgetary provisions set out by the committee? The committee&#146;s work will obviously be greatly affected not only by its report but by the Government&#146;s response.</p>

When we looked at the analysis of the amendments, we thought that other issues were bubbling away about setting budgets going forward, rolling periods and the 30 June report coinciding with other 30 June reports. Looking at the timetable, the intention is clearly to give the committee flexibility about extending the time that it needs to report and thereon to give the Secretary of State more time, should the committee decide to extend the timing of its report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08011470000056"></a>The noble Baroness said: The debates and the development of the Bill have been absorbing. I was on the Joint Committee, along with many other Members who are here this evening. There has been a genuine dialogue and a good level of consensus on the Bill right from the outset, and I hope to follow that lead in moving the amendment.</p>

<a name="80114-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08011470000057"></a>The purpose of the amendment is absolutely clear, and I will restrict all my arguments to the potential of energy saving through daylight saving schemes. I do not need to remind noble Lords that the purpose of daylight saving is to adapt time so that the daylight hours can be used more efficiently, corresponding closely with waking hours. There are numerous models, but it is not my intention to describe them at length. It is enough to say that the expert Committee on Climate Change would be far better placed to select a model for the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80114-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08011470000058"></a>In previous debates we have suggested several additional duties to those laid out in the Bill for the climate change committee and I think that daylight saving could be another. All the scientific evidence suggests that reaching targets set out in the Bill will be a severe challenge. Those very targets may well become even more stringent as scientific evidence mounts as to the seriousness of climate change threat. In fact I would go as far as to say that the pressure is increasing daily, not only in emissions but also with a huge rise in energy prices. Daylight saving helps in both those areas.</p>

<a name="80114-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08011470000059"></a>According to evidence received from Dr Garnsey at Cambridge University, who bases her work on statistics from the National Grid, there would have been an electricity saving of 2.78 megawatts if winter clock time had been Greenwich meantime plus one in 2006&#151;a significant saving. Emissions savings would have been 1.2 million tonnes of CO2. That is using the most modest daylight saving schemes. More extreme models would be even more effective. There is also the fact that daylight saving switches usage away from peak time, which is more costly, to cheaper times, so the consumer benefits both ways, not only in lower emissions but in lower electricity bills.</p>

<a name="80114-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08011470000060"></a>If proposals laid out in the Bill are to be translated into fact, measures to reduce climate change have got to be timed properly. The Stern report made no bones about it. The sooner we tackle climate change, it says, the cheaper and more effective it will be. So here is a start. We have role models all around the globe. The USA and Australia significantly have already adopted daylight saving schemes which have found favour with their citizens and at least another 70 countries have already instituted such schemes. There are more in the pipeline. I guarantee that all industrialised countries will look closely at more stringent schemes in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08011470000061"></a>At virtually no cost, with proven success around the world, we could have our own daylight saving scheme in place in a very short time. We would have the guarantee of expert opinion from the climate change committee and we would see considerable energy savings for everyone in the UK.</p>

<a name="80114-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08011470000062"></a>To reject this proposal would be flying in the face of scientific evidence and the well-being of our citizens. I hope I have made the case as energy-efficiently as I am able. I look forward to contributions from all sides of the Committee and, of course, from the Minister. I beg to move.</p>

In the Second World War, when energy was absolutely critical, we introduced daylight saving. We did that because it was necessary and it worked. At the end of the Second World War, for reasons I am not aware of, it was discontinued. That seemed a pity. There have been various attempts, however, to reintroduce daylight saving ever since and so far they have failed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08011470000064"></a>In December I asked the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, a supplementary oral question about the introduction of daylight saving as an energy measure and in his response he said he tended to agree with this proposal and that he thought it was a good idea. Here is an opportunity for him to move forward and agree something straightaway by accepting the amendment. It would be the first amendment in the whole of these five days which the Government had been prepared to accept forthwith. I hope, therefore, that this will work now and that we can move ahead. The noble Baroness, Lady Billingham, has made it extremely clear that there are plenty of precedents for how you can establish this in a separate measure. It would be a simple measure, it would achieve the objectives of the Bill and it would counteract all the technical things about emissions which have been discussed. I hope that the Government will agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08011470000068"></a>There are two ways of adjusting to the winter period. You have to decide whether you want to have dark mornings or light evenings and people have to adjust their working hours. Coming down to London nowadays, I am amazed at the lifestyle that most people seem to adopt. They have no idea that it is dark in the mornings because they seem to get up so late and the shops open at quite ridiculously late hours. Nothing much happens before ten o&#146;clock and you cannot get hold of anybody. I come from a part of the world where people have to get up early because the goods they produce are demanded in the marketplace early in the day. Such an amendment is not about making evenings lighter but mornings darker. If you get up early in the morning, it is dark long enough before the day starts.</p>

<a name="80114-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08011470000069"></a>I make a serious point about people who live in the countryside: the coldest time of the day is in the early morning. The period of travelling to work coincides with the frostiest of roads. Most rural roads are not gritted; certainly people who come to work at my place must travel on ungritted roads. This is a serious problem if you are starting your work in order to meet markets and get goods in the marketplace at the right time of day. So this measure does not have my personal support, or that of the Opposition.</p>

I come from a deeply rural area myself where milk tankers now usually collect the milk around midday or 1 pm. This argument of getting goods to market does not really hold as much water&#151;or milk&#151;as it might have done 30 or 40 years ago.

I ask the young noble Baroness and those who have spoken to pay fairly close attention to what my noble friend Lord Taylor on the Front Bench said. The hours of daylight are given, but it is hard, as the noble Baroness said, for those living north as I do. I live in Angus, which she will see from the map is quite far north. Yet my noble friend Lord Caithness lives even further north, about as far north as you can get. If we adopt so-called daylight saving, it is lovely here, it is just fine, but I invite the noble Baroness who moved the amendment, and others, to follow my noble friend Lord Caithness to Wick in winter.

There is an advantage in the summer, when the days are longer and you do not need to use the lights&#151;though of course in Sweden and Norway we can certainly find evidence that the lights are kept on for various reasons. The noble Baronesses and those who have proposed or supported this amendment might just think that this great United Kingdom of ours stretches a long way; indeed Scotland stretches even further than where I live. I would love to have some support and to hear the views from this Viking of the north, my noble friend.</p>

I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, would repeat this were he here.

If mornings are darker, will people get up later? What will be the savings if the working day extends well into the evenings? How will the energy savings be translated?

Personally&#151;and unless I speak personally I am speaking for the Government&#151;I have a good deal of sympathy with the concept. We can go back to the history and, as my noble friend Lord Whitty said, we can look at the various issues, at the various interest groups&#151;whether road safety interests, farmers or anyone else who has to do things&#151;and at the evidence of what happened in 1968, which I remember. We can think about all that and then dismiss it. We are now in a different world. The issue is whether this will help us in respect of climate change and emissions. If it was thought advantageous in that respect then there would be an overwhelming argument in favour, but all I can bring is bad news. By the way, I should say that I am not completely convinced that there is a settled government view on this because in the past couple of years, in Answer to a Question from the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, I have heard one department say from this Dispatch Box that it was in favour of it but another department say the opposite.

The study indicated that putting the clocks forward an additional hour in winter and summer would lead to a net increase in carbon dioxide emissions, corresponding to about 1 per cent of total UK emissions, as a result of increased energy consumption in UK buildings for lighting, space heating and cooling. It also showed that a switch to British Summer Time all year round would increase emissions by just under 0.5 per cent. The study was based on modelling patterns of energy use in the UK buildings stock. Even if there were conclusive evidence that a change would reduce emissions&#151;and the evidence is that it would not&#151;the

That experiment was abandoned for all sorts of reasons. The situations that apply today did not apply in 1968, so it is quite legitimate to raise this issue. The Building Research Establishment&#146;s research was probably quite narrow and not comprehensive. On the other hand, it is probably not a good idea to lumber the climate change committee with this.

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="0801157000022"></a>In order to fulfil its functions under the Bill, the Committee on Climate Change may need to undertake other activities such as commissioning research or entering into contracts. Clause 31, to which these amendments relate, gives the committee the power to do anything that appears to it necessary or appropriate for the purpose of, or in connection with, carrying out its functions. These are standard provisions for a non-departmental public body that allow it to operate effectively and independently of government. Subsection (2) merely sets out examples to illustrate the scope of the power, and the additions these amendments propose are unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0801157000023"></a>Amendment No. 161A would make explicit that the committee may acquire, hold and dispose of land or any interest in land, but this provision is covered by the current drafting of subsection 31(2)(b), to which the noble Earl referred. This provision illustrates the fact that the committee may acquire, hold and dispose of property. As the noble Earl suggested, &#147;property&#148; covers land and interests in land&#151;referred to in law as real property&#151;as well as other personal property. The amendment is therefore superfluous. I hope that those comments have helped to reassure the noble Earl.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0801157000024"></a>Amendments Nos. 162 and 163 are also an unnecessary addition to the list of specific examples of the use of ancillary powers. We do not need additional examples, because obtaining advice will be covered by Clause 31(1), which sets out the committee&#146;s general ancillary power, which is obviously very broad. Where that advice is in the form of research, for example, it is specifically covered by Clause 31(2)(a). I therefore see no value in making such amendments to the Bill, but I appreciate the opportunity to make this comment on the record. I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0801157000029"></a>The noble Earl said: This is a probing amendment, although it may not look like one. It places a duty on the national authorities to pay an annual levy to fund the work of the Committee on Climate Change. That is simply one way to fund it. However, by tabling the amendment, our intention was to seek an explanation for the record as to the precise cost structure and funding of the committee.</p>

<a name="80114-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="0801157000030"></a>Will the Minister explain for the record his predictions of how much it will cost and from where the money will come? Can he tell us what the shadow committee will cost and what will be the ongoing costs of the committee annually? Presumably, that is calculated assuming a committee of nine and a staff of 20. Does the Minister think that that will be enough money? Can he explain if he thinks that that will be an adequate staff? What provisions are there for increasing the committee&#146;s budget and its number of staff?</p>

<a name="80114-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="0801157000031"></a>Essentially, I want the Minister to explain the financial aspects of the committee, the ways in which he might foresee that changing and the mechanism for adjusting that change. I beg to move.</p>

The committee secretariat will be the core in-house analytical resource available to the climate change committee.</p>

<a name="80114-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="0801157000033"></a>In March 2007, alongside the draft Bill, the estimate was that the cost of the committee secretariat would come to just over &#163;800,000 a year. Since then, taking account of the pre-legislative scrutiny, and as a result of discussion with the shadow secretariat as it scoped its work, it is reckoned that the resources made available to the committee should be increased by about 50 per cent. We anticipate that the secretariat will consist of about 20 people, representing a larger and more senior secretariat&#151;a similar size and make-up to the team that carried out the Stern review.</p>

<a name="80114-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="0801157000034"></a>The other figure that I have&#151;it can only be an estimate at this stage&#151;is that we envisage that the committee will require in the region of &#163;2.6 million per annum once it is put on a statutory basis. Those are the only figures that I have to share with the Committee.</p>

<a name="80114-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="0801157000035"></a>By the way, we do not believe that the committee's budget should be dictated by the committee. There is no non-departmental body in Whitehall that fixes its own budget. That may seem a good idea, but I can assure the Committee that that is not how the system

So we cannot accept that amendment, but we are committed to ensuring that the committee is adequately resourced and will discuss and agree the committee's annual budget with both the national authorities and the committee itself. We do not envisage any difficulties with the devolved Administrations. They have agreed the Bill and the funding mechanisms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="0801157000036"></a>We are committed to ensuring that the committee provides good quality independent advice. To do that, it needs sufficient funding to be truly independent. As I said, the figure that I have at the moment is purely an estimate of just over &#163;2.5 million, once it is on a statutory basis. I will seek to get some more information before Report, but it may not be much more detail than that, because these are very early days.</p>

The Joint Committee made two specific comments. It expressed a good deal of concern about the scale of the research budget included in the original estimates, as we felt that was likely to be inadequate. We also suggested&#151;particularly in the light of comments from spokesmen and Ministers from Defra about the funding burden falling wholly on them&#151;that the funding mechanism for the committee should be established outwith the Defra budget. Has the Minister any comment on those two specific points?</p>

It would erode the independence of the committee if the execution of its duties could be changed by order.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="0801158000094"></a>&#147;In this Act &#145;national authority&#146; means any of the following&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0801158000087"></a>The list starts with the Secretary of State. In this Bill, there is a form of distinction. I accept that there probably is a distinction, because the Secretary of State may well be in a somewhat separate situation from the national authorities. However, the definitions at the end of the Bill say that the Secretary of State is a national authority, and I wonder whether there might be an issue that should be clarified before we finally dispose of the Bill&#151;if we ever reach Report, which I suppose we will one day; at the moment, Report seems to get further away rather than closer.</p>

We are dealing with the United Kingdom body here; with the four institutions that will take the joint decisions: the Scottish Executive, the Welsh Assembly, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and in effect the UK Government. The UK Government is the Secretary of State, hence the four national authorities. That is all it is. There is nothing special here. Nor is there anything new about it, but I hope that that answers the noble Lord&#146;s question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="0801158000021"></a>As I said, there is nothing new here. There is a natural suspicion, but honestly it is not justified. The power to give a direction to a non-departmental public body is perfectly standard and applies to all the NDPBs, but it is important to ensure good governance and financial probity. The power will not undermine the committee&#146;s independence in any way. Therefore, the clause states explicitly that the committee cannot be given directions on the content of advice, but it is important that the national authorities have the power to issue directions in the case of any non-departmental public body. This is to provide a degree of control over a publicly funded body by government as a reserve power.</p>

Furthermore, Clause 71 lays down that national authorities are to be treated as part of the UK, except for waste reduction schemes, climate change in Wales and fines. It is surprising therefore to read that national authorities may set up their own trading schemes. It is even more surprising to realise that this part of the Bill defines a trading scheme, sets broad limits on its activities, defines who the national authorities are and goes into some detail about the making of regulations and the giving of guidance, directions and grants, but says nothing about the scope of trading schemes. Are they each unique?</p>

<a name="80114-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="0801158000029"></a>Schedule 2 refers to activities occurring in various locations and to activities of a particular kind carried on in the UK or in part of the UK. Is this a clever way to make sure that the work is divided between the various authorities? For instance, Scotland would deal with schemes in transport and agriculture for the UK as a whole, while Wales would take manufacturing, shops, offices and commercial premises and England would have the NHS, the armed services and schools. Alternatively, is it intended that, for example, farmers in Scotland will have a trading scheme that reflects the way they have adopted the single farm payment scheme, while Wales and England have something different? Will the suppliers of gas and electricity find themselves dealing with three or four different schemes or will they face many schemes set up and run by three or four Administrations? Can a participant belong to more than one trading scheme? Will he be able to shop around? Will someone with interest in several places be able to put all those interests into the scheme that gives him the best deal? Will someone with several interests have to subscribe to a number of schemes?</p>

One of the characteristics of trading schemes is that the smaller they are, the more difficult the marketability of the asset.

It seems to me that we are asking for trouble. You only have to look at the appalling difficulties between Northern Ireland and southern Ireland with differentials in cross-border duties leading to strong cross-border smuggling operations to see what can happen if you get two different regimes in close proximity. I am trying to imagine what might happen in Hereford if they supply goods to Wales or Wales supplies goods to Hereford because of the cross-border situation. The same situation could arise in Berwick-upon-Tweed or Carlisle between England and Scotland. We shall find ourselves fraught with difficulty if we have too many schemes. Therefore, the proposal that the Secretary of State should have the responsibility for controlling this situation is probably very close to essential, if not absolutely essential.</p>

On a much more serious note, this amendment does not take account of the fact that in many of the areas where action will need to be taken, it is a devolved issue. This amendment will stop things happening in those areas. The Secretary of State cannot act in terms of Scotland and Northern Ireland in devolved matters. We have a pig in a poke here.

The amendment would remove the ability to introduce UK-wide trading schemes in areas of the UK which were devolved. That ought to turn everybody off. Once the penny drops that taking out &#147;national authorities&#148; and putting in &#147;Secretary of State&#148; means that in any area of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales where it is a devolved issue, you cannot have a UK-wide system because the Secretary of State has no authority to bring in those measures. They have to be brought in by the devolved authority. At a stroke, UK-wide trading schemes would be stopped in areas where what you are doing for trading is a devolved matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="0801158000037"></a>The amendment would also remove the power of the devolved Administrations to establish trading schemes using the powers in the Bill either individually or in concert with one or more of the other national authorities. Taking that approach would not be consistent with the flexible approach we have adopted elsewhere in the Bill. We think that flexibility is important, given the long-term framework of the legislation to establish us to 2050 and beyond.</p>

<a name="80114-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="0801158000038"></a>As I have said, it is the case that significant parts of climate change policy are devolved in different parts of the UK, and the devolution settlements are themselves different. This amendment would make it impossible for the very thing noble Lords have talked about to happen: it would be impossible for UK-wide trading schemes to be introduced. I rest my case there because we all want the schemes to be as large as possible and thus get economies of scale. It would limit the effectiveness of the powers and the ability to reduce emissions through them, and it would lead to considerable duplication and administrative complexity for business. In other words, the amendment would have precisely the opposite effect of what is intended simply because whoever drafted it forgot that in parts of the UK, policy issues are devolved and the Secretary of State has no authority.</p>

<a name="80114-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="0801158000039"></a>I shall give one example: that of the new carbon reduction commitment. The new trading scheme targeting the emissions from large non energy-intensive public and private organisations is in a policy area which is devolved across the UK. We have proposed for consultation to introduce this policy on a UK-wide basis using the powers in this Bill. However, the amendment would make that impossible. There would be no UK-wide emissions trade schemes where areas are devolved. Because most schemes would be based on the UK, it would be much more efficient that way.</p>

I wonder if he could explain the way around it. I accept, because I must, that if our amendment goes through there would be parts of the UK where these matters are devolved and a marketing scheme could not be applied. That is a problem and gives a different form of differential. But if we have the individual devolved authorities being able to establish their own marketing schemes all on different bases, we still have the problem. I am sure that the intention of my noble friend is to try to ensure that do not we have a problem with differentials. I do not think, with respect, that the Minister has explained how we can overcome that.</p>

On the one hand, the intention is to stop little trading schemes being set up in different parts of the UK. That would cause difficulties. Our intention is for the Bill to be as flexible as possible and in the main for most trading schemes to be UK wide. But to be UK-wide in devolved areas where the policy is devolved, we have to include the national authorities; that is, the Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Administrations. Acting in concert with the Secretary of State&#151;with England, if I can put it that way&#151;we can get a UK-wide trading scheme up and running. So if the intention is to stop one-off trading schemes in the national authority areas alone, frankly this amendment would not do that; you would need another amendment for that.</p>

<a name="80114-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="0801158000042"></a>Accepting this amendment would stop the very thing that we are all agreed might be desirable&#151;UK-wide systems. But if you want to stop separate systems from England being set up in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, that requires a completely different amendment. The Bill is sufficiently flexible to allow the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, in their various ways, to put in place mechanisms for doing something for them alone. It would be almost impossible to impose this on Northern Ireland because it has to deal with the Republic of Ireland; there is no question about that.</p>

<a name="80114-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="0801158000043"></a>In the interests of less complexity and not putting burdens on business, it would be in the interests of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to be part of a UK setup. The Bill allows for flexibility should there be an occasion where a policy area could be dealt with another way. I oppose the amendment because it simply stops UK-wide trading schemes in areas where the policy issue is devolved. That is my starting point and, on that alone, it is the end of the discussion. If it is desired to do what was said in the opening speech, that is for another amendment, not this one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="0801158000045"></a>Again, I look at the work of the Joint Committee. We probed and could not get much out of the Government at that stage. There was mention of a possible carbon reduction commitment scheme, an energy efficiency scheme, and that was about all. The Minister must not be surprised if we probe the intentions of what is potentially a very wide scheme when we have had practically no explanation of what might emerge as proposals. We seek to discover a little more of what is in the mind of the Government. As he went on, the Minister, who sounded&#151;uncharacteristically&#151;a tiny bit irritated at the start of proceedings, became more helpful and constructive. If it is possible for rather more thinking to be put on the table about the potential use of the main clause, the Minister might have rather less difficulty with any suggested amendments that might come forward at the next stage.</p>

In moving this, I recognise that it is asking a lot for this still to be included, because it could be politically very unpopular. As I shall say in this brief introduction to the issue, it comes fraught with difficulty. In the Joint Committee we took a very limited amount of evidence on personal carbon-trading schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="0801158000052"></a>David Miliband appeared before the committee and was interested in these schemes. Defra commissioned a report from the sustainable energy centre in November 2006 which concluded that personal carbon trading  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1165"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be an effective, measurable way of reducing UK carbon emissions, which might be fairer than a carbon tax. I am sure that the Minister will tell us the results of Defra&#146;s feasibility analysis and discussions. It is looking at,</p>
<ul><a name="0801158000100"></a>&#147;whether a carbon trading scheme could be a proportionate, effective, socially equitable and financially viable approach&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0801158000089"></a>compared with other policy options. However, I ask the Minister whether it could be effective, as well as other policy options, because I consider that that is what we are looking at.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="0801158000053"></a>What really attracts me to the idea of personal carbon trading is that it gives power back to individuals as regards the whole issue of climate change and reducing carbon in terms of the individual&#146;s place in this whole scheme of things. I am aware that think tanks, for example the RSA and IPPR, are also looking at these issues. IPPR states that personal carbon trading schemes are enormously appealing given the equality principles on which they are based but recognises that they are likely to be politically unpopular, at least to begin with. That is the crux of the issue. When the Minister appeared before the Joint Committee he believed that this was such a big step politically that it would need primary legislation.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="0801158000054"></a>Oxford University&#146;s Environmental Change Institute, which is also looking at this matter, identifies a,</p>
<ul><a name="0801158000101"></a>&#147;perceived lack of social and political acceptability&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0801158000090"></a>The common ground of all the studies to date or ongoing&#151;most of them are ongoing&#151;is that such a measure has a lot of merit but that there is great political nervousness about moving forward with it. My purpose in tabling this amendment is to ask the Minister how brave the Government are willing to be. Would they be willing to pilot such a scheme in areas that are already committed to it, such as transition towns? What sort of resources is Defra willing to commit to this? Some assessments put the costs of a pilot scheme at somewhere between &#163;500,000 and &#163;950,000. Oxford University&#146;s Environmental Change Institute suggests that voluntary trials looking particularly at the behavioural and attitudinal impacts of the scheme on participants would take between two and a half to three years from initiation to final report.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="0801158000055"></a>As I say, there is a lot of work going on. IPPR is commissioning a poll to see what public awareness there is on this issue. Obviously, sensitivity issues are involved when we ask people to divulge the carbon allowances that they may get through in their personal lives. As a party we argued against identity cards and divulging lots of personal data. Such a scheme might involve state intrusion into people&#146;s day-to-day lifestyles. That would be a difficult matter. That issue would have to be weighed against whether the scheme would be a good way to reduce personal carbon allowances. However, I believe that it has merits and deserves to be looked at seriously. I should like to hear from the Minister how Defra has got on with regard to this issue but I should most like an assurance that the Government will keep the measure in the Bill. I suspect that we may hear an argument for taking it out. The noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, nods

The two issues tonight are whether the Bill, as it stands, would enable a personal carbon allowances scheme to be introduced and whether it should be introduced. The amendment seeks to ensure that it would&#151;to put beyond doubt that it would. When we had the briefing meeting with the Bill Committee team some days ago we were there were told that the Bill would permit personal carbon allowances to be introduced. It is in that context that I would like to address the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="0801158000057"></a>It is late and I apologise for that, but of all the issues that affect individuals this one is actually something that would be a real political hot potato. If, in due course, the Government did introduce it using the powers of the Bill, people would say, &#147;What was your Lordships&#146; House doing not debating it very thoroughly?&#148; Considering it is 10.20 pm&#151;pretty late&#151;it is not a very good way of doing that. Therefore, I beg indulgence to say a few words.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="0801158000058"></a>Carbon allowance schemes or issuing emissions rights is a very polite way of saying rationing. Power stations will be issued with rations for how much they can emit. Do not let there be any mistake, we are talking about personal carbon rationing: issuing people with rations. In the Second World War you would have been issued with a ration book. Whatever the scheme is, it will be a ration card. It will be issuing rations to people. The difference between that and the Second World War is that people will be able to trade those rations. As I recall, because I was only a very young child at the time, in the war you were not allowed to do that. Moreover, you would be able to buy more rations&#151;and it is an important question whether you would be able to&#151;as, indeed, power stations will be able to buy extra carbon allowances if they can get them on the open market.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="0801158000059"></a>It is a question of issuing people with rations for the right to buy goods or services that result in carbon emissions. I will do my best not to argue for or against the scheme but simply draw attention to what would be involved and whether it should be the subject of separate primary legislation or should be permitted to get through under secondary legislation if a future Government were ever minded so to do.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="0801158000060"></a>Those who advocate it, for example, say that it would apply in the first instance to the purchase by individuals, families or whoever it happens to be of electricity, gas and petrol and travel by air, bus or train. That is how it would start. People would be issued rations and whenever they went into a petrol station or paid for gas and electricity, they would not only have to pay money, they would have to hand over part of their ration.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="0801158000061"></a>There are important questions for any scheme over how to allocate these rations. Who would get what? Would everybody get the same? Would equal amounts go to everyone? That, as I understand it from most  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1167"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proponents, would be the case. Would babies get it when they were born, like a child trust fund? How much would the ration be and how would it change over their youth? Would people be able to trade their rations? Would people have to buy their rations at auction, because that is the case in some of the trading schemes being produced? Would people be issued with ration cards or books?</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="0801158000062"></a>All that would be recorded central data, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said. We would have to tell people that a regulatory authority would know every time you bought a gallon of petrol, or travelled by bus or air. That would have to be monitored because, apart from anything else, you would have to check for fraud. You could be certain, as with any other case, that that would apply; plenty of ration fraud happened during the Second World War.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="0801158000063"></a>In any case, the public at large might feel that this is duplicating carbon trading, because the gas and electricity power suppliers have been given rations for carbon emissions allowances, and they have already had to buy extra carbon emissions. That is pushing up the price of electricity. That is the rationale behind the Government&#146;s nuclear power policy of the past few days. The price of electricity will be forced up, which will make nuclear power more economic, so people might reasonably say, &#147;What are we having to be issued with rations for? We are already paying a higher price for gas and electricity. What on earth is this all about?&#148;. The price of petrol is going through the roof at &#163;5 a gallon, and it will go still higher. People will say that it is double counting if they are told that in addition they will have to give up some rations.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="0801158000064"></a>We are all agreed, thank goodness, that aviation is coming into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. That will push up the price of air fares, and people will also have to hand over rations. As I said at the outset, the question is not whether personal carbon trading allowances are a good thing or a bad thing, but whether they raise issues that would require careful consideration of primary legislation to provide an appropriate framework, rather than being introduced, if ever a Government were so minded, using the powers in the Bill, which is designed to do that.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="0801158000065"></a>The issues raise so many different considerations that people would expect noble Lords to ask most serious questions about the Government allowing something like this to go through at this time of night and saying, &#147;In due course, these powers could be used&#148;. I have one or two questions for the Minister. When Mr Miliband, who was Secretary of State, came before the committee, he went rather further than the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said. I apologise, but I have forgotten my reading glasses, so I cannot read the text. My recollection is that when I pressed him, the Secretary of State said that he found it inconceivable that the powers in the Bill could be used to smuggle in something of the significance of personal carbon trading allowances. That is strong language.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="0801158000066"></a>Will the Minister confirm that that is the Government&#146;s view? Do they regard it as inconceivable that you could smuggle in personal carbon trading allowances under the powers in the Bill? Is that because they want  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1168"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to keep the powers in the Bill but they would not do this at the moment, or because they do not think that it would ever be appropriate to use the powers even when the Bill becomes an Act? Will they consider going further than that and giving an assurance that they would not do so? Will they respond, in due course if appropriate, to a proposal that the Bill be amended so that personal carbon trading allowances could not be introduced in the Bill but would require separate legislation?</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Woolmer of Leeds, has rendered the Committee a very considerable service by drawing attention to this matter. I rather wish that the Government would try to smuggle in such a scheme before the next election. I think that it would have the same effects as some legislation that I recall when I was Minister had on the then Conservative Government. It would guarantee the election of an alternative Administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="0801158000068"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s memory is perfectly correct about what Mr Miliband said. He said that he was an enthusiast for the idea of personal carbon allowances. He then went on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="0801158000097"></a>&#147;Technically I suppose you could smuggle it in under one of these provisions but frankly that is not the real world. It is inconceivable that a Government would do that&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0801158000091"></a>He then went on to say that it was so inconceivable it was not worth excluding it. That was OTT, he said. I am not sure about that. If it is so inconceivable and if it has the implications spelt out by the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, we should exclude it. It is not something that could possibly be introduced by order. Therefore, it would be much better to clarify the matter and make sure that no one was so foolish as to make the attempt in the future.</p>

For my noble friend Lord Woolmer of Leeds, I would like to take some time to reiterate the comments made by my right honourable friend David Miliband to the Joint Committee, as the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, started to do.

<ul><a name="0801158000102"></a>&#147;activities that consist of, or that cause or contribute, directly or indirectly, to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or the removal of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0801158000093"></a>Technically, as the noble Baroness knows well, that means that there is no restriction on where in the economy or at which level of society the schemes may be introduced. Bearing in mind my comments, she will know the context in which we are debating this.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="0801158000072"></a>During the pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee, the Secretary of State indicated that we did not envisage using the enabling powers to support the introduction of personal carbon trading schemes. I reiterate my noble friend&#146;s point: any such scheme would require change of quite a different order of magnitude to that required for a scheme limited to a particular sector or group of sectors. By its very nature, it would have the potential to impact directly on individuals.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="0801158000073"></a>There is a link here to the separate question about the Government&#146;s views on personal carbon trading, which are of great concern to the noble Baroness. We are certainly committed to exploring action to tackle emissions at individual and community level. However, there is still a lot of work ahead to explore whether or not&#151;as the noble Baroness asked&#151;personal trading is a realistic and workable policy option.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="0801158000074"></a>The Government are looking into the potential value of personal carbon trading, as just one of a number of potential long-term options being explored for making individuals better informed about, and involved in, tackling climate change. We expect to be able to make a decision on whether further analysis is necessary this year.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="0801158000075"></a>The noble Baroness asked what the Government are doing to promote further investigation of this concept. The Government are considering personal carbon trading on a number of levels. For example, a cross-departmental working group has been established to consider personal carbon trading in detail. This of course includes officials from Defra, as well as from BERR, the Department for Transport, the Department of Communities and Local Government and HM Treasury and the Sustainable Development Commission. The Government are keen to make progress, and a pre-feasibility study is being carried out to answer some of the key questions on personal carbon trading. The study, as the noble Baroness knows, is due to report this year.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="0801158000076"></a>Work in government on personal carbon trading is being supplemented by a significant amount of work, as the noble Baroness has suggested, in the academic community; Defra is contributing to its funding. A number of these relevant bodies are members of a wider&#151;I cannot say &#147;PCT&#148; as that means &#147;primary care trust&#148;&#151;personal carbon trading advisory board   


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1170"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column 1170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which has been established to consider the issue. We are interested in the idea of personal carbon trading. However, given its wider-reaching impact on society, it is right that any decision is based on a thoroughgoing exploration and well established evidence base.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="0801158000077"></a>The noble Baroness asked about piloting or a voluntary scheme. The scoping study produced by the Centre of Sustainable Energy recommended addressing the high-level questions surrounding personal carbon trading before considering a pilot or a trial scheme. Pilot systems would, as the noble Baroness is aware, inevitably be simpler, potentially fault ridden and less defined than any final system. They could lead to failure and subsequent public distrust if a pilot was not carefully thought through at the highest levels and in detail.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="0801158000078"></a>Additionally, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to pilot one of the most important factors behind the scheme: its compulsory and national nature. We do not, however, rule out exploring likely individual responses, perhaps by developing and testing simulation games or running some trials. However, while these could provide some valuable information, they could not and should not be seen as formal pilots for a national mandatory scheme.</p>

<a name="80114-0017.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="0801158000079"></a>The noble Baroness asked about ID cards. For the record, the report of the Centre for Sustainable Energy does not recommend this. While noting that some academics, such as those at the Tyndall Centre, have stated that such a link would provide maximum levels of protection against fraud, the report goes on to state that personal carbon trading could be integrated within the banking system&#151;which is of course an alternative way of looking at it&#151;and that no link with ID cards would be necessary. Finally, the noble Baroness asked about Defra&#146;s financial commitment. Over the financial year 2007-08, Defra will have spent over &#163;140,000 on external work to explore the details of personal carbon trading, backed by over &#163;100,000 of internal staff resource. I hope that I have been able to pick up on questions raised by Members of the Committee in this short debate, and that, with that, the noble Baroness will consider withdrawing her amendment.</p>

It is an important issue, which I hope we will come back to&#151;probably not during the passage of this Bill, but when the Defra feasibility study reports.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011449000122"></a>(2) In preparing the charter the local authority must consult with children in care and care-leavers.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011449000123"></a>(3) The local authority must publish the charter and take all reasonable steps to ensure its wide availability to the public.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000015"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment would place a duty on local authorities to produce a charter of aims, standards and practices that constituted their particular approach to the care of looked-after children in their area. We developed the amendment following discussions with the What Makes the Difference project, which has been supporting Warwickshire County Council in developing a pledge to all the children and young people in the county who are in care or are care leavers. This has formed part of the partnership between What Makes the Difference and Warwickshire in taking forward a corporate parenting agenda. The development of the pledge was a joint venture between elected members, officers and children and young people. Particular consideration was given to how all parties could work together on an equal footing and without children and young people being disempowered in the process. This is an excellent example of good practice and should, we feel, be extended to all children in the care of the state.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000016"></a>Among the benefits of this proposal is increased transparency. The idea is to promote a wider understanding of what children and young people who are in care or who are care leavers can expect from their local authority and to detail services and support that meet their specific needs, rather than an unspecified statement of values and principles. Local authority charters could also have the knock-on effect of raising awareness of a social service that is often not understood or is neglected in the wider community.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000017"></a>Local authority charters institutionalise good practice, and successful authorities can draw on their experience to set standards to ensure that that continues. Similarly, the process of developing a charter forces those local authorities that are underperforming to identify priorities. It makes it easier to see what is going wrong and what needs to be done to deliver effective outcomes.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000018"></a>I want to take a moment to underscore the importance of the local aspect of these charters. This is not a top-down mandate. The idea is that these are developed locally and with sensitivity to the priorities of particular areas. The needs of local authorities and the challenges that they face vary, because of a multitude of factors, from demography to geography. Thus it is important that charters are developed locally and by those who best understand the priorities of looked-after children in the area and their specific requirements and goals. Highlighting the local aspect of the development of these charters is not an attempt to shirk national minimum  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC389"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC389</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>standards. The underlying assumption of the amendment is that the aims, standards and practices developed organically and tailored by local authorities are more likely to be effective than a top-down approach.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000019"></a>Another point that needs to be mentioned is that the amendment would require local authorities in preparing the charter to,</p>
<ul><a name="08011449000131"></a>&#147;consult with children in care and care-leavers&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011449000112"></a>That would lend the charter an added sense of legitimacy. Not only would the charter arise from the professionals engaged in providing care but it would come out of those with the experience of being in care.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000020"></a>Essentially, this is a way of giving more power, freedom and flexibility to local authorities while maintaining an emphasis on robust standards of care. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000021"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08011449000144"></a>Lord Judd:</b> In the spirit of constructive dialogue that I am sure the Minister would agree has characterised this Committee stage, I hope that my noble friend will take the opportunity to look seriously at this amendment with his colleagues. All my experience in community work, both in this country and abroad, has demonstrated to me beyond doubt that where aspirations and intentions are to be fulfilled&#151;where goals are to be achieved&#151;it is essential for those involved and affected to identify with the task in hand and with the arrangements that have been made to fulfil that task. The wider the internalisation of the commitment, the greater the success.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000022"></a>Legislation is sometimes not as effective as it might be because of the feeling that, once you have it on the statute book, it is the law and everybody will work to it. In a sense that is true, but the spirit of the law is very much more important. As I was saying over lunch to some of those outside Parliament who are working with us on the Bill, we all need to remember that legislation and institutions are inanimate; they provide frameworks and opportunities and underline what is appropriate, but effectiveness in policy depends on identification and commitment to that policy. I think that the amendment is sensible and I hope that my noble friend will assure us that he will consider it seriously.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000023"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08011449000145"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Amendment No. 52 is part of this group. Its aim, like that of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, is to ensure that there is a body to take responsibility for a number of things, perhaps the most important of which is that the child is involved in all the processes. That applies to the individual child&#146;s involvement in their particular circumstances&#151;accommodation or whatever&#151;in the care of the local authority and to the services generally that the local authority provides. There must visibly be a body with responsibility for those things.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000024"></a>We shall have to wait and see whether that makes sense in the long term, given the way in which everything is being reframed. However, my impression is that

There will be an important duty to keep one another informed about the different aspects of the work that is going on.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000025"></a>Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child gives children the right to be consulted. However, as I understand it, our Government is not one of those who are regarded as having consulted children sufficiently.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000026"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08011449000146"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> I support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. <I>Care Matters</I>, both the Green and White Papers, had some encouraging references to the participation of children in care and included an expectation that every local authority would develop, if they had not already done so, the opportunity for children to have their voices heard and to influence the work of the authority at a high strategic level through a new children in care council. The idea is that not only are children&#146;s voices heard about decisions relating to their own care but the voices of a range of children in care are heard in policy making, assessing the quality of the services that the local authority is delivering and putting forward ideas about how that service could be improved.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000027"></a>We are disappointed that that provision has not been put in the Bill, despite the fact that <I>Care Matters</I> specifically said that every local authority would be expected to set up a children in care council in its area. If that is really to happen in every local authority, as children rightly expect it to, the legislation should make provision for it. In a recent consultation with 300 children living away from home, the Children&#146;s Rights Director found that they thought that their right to have their say about things that mattered to them, and for that to be taken seriously at the highest level, was just about okay. That was as good as it got.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000028"></a>The Bill is a perfect opportunity to strengthen children&#146;s influence in strategic decision-making and service delivery. The amendment put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, would substantially strengthen the accountability of the corporate parent to children in care and ensure that the views of children were heard at the highest level.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000029"></a>Let me say a word of support to the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. One of the most attractive elements of her amendment is transparency. Its third subsection says that the policy has to be published.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000030"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08011449000147"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> I want to make two points in support of both amendments. I recognise that local authorities have to produce children&#146;s plans that will contain many of these elements. If the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, is not to be included in the Bill, it would be valuable if it were enshrined somewhere in the form of guidance, simply because it gives a specific way of looking at standards. I am always encouraged when there is a good example of practice to give direction, and that is what she is giving.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000031"></a>I hope that we can get something into the Bill about the voice of the child being heard. I say that because I have been somewhat disappointed, in talking with a variety of people in social work, about the continued difficulty that people have in hearing children. They may think that they are listening, but the Children&#146;s Rights Director will tell you time and again that children say that they do not feel that they are being heard. The idea for children in care councils came out of <I>Care Matters</I> and, like the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, I expected that something would appear in the Bill. Some reference to them would be extremely helpful in order to ensure that councils have to set up such bodies and listen to children. That would mean that they had to set up mechanisms for children who are in their care and accommodated by them to be encompassed in those bodies and therefore heard.</p>

That is a major theme of the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper. A set of proposals is set out on page 22 of that document.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000034"></a>I am responding to the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, on the basis that I assume from her remarks that Amendment No. 15 intends to enshrine in legislation the proposal set out in the White Paper for every local authority to develop a pledge to the children in its care. The intention behind the White Paper&#146;s proposal is that looked-after children should be made aware of the services that are available to them. The pledge proposal is a central part of our overall strategy for improving corporate parenting and it has been widely welcomed, particularly by young people. However, we do not consider that further primary legislation is required to achieve these aims. We have provided local authorities with funding to help them to develop pledges and we will, in the revised Children Act 1989 statutory guidance, set out our expectation that all authorities should have developed a pledge by the end of 2009.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000035"></a>As the noble Baroness said, many local areas are already developing pledges, working in some cases with voluntary sector partners. Others are working collaboratively across regions to ensure a consistent approach. We intend to provide some good practice examples in the <I>Care Matters</I> implementation plan, which we are due to publish shortly and which we hope will encourage all local authorities to aspire rapidly to best practice in this area. However, I stress, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that these

Standards for service provision in relation to fostering and residential care for looked-after children are set out in the regulations and national minimum standards that are underpinned by the Care Standards Act.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000036"></a>Amendment No. 52, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and Amendment No. 88, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, are concerned with establishing a collective mechanism to ensure that children and young people who are looked after are able to put their experiences of the care system directly to those responsible for service delivery. This important priority is already enshrined in legislation. For example, there are requirements under the Children Act 2004 to consult children and young people generally, which includes looked-after children and care leavers, about service provision in their area. The Children and Young People&#146;s Plan (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2007 also include a specific requirement to consult children and young persons when the plan is developed and a more general duty to consult when the plan is reviewed. Local authorities are, of course, already required to take account of the wishes and feelings of looked-after children when planning for their care at an individual level.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000037"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, we are building on these requirements by taking forward the proposal in the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper to spell out in statutory guidance our expectation that every local authority should have a children in care council or equivalent structure. We intend to set out the requirements in guidance that representation on children in care councils will not be limited to looked-after children but will also include care leavers, who of course have an enormous contribution to make from their own experience to the shaping of services for looked-after children. In this respect, our requirements will go wider than the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, contemplates in Amendment No. 52.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000038"></a>While we believe that it is right to focus on ensuring that children in care councils are representative of the children who are currently looked after, we also believe that it is right to consult those young adults who have left care about the services that they received while they were looked after, as their contribution will help to improve the experience of those who come after them. I hope that in all these respects we are meeting the ambitions set out by the noble Baronesses.</p>

</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011449000126"></a>A local authority must conduct a review of a child&#146;s experience of care if, during a child&#146;s time in care, he or she has been looked after by three or more different social workers during the course of one single year.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000044"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment was inspired by the Minister&#146;s speech at Second Reading. He noted that some children see as many as 30 different social workers and go through nine or 10 care placements within a few years. The amendment places a cap on the number of social workers who may look after a child in a year. If the child has more than three social workers, the local authority is obliged to review the situation.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000045"></a>This amendment would create a mechanism by which a disproportionately high rate of turnover could be checked, investigated and, I hope, stopped. The rate of turnover might be perfectly explicable, but it might be a symptom of a yet unidentified problem with a child or, indeed, the local authority&#146;s provision of service.</p>

Elsewhere in the Bill are provisions for more regular independent reviews of care. This is much more straightforward. Does the Minister think appropriate this kind of trigger for an internal review of a child&#146;s experience of care? It is essential to a child&#146;s experience of care to be able to forge meaningful relationships without fear of having them repeatedly broken off. This is the underlying motivation of the amendment. The number we have chosen may be impractical, but I hope that the Minister will be willing to work with us on the amendment to stem the tide of constant turnover. I beg to move.</p>

I was grateful to the noble Baroness for tabling it. It goes to the heart of the concerns of the Government and of us all about ensuring continuity of care, which  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC394"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC394</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we have failed to do in the past. High turnover of staff is a continually expressed concern of young people in care who visit Parliament. It is a bane also for families of children with disabilities. Those families are often most concerned that their child should continue to receive adequate services as they reach the age of 18 and move into the sphere of adult services. Their social worker should be their child&#146;s strongest and most effective advocate for services. Often, however, their child will have a number of different social workers, whose effectiveness is distinctly compromised as they are insufficiently familiar with the case in question.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000049"></a>I strongly agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, that children in public care are often traumatised because of their problematic relationships with the significant adults in their lives. For some of them, changes in social worker will be profoundly painful and may cause them further harm, possibly undermining their ability to make the intimate relationships that could be helpful to their recovery from their early experiences. I re-emphasise how important are good supervision, supported reflection and manageable workloads to retaining social workers. I hope that any review of the kind proposed in the amendment would look carefully at the professional framework in which the child&#146;s social worker operates.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000050"></a>How is turnover of social workers monitored? What figures on individual local authorities can the Minister provide? Does he find widely varying rates of turnover between similar local authorities? What action can be taken when that is the case? I would understand it if he preferred to write to me than to reply to those questions at this time.</p>

The last thing that they need is further disruption in their lives. With the best will in the world and whatever the intention, if a whole string of social workers deals with them, the process can be very disruptive. There are too many powerful stories of young people who make it explicitly clear that the one thing that they yearn for is somebody who can be their confidant, to whom they relate and who is central to the working out of their lives. Continuity is tremendously important. Of course, any reasonable person understands the incredible demands that we put on social services and the difficulties in meeting the ideal, but the amendment spells out a real issue that needs to be addressed. I hope that my noble friend will find ways in which to work with the sponsors of the amendment to meet the observation. I am sure that I am not alone, but I am deeply upset that, even with positive commitment in legislation, because of the way in which the legislation is tackled the whole purpose can in effect be negated. That is a disaster. We need to ensure that the issue is given priority.</p>

One of the principal lacks of the sort of distressed and damaged children who tend to be in care is an experience of secure attachment to a responsible adult who they believe cares about them. The problem is that, unless we put into legislation something of this sort, local authorities will cut corners, because they are always short of money. So it is essential that such a provision should be somewhere in the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000053"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08011449000158"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> I respect and sympathise with the principles behind the amendment. It is obvious that the element of continuity is of priceless worth in relation to the children whom we are discussing. Their lives have been so bedevilled by upheavals already and all manner of turmoil that they require greater continuity than the ordinary child might. That continuity must be at all levels in so far as that can be achieved: there should be judicial continuity with regard to the judges who supervise a particular case; there should be continuity of residence, in so far as that can possibly be achieved; and there should most certainly be continuity in the social workers charged with caring for and befriending those children.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000054"></a>Having said that, I believe that there is another side to the coin, although it does not defeat anything that has been said or any aspiration that has been exhibited in relation to the amendment. I refer to the question of resources. I spoke in Committee last week about poor counties&#151;the ones that I dealt with when I sat as a judge in north Wales. I am thinking of the four or five counties stretching from Anglesey all the way across to Flintshire. Their problems are very much the same: they have small teams of social workers and if one social worker is ill, another is away on a course and another has left employment for, perhaps, another local authority, while a fourth is on maternity leave, there is a limit to how much they can shake the pack. I have no doubt that in most cases they are racking their brains for how they can achieve as much continuity as is humanly possible in the difficulties of that case.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000055"></a>Without hazarding a guess as to what exactly might be done or what the fine point of balance might be, will the Minister consider the advantages of making the principle of continuity even clearer by perhaps mentioning it in the Bill as well as considering the danger of adding an unnecessary wheel to the coach and making life more difficult for local authorities in this regard? If the review is a fairly cursory one, it hardly justifies a specific statutory precept. On the other hand, if it is deep-seated and deeply penetrative, it may bring about the very bureaucratic burden that local authorities are already not in a position to deal with.</p>

The review needs to be external&#151;hence the independent reviewing officer&#151;because it would be very easy to say, &#147;Yes, but we only had this because we could not recruit enough social workers&#148;. That could appear on a number of occasions.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000057"></a>What is it in a local authority that triggers things such as the further involvement of the independent reviewing officer? Perhaps in the guidance we should look at those kinds of triggers. After a child has had more than three social workers in a year, perhaps someone should appoint an independent advocate for that child, to look with the child at what is happening in their life. A number of issues could be looked at around this, in recognition that it may not be the one issue. After all, the child&#146;s real contact might be with their residential staff and their residential social worker and, if there is continuity there, they are not as fussed as when they have no continuity anywhere. We need to look at the issue holistically; we need to consider the triggers and the services that might be brought to bear when this kind of thing happens.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000058"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08011449000160"></a>Baroness Butler-Sloss:</b> I support the amendment but also the wise words of the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth&#151;this might not be the best way of dealing with the matter after three social workers. I support Clause 13, which concerns visiting. However, visiting will be completely useless if a social worker visits a number of children without the individual social worker giving the continuity that a child wants. I have had, as I am sure has the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, a large number of children come through my hands who have had multiple movements. Twenty movements for a child in two years is not, I regret to say, all that unusual with some local authorities. The worst I have come across was 40 moves, and it was no surprise that that child ended up in the Caldecott therapeutic centre.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000059"></a>I know how difficult it is for social workers&#151;I totally take on board what the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said&#151;but if you keep changing the social worker, as noble Lords have said, the child will be disrupted by not knowing who is the person to whom to turn. There has to be someone. I would like to see a trigger in primary or secondary legislation that reminds local authorities that they have to do something about this. I can understand what happens in the small and difficult-to-manage local authorities of north Wales, but it also happens in large local authorities that ought to know better. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, that we should be looking round this point, but it certainly should be there somewhere.</p>

Speaking as someone who works in health and, in the old days, in social services, I am conscious of the different systems that can lead to changes in social workers.

I strongly support the amendment simply because it would be a signal to social services that, if they did not sort out their systems and keep down their turnover and changes of social workers, they would have endless reviews. That would be difficult, expensive and embarrassing, so they should do something about it. For those reasons, I hope that the Minister will support the amendment.</p>

I have experience as the patron of a charity involved with the personal mentoring of children in care. Providing continuity is precisely the sort of role that a personal mentor can play, in addition to the role of being an independent support. Also, that mentor, when taking on that role, should be given guidance that one of their roles is to monitor whether there is continuity in the services being provided. So, rather than there being a set of triggers, the mentor could provide the trigger for some sort of review, because their relationship gives them the insight into whether there is a need for a review of what is being done on behalf of the child. I press the point that the mentoring role could assist with this set of problems.</p>

I hope that he will respond in a constructive way to the concerns that have been expressed. When he does so, will he ensure that the pilot social work practices are put on a level playing field with local authorities when they are being held to account for the turnover of social workers? If that is not done during the pilots, the evaluation will not be fair.</p>

The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, asked me for some statistics. They are, indeed, of great concern. They show that in 2005, the last year for which we have figures, there was an average vacancy rate of 11 per cent for field social workers in respect of children across England, but with very wide regional variations. The lowest regional vacancy rate is 8 per cent, in the eastern region, but the rate is nearly twice that in London, at 15.1 per cent. Therefore, it is of no surprise that the use of agency staff should be highest in London, where, in 2005, the figure for agency staff stood at 20.8 per cent, compared with an average of 11.6 per cent in the rest of England. That is still a high percentage, even as an average. This is a serious issue. </p>

Regulations under that section require the child&#146;s case to be first reviewed at least within the first four weeks of the child becoming looked after; the second review must take place within three months and, thereafter, reviews must take place at least every six months, although the independent reviewing officer can direct more frequent reviews. The Bill will strengthen the role of the independent reviewing officer, who is responsible for convening reviews, scrutinising care plans and ensuring that children&#146;s views are taken account of in the care planning process. The IRO will of course be expected to take full account of changes in social workers in reviewing the quality of support provided to a child and to make any appropriate recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000065"></a>While I absolutely share the sentiments expressed by the noble Baroness and other speakers, we do not believe that a process of independent reviews in addition to those that already take place under the auspices of the independent reviewing officer would add anything.

The intention of the social work practices is to address exactly this point on social work turnover. Perhaps I might briefly allude to that, given that the Minister kindly wrote to us all on various matters since our previous day in Committee, including at length on social work practices. These social work practices hold good prospects for securing greater continuity of care for looked-after children. The greater autonomy that they grant to social workers should make the work more attractive and, to an extent, offer a refuge from the bureaucracy of local authorities. So I can see the benefits in principle. In his letter, the Minister outlined concerns, which I have also expressed and which he recognises as legitimate, about the impact on the wider workforce. I shall not go into details at this point, but perhaps the Minister can clarify a further point. Once the pilots have reported and the evaluation has been made, the Secretary of State will have the power to decide whether local authorities can implement the pilots, but will a statutory instrument be brought before Parliament?</p>

The turnover of social workers appeared to be an issue everywhere. While I absolutely take on board what the Minister said about the independent reviewing officer and how there will be consistent and constant reviews that would pick up on an individual child&#146;s problems, the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, referred to a hatred of reviews. She said that, if something was enshrined in statute and authorities found that this was happening, they would have to look at their wider procedures.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000072"></a>When we took evidence, it became clear that little bits of bad practice that might seem good business practice, such as hot-desking, do not work. We were told that hot-desking is now used in many offices and that this is adding to social workers&#146; stress. It may be cost-effective in the use of space while social workers are out on visits, but it cuts them off from their support networks and their colleagues; it isolates them and prevents them from sharing knowledge, input and cover. This kind of thing can lead to them leaving and going elsewhere. I am not too sure whether these things would be picked up by the IRO, but they might be if there was something in the Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, said, the element of continuity is of priceless worth and, as the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, said, unless we put it in legislation, local authorities will cut corners.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000073"></a>At a meeting of a number of our Conservative leads in children&#146;s services, it became clear that they do not know how they are going to carry out a great deal of what is in the Bill, because they do not know whether they are going to have the money to do it. With all the good will in the world, they may turn a blind eye to some of the things that would make a huge difference.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000074"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, referred to something that is close to my heart&#151;mentoring. We tried to table an amendment on mentoring but were told that it was beyond the scope of the Bill. I am not sure why and we may try to do something on Report. Mentors offer a tremendous continuity over the years, wherever the child may end up or whenever their circumstances change. We need to look closely at what mentoring can do to help in this.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000078"></a>The noble Baroness said: We now start a series of amendments on a subject that is near and dear to the hearts of many of us: contact with siblings and families. The process of entering or living in care, even for short periods, can destroy relationships between  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC400"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC400</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>siblings. Stable relationships that reinforce a sense of belonging, trust and even dependence are among the rarest and often most necessary features of the experience of a child in care. Contact with siblings fosters these kinds of relationships.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000079"></a>Reams of expert opinion and consultations with children in care echo this sentiment. In the response to its <I>Care Matters</I> Green Paper, the Department for Children, Schools and Families said that keeping siblings together is vital. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, mentioned, the Children&#146;s Rights Director for England, Dr Roger Morgan, published the views of 433 children on improving care standards. Designing placements so that brothers and sisters can stay together was the fourth main recommendation from the children. A National Voice, the excellent organisation run by and for young people in care, found in a recent survey that 83 per cent of children and young people who do not live with their birth siblings would like to see more of them. I need not further rehearse the significance of that.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000080"></a>Provisions in the 1989 Act should ensure that siblings are kept together wherever possible, but this is a probing amendment, designed to reignite that debate. Will the Minister explain what specific steps have been taken to keep siblings together? Is he willing to comment on the success of those attempts? Does he agree that more needs to be done? Is he willing to give undertakings that further measures will be taken to ensure that siblings are, wherever possible and when it is in their best interests, kept together? I beg to move.</p>

I shall speak also to Amendment No. 32, which should have been grouped with these amendments, since it fits in with this issue more than with Amendment No. 28, with which it has been grouped.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000082"></a>Amendments Nos. 17, 53 and 71 would strengthen the duty on local authorities to facilitate sibling contact, unless it is inconsistent with the child&#146;s welfare or a child with sufficient understanding objects to it. Amendment No. 53 spells that out at slightly greater length than Amendment No. 17, proposing to add a new section, Section 34A, to the Children Act 1989. Amendment No. 71 would simply amend the wording of that Act.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000083"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, explained, the Bill misses a golden opportunity to increase the placing together of siblings. Children enter care largely as a result of the actions or inaction of adults, yet the process of entering and living in care, even for short periods, can destroy relationships with siblings and take away identity, shared memories, companionship and love at a time when they are most needed. The Department for Children, Schools and Families reported in its summary of responses to the <I>Care Matters</I> Green Paper consultation:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011449000130"></a>&#147;Many of the children and young people we have spoken to thought that it was vital to keep siblings together wherever possible. Where this is not possible, maintaining contact with siblings is very important to young people&#148;.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000084"></a>On Amendment No. 53, Clause 8 repeats the provisions of the Children Act 1989 that relate to the duty of local authorities to accommodate together siblings wherever it is reasonably practicable and consistent with the welfare of the child. Section 34 of the Children Act 1989 requires the local authority to allow reasonable contact between a child in care and his or her parents, guardians and those who formerly had residence. Paragraph 15 in Part II of Schedule 2 to the 1989 Act makes provision for contact between the child and &#147;any relative&#148;. However, no explicit provision is made for sibling contact. The local authority is required to promote rather than to facilitate contact, though there is provision for covering travel expenses.</p>
<h5><a name="08011449000136"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80114-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000085"></a>Amendment No. 32 relates to proposed new subsection (7E) of the 1989 Act. It would delete the words &#147;reasonably practicable and&#148; from proposed new paragraph (b), which relates to the duties laid on the local authority to try to ensure that looked-after children are placed in accommodation in the area where their family lives and, under proposed new subsection (7D), with siblings if they are also looked after by the local authority. The problem with words such as &#147;reasonably practicable&#148; is that they are too often used as a let-out for not making much effort to pursue that duty. This amendment to the 1984 Act would therefore remove the considerable and unjustified discretion given to local authorities for providing accommodation for looked-after children, while maintaining the appropriate duty to act in a manner that is consistent with the child&#146;s welfare.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000086"></a>Amendment No. 53 offers an alternative formulation to Amendment No. 17. It makes it clear that, where it is not consistent with the child&#146;s welfare to be placed with his sibling, there should be an explicit duty on local authorities to support sibling contact, unless that is also not consistent with the child&#146;s welfare or with the child having sufficient understanding of the objects of such contact. Both amendments are crucial if we are to come closer to having a system that cherishes children&#146;s relationships with one another.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000087"></a>Amendment No. 71 offers an alternative formulation, although it fails to stress the importance of contact being consistent with the child&#146;s welfare and of the child itself wishing to have such contact. For that reason, such a formulation would need to be accompanied by new guidance emphasising the importance of contact with siblings and other significant family members to looked-after children. Not only Amendment No. 17 but also our Amendment No. 53 spell the issue out in more detail. The preferred amendment of these Benches is Amendment No. 53.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000089"></a>In the absence of the full family, brothers and sisters&#151;we call them &#147;siblings&#148; for the purpose of our debate, but let us spell them out in human terms&#151;can become emotionally tremendously important to the person concerned. It is important that, wherever it can be done and the children so want it, every muscle should be stretched to ensure that the siblings can stay together. If that is impossible, not to have generous and practical arrangements for contact is a pretty sad state of affairs. It can also have very costly consequences.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000090"></a>I heard the other day about a group of siblings who were separated. I will not go into all the details, but every one of them in follow-up discussions made it absolutely clear that nothing mattered more to them than being in touch with their brothers and sisters, and how distressed they were that they had been separated. One of them had been showing great promise. He was settling down to studies and was very successfully playing rugby; it looked as though he had a considerable future in rugby. However, when the children were separated, he withdrew completely into himself. He gave up his commitment to sport and his improved performance at school, and he ended up in an alcoholic, homeless and distressed situation. This is the foolishness of not giving enough priority to these emotional needs at the right moment. The cost later, not only in human but in economic terms, can be ongoing and considerable.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000091"></a>These amendments are, therefore, not just important but crucial. We all draw on our experience. Mine is not directly and specifically related to children, but I look back at my time as director of Oxfam; that was a completely different setting but, by God, we dealt with children there. One of my reflections on my years there&#151;this was one of the most important learning experiences in my life&#151;was that if you are trying to stand by those who are excluded, deprived or in need, perhaps the most important form of support that you can provide is advocacy: making sure that children do not become just objects and do not feel that they are pushed around by a system. That can sometimes be an extremely sad situation, because there are often dedicated people working within the system, but sometimes that is the overall perspective of the child. Children matter as individuals and they need to be heard. Therefore, Amendment No. 71 is terribly important in this context, too. I hope&#151;I know&#151;that my noble friend will not only recognise the force of these arguments but see whether specific arrangements can be put in place to meet their objectives.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000092"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08011449000174"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> We seem to have covered quite a range of amendments, which are scattered all over the agenda, but I certainly very much support these three amendments and Amendment No. 32, which has been alluded to. The passion that has been expressed about families, which is also shown in a later amendment on the importance of grandparents, shows the extent to which we are waking up to the importance of the family. I am not talking about every single family contact, because, as  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC403"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC403</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we all know, some would not be remotely desirable, even if the individual was passionate about that particular person. None the less, the family is an extra resource and provides a feeling of identity. We have heard on many occasions how appalling and chaotic the lives of children in these sorts of situations are, so the more help, outside support and outside role models they can have, the better.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000093"></a>The purpose of this probing amendment is to strengthen the duty of local authorities and encourage and facilitate sibling contact. I very much hope that the Government will accept the amendment. We have heard about the number of Acts that mention the importance of families being placed together and that say that, if they cannot be placed together and there are reasonable grounds for not doing so, visits should be facilitated and so on. But this is not just important for those reasons; the children themselves say that they want it to happen. A National Voice, for example, which is run by and for young people in care, found in a recent survey that 83 per cent of children and young people who did not live with their siblings would like to see more of them. An NSPCC survey that consulted children about their experiences of family proceedings since the 1989 Act showed that four in every 10&#151;a huge percentage&#151;said that they did not have enough contact with their siblings.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000094"></a>The need to keep siblings together has been stressed absolutely by the Department for Children, Schools and Families&#151;and I am sure that we will hear from the noble Lord the Minister or the noble Baroness that they are very much in favour of it&#151;in the summary of responses to the <I>Care Matters</I> Green Paper consultation and in the recent report by Dr Roger Morgan, the Children&#146;s Rights Director for England. Following a survey of 433 children on how to improve care standards, he made the need to keep siblings together in care proceedings his fourth main recommendation, which I think says quite a lot. Therefore, I very much support the amendments and the comments of all other noble Lords who have spoken.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000095"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08011449000175"></a>Baroness Butler-Sloss:</b> I support the amendments in principle. Clearly, it is very important to keep children together if one can. If that cannot happen, it is very important that they see each other if&#151;I hope that I shall not be accused of being unduly legalistic here&#151;it is in the interests of the welfare of the child and siblings. There are cases where a child is extremely keen to see other children in the family but it is not in his or her interests to do so, and there are also cases where the other children do not want to be involved. Therefore, one has to be a trifle cautious in that regard.</p>

However, there must be a clear understanding that when a child is in a placement together with two or three other children over several years, although those other children may not be blood kin, they can be as important as any sibling. Therefore, the extent of the  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC404"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC404</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relationship that children have with one another is important, and that must be respected. Earlier today, I was with the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and heard that some children who had been placed together for many years and were very attached to one another were given just one week&#146;s notice that they were to be separated. If the approach by the local authority is too legalistic and it says, &#147;Well, these children are not blood kin, so we do not need to apply this law&#148;, that will not be helpful. It needs to be made clear, perhaps in guidance, that that is the intention.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000097"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08011449000177"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> I confess to feeling a degree of exasperation, as I am just sorry that these amendments need to be tabled at all. I believe that from 1948 onwards it has been practice, under legislation, for siblings to be placed together wherever possible, although I take my noble and learned friend&#146;s point about that happening only where, following assessment, it is deemed appropriate for all the siblings. It seems to me that this is all to do with there being sufficient placements, about which later amendments have been tabled. Therefore, again this is a question of resource and the way in which the structure is put in place to provide the necessary expertise and skill. I take the point made by my noble friend Lady Murphy in that regard. Those making the assessments must have sufficient expertise and skill to understand the nature of the relationships. I should like the Minister to take on board the point made by my noble friend Lord Listowel&#151;that children may be linked by affinity and not by blood. That is extraordinarily important, bearing in mind the Welsh case that we heard about. I would support the amendments if I thought that there were not enough legislation already on the statute book, but I should like to hear what the Minister says about ensuring that children have the right to contact by affinity as well as by blood.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000098"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08011449000178"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> Perhaps I may begin by clarifying the remarks that I made a moment ago in response to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, about social work practice. After nearly three years in the job, I am still learning the hazards of giving a simple answer to a simple question as a Minister. It is almost always the wrong thing to do.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000099"></a>The noble Earl asked me what the statutory arrangements would be for the rollout of social work practices. Perhaps I may give him the fuller response that I should have given earlier. Any statutory instrument made in pursuance of the powers in Part 1 of the Bill, particularly under Clause 4, will be by negative resolution. However, the exercise of powers in Clause 1, under which the Secretary of State can change the nature of functions that can be delegated to a social work practice or the bodies with which a local authority can contract, must be by affirmative order. Therefore, there is proper provision for parliamentary oversight, but the arrangements vary depending on the nature of the powers being invoked. </p>

Of course, we believe that, where that is conducive to their welfare, it is important that it should take place. Legislation currently provides for it, as does practical guidance and support. If I set out how that is done, perhaps it would meet the concerns raised by noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000101"></a>Paragraph 15 of Schedule 2 to the Children Act 1989 contains provisions for the promotion of maintenance of contact between child and family. It requires the local authority,</p>
<ul><a name="08011449000132"></a>&#147;unless it is not reasonably practicable or consistent with his welfare&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08011449000113"></a>to,</p>
<ul><a name="08011449000133"></a>&#147;endeavour to promote contact between the child and ... any relative, friend or other person connected with him&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011449000114"></a>Siblings can also apply for contact orders under Section 34 of the Children Act 1989.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000102"></a>The contact requirement is reinforced in the schedule to the Arrangement for Placement of Children (General) Regulations 1991, which requires local authorities to consider arrangements for contact and whether there is any need for changes in the care plan to promote contact that is consistent with the child&#146;s welfare. Contact must also, by regulation, be one of the matters considered at the regular, six-monthly reviews of the child&#146;s case. The accompanying guidance to the Children Act stresses the importance of contact between the child and all those connected with him where it is conducive to his welfare. Section 105 of the Children Act provides a definition of &#147;relative&#148; that includes not only brothers and sisters of the full blood, but also half-siblings and those related by marriage or civil partnership.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000103"></a>We recognise, however, that practice may often fall short of these legal requirements. It is for precisely this reason that we have ensured that the requirements for contact are reflected in the child&#146;s care plan and placement plan within the integrated children&#146;s system, which provides a conceptual framework and practice tool for undertaking the key processes of assessment, planning, intervention and review for all children in need, including looked-after children. All local authorities in England are required to have in place an ICS system that is compliant with the business requirements issued by my department.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000104"></a>Within the ICS care plan and placement information records, practitioners are required to record contact arrangements with siblings, including step-siblings and half-siblings, and the practicalities as to how this will happen.

Does the Minister agree that there are simply not enough resources to hire enough people to do the job that the Government are committed to doing?</p>

The Government have of course significantly increased resources in this area over several years, which is most welcome, but a report produced by the British Association for Adoption &amp; Fostering and the Fostering Network in 2005, <I>The Cost of Foster Care</I>, identified that, to make the necessary improvement to the lives of children in care, one would need to invest an extra &#163;500 million a year&#151;I will check on that. The whole sum for the implementation of <I>Care Matters</I> is &#163;300 million over a number of years, so resources must be significantly increased if a choice of placement for children is to be made a reality.</p>

<p><a name="08011449000108"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08011449000182"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply and all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate. Perhaps I may pick up on the story told by the noble Lord, Lord Judd. Some time ago, I spoke to a young man who had been in care before he was adopted. The adoption had broken down and he had been taken back into care. He became a friend of our family and said that one of the things that troubled him most was that he knew what a difficult time he was having and worried greatly about what was happening to his younger brothers and sisters. The fact that he did not have the contact that he needed was, he thought, one of the reasons why he found his placements so difficult. He thought that, if only he could have been reassured that his brothers and sisters were fine, he would have found life much easier. A lawyer who was meeting the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, said to me earlier today that if the Children Act 1989 were properly applied, much of what we are discussing today would be unnecessary, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08011449000109"></a>This probing amendment was proposed to stimulate debate and represents yet another attempt to find those drivers, because, although the requirement has been on the statute book since 1989, it is still not being implemented in the way in which many children and young people in care would like to see. The Minister said that practice falls short of the legal requirement, although he went on to explain at length what was happening. I like the idea that it will be a requirement to record contact arrangements. I am most grateful to everybody for their participation in this short debate and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011466000059"></a> Before Clause 7, insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011466000060"></a>&#147;Provision of appropriate placements</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011466000061"></a>In section 23 of the 1989 Act (provision of accommodation and maintenance by local authority for children whom they are looking after), after subsection (2A) insert&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011466000062"></a>&#147;(2B) A local authority must provide a sufficient and diverse provision of appropriate placements within their local area.&#148;&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000002"></a>The noble Earl said: On page 48 of their White Paper, <I>Care Matters: Time for Change</I>, Her Majesty&#146;s Government promised in bold, black letters that they would,</p>
<ul><a name="08011466000073"></a>&#147;impose a statutory duty on local authorities to secure a sufficient and diverse provision of quality placements within their local area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011466000047"></a>Yet nowhere in the Bill can one find such a duty. The amendment would allow Her Majesty&#146;s Government to fulfil that undertaking. I am grateful to the Fostering Network and the British Association for Adoption &amp; Fostering for advice in preparing the amendment.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000003"></a>At Second Reading, the Minister said that the duty was implied by the Bill. I regret to say that, unless it is made explicit, it is unlikely that it will be respected. If children are to be placed locally as far as possible, it has to follow that an explicit duty is placed on local authorities to make sufficient appropriate placements available. If there are no funds now to implement this, we should put in place the necessary empowering clause so that the duty can be introduced as soon as the resources are available. If the duty is implied in the Bill, one must ask where in the regulatory impact assessment provision is made for the huge increase in funds that would make all those new foster care places available. I am afraid that we just do not find them. How is the commitment to be fulfilled if the resources are not being made available to make it happen?</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000004"></a>As I said under a previous amendment, BAAF and the Fostering Network&#146;s report, <I>The Cost of Foster Care</I>, published in 2005, made clear the situation. Commenting on the report, the chief inspector at the Commission for Social Care Inspection, David Behan, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011466000063"></a>&#147;Our inspections have revealed that just under 40% of fostering providers are still not meeting the standard required on matching, which is key to achieving stability for these children. It is essential that there is an increase in the choice of foster carers for children and young people which will lead to a real improvement in outcomes, with the right placement for the right child at the right time&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011466000048"></a>The report highlighted a shortfall of 10,000 foster carers across the UK. Robert Tapsfield, chief executive of the Fostering Network, said that it was a call to the UK Government to invest a further &#163;748 million in foster care each year. Rather than the &#163;500 million that I mentioned, &#163;748 million should be invested in foster care each year. This call is reinforced by a report from the Children&#146;s Rights Director, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011466000064"></a>&#147;A very common message from children is that when they&#146;re being moved, there should be a choice of at least two alternative suitable placements and the child should have a real say in the choice between them&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC408"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC408</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08011466000049"></a>Perhaps I may also quote some foster carers:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011466000065"></a>&#147;There is a lot of pressure put on foster carers to accommodate children not on their approval status and to take in more children than their quota ... Fostering is a very stressful occupation but foster carers are expected to carry on regardless of situations they find themselves in ... It is not just a need to recruit more foster carers, there is a need to keep them&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011466000050"></a>Another foster carer says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011466000066"></a>&#147;There is often an air of desperation that surrounds placements. No efforts are made to ensure suitability and/or compatibility. Three years ago, I accepted a child on an emergency basis. The child remains in our family. I am now being pressurised to take the child&#146;s siblings, which I have declined because the child does not want this. I am so disenchanted with my situation, I would give it up tomorrow were it not for the commitment I have made to this young child&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000005"></a>The Government are to be congratulated on meeting some of the needs identified by that report. They have now set minimum allowances for foster carers and, I believe, are considering minimum fees for them. The Bill, even unchanged, will contribute to improving the situation, yet we remain far behind as regards the incentives offered to foster carers by our continental neighbours. I recognise that some of your Lordships may blanch at the idea of paying a large sum per child to each foster carer, but the situation clearly demands such an approach, given the shortage of foster carers.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000006"></a>I have already discussed the impact statement relating to the Bill. Funding to local authorities for social services is not ring-fenced, as was said previously. There are many conflicting pressures on local authority budgets, and currently local authorities are facing huge, unexpected expenditure on payments to women who in the past have not received equal pay for equal work. Care for the elderly will be an ever increasing expenditure, and there will always be the public&#146;s and the local electorate&#146;s abiding priorities of roads and waste to consider. Unless an explicit duty is laid on local authorities, some will inevitably raid their social service budgets to meet other priorities. I hope that the Minister will think about this matter and that he can accept the amendment. I look forward to his response. I beg to move.</p>

It is very disappointing that the commitment in <I>Care Matters</I> has not resulted in an explicit duty in the Bill to provide diverse accommodation.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000008"></a>Amendment No. 30 relates to the duty in relation to disabled children in particular. It would add to the duty to secure accommodation the further duty to secure enough accommodation that is,</p>
<ul><a name="08011466000074"></a>&#147;consistent with the welfare of all children including disabled children&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011466000051"></a>It would require local authorities to demonstrate that they were increasing the supply of suitable accommodation for such children in their area rather than simply relying on the provision in the Bill not to place a child locally if there was no accommodation consistent with their particular needs.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000009"></a>I have been asked to table this amendment by Every Disabled Child Matters, which speaks particularly for the disabled child. It welcomes the Bill&#146;s provision in  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC409"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC409</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Clause 8 to increase the number of looked-after children placed locally but has major concerns about how disabled children will fare under the Bill. The Bill has the potential to transform the experiences of a lot of disabled children, many of whom are placed a long way from home because their special needs can be met only in an authority some miles away.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000010"></a>We do not want to see local authorities relying on the necessary provision in the Bill not to place a child locally if there is no accommodation consistent with their welfare; instead, we want local authorities to build up enough appropriate places in each local authority to take care of such children. There is a tendency to place children a long way away, and these distances increase the safeguarding concerns because there is no one whom the child knows, such as a member of the family or a friend, to keep an eye on them. That makes it difficult for family and friends simply to stay in touch and to keep their relationship going. It also adds to the sense of isolation that many disabled children feel anyway because they are just a little bit different from their peers.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000011"></a>Amendment No. 30 would impose a duty on local authorities to demonstrate that they are building capacity for future placements for children and young people with disabilities. Without this amendment, we are concerned that the most vulnerable looked-after children&#151;those with disabilities&#151;will not benefit from the improved outcomes of being placed near to home from which other children will benefit.</p>

I put my name down to this amendment when it was alone and palely loitering and prepared three pages of speech to make to it, but I fear that they are no longer required. The important thing is that the amendment refers specifically to disabled children; it is the only one in this grouping that does so, which from my point of view makes it the most important of the four amendments.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000013"></a>The amendment would require local authorities to increase the supply of suitable accommodation available locally in line with local need and to ensure that the overall aim of Clause 8&#151;that children looked after by a local authority stay in their local area&#151;is properly met. It would therefore ensure that the capacity for suitable accommodation is developed over time. Out-of-area placements are of course sometimes necessary but they are expensive and disruptive and they increase children&#146;s vulnerability. By accepting the amendment, the Government could reduce the need for out-of-area placements and increase the welfare of disabled children and all children who need accommodation to be provided by their local authority. I hope that the Minister will agree to support the amendment and, possibly, the other amendments, too.</p>

<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC410"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC410</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="08011466000075"></a>&#147;a sufficient and diverse provision of appropriate placements within their local area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011466000015"></a>Other noble Lords have spoken about the disadvantages for children of being placed hundreds of miles from home&#151;and we know that that happens an awful lot. The precise wording of the amendment is important. I know only too well from my work in east London that boroughs such as Tower Hamlets, Newham and Hackney simply cannot provide sufficient fostering placements or other placements within the borough. I am sure that that applies also to a lot of other inner-city areas. Therefore, the term &#147;local area&#148; is important, as it adds the required flexibility to achieve the desired result.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000016"></a>The key point is that boroughs need to negotiate with the boroughs next door to provide sufficient local placements so that the children can maintain contact with their families and school; one hopes that they can attend the same school as they went to before, and so forth. I very much agree with the British Association for Adoption &amp; Fostering that focusing on local authority boundaries could be clumsy and work against the interests of children in some cases, particularly if the nearest placement was on the other side of the borough, when going over the border into a neighbouring borough would produce a much better outcome.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000017"></a>The focus on the local area therefore makes a huge amount of sense from a number of points of view. The aim to have sufficient provision in each area except in exceptional circumstances is also important. The Children&#146;s Services Development Group makes a powerful case for out-of-area placements for children with acute or complex needs, for whom it would be unrealistic to replicate services locally; I am sure that all noble Lords are familiar with that point. The sufficiency of local provision would take account of the proportion of children who will anyway need to be placed out of area, so I do not think that that is an issue.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000018"></a>The organisation National Children&#146;s Homes expressed concern that local authorities may have an incentive to place children locally, if they have sufficient places locally, even when that might not be in the child&#146;s best interests. NCH has a point, as local authorities would certainly be tempted to try to place as many children as possible in their local area, or certainly within their local borough, if they could do so, even when that might not be in the best interests of the child. However, I would like the Minister&#146;s assurance that that issue could be dealt with through guidance or perhaps even regulations.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000019"></a>Like the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, I draw the Government&#146;s attention to their commitment in <I>Care Matters</I>,</p>
<ul><a name="08011466000076"></a>&#147;to drive improvements in local authority commissioning ensuring a sufficient provision of local suitable and stable placements&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011466000052"></a>They also pledged to legislate for that. Along with the noble Earl, I do not believe that the wording in the Bill makes that commitment. The purpose of the amendment therefore is to honour the Government&#146;s commitment. On that basis, I hope that the Minister will support it.</p>

I support this group, but we would probably like to repeat during our deliberations our view that this is a good Bill that has been warmly received for its intentions. Therefore, it would be a shame if in historical perspective it did not achieve its objectives because it had not been specific enough about how they should be achieved. That is tremendously important when there is an intention to spell out exactly who is responsible and who must make the provision.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000021"></a>Reference has been made to the resource issue; that is an inescapable argument, which has to be taken seriously. However, if we somehow mask the issue by not spelling out specifically enough what has to be done, revealing what the required resources will be, we are making a mistake. If my noble friend can take the amendments on board and find some way to respond to them by Report, it will be an altogether good thing.</p>

<p><a name="08011466000022"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08011466000084"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> I begin by commending the Department for Children, Schools and Families for its work in setting standards in this area. I refer particularly to setting minimum standards in relation to fostering allowances. It is, however, appalling that 17 local authorities in England are still not paying the national minimum standard. As one who has brought up children, I do not think that I could bring one up for &#163;102 or &#163;151 a week. Foster carers are out of their own pocket paying for a lot of extras for those children, so that they can have equal care. It is important that we do all that we can to ensure that all those local authorities come up to standard.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000023"></a>I particularly wanted to speak on the issue of commissioning, since it has not been mentioned. I am not sure whether my noble friend is going to speak about this, but this discussion gives me the opportunity to raise the issue and to say why there is considerable difficulty in this area. Most of us who have been involved in children&#146;s services will know that many of the very good placements provided mostly by the voluntary children&#146;s sector that are now closed have been closed because they could not be maintained under present commissioning arrangements. That means that no local authority was prepared to pay consistently the appropriate fee for the child&#146;s placement or to ensure that they paid for vacancies or voids during the time when a child was being moved from one place to another or when a placement might be held for a child who might need to come back. There was no way in which all that could be maintained. That has caused a huge reduction in good placements for children. Unless practical ways are found through commissioning, we will not be able to do anything about that.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000024"></a>Also on commissioning, when services are being sought by local authorities in this way, it is crucial that the practice is improved substantially. Many organisations continuing to provide services of one sort or another&#151;I have said this to the Minister many times before, publicly&#151;will tell you that short-term contracts militate against good services. Local authorities are employers and would not take on staff on the same basis as they would expect their voluntary services partners to do, which is on  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC412"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC412</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>short-term moneys. Not only that but, sometimes only weeks before the contract is due to run out, you do not know whether the contract will be renewed&#151;another such case has arisen today. Redundancy notices have to be issued to staff in time, so that if you do not get your grant you have some way out as a voluntary organisation. Good commissioning is terribly important right across the sector for all sort of placement services.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000025"></a>I wanted to reinforce the point that, important as local area networks are, there are some children for whom specialist provision needs maintaining. I declare an interest as the chair of Grooms-Shaftesbury, which provides specialist school placements for very disabled children. Unless some way is found of maintaining those kinds of placements, the children do not end up going into normal education, because they are not the kind of children who can often be contained in ordinary education. They have severe and complex disabilities and end up living with their parents at home in considerable difficulties, without the capacity to learn what they could learn with skilled help. So it is not always appropriate for a placement to be in a local area, although for the mainstream of children it clearly is.</p>

Amendment No. 20 relates to supported accommodation; its purpose is to ensure that there is an adequate supply of such accommodation for care leavers. The National Leaving Care Advisory Service at Rainer helped me with developing the amendment and I am grateful for its advice.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000027"></a>In many areas, housing of any kind is in desperately short supply. In that regard, I warmly welcome the Government&#146;s Housing Bill and the promise of 3 million affordable new homes. I declare my interest as a landlord. Unsurprisingly, good-quality supported housing is also in short supply. In 2007, 25 per cent of those leaving care were aged 16; those in residential care, often the most vulnerable, are most likely to leave at 16, compared to the average age at leaving home of 24. Clearly, many of those young people will require accommodation with built-in assistance and advice available from a responsible adult, such as foyers, hostels, training flats and flat-shares with live-in volunteers.

Since the introduction of the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000, the percentage of 19 year-old care leavers in training and employment has increased by 8 per cent, but if this Bill is successfully to address the improved transition of young people from care, which is very much its intention and the intention of the whole <I>Care Matters</I> project, it must address supported accommodation. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response on this point. If he would prefer to write to me, as I tabled the amendment rather late, I would certainly be grateful for a letter.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000029"></a>Amendment No. 22B is about the quality and regulation of supported accommodation. As someone who has worked as a volunteer in such accommodation over several years, I am well aware that these young people and the staff who support them deserve far better. There are insufficient guidelines on how supported accommodation is staffed and on the level of qualification and skills base of staff to support care leavers. In addition, there are no guidelines about the level of support provided to care leavers and how it is monitored. As a consequence, the quality of supported accommodation varies across local authorities. Can the Minister say how he will ensure that there is better planning for supported accommodation by local authorities, what plans he has to introduce guidance in this area and how regulation will be strengthened? Again, I apologise for not giving notice of these questions. Perhaps he will be good enough to write to me. I am not a great expert in this area, but I am very much surprised that there is no guidance of this kind. However, the advice that I have received is that there is not. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="08011466000030"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 22C is on commissioning. I have heard my noble friend Lord Laming refer to this matter many times. I was grateful for the reinforcement offered by my noble friend Lady Howarth of Breckland. Will the Minister give careful consideration to the recommendation of my noble friend Lord Laming that there should be a commissioning strategy for each local authority? Recommendation 23 of the placements working group, an offshoot of the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper, states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011466000070"></a>&#147;Every local authority must have a commissioning strategy based on the assessment of the needs of the children in their area&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011466000056"></a>Such a strategy is fundamental to the success of the Bill in improving outcomes for looked-after children.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000031"></a>Currently the driver for commissioning is often cost and not quality. We need to know the needs of the children in each area, as my amendment would provide, and to take account of those needs. What response have Her Majesty&#146;s Government made to that part of the report of my noble friend Lord Laming? How does the Minister intend to take forward the other plans set out in <I>Care Matters</I> relating to the local commissioning of care placements? Will he take steps to ensure that commissioning strategies and practice are based on

There needs to be a clear audit of what is available and what is needed. Regrettably, I am advised that there is not and I would be most grateful for an opportunity to meet the Minister prior to Report, along with some of the stakeholders, to discuss the implementation of my noble friend&#146;s recommendation. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

If we intend to keep children in care near their homes, it would make sensible economics to have good local provision. However, what does &#147;sufficient and diverse&#148; mean and how would you achieve it or know that you had achieved it? The needs of many children and young people are highly complex.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000033"></a>If there were the resources, we would wholeheartedly support these amendments, because we would like nothing more than local authorities to be equipped to provide sufficient care for every child in care. The child&#146;s welfare, not cost, should always be the driver of decision-making with regard to care. However, there are instances, such as when children have complex disabilities, as mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth of Breckland, when the potential cost is genuinely limitless. Although we applaud the spirit of the amendment, we regret that we cannot support it&#151;if I did, the wrath of the shadow Treasury team would come raining down on my head.</p>

I absolutely agree with the sentiments being expressed but existing legislation and/or regulations and/or guidance already provide for it or will do so once we have revised the said regulations or guidance. As I look through the pages of my speaking note, I fear that that is precisely what I shall say in response to these amendments.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000035"></a>We entirely agree with the need to ensure that local authorities provide sufficient accommodation for looked-after children, which is the purpose of the noble Earl&#146;s Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 and Amendment No. 30 proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. However, new subsection (7A) in Clause 8(2) of the Bill would prevent local authorities from using a lack of provision in their area as an excuse to place children out of it. If they did so, they would not be acting reasonably to fulfil their obligations under this duty.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000036"></a>In addition, local authorities are already under a general duty to secure a range and level of services, which clearly includes accommodation, appropriate to the needs of children, including disabled children,  in their area through Section 17 of the Children  Act 1989. Moreover, Section 23(8) ensures that accommodation provided by a local authority to a disabled looked-after child should not be unsuitable to their particular needs. We have committed in <I>Care Matters</I> to developing the detail in guidance to help to

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000037"></a>We are entirely supportive of the view set out powerfully, also, by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, that effective commissioning lies at the heart of improving services for children and young people. My department, the Department of Health and the Department for Communities and Local Government are working together to put in place the right framework to ensure that there is effective joint commissioning. There are already a range of obligations on health and local authorities, including a duty to undertake joint strategic needs assessments and a requirement to produce a children and young people&#146;s plan. In addition, we are currently consulting on statutory guidance covering the role of the local authority as commissioner, including services for looked-after children; the consultation is due to close in March.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000038"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, asked about local authorities that are still paying below the national minimum allowances. As she knows, we have the legal power to enforce those allowances and we are working with Ofsted to ensure that we have accurate information about the allowance levels paid by all fostering providers. We will look closely at that information as it becomes available in deciding whether to enforce our national minimum allowance rates.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08011466000039"></a>Amendment No. 22B refers to accommodation for children leaving care. As part of our wider <I>Care Matters</I> programme, we will be revising the regulations and guidance to the Children Act. This will include revision of the children leaving care guidance. We will use this opportunity to emphasise the responsibilities that local authority leaving care services will have to children whom they have placed in unregulated supported accommodation. These responsibilities will necessarily include ensuring that children are properly safeguarded, and so are not to be expected to live in unsafe places, and that the services commissioned to support them in any unregulated accommodation are the most appropriate to responding to the full range of their needs. I hope that that goes some way towards meeting the points raised by the noble Earl.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011466000071"></a>&#147;A local authority must provide sufficient and diverse provision of appropriate placements&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08011466000058"></a>However, if accommodation is not consistent with the child&#146;s welfare, one can go outside the area. With a little careful rewording, those two proposals are not necessarily incompatible. I appreciate that the Minister said that he was advised that the amendment was incompatible with the clause, but I do not think that that need be the case.</p>

As I said, the 2005 report identified that an annual increase of more than &#163;700 million a year would be necessary to make placements available.

However, I crave the Committee&#146;s indulgence to go over some issues that have a bearing on other amendments, in particular my later amendment on grandparents.

<p><a name="08011510000004"></a>I am grateful to the Family Rights Group and the National Children&#146;s Bureau, among others, for their detailed support on this amendment, which seeks to include a new duty in the Children Act 1989 to provide a framework for family and friends carers. It recommends an assessment of the need for support services and the preparation of a plan of support if those services are recommended. In addition, it would give the Secretary of State the duty to make certain provisions&#151;for example, about the type of assessment, a review of any plan, and provisions as to the circumstances in which a local authority may recover costs of providing support services.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000005"></a>Amendment No. 86 would clarify the definition of children in need; it would ensure that any child in care could be considered as a child in need. This issue was raised by several noble Lords last week, and I think that it will come up again later. Last week, many noble Lords spoke of practical support for families and of therapeutic support. I was pleased to hear this, as families under stress, in poverty or in other difficulties often need support in order to benefit children, who are, after all, the focus of our deliberations. Without such support, many placements are under great strain and some will break down, with the result that children will end up in the care system after all.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000006"></a>Research on kinship care commissioned by the former DfES and carried out by Elaine Farmer and Sue Moyers tells us that children in family and friends placements have similar difficulties to those living with unrelated foster carers but that the outcomes of children settled with families are often better. We heard horrendous stories earlier about some children in care. However, family and friends carers are significantly more impoverished, more likely to be living in overcrowded accommodation and more likely to be in worse health than unrelated foster carers. I shall dwell on this more when I speak of grandparents as carers.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000007"></a>Despite the vulnerability of both children and carers, many of these families receive no adequate financial or practical support. They are more likely to be left alone to cope&#151;for example, in managing contact arrangements and in balancing financial needs. I want to distinguish between two kinds of  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC419"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC419</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>family and friends carers support: immediate short-term needs, where a carer takes charge of a child in an emergency to prevent the child from going into care; and longer-term needs, where family or friends take on the care of a child or children on a long-term or permanent basis, as local authority foster carers, under a residence or special guardianship order or by private arrangement.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000008"></a>Let me first look at the immediate emergency type of care, which can happen because of a crisis in the parental home, perhaps in the context of child protection inquiries. If suitable care cannot be found in the family network, the child will almost inevitably be taken into care either with parental agreement or under an emergency protection or interim care order. Such emergency placements frequently cause enormous financial and other pressures, particularly where the carer takes on a group of siblings who may have suffered trauma, neglect or abuse. Such support may include cash to buy clothes or specialist mental health or behaviour support.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000009"></a>If the child is treated as being in the care of the local authority, as in the recent Southwark case, the carer will be a local authority foster carer and will receive a fostering allowance and support to care for the child. In practice, however, only a small minority of family and friends carers are treated as local authority carers because, even in a child protection context, those carers agree directly with the parents to take on the care of the child, whether through direct negotiations or in the context of a family group conference. Thus the local authority is not directly involved in making the placement or, despite the ruling in the Southwark case, the local authority refuses to accept that the child was looked after when placed with the carer and hence refuses to pay the carer financial and other support. In these situations, the carers do not receive a fostering allowance and can receive support from the local authority only if the child is considered in need. Is everyone still with me? This is very complex.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000010"></a>The provisions in Clause 21 of the Bill that remove the reference to &#147;exceptional circumstances&#148; are helpful, yet such carers will still have great difficulty in accessing support because, even though the children will have undergone some degree of trauma to no longer live with the parents, they are frequently denied an assessment for their need for support&#151;and without such an assessment they are not categorised as being &#147;in need&#148; for accessing the specialist support that they require. We talked about assessment earlier. My Amendment No. 86 would help those family and friends carers who are not treated as local authority foster carers to have the child&#146;s needs assessed without having to argue the case that those children should be treated as being in need. They would therefore have access to support services.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000011"></a>Let me move on to meeting needs where family or friends take on the care of a child on a long-term or permanent basis. The amendment to Clause 7 would insert a new duty into the Children Act 1989 to provide a support framework. Currently, the only way  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC420"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC420</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in which family and friends carers can be guaranteed access to their support needs is for the child to be a looked-after child in the state system. Yet there may be no other good reason why the child should be in care. In order that children do not remain in state care unnecessarily, I am seeking a new duty to be placed on local authorities to provide a family and friends care support service for those who have an established caring arrangement.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000012"></a>The service would mirror the framework for special guardianship support services. It would be available to family and friends carers who are not local authority carers but are family members or friends who are taking charge of a child for 28 days or more, either where there is a residence order or where there is no order in place. The amendment would mean that the local authority would have a duty to establish family and friends care support services, including commissioning services from the voluntary sector. The duty would be consistent with the duties introduced under the Adoption and Children Act 2002 in respect of adoption and special guardianship. It would mirror those specified in the Special Guardianship Regulations 2005, which include support groups for carers to combat isolation; support for contact arrangements where appropriate; respite care; therapeutic support; an assessment of need and access to support provision; improved communication between agencies such as CAMHS, housing, police and children&#146;s services; and cash help.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000013"></a>In law, at least, relatives and friends are not financially liable for the children whom they are raising. It therefore follows that the core financial needs of caring for such children should, where they cannot be met by parents, be met by central government. There is a moral argument at least that financial support should be available to anyone caring for a child who is not their own. There should be a national non-means-tested financial allowance, tax credit or benefit to cover the real costs of raising a child, which should be paid to relatives or other persons already connected to the child who take on the care of a child for more than 28 days continuously in the following circumstances: where there has been a Section 47 child protection inquiry; as a result of a Section 37 investigation; or where a carer has secured a residence order or special guardianship order and there is professional evidence of the parents&#146; inability to look after the child and/or there is a residence order or special guardianship order arising out of care proceedings, or the carer has those orders following the accommodation of a child. That would avoid the child being a looked-after child. Thus the financial allowance would be received only if the carer were raising the child and the parent had been shown to be incapable of raising the child.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000014"></a>These are complex but incredibly important issues. There are moral, emotional and financial reasons for looking at the amendments and I hope that at the very least we may get an inquiry into the imperative and the practical implications of providing a national financial allowance and other support to family and friends carers. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response. I beg to move.</p>

She has so much knowledge and experience that her argument has to be taken seriously. Perhaps in the absence of my noble friend Lady Thornton I might add a few words on Amendments Nos. 35 and 36, which are grouped with this amendment.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000016"></a>When a child or young person leaves care and is reunited with their family, that can obviously be a difficult time of transition with regard to their mental health and emotional well-being. Amendment No. 35 is intended to ensure that an assessment of need is made to make certain that access to the necessary support is provided and that the health and well-being of the child is thereby better safeguarded. Amendment No. 36 would simply introduce measures to provide the necessary assessment of need and the associated support for children and young people who are at risk of entering care. These are preventive measures, which we hope would assist in addressing the causes of the challenge that confronts us.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000017"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08011510000282"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> I shall speak to Amendment No. 87 in my name, which is grouped with the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey. Whereas her amendments refer to support for family and friends carers after 28 days, my amendment is designed to meet the immediate short-term urgent needs of children and family and friends carers. It would do so by adding to the definition of a child in need under Section 17(10) of the Children Act those children who are being cared for by family members or friends.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000018"></a>The current situation is that many relatives and friends take on the care of children without any warning at very short notice, often in an emergency because there is a crisis in the parental home. That often arises in the context of child protection inquiries, as well, in which the children are in fact in danger. If suitable care cannot be found in the family network, the child will almost certainly be taken into care, with or without parental agreement.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000019"></a>The lack of planning for such placements, which is in their very nature, often creates enormous financial and other pressures on family and friends carers, particularly where the carer takes on a group of siblings, as often happens, who are traumatised by their previous experience. Such support may include cash to purchase suitable clothing or bedding&#151;or even beds, if family and friends do not have quite enough beds in the house. Specialist mental health or behaviour support may be needed, or help with transport arrangements to enable the children to keep contact with their parents or to get to school or to other services that they need. Without that support, there is a risk that such placements may break down at a later date, or even quite early. That is not desirable at all.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000020"></a>Where the child is treated as being looked after by a local authority, their carer will receive a fostering allowance and support to care for the child. Unfortunately, in practice only a small minority of family and friends carers in the situation that I have just described are treated as local authority foster carers, either because they agreed the arrangement  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC422"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC422</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>directly with the parents to take on care of the child or because the local authority refuses to accept that the child was looked after when placed with the carer. Often that is done at night or at the weekend, when there is no local authority person there to take on that responsibility.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000021"></a>In these situations, carers do not receive any fostering allowance and receive support from the local authority only if the child is considered to be in need. The noble Baroness, Lady Massey, in relation to the group to which she referred, indicated the difficulty of proving that the child is in need and going through some kind of trauma. The amendment would assist those family and friends carers who are not treated as local authority carers to have the child&#146;s needs assessed without having to argue the case for them to be treated as being in need, because the statute would already define them as such. The support services would then be provided for them and they could get the amount of support that they needed, as determined by the outcome of an independent assessment of that need.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000022"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08011510000283"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> I am pleased to register my support for the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, and I appreciate her addressing this vital issue. We strongly support the assistance for family and friends care for vulnerable children and young people. I find it extraordinary that we are not making far better use of extended family members when children are, for whatever reason, unable to stay with their birth parents. Our position on these Benches has always been to try to find ways in which children can be looked after in the most continuous and stable way possible; kinship care offers that. By every measure, kinship carers have proven to offer a far greater chance of a stable alternative placement, even when there has not been the full support of the local authority.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000023"></a>It is time that we gave family and friends carers better support. There is an estimated shortage of 10,000 foster carers in this country. Surely this makes the need to extend support to extended families and friends willing to look after a child even more acute. It is particularly important if we consider children with uniquely complex needs and older, more challenging, children for whom stability and a sense of continuity are key. When extended families are given the right support from social services or voluntary organisations, there is a far greater chance of making a success of a foster placement or, ultimately, adoption by family members. What is necessary, and what I am pleased to see addressed in the amendment, is a holistic approach that allows family and friends access to counselling and support that would enable them to be prepared, both practically and emotionally, to look after their relatives.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000024"></a>Of course, there might be scenarios where this will not be appropriate&#151;I am thinking of instances of family breakdown where what is necessary for the child&#146;s welfare is a clean break from their previous situation. However, it is difficult to imagine that it would not be appropriate for very many more children than those who now have had a second chance with another family member.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000025"></a>One authority that has a wonderful track record of kinship care is Hampshire. It puts great emphasis on research findings that show that children in kinship care feel loved&#151;they feel that that they belong&#151;and that such care helps them to maintain their identity and their family ties. Kinship care in Hampshire has, as the outcomes show, offered the children a high level of stability. Yet kinship care is not one of the key indicators and so its success is not marked. Indeed, the converse happens, because the authority&#146;s fostering and adoption placements are down. Will the Minister look urgently at how this crucial service can be valued and recognised?</p>

<p><a name="08011510000026"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08011510000284"></a>Baroness Butler-Sloss:</b> I support all these amendments for a particular personal reason. I have a friend who was, some months ago, asked to take over the care of a little girl whose mother patently cannot care for her because of drink and drugs problems. The mother agreed that she should take over the care; otherwise, the child would have gone into local authority care. The local authority was told by my friend that she was prepared to be considered as a foster mother, but she was very much discouraged from going down that route. She was asked to apply to have a residence order. She was given a certain amount of money&#151;most of it in arrears and only a part of what was due to her&#151;while the child was informally with her through the local authority. At the moment when, with local authority support, she made the application to have a residence order and take over the care of the child formally, she was told that in future the authority would not pay a penny. She was therefore discouraged from the idea of becoming a foster carer.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000027"></a>Clause 21 is, as the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, said, extremely helpful, but it needs some teeth, because it applies only in circumstances where a local authority chooses to make payment. This friend of mine is not asking for a foster carer&#146;s payment, but she wants some practical support to enable the child to be with a childminder while she completes her job. She will have 10 or 15 years of caring for this child on a long-term basis and she is told that she will get no money. That is outrageous. Clause 21 takes us part of the way, but not far enough. Consequently, I strongly support the amendments.</p>

I have numerous examples in this regard, but one in particular is of a woman who died, leaving her child in the care of her neighbour, who had cared for that child on and off for years. The local authority, though it came and said that it would make an assessment, thought that the child was adequately cared for, and for weeks that family looked after the child without a single penny and with minimal support, until another organisation intervened fairly seriously about the implications. Local authorities tend to think, &#147;This

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000030"></a>I want to talk about support for children reunited with family or friends. The point that has not yet been made in the debate&#151;I do not have the figures, but the Minister should be able to tell me&#151;is that a huge number of children pass through the care system in short-term placements. Because I did not know that I was going to speak on this, I do not have that number to hand. The flaw in our services is that those children, when they come out of care after a short-term placement, often do not have the continuous care that would underpin their rehabilitation, and therefore we find them back in care. It is those &#147;turntable children&#148; who often become the most disturbed. I hope that we can do something about that issue, which is well known structurally, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, has said.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000031"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08011510000287"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> As my name is attached to at least one of these amendments, I wish to say in the briefest possible way how impressed I have been by all the speeches, especially that of the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, on this subject. It occurs to me that there must be savings in the long-term for local authorities in this area, when you think of the added trauma that there could be for children who are in and out, unhappy in their placements and so on. We must do as much as we can to ensure that these kinship carers, or whatever we are going to call them, are available&#151;friends or kin, genuine people who want these children to be part of their family. We must encourage them. It has to be in the long-term interests both of the economics of what we spend in this area and of the children concerned, as well as our long-term preventive aims.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000032"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08011510000288"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> It is hardly necessary for me to add my voice to those who have already supported the amendments. They are of the utmost merit and I support them fervently, particularly in the light of the matters referred to by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. I had been tempted to make this point about Amendment No. 19, but I believe that it applies equally in this case: when we talk about the provision of accommodation by local authorities, we are not talking about something that local authorities can do directly in the sense of a cause-and-effect situation. In other words, no one suggests that local authorities can designate A, B and C as potential carers and then exercise some draconian statutory powers to force them into that position, almost in the way that during the Second World War people were forced to billet children who were evacuees from bombed cities. You have to rely on&#151;this point is relevant to much of what we are discussing in many amendments&#151;the capacity of government, whether local or central, to create a situation in which it is likely that more rather than fewer persons will come forward to care.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000033"></a>There is a reason of the utmost sensitivity why one should concentrate on family and friends in the first instance before one has to look further afield.

Indeed, it may be that one is talking about the efforts not only of local government bodies but also of central government. It may be that a campaign of television advertising should be launched, perhaps not dissimilar to the blood donor campaign that has been taken up most excellently. Every support should be given to entice people to come along, most of whom will have an idea more of vocation than of occupation. Be that as it may, not only should this be socially acceptable and have the approbation of society, but it should have adequate and realistic financial support.</p>

I have before me the speech made by my noble friend Lady Massey. We know there will be those who will immediately see these amendments as having the potential for abuse and as a risk to public moneys. It will be claimed that arrangements will be made, conveniently, to look after the children of others in order to access public funds. I can well imagine the kinds of headlines  we may see in some newspapers about these recommendations.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000035"></a>The emphasis should be on the fact that such a financial allowance would be received by a carer only where it was clear that the parents were incapable of raising the child themselves. My noble friend Lady Massey has made the point, but I reinforce it because there is always a great deal of debate around the issue of the abuse of public funds. This has to be seen in the context of the moral obligations of parents to care for and bring up their own children, and to take responsibility for them. We have had the debate often, around absent fathers particularly.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000036"></a>But there is also the issue of our moral obligation as a society to keep children within kinship relationships and to provide them with proper care. There is a very real need to make this argument publicly in a way that makes it clear that the first obligation is on parents to bring up their own children and to take financial responsibility for them.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000037"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0006.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08011510000290"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I support what the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, and all noble Lords have said on these amendments. In response to what my noble friend Lord Elystan-Morgan said, I think of what the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, has achieved over many years. I believe the organisation Carers UK is pushing the point of providing financial support to family carers and, if I correctly read the <I>Sunday Times </I>over the weekend, I understand that the Government are now seriously considering giving far more financial support to informal carers. I hope that will apply to these children as well.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000038"></a>Listening to the debate, it occurs to me that when foster carers are well supported by social workers they feel far better able to do their job. I imagine the same applies to families as well. If they get good professional support, good CAMHS and good social work support, it will make a big difference to their lives. It is probably not just about money.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000039"></a>In that case, we need to think again about the impact of social work practices. Again, I am grateful that the Minister in his letter recognised the need to think through very carefully what impact social work practices would have on those working on the margins of care and supporting families to keep children in their extended family. As he recognises, the social work practices could be so attractive, could be such a honey pot for social workers, that they would be pulled out of what has always been the Cinderella area of supporting families before children come into care. He said, either at Second Reading or in Committee, that children who can be cared for within social work practices must have a care order attached to them first.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000040"></a>Therefore, I should be grateful for clarification of when exactly social work practices could start interacting with families and children. Once the child had a care order and he returned to his family&#151;the point has been made that children often move back and forth from and into care&#151;one would think that, even when the care order had been removed, the social work practice would keep in contact with the family and provide support. How far can social work practices go in supporting families such as these?</p>

<p><a name="08011510000041"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08011510000291"></a>Lord Northbourne:</b> I should like to take up the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, about the responsibility that parents have to look after their own children. I also draw attention to the fact that my Amendment No. 102&#151;it comes right at the end of the Marshalled List, so I am not sure when we will come to it&#151;is on the subject of parents&#146; responsibilities. It is a fact that there is no clear statement in English law on the responsibility of parents towards their children, but it seems to me that that basic piece of information is fundamental to all the discussions that we are having.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000042"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08011510000292"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> Amendment No. 21 in the name of my noble friend Lady Massey raises the vital issue of relatives and friends who take on the care of children. My other role in these debates will be that of chief fact-provider. Placements with family and friends currently account for about 12 per cent&#151;that is, 7,500&#151;of all looked-after children, but, of course, on top of that 7,500 are a vast number of arrangements in respect of children who are not looked after but whose support by family and friends is indispensable to them not needing to be looked after or to enabling parents to fulfil their obligations more effectively than they might otherwise do. As the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said, short-term placements account for a very high proportion of all placements. The latest figures show that 37 per cent of children leave care in under six months and 50 per cent leave care within a year, so the role of family and friends also needs to be seen in that context.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000043"></a>We place great emphasis on children in need being cared for wherever possible by their families, including their wider families. We have demonstrated that commitment in Chapter 2 of the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper, which sets out how we intend to provide additional support for parents, including pilots of

<p><a name="08011510000044"></a>We are also aware of the difficulties that some relatives may face in taking on their responsibilities, and the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper sets out a strong agenda for improving the range and quality of support and services available to them. We have committed ourselves to developing a new framework for family and friends care, which is to be issued as part of the Children Act 1989 statutory guidance, under Section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, to address the issues of unacceptable variations in levels of support and services between authorities, the lack of policy frameworks and the need for transparency and equity in relation to services and support for family and friends carers. All those issues were raised by my noble friend Lady Massey, and I can tell her that the new statutory guidance will cover the content of an appropriate policy framework, expectations of an effective support service linked to commissioning, wider support, including financial benefits to which carers may be entitled, and an appropriate assessment process where a relative is to be approved as a foster carer. We will, of course, consult our stakeholders on this new framework to ensure that we get it right, and we will consider all the points that have been made so eloquently in this debate.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000045"></a>Turning to some of the specific elements of my noble friend&#146;s amendment, we believe that it would be inconsistent with the widely framed general duty to children under Section 17 of the 1989 Children Act to identify a particular group of adults in particular circumstances and to provide a statutory right to an assessment which we do not give to any other group of adults, including birth parents, as part of the Section 17 duty. The amendment proposes a wide range of people who may request an assessment on behalf of a family and friends carer, which is a departure from other provisions in the Children Act 1989.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000046"></a>The current assessment process for children in need requires the local authority to understand the child&#146;s developmental needs and their parents&#146; or carers&#146; capacity to respond to these needs in the context of their wider families and communities. Any specific needs of carers will therefore be picked up as part of this process.<I></I>Indeed,<I></I>a local authority would need to provide an assessment of the child and family in order to know that the child was on the edge of care to provide the appropriate services as a result of that assessment.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000047"></a>I can tell my noble friend that we are making one important improvement to the 1989 Act in the Bill. Clause 21 would amend Section 17(6), which restricts the making of payments to &#147;exceptional circumstances&#148;. The change will give local authorities a wider discretion and will enable them to provide financial support on a longer term basis where they are satisfied that doing so would safeguard and promote the child&#146;s welfare. However, it must be very clear that it is not the role of

My department is committed to working with the other relevant government departments to ensure that family and friends carers are able to make maximum use of the financial benefits available to them.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000048"></a>Section 17E in my noble friend&#146;s Amendment No. 21 proposes that, in prescribed circumstances, where the local authority has decided to provide services, a plan must be made for the provision of support services. I can tell my noble friend that it is already a requirement within the integrated children&#146;s system&#151;to which I referred earlier&#151;that, where services are being provided under Section 17 of the 1989 Act, there must be a child in need plan and review. This requirement will be reinforced in the revised care planning and review regulations and guidance which we proposed in the White Paper. The assessment model is set out in section 7 guidance in the framework for the assessment of children in need and their families issued in 2000. We therefore believe it is unnecessary for any new regulations about assessment, planning and review in this context.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000049"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, specifically asked me about the value placed on family care in the performance framework. She is correct that it is not an indicator in the new national indicator set. However, alongside the new comprehensive area assessments, Ofsted will be undertaking a rolling inspection programme of services for looked-after children. We will ask it to ensure that this also considers services for children on the edge of care, which will include services for those in family and friends care.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000050"></a>My noble friend&#146;s Amendment No. 86 and Amendment No. 87 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, seek to define all children being cared for by family or friends as &#147;in need&#148; for the purposes of Section 17, without an assessment. As they will be aware, if such a child is &#147;in need&#148; of services to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard of health or development, they are already covered by Section 17.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000051"></a>The only group of children who at the moment are automatically defined as &#147;in need&#148; is disabled children, and it is obvious why they are included. The identification of other children who may be in need arises following an assessment of their needs for local authority services in order to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard of health or development. We believe that it would be inappropriate to designate a child as &#145;in need&#146; simply because they are being cared for by their family or friends when they do not need services in order to achieve reasonable health and development.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000052"></a>There is an important point of principle here. The Children Act 1989 focuses on the needs of the child, rather than who they are cared for. We believe that that is correct. Children living with family or friends are a diverse group. In many cases, they are living away from their parents because of a perfectly acceptable private arrangement and have no additional needs. A balance is to be struck between ensuring that children are safeguarded while minimising state interference in private family matters. We must ensure that the law

We believe that the current Children Act duty in Section 17 does this by focusing on the child&#146;s needs, regardless of who cares for him.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000053"></a>My noble friend Lady Thornton told me in advance that she would be unable to be in her place today. Her Amendment No. 35 refers to children returning from care or accommodation to live with family and friends. The issues raised by my noble friend&#146;s amendment are also addressed in <I>Care Matte</I><I>rs </I>in recognition of the particular needs and vulnerabilities of all children returning to birth parents and wider family following a period in care. In the White Paper we set out our commitment to use the revised Children Act 1989 guidance to address the need for effective care planning to ensure that work continues with the child&#146;s family while he is in care and that appropriate services are delivered to support his return home.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000054"></a>I will of course read carefully my noble friend&#146;s speech to see if there are further points to which I should respond, but I hope that I have given a fairly comprehensive response to her points.</p>

I think there is probably some good news in there, but I need to read what he said in order to be sure that there is.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000056"></a>Of course we are all aware of the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper, but sometimes people just need money and not various other forms of support. I thank other noble Lords who have contributed to the debate. We have had a thorough discussion of this, as I said earlier, very complex issue.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000057"></a>I am very glad that some people provided anecdotes. There are thousands of anecdotes about deprivation and suffering regarding family and friends who care for children. There is also a fair bit of research on it, to which I have also referred. One of the things that worries me is that local authorities may differ so much in what they do for family and friends who are carers and how they do it. That always needs to be regulated. As has been pointed out today, there must be long-term savings by having children not going into care. Dire consequences can result from children going into care&#151;poor achievement, substance misuse, teenage pregnancy and ending up in custody, with all that that costs. Of course there must be potential savings if we support carers and the children who are in care. I wish someone would work out what that saving could be. Maybe someone on the back row could do that little task.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000058"></a>I shall read carefully the whole debate and what the Minister has said. We might come up with some simpler composite amendment at a later stage. Perhaps the Government might do so. We need to keep the matter on board and to look at it again. In the mean time I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011510000246"></a>(1) As soon as a child under 18 who is separated from both his parents and is not being cared for by an adult who by law or custom has responsibility to do so makes an asylum claim or a human rights claim or is identified as a victim of trafficking, a local authority must ensure that a legal guardian is appointed to represent that child.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011510000247"></a>(2) The following expressions have the same meaning in this section as in section 113 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (c. 41)&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011510000248"></a>(3) &#147;Trafficking&#148; means the arrangement or facilitation of the arrival in, entry into, travel within, or departure from the United Kingdom for the purposes of exploitation as defined in section 4(4) of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 (c. 19) (trafficking people for exploitation).&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000061"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 22 is about guardians for children with special protection needs. By that we mean children who are separated from their parents and who come to the UK and seek asylum, or children who have been trafficked. Each year 3,000 such children come to the UK and claim asylum. The Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium has repeatedly called for a system of guardianship for these children, most recently during the passage of the Children Act 2004. The continued denial of full statutory safeguards to be placed on the Border and Immigration Agency under Section 11 of the Children Act 2004, and the proposals to introduce fundamental changes to the system of support for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, means that the need for a children&#146;s guardian has now become urgent.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000062"></a>There is no systematic provision of independent oversight on matters involving separated children who are subject to immigration control. Children may go unrepresented in their asylum application; they may be placed in inappropriate accommodation with inadequate support; and may not understand the implications of their asylum application. In particular, the long-term solutions for each child may not be fully explored.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000063"></a>In the current system, separated children seeking asylum&#151;some as young as eight years old&#151;have to instruct their own solicitors. I have difficulty instructing a solicitor, let alone an eight year-old child. The question of a child&#146;s competence to be party to legal proceedings is addressed in various jurisdictions, but not before the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. Citizen children who go through similar court proceedings are recognised as needing independent advice and support to represent their best interests. This is provided through CAFCASS, a non-departmental public body accountable to Parliament through the Chancellor. It is independent of the courts, social services, education and health authorities and all similar agencies. Children&#146;s guardians represent the interest of a child in court during cases in which social services have become involved in the child&#146;s case.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000064"></a>Even a child going to a police station to give evidence about something which he or she may or may not have been involved with has the right to have an appropriate adult with them. Under Code C, Section 1 of PACE, if the police think that a person coming to the police station is under 17 years-old they  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC431"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC431</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have to act under Code C, paragraph 11.15, which provides that a vulnerable person,</p>
<ul><a name="08011510000263"></a>&#147;must not be interviewed ... or asked to provide or sign a written statement ... in the absence of an appropriate adult&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011510000209"></a>In the Code C notes for guidance, paragraph 11C states that it is important to remember that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011510000249"></a>&#147;Although juveniles or people who are mentally disordered or otherwise mentally vulnerable are often capable of providing reliable evidence, they may, without knowing or wishing to do so, be particularly prone in certain circumstances to provide information which is unreliable, misleading or self incriminating. Special care should always be taken when questioning such a person, and the appropriate adult should be involved if there is any doubt about a person&#146;s age, mental state or capacity. Because of the risk of unreliable evidence it is also important to obtain corroboration of any facts admitted whenever possible&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011510000210"></a>The attendance of the appropriate adult is an essential prerequisite for a lawful interview. Without it the interview is likely to be held as inadmissible by the court.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000065"></a>The appropriate adult is not just an observer and their role is to advise the detainee and to observe the interview and whether or not it is being conducted properly and fairly. It is also their role to facilitate communication with the person being interviewed. That is the sort of support that is given to a child who is a citizen of this country, but no such support is provided for separated asylum-seeking and trafficked children, who, in addition, are increasingly unable to access the specialist legal advice needed to ensure that they are properly supported and receive a timely decision on their asylum application. The Home Office consultation paper, <I>Planning Better Outcomes and Support for Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children</I>, outlines plans to disperse these children, which raises even greater concerns about the provision of adequate legal advice and other support services.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000066"></a>The case for guardianship is even more compelling in the light of the changes made to the immigration rules in December 2007, which state that all children over the age of 12 who make their own asylum application will be interviewed. We would not interview a citizen child without an appropriate adult speaking for them and ensuring that they get fair play, so why should we do that for the most vulnerable children who come to our shores in great need?</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000067"></a>Also of great concern is the high number of separated children who go missing from local authority care. Two different pieces of research on child trafficking in England found that in well over half of the cases of examined the child identified had gone missing. Based on that evidence, UNICEF UK&#151;I declare an interest as a trustee of that body&#151;recommended that a guardian is appointed for trafficked children as soon as a child victim is identified or there are reasonable grounds to believe that the child is a victim. We have international obligations in this respect but I shall not go into all of them now.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000068"></a>The Government have claimed in the past that the children&#146;s panel of the Refugee Council provides what is needed here. But, although the children&#146;s panel is able to help a large number of unaccompanied  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC432"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC432</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>children to access legal representation, it is by no means guaranteed for all children seeking asylum on their own. The panel&#146;s role is not a statutory one, although it is funded by the Home Office. There is no obligation on children&#146;s services to work together with the panel of advisers or vice-versa. It has no mandate to report, to make recommendations or to ascertain the feelings of the child. It does not act as an &#147;appropriate adult&#148;, as I described it a few minutes ago, and it does not act as a litigation friend or a CAFCASS court welfare officer.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000069"></a>NGO agencies such as the Refugee Council Children&#146;s Panel, valuable though they are, are no substitute for statutory guardianship. I hope that the Minister will pick up this case and heed the needs of these most vulnerable children and give them at least the same sort of protection that we give to citizen children who find themselves tied up with these serious legal matters. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000070"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08011510000295"></a>Lord Judd:</b> I cannot think of a more important amendment for our deliberations than this one. I was previously a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and both in our examination of legislation and its practice in the context of UK immigration policy&#151;and more specifically and more recently in our examination of the UK Borders Bill, now Act&#151;I do not misrepresent the situation in saying that we, as a committee, became disturbed by the predicament of children.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000071"></a>Children in that situation have sometimes been through unimaginably traumatic experiences. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has put the issue so well: if certain principles apply to children in our own immediate society, those principles should apply at least as much to children in this kind of predicament.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000072"></a>I toyed with whether I should make this point because it is seen within the internal politics of my own party&#151;no more widely&#151;that perhaps I am trying to score points: I am not. I was very moved in the autumn when the Prime Minister made his remarks in his speech to conference about children. He said that he wanted to live in a society in which all children were included in the provisions to be made, not some children. I do not believe that this legislation, as proposed, meets the Prime Minister&#146;s passionate pronouncement on that issue. For that reason, if for no other, I urge my noble friend to consider how he can turn the Prime Minister&#146;s personal commitment and passion into a specific reality on the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000073"></a>In our deliberations in the Joint Committee on Human Rights, we began to fear that children would be seen primarily as part of the immigration problem. Children are children; everything else is secondary. They are children and, as such, what we as a civilised society have spelt out as appropriate conduct and support for children must apply to those to whom the amendment refers. I express my profound gratitude to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, for having moved the amendment. I sincerely hope that my noble friend can respond to it.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000074"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0007.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08011510000296"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I strongly support the amendment. I was grateful to the Minister for his helpful letter following Second Reading. However, I  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC433"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC433</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was not clear about one point. He wrote that most unaccompanied asylum seekers will have looked-after status as they have no parent by definition. Surely all unaccompanied asylum seekers should have looked-after status as they have no parent by definition. Will the Minister explain why some might not have a social worker? I regret that some seem to be without, whether or not they are entitled to one. Perhaps that is as much to do with the shortage of social workers in some areas as anything else.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000075"></a>I make the point because it speaks to the amendment&#146;s proposal for a guardian for every unaccompanied asylum-seeking child. Although concern is felt that some children will not have a social worker or, as we have heard many times today and on previous days in Committee, that the turnover of social workers is so high that several may be without consistent contact and understanding of their case, I say that if they have a guardian, they will have someone who, one hopes, will stick with them for as long as they need their help, and a better outcome for them could be expected. They need a strong advocate to access legal services&#151;which, as we have heard, are in short supply&#151;and education, health and social services. Many of the young people about whom we are speaking can do very well in education and then make an important contribution in this country or in their own when they return. It would be a great pity if any of their potential was wasted for lack of an effective advocate. The amendment would be a helpful step forward, and what it proposes has, I understand, been demonstrated to be so in several other countries. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000076"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08011510000297"></a>Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws:</b> I am conscious that the Minister is in difficulty here because other government departments have an interest in these matters. When the Children Bill was going through this House&#151;it was after the Victoria Climbi&#233; case&#151;I remember thinking what wonderful legislation it was and how content I was that here was something on which I could agree with my Government at a rather painful time when I had to disagree with them on a number of other matters. Here was something with which I could be completely content. I felt happy that I was going to be able, with great willingness, to go through the Lobbies in support.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000077"></a>Then, one evening, I came into the House and took my place on my Government&#146;s Benches. I was shocked to hear an amendment being moved by the Minister that would keep out of the great advances being included in the legislation the children of immigrants. Child asylum seekers would not have the protection that the Children Bill would provide to others. I heard Bishops and a number of other lone voices in a quite empty House speak about the horror of some children being deprived of the protection and the human rights for which we were aching for the children of this country. We have the opportunity to right a wrong. Through my practice and through other human rights lawyers at the Bar dealing with the issues of asylum and immigration, I have seen very closely the suffering that children experience as a result of their not having the same protections as we

We should not be making those differences between the children who are citizens and those who are not. I hope that the Minister can provide us with some solace.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000078"></a>When the Children Act was passed, I met some colleagues from the other place at a social gathering and expressed my horror that we had exempted the children of asylum seekers from the great protections of the Act, and they told me that they were completely unaware of that. It is the nature of politics in our current system that often the small print is rushed through these Houses and it misses the kind of examination that it should have. I think that many people did not realise the terrible wrong that was being created in the Act when we excluded those children. I warmly support the amendments. This is an opportunity for us to put right something that should not have happened.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000079"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0007.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08011510000298"></a>The Lord Bishop of Newcastle:</b> For all the reasons mentioned this afternoon, I support the amendment. It is staggering to think that every year 3,000 children separated from both parents arrive in the UK. Some&#151;we do not know how many&#151;have been trafficked, and I suggest that most, if not all, will have had traumas of many kinds. That seems to me enough to demonstrate that we urgently need some system of guardianship. Although I welcome much of the Bill because it strengthens the care and protection of children in the care of the state, it could do a lot more&#151;and this amendment is a case in point. It gives the Government a chance to provide better care for one of the most vulnerable of all groups in our society&#151;unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000080"></a>How we treat and care for the most vulnerable people, whether they be the youngest or oldest in our society, is a real test of what kind of nation we are. How, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, can we expect some young and very vulnerable children to instruct their own solicitor? Surely it is right to provide the kind of statutory legal support that a guardian could give. I fear that the Minister will reply that the role of such a person as a statutory guardian is unclear or that such children are already receiving sufficient help from social workers, as well as other bodies or groups. They may or may not be, but neither of those responses would be good enough. I hope that the Minister will give us&#151;and, much more importantly, give that vulnerable group of young people&#151;some hope and statutory support by accepting the amendment.</p>

Believe you me, central to the problem that I have just described is what is seen as hypocrisy. If people see a society that talks about its values in one context but totally fails to apply them in their personal experience, we are asking for trouble and, I dare say, we almost deserve it. This argument also has to be taken seriously in that sense simply because of children&#146;s vulnerability.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000082"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08011510000300"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> I declare an interest as a member of the Independent Asylum Commission, which is due to report later this year. I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, on the coverage that she has given to many aspects of this hugely important issue. I commend, too, the noble Lord, Lord Judd, on the seriousness that he has attached to it, and I agree with everything that has been said.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000083"></a>I wish to draw attention to two groups, both of which have been covered. The first is the group that the noble Baroness referred to as &#147;the missing&#148;. It was mentioned during the study of the inspectors&#146; second report on safeguarding children. We do not know precisely how many of these children there are, but no one has responsibility for finding out how many there are or where they are or for doing anything about them. At the time of that debate, it was suggested that this matter should be delegated to local authorities, which should have to conduct a census in their areas and do something about them.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000084"></a>The second group that worries me is the children whom we do know about and for whom these guardians are being appointed, because there is currently a huge difference in the ways in which they are treated in different parts of the country. In some areas they are merely dumped into bed and breakfast accommodation with nothing else being done for them, in some areas they are fostered and in some they are extremely well looked after. I hope that, in agreeing that they should all be given a guardian of some kind, some attempt will be made to produce a series of standards on how these children should be looked after so that consistency can be restored. The inconsistency results from the fact that, instead of putting them in the care of the authority in the area in which they surface, they are allocated around the country in a sort of &#147;fair&#146;s fair&#148; arrangement so that everyone has a group to look after. That does not seem to be very sensible, however equitable it may seem to the authorities.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000085"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08011510000301"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> I have no expectation of any positive response from the Minister on this. I am sad when I say that because I think that his heart may well be with us on this but for the policy of his Government, who have exemptions from the Convention on Human Rights in relation to the two key areas of immigration and children in custody. Set in that frame, the Minister might find it difficult to agree.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000086"></a>However, I support the amendment substantially. I declare an interest as the deputy chair of CAFCASS, and, in any event, we have enough work to keep us

If these children were indigenous to this country, there would be an outcry, but, because this matter is linked to immigration, we have no hope of gaining media support for this group of extraordinarily vulnerable young people and children. I had not intended to speak on this issue but, having spoken on the others, I felt that that would be going against my principles. These are the children who disappear into child-abusive situations&#151;into prostitution and ghettos. Young prostitutes whom you meet on the streets often started their lives in this way.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000087"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said all the other things that I wanted to say about inconsistency. We know that some local authorities have grasped this nettle and, therefore, we have examples of good practice where something can be done. There are other areas where children disappear, never to be seen again, and everyone is grateful that they do not have to worry any more. Consistency in standards would make a huge difference. I know that the Government are trying to work in that direction but I hope that they will do even more in terms of these vulnerable youngsters.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000088"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08011510000302"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> Under Article 19 of the EU reception directive, the Government must ensure that unaccompanied minors are represented. This was underlined in the Joint Committee on Human Rights&#146; 10th report and Article 19 specifies that representation must be either by a legal guardian&#151;the course recommended by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley&#151;by an organisation responsible for the child&#146;s care and well-being, or by other appropriate representation. I can tell the Committee that the Government&#146;s view is that we comply fully with this and with the other requirements of Article 19. All unaccompanied minors who apply for asylum, including in age-disputed cases, are referred to the Children&#146;s Panel of the Refugee Council within 24 hours of the claim being lodged. The Children&#146;s Panel, which is funded, as the noble Baroness said, by central government, provides appropriate guidance and signposts asylum-seeking children to the appropriate services they need. The panel also ensures that the child is aware of his or her rights and the services to which he or she is entitled throughout the asylum process. The panel does not offer legal advice, but it can refer the child to a legal representative if he or she needs one. The legal representative will assist with the person&#146;s asylum claim and be funded by the Legal Services Commission.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000089"></a>So while the noble Baroness is right that the Children&#146;s Panel is an NGO, it is only one part of the picture of support provided. It signposts children to the services that they need, including legal services funded, as they need to be, by the state, and ensures that local authorities make an assessment of need and make services available.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000090"></a>In respect of some of the other services to which the noble Baroness referred, entitlement to representation by CAFCASS officers in family and related proceedings does not depend on immigration status. Similarly, if asylum-seeking children are involved in criminal proceedings, which were also mentioned by the noble Baroness, they will be protected by the code of practice to which she  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC437"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC437</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>referred as much as citizen children would be. Furthermore, the UK Borders Act 2007 introduced a requirement for the Border and Immigration Agency to have regard to a code of practice set out by the Secretary of State designed to ensure that, in exercising its functions in the UK, the BIA takes appropriate steps to ensure that children are safe from harm. We are drawing up that code of practice and, as a minimum, the immigration procedures to be covered by that code of practice will include checking documents and confirming identity, checking the bona fides of accompanying adults and destination address, interviewing children, caring for children during enforcement activities, greater attention to the needs of children who are detained in immigration premises, caring for children during escort and transfer activities, applying child-specific standards to contractors and other commissioned services and there will be provisions about the need to be vigilant for trafficked children and children who have gone missing&#151;who were also referred to by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000091"></a>The Border and Immigration Authority refers all lone children with no parent or carer to children&#146;s social care. Local authorities then make an assessment of needs in accordance with the statutory guidance set out in the<I> Framework for the Assessment for Children in Need and Their Families</I>. Local authorities have a statutory duty that their functions are discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of all children, under Section 11 of the Children Act 2004, regardless of their immigration status. The children that this amendment seeks to target would almost certainly be &#147;children in need&#148; as defined by Section 17 of the Children Act 1989, and most are likely to meet the criteria under Section 20(1) of that Act, requiring the local authority to accommodate them and so they become looked after.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000092"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, asked me why most, but not all, asylum-seeking children are classified as looked after. The answer is that it depends on whether or not they need to be provided with accommodation. Some asylum-seeking children are cared for by relatives or family friends who are established here and, therefore, may not have looked-after status. However, if they need accommodation they will be looked after and they will have a social worker. Our statutory guidance to local authorities in <I>Local Authority Circular (2003) 13</I> makes it clear that there is a presumption that any child who has no parent or guardian in this country should be accommodated under Section 20 of the 1989 Act. The recent High Court decision of Mr Justice Holman in cases involving the London boroughs of Wandsworth, Hackney and Islington concerning the status of young asylum seekers confirmed that where an asylum-seeking child needs to be provided with accommodation, the local authority should provide it and the child should be looked after.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000093"></a>We recognise that unaccompanied children and those who have been trafficked can be particularly vulnerable. In addition to <I>Working Together</I>, we have   


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC438"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC438</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>published supplementary guidance, <I>Working Together </I><I>to Safeguard Children who may have b</I><I>een Trafficked</I><I>,</I> and launched the NSPCC Child Trafficking Advice and Information Line to assist local agencies in addressing the specific safety and welfare needs of children who have been trafficked.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000094"></a>Assessment plans and interventions for children are already subject to external scrutiny through a number of statutory routes. For example, the care plan of looked-after children must be regularly reviewed at meetings chaired by the independent reviewing officer, as I mentioned earlier. These officers have powers to refer individual cases to CAFCASS for consideration of legal representation and we are taking steps through the Bill to strengthen the role of the IRO to ensure that this is implemented consistently and effectively.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000095"></a>The courts already have power to make an order in specified family proceedings to appoint a CAFCASS officer to be the children&#146;s guardian. This arrangement continues until the court determines that it is no longer necessary. In addition to that scrutiny of whether their care plans are being implemented, any child in need who has a complaint or wishes to make a representation about the services that they receive is entitled to independent advocacy support, under Section 26A of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000096"></a>Article 10 of the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory, requires that as soon as an unaccompanied child is identified as a victim each party shall provide for representation of the child by a legal guardian, organisation or authority which shall act in the best interests of that child; take the necessary steps to establish his or her identity and nationality; and make every effort to locate his or her family when this is in the best interests of the child. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is considering the changes needed to comply with the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings. In doing that, the Home Office will consult with a range of stakeholders, including our established non-governmental organisation stakeholder group. This will include an assessment of all the options for improvement to the arrangements for all trafficked children.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000097"></a>In concluding this rather technical response to the specific points raised, perhaps I may say in more general terms that of course we recognise that some services for looked-after children have not always been of the highest quality. It is a fundamental purpose of this Bill to improve those services precisely to meet the objectives that my noble friend Lord Judd set out. It is also why we are taking forward the full range of reforms described in the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper, which has been broadly welcomed by the Committee, that apply to all looked-after children, regardless of immigration status. But, as we have discussed often during our consideration of the Bill, much of the inconsistency in provision is not in fact a matter for primary legislation, but a matter of improving the skills of the workforce, reducing staff turnover, improving the quality of services and

<a name="80114-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000098"></a>We do not believe it is necessary to create an additional demand in terms of statutory entitlement to a guardian in every case that merely duplicates existing statutory requirements. Therefore, we do not support the amendment, but believe that the whole range of improvements to provision for children in care, which will be brought about by <I>Care Matters</I> and this Bill, will affect those children also.</p>

I would say to the noble Lord that, listening to his reply, it struck me that there is a whole hotchpotch of bits of protection here and bits of protection there, but the one thing that would ensure that there was someone&#151;an adult who knew what they were talking about&#151;on that child&#146;s side when they were trying to find their way through the morass of rules regarding asylum is the one thing that the Government will not do. That would be a catch-all to make quite sure that the child actually made use of all these various bits of protection that the Minister mentioned. It is a bit like rolling a dice; you either come up with a one or a six; you either land on Park Lane or Go to Jail. It sounds like an awful mess to me, but I am a lay person.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000100"></a>Perhaps I may mention one or two specific matters in relation to the Minister&#146;s reply. He slightly mistook me when I referred to the PACE code of practice. I was not suggesting that a child who is an asylum seeker finding himself in a police station would not have the same right to an appropriate adult as a citizen child. I was trying to draw a parallel between that provision when a child might be suspected of committing a minor offence and the protection that the child does not have when addressing the legal system on a life-changing matter such as that child&#146;s asylum status.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000101"></a>The Minister mentioned the local authority; it is not adequately resourced to fulfil the effective functions of a guardian, as set out by the UNHCR and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Besides, the guidance to that convention states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011510000250"></a>&#147;agencies or individuals whose interest could potentially be in conflict with those of the child&#146;s should not be eligible for guardianship&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011510000211"></a>Indeed, there is a potential conflict of interest for local authorities, particularly in carrying out age determinations of young people, because there will be resource implications if it is determined that someone is a child and if the child is in need of other services from the local authority.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000102"></a>It is clear that we are not getting anywhere with the Minister, perhaps because of the constraints that the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, hinted at earlier. This matter is of great concern and of passionate interest to other Members of this Committee as well as me. Although I will of course withdraw the amendment for the moment, I would not be at all surprised if we heard more about it.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000107"></a>The noble Baroness said: I return to some of the passionate topics that we have just been debating. This is an important amendment that would place on the Border and Immigration Agency a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. As the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, said in the debate on the previous amendment, no such duty exists. Having an obligation is necessary because of the uniquely difficult situation of asylum-seeker children, many of whom arrive unaccompanied.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000108"></a>Their narrative is starkly different even to some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable children that are taken into care. We must try to ensure as far as possible that not just their immigration status receives attention, but their welfare. A duty is needed to ensure, to guarantee, that they do not fall through the cracks and that their welfare and safety is promoted to the fullest possible extent. Section 11 of the Children Act 2000 excludes the immigration services from an otherwise comprehensive list of those to which a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children applies.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000109"></a>In the debate on the UK Borders Bill, the Government argued that an amendment placing a duty on immigration services to promote child welfare would restrict the primary function of the Immigration Service; but this section of the Act would includes many other government agencies with other primary functions&#151;such as the police. The amendment is simply designed to ensure that, alongside the normal functions of the Immigration Service, the promotion of child welfare is considered.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000110"></a>The UK Borders Bill brought in a requirement for the Home Secretary to publish a code of practice, to which the Minister has already referred, on how the Border and Immigration Agency helps to keep children safe from harm and have regard to that code when carrying out its functions. However, this simply does not go far enough to safeguard the interests and welfare of the child. The code of practice was a welcome step in the right direction but I hope that your Lordships will agree that, if we are to take seriously the interests, welfare and safety of these children, we need to ensure that a statutory duty is placed on the immigration services to promote their welfare. I beg to move.</p>

There is a reference to the Children Act 2004. I do not think that it is something that we normally do in Committee but I hope that noble Lords will bear with me if I take the opportunity to spell out in some detail exactly what we are referring to in the Children Act 2004, rather than just express it in general terms.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000112"></a>First, perhaps I may turn to the Explanatory Notes on the Act, as published by the Government. I find it significant that referring to this part of the Act they say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011510000254"></a>&#147;This section imposes a duty on specified agencies to make arrangements to ensure that their functions are discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011510000212"></a>Noble Lords should note that they do not simply say &#147;the welfare of children&#148; but that they use the word &#147;promote&#148;. I hope that that word was not used lightly, as it contains a significant emphasis. Having spelt out a little more, the Explanatory Notes go on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011510000255"></a>&#147;This duty is intended to ensure that agencies are conscious of the need to safeguard children and promote their welfare in the course of executing their normal functions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011510000213"></a>Then, the Act specifically names the agencies as,</p>
<ul><a name="08011510000264"></a>&#147;a children&#146;s services authority in England ... a district council which is not such an authority ... a Strategic Health Authority ... a Special Health Authority ... a Primary Care Trust... an NHS trust all or most of whose hospitals, establishments and facilities are situated in England ... an NHS foundation trust ... the police authority and chief officer of police for a police area in England ... the British Transport Police Authority ... a local probation board ... a youth offending team ... the governor of a prison or secure training centre in England ... any person to the extent that he is providing services under section 114 of the Learning and Skills Act ... Each person and body to whom this section applies must make arrangements for ensuring that ... their functions are discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children; and ... any services provided by another person pursuant to arrangements made by the person or body in the discharge of their functions are provided having regard to that need&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011510000214"></a>We have just had a major debate in this Committee on the issues surrounding these provisions. To leave out the border authority at this juncture almost specifically indicates that somehow all this does not apply to that body.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000113"></a>My noble friend very genuinely gave us a very full reply in which he spelt out how he believed our anxieties were being met. I ask him to see that there is a yawning gap in that respect. Apart from anything else, there are codes of practice laid down by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act which apply to the police and other bodies and are referred to in this Bill. The same codes do not apply to the border authority. We are told that certain guidelines will be given about how it should behave but in the Joint Committee on Human Rights we were very anxious about that point. We thought that if the agency was exercising what were in effect police powers, the codes of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act should apply to them. So there is a real grey area here, just when all of us need to be satisfied that we have belt and braces in place to ensure that the needs of children are being met. Frankly, the amendment is, therefore, absolutely

I recognise the Minister&#146;s concerns about the dangers of judicial review of cases, which, I know, he is concerned might occur following the introduction of this duty, but I seek to reassure him that the Human Rights Act already provides ample opportunities for children to go to judicial review. That process has been tightened up recently. It is really unhelpful to discriminate against those among all other children in this country. It is most welcome that the Government have come forward with their own code in this area, but to treat those children differently from all other children sends out quite the wrong message. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

When you look at the figures of the number of children who have disappeared in this country, which could not be more determined to do the best for children, despite all that, somehow they are slipping through our laws or our agreement to comply with certain sections of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, and so on. I am concerned about this, as are all other noble Lords who have spoken, and we will hear from the group of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, on this matter. The longer that we put off facing this issue, the worse it will become. We should be ashamed of ourselves.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000119"></a>Amendment No. 22A proposes an extension of the duty in Section 11 of the Children Act 2004 to the Border and Immigration Agency. Instead of extending the Section 11 duty, the UK Borders Act 2007 introduced a requirement for the Border and Immigration Agency to have regard to a code of practice designed to ensure that, in exercising its

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000120"></a>The code of practice is currently being prepared and the intention is to begin a period of public consultation on the content of the code shortly. We will consult widely, both in drafting the code and the operational instructions flowing from it. As part of the development, we will work with the Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services, the children&#146;s commissioners, officials in the devolved Administrations, the Children&#146;s Society, Barnardo&#146;s and others who have expressed their willingness to work with us on the development of this code.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000121"></a>While the code is not yet finalised for consultation I can outline in general terms what it will cover. As I said in reply to the previous amendment, our intention is to ensure that specific immigration procedures are properly responsive to the needs of children. As a minimum, these are&#151;I repeat what I said earlier because it is directly relevant to the amendment&#151;checking documents and confirming identity, checking the bona fides of accompanying adults and destination address, interviewing children, caring for children during enforcement activities, greater attention to the needs of children who are detained in immigration premises, caring for children during escort and transfer activities, applying child-specific standards to contractors and other commissioned services, and provisions about the need to be vigilant for trafficked children and for children who have gone missing.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000122"></a>Where conditions defined in the code suggesting trafficking or other harm are met, a referral will be made to a body with statutory care responsibilities. In a similar way, if a child fails to meet an immigration appointment and appears to have gone missing, the Border and Immigration Agency will make a formal referral to a statutory body with relevant responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000123"></a>The UK Borders Act also created the role of chief inspector of the agency and its immigration functions, and the chief inspector will have an active role in reviewing the agency&#146;s performance in relation to children. The Border and Immigration Agency is, furthermore, taking the necessary steps to ensure that staff realise how they safeguard children from harm and are more responsive to the needs of children in the work they are carrying out, while not overriding the purpose of that work.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000124"></a>The code of practice to which I have referred is not and will not be a token document. It is a commitment on behalf of the Government and the agency to a culture change on children&#146;s issues that those who have proposed the amendment wish to see. I know that will not satisfy noble Lords who have spoken, but the position of the Government has not in other respects changed in the past three months.</p>

However, it is at least morally and practically different. It seeks to ensure better support for grandparents, and I shall put their special case. I thank my noble friends for supporting the amendment. My noble friend Lady Hollis is here in spirit, if not in body, because she has to be at another meeting.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000133"></a>The issue of grandparents as carers has been around for a long time. I am grateful for parliamentary support for grandparent carers&#151;my noble friend Lord McKenzie of Luton, in particular, has shown an interest&#151;and I was glad to see in the new Children&#146;s Plan a reference to family needs. I quote from page 19:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011510000257"></a>&#147;Different families will need different things at different times and in different circumstances. The challenge is to provide services which are flexible and meet the needs of all families, in whatever shape or form. Our family policy will support families with whatever level of information and support they need, when they need it. This will include lone parent families, step families and families where children are being brought up by their grandparents&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000134"></a>When grandparents take over, it is because the parent or parents are incapable of looking after the child or children. The grandparents become substitute parents but they are older than parents normally are. Grandparents are sometimes an overlooked group who do not make too much noise  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC445"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC445</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because they are struggling with the circumstances of bringing up children, often in difficult circumstances. They often take on all grandchildren, and I know of several who have taken charge of three siblings. We talked earlier about siblings.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000135"></a>The grandparents whom I meet are mainly those who have taken on the care of children because the parents are dead, in prison or addicted to drugs or alcohol. I have hundreds of letters and case histories which testify to the problems encountered. The grandparents are dealing with children who may be grieving or they may be grieving themselves due to the loss of a son or daughter. They take on their grandchildren because they desperately do not want them to go into care, yet they report horrendous problems in trying to get support and failing because the system is unsympathetic and not geared up to help. We must change this. Grandparents suffer physical, emotional and financial hardship. They are a special case because they are older people. Some have given up jobs and some have poor health and poor economic circumstances, yet they save the state millions of pounds by caring for their grandchildren. They probably save even more in the long term. As I said earlier, children who are settled with a family have more positive outcomes than those in care.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000136"></a>This situation is unfair and unacceptable. There is confusion about what help is available. Grandparents cite particular difficulties as being those of residence orders, financial concerns, aftercare and isolation. I have just read a new document by Ed Miliband on families at risk, which talks of some families being seriously disadvantaged and of the fact that systems and services have to be made to work for them. I suggest that most grandparents as carers fall into this category. Where is the help for them?</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000137"></a>The Children Act 1989 gives local authorities the power to determine financial arrangements. Unfortunately, despite this being clear, there is good evidence that grandparents who care do not receive the same payments as other foster carers. There is case history on this, which I have here. In Manchester, a case came up concerning whether the local authority policy of paying family and friends who were short-term carers significantly less in relation to the child&#146;s maintenance than would be paid to other carers was lawful. It is known as the Munby case. Mr Justice Munby, who heard the case, granted judicial review and declared the policy to be unlawful on the basis that it was irrational and discriminatory against both the adult and children concerned, the level of payments failed to meet the welfare requirements of the child, and the limits placed on the amount paid to relatives was arbitrary and inflexible. It was a pretty strong judgment.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000138"></a>In addition, recent research has shown that family and friend carers receive far less practical support in caring for a child than an unrelated foster carer. They are&#151;I hear this a lot&#151;left to manage all arrangements, including complex care, on their own. This places a strain on everyone, including the children. Those of us who occasionally look after grandchildren know that it is a delight but it is also

Let us imagine those grandparents for whom this is a 24-hour a day job with no respite and little support.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000139"></a>Outcomes for children are the central theme of the Bill. If those outcomes are to be improved, we need to look at and repair the anomalies present in the system. If, in practice, a case can be ruled unlawful in one local authority, surely it is unlawful everywhere. I am not a lawyer but that seems to be the implication. The amendment, and those that came before it, must be addressed as a matter of urgency if we are not to compound an already confused situation and if we are not to leave some carers seriously deprived. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000141"></a>It is estimated that more than 200,000 grandparents in the UK have their grandchildren living with them&#151;not just staying for part of the time or being looked after part time, but living with them. As the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, said, many of those children have very severe and special needs; many are disabled; and many have parents who are in circumstances which have made life very difficult indeed for them. It is essential that these carers receive adequate support, both financial and in other respects, to support the dependants for whom they are caring.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000142"></a>I read an article a couple of days ago which stated that each year more than &#163;50 billion is spent by grandparents on family care. This is not grandparents buying Christmas presents; this is family care. That is a huge amount of money. In the course of chairing the all-party group I have met numerous people doing this job who spend so much of their personal money that they cannot afford it and are living under extreme difficulty.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000143"></a>We know that the discretion available to social services departments sometimes results in grossly unfair treatment of grandparents or members of the child&#146;s extended kin who provide exactly the same amount of care as foster parents. The law allows this unfair treatment, or even discrimination, against grandparents simply because they are relatives. One example is that from time to time&#151;I think this is the practice; it has happened too many times for it to be just a one off&#151;late on a Sunday night, or late at night, a grandchild is brought round to the grandparents and they are asked &#147;Will you take this child?&#148; That is the last the grandparents see of social services; they do not come back. It is safe for them to say that social services are stretched, they have very little money, &#147;but we have managed that case and so we do not have to worry any more&#148;. This is not acceptable and something needs to be done. The law needs to be changed so that people doing the same job are treated in the same way, otherwise we cannot talk about equality of treatment.</p>

I was immensely grateful when the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, a more conventional leader, took over the chair of that group. I helped that group set up the tremendous support that it gives to many children in this country. Coming from the north country, where most of the people in my kind of community looked after their grandchildren, I knew what that emotional support was about.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000145"></a>There is an issue with our amendment which seems to imply that every grandparent who takes over the care of their grandchildren wants a payment. I know from working with the Grandparents&#146; Association that that is not necessarily so. Many grandparents wish to take on that care; they know what has happened to their own children and want to provide surrogate parenting because that is what is needed in the family. But they need all kinds of other things and many of them need financial support. What irks them&#151;and this is rather scandalous&#151;is when children are taken into foster care in an emergency and then, with good kinship care programmes, placed with the grandparents, and finance is given to the original foster parents but no finance is given to the grandparents, who then have a terrible struggle. Not only that, there is very little help and advice about how to access the other financial supports which are available in the system.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000146"></a>I have spoken to a number of grandparents who have taken on difficult adolescents&#151;I have lots of surrogate grandchildren and the joy about grandchildren is that you can give them back&#151;who need support as they get older and have to struggle with the adolescent&#146;s emotional needs. It is very interesting that grandparents, like many other members of the community, are not anti-social services. They are not frightened that social services are going to come and take the children away&#151;indeed, they know they will not take them away&#151;but they want local authorities to give them advice and support and sometimes a break. Occasionally a bit of respite care is needed to keep the situation going.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000147"></a>I recognise that this comes into kinship care but these grandparents, as a group, underpin our society. I hope the Government will look at their special needs and at how to help them to do the task they are undertaking.</p>

Under the amendment&#151;which I support&#151;we are talking about &#147;Heaven&#146;s Grannies&#148;. It is important to recognise that what is proposed here is not in relation to any old informal arrangement but in relation to cases where a child is placed with a sole carer. This can be clearly defined from the point of view of finance and support and we know what we are talking about.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000149"></a>I support the principle that finance should follow the logic. If the logic is that this is the best way to do it, I cannot understand why we do not follow it up with the kind of finance and support that we make available to foster carers. I support the amendments and I am sure the logic of what we are saying will influence the Minister, who will jump to his feet and give us a friendly reply before dinner.</p>

The issue is crucial. However, this is not only about the financial side but about all the additional support that should be available. For example, where a grandparent is ageing a bit, if you could arrange for the child to be taken to school and back, that would open up opportunities for many more grandparents to play this role. I warmly support the amendment, just as I did the kinship care amendment&#151;but this is even more important.</p>

As the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, said, more than 200,000 grandparents and extended family members are already raising their grandchildren because their children cannot do so. We need to harness the dedication and love that extended family members have for the younger generation in their families. At the moment local authorities are too often missing a trick by not tapping into it more readily, but it is the children who are missing out most of all. We support the amendment&#146;s attempt to utilise and appreciate this valuable resource.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000153"></a>The Bill addresses concerns that some local authorities have considered placement of a child within their extended family to mean that the child is no longer looked after. Clause 7 of the Bill will ensure that if a grandparent or other relative agrees to care for a child at the local authority&#146;s request, this will be a placement under Section 23(2) of the Children Act 1989 and the local authority will continue to be responsible for the accommodation and the maintenance of the child as a looked-after child.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000154"></a>All individuals who care for looked-after children must be approved as a local authority foster parent within six weeks of the child being placed with them by the local authority, unless they are a parent of, or someone who has parental responsibility for, the child, or, if the child is the subject of a care order&#151;unless they had a residence order for the child immediately before the care order was made.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000155"></a>The requirement to be approved as a foster carer applies equally to related carers and stranger carers. All foster carers should be paid at least the national minimum allowance for foster carers at the rate set by the Government and be eligible to receive any additional fees or allowances paid by the local authority concerned in accordance with the authority&#146;s policies, which should not discriminate against carers who are related to the looked-after child. No foster carer, including those who are grandparents, should be out of pocket because of their foster-caring responsibilities.</p>

The judgment of Mr Justice Munby in the case of R (L and others) v Manchester City Council, R (R and another) v Manchester City Council makes it clear that the criteria applied when determining the appropriate level of support to be paid to a foster carer must not discriminate between stranger and related carers. Case law in this area is, therefore, clear, and the amendment is unnecessary. However, we will address the issue when we revise the Children Act statutory guidance to ensure that all local authorities are aware of their legal responsibilities. In addition, to ensure that all foster carers are aware of the criteria that will be used to assess their support package, the statutory guidance will also place a responsibility on local authorities to publish clear and transparent policies on the support they provide to all relatives who care for children, including those approved as foster carers. I hope that, on that basis, my noble friend will think that we are meeting the concerns that she raised.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000160"></a>Clause 7 agreed to.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011510000260"></a>It is the duty of each Primary Care Trust to ensure that a holistic assessment of a looked after child&#146;s health, development and mental health needs is undertaken as soon as a care order has been made, and to ensure that services meet those needs.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000162"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 25, which would ensure that the mental health needs of children who are placed outside their own local borough are met. At present, local authorities are reluctant to see placements for looked-after children from other boroughs developed in their own borough, because they know that the provision of services  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC450"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC450</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could be considerable. Kent, for example, provides large numbers of placements for looked-after children from east London. Why should Kent foot the Bill for CAMHS for those children? We have already discussed an amendment designed to ensure sufficient local authority placements in each local area. The Minister assures us that such provision will be made even under the Bill as it stands, but, however it is done, it is likely to involve negotiation between neighbouring local authorities to provide placements for their looked-after children. Such negotiations must be based on a clear understanding of the responsibility for funding the services for those children.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000163"></a>The British Association for Adoption &amp; Fostering argues the case well for these provisions. We know that 45 per cent of looked-after children aged between five and 17 are assessed as having a mental health problem. In the five to 10 year-old group, 42 per cent of looked-after children have mental health disorders compared with only 8 per cent of children in private households. The case is very strong. The mental health needs of looked-after children have been overlooked to an extraordinary degree when we consider not only the long-term consequences of neglect for the children themselves but also the consequences for the community at large, and, indeed, for the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000164"></a>In theory, we have a universal health service. We have the Department of Heath practice guidance on the health of looked-after children and the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services. However, in the 2004 report <I>Chi</I><I>l</I><I>d</I><I>ren&#146;s health, our future</I>, which reports on the progress of implementing the national service framework, there is not one mention of looked-after children. <I>Care Mat</I><I>t</I><I>ers</I> sets out an objective to publish statutory guidance on the health of looked-after children.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000165"></a>The British Association for Adoption &amp; Fostering is rightly very sceptical. It takes the view that the barriers to implementation are so significant and the problems so longstanding that only with primary legislation, including our Amendment No. 24, will sufficient priority be given to addressing this considerable problem. Introducing such a duty in the Bill would put health on an equal footing with education, where a clause gives a statutory basis, as we all know, to the designated teacher role in every school. If a looked-after child needs a school place, they get to the top of the list automatically. This is not the case for mental health services. Yet, without mental health care, these children will not be able to take advantage of the education. Similarly, if a looked-after child is physically ill, they will become inpatients or go for emergency treatment and get to the top of the list for whatever their needs are.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000166"></a>When I raised this issue at Second Reading, the Minister responded by saying that looked-after children have a mental health assessment under present arrangements. I checked that out. My understanding is that all looked-after children have a general medical assessment undertaken by and large by a nurse, but probably not a mental health nurse.  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC451"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC451</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The amendment would ensure that the mental health needs of these children are identified early. I hope the Minister will accept that present arrangements are not working. The cost is of our continuing failure to identify and treat the mental health problems of these looked-after children is considerable. Up to 90 per cent of young people in custody have some kind of mental health problem, including 10 per cent who manifest signs of schizophrenia. Children and young people in care are around three times more likely than other children to be cautioned or convicted of an offence while in care, and, I guess, quite a lot of that has to do with the child&#146;s mental instability of one sort or another.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000167"></a>Research from the Social Services Inspectorate suggests that 23 per cent of adult prisoners had been in care at some time. About 46 per cent of young people in custody have had some experience of the care system. That shows that the Minister is not the only person providing facts to the Committee. The evidence in support of these amendments is overwhelming, I hope therefore that he will support them. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000168"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0009.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08011510000324"></a>Lord Judd:</b> I happen to agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, that the arguments are overwhelming. I always find her arguments when she is speaking in favour of a proposition, clear, concise and extraordinarily well assembled. I really think it would be difficult to add anything to the very convincing arguments she has put forward. I only emphasise that the reason I put my name to this amendment is that it comes into the whole area of prevention rather than cure. The long-term implications for the youngsters concerned, if this sort of thing is not done effectively, are severe. The cost to society can be extraordinary because, as all of us know&#151;and I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, may have something to say about this&#151;it is true that our prisons are full of people who should never be in prison because they are basically there as a result of mental health problems. Here we are, if we do not make effective provision, aiding and abetting that extraordinarily negative process.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000169"></a>I warmly welcome the amendment. I am glad at the same time to express a word of support for Amendment No. 47, spelling out the responsibilities of primary care trusts, and Amendment No. 92, setting out exactly how assessment should be made. I hope that the Minister will feel able to take these points seriously. As I have said before, I do not see the point of the Moses Room process unless it is turned into a prelegislative process in which the Minister has a chance to take on board the arguments and go away and think about them before we get to what we have turned the Report stage into&#151;a de facto Committee stage, when we actually take votes. So I hope that my noble friend will listen.</p>

I also ask the Minister to provide further information regarding the Government&#146;s plans for ensuring that local authorities and healthcare agencies work together to provide for the assessment of looked-after children&#146;s physical, mental and emotional health needs. I am not referring here only to mental health but to the whole gamut of health needs.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000171"></a>The NSPCC passed me some Ofsted statistics today that showed that for the 12-month period up to September 2006 one in five children in care received no health assessment, which means that 8,888 children did not receive any assessment at all. What the figures do not show is that in a significant number of cases the assessment will be only a basic health check and will not consider the child&#146;s emotional and mental health needs. Clearly, that system needs changing.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000172"></a>Looked-after children and young people are often disproportionately affected by physical and mental health problems, such as many different physical complaints, mental health disorders, high rates of self-harm or other high-risk behaviour, substance misuse and high rates of teenage conception and motherhood. This can obviously result only in them not achieving, or not achieving so well, across the five <I>Every Child Matters</I> outcomes of being healthy, staying safe, enjoying, achieving and making a positive contribution. I also know that some children&#151;for example, children from black and minority ethnic groups and with disabilities&#151;have health problems that may be more severe than those for children who do not have those disabilities.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000173"></a>The Comprehensive Spending Review talks about the health and well-being of children and young people overall, in PSA target 12, and improving emotional health and well-being, particularly the emotional health of children in care, which is priority 4 of the same PSA target. There is the Healthy Care programme&#151;perhaps the Minister could say something more about this&#151;which seeks to develop Healthy Care partnerships across England, funded by the Department for Children, Schools and Families and developed by the NCB. The programme is rolling out across 90 local authorities via local multi-agency partnerships. That provides an excellent model for partnership working between local authorities, healthcare bodies and other partners. However, the responsibilities must be set out in legislation to ensure that looked-after children and young people experience improvements in their physical, mental and emotional health outcomes. Perhaps the Minister could give some detail on how these partnerships might work and how the Department of Health guidance, <I>Pr</I><I>omoting the </I><I>H</I><I>ealth of </I><I>Looked After Children</I>, can be developed on a statutory footing and revised to clarify the role of PCT chief executives in prioritising the health of looked-after children at the PCT board level. I realise that that is not his specific responsibility but I think that it overlaps with this amendment.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, explained the situation very clearly. The White Paper, <I>Care Matters: Time for Change</I>, stated that the Government would undertake to reissue the guidance promoting the health of looked-after children and place it on a statutory footing for health agencies, but we do not see anything to that effect in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000175"></a>We on these Benches are particularly concerned about the lack of assessment and treatment for mental health problems, which, as has been explained, we feel are particularly prevalent among looked-after children. Regulations are in place which state that the health assessment should have regard to mental and emotional health, but there is no requirement for assessments in these areas to take place; nor is there is a requirement for assessments of emotional well-being or mental health to be conducted by individuals with training and/or expertise in the fields that they are assessing. Furthermore, there are examples where assessments have not occurred as soon as reasonably possible and where therapeutic care has not been provided due to a breakdown in communication between local authorities and the health agencies concerned. One example has been quoted in the briefings that we received of a foster parent who said in interview:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011510000261"></a>&#147;[The child] destroys everything in his sight. He self-harms, doesn&#146;t sleep, doesn&#146;t get on with other members of the family, isolates himself, needs 24 hours of supervision, he pulls his hair out, pulls his finger nails off ... [the child and adolescent mental health services] won&#146;t work with him as he is not in a permanent placement. They see him to monitor his medication but do no one-to-one work&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011510000215"></a>with him.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000176"></a>Some 90,000 children will pass through the care system in any one year, and there are 60,000 children in care at any one time. Approximately 37,000 of these children are in care explicitly for reasons of abuse and neglect. They will have experienced emotional trauma, often over a sustained period, and it is reasonable to assume that a high number will have had experiences which may impact on their emotional well-being. It is essential that PCTs and CAMHS pull their weight alongside other partners in children&#146;s trusts. Evidence to date suggests that that is not happening, which is why in these various amendments we wish to give some statutory backing to the duties placed on them.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000177"></a>Specifically in relation to Amendment No. 47, we note that the forthcoming public service agreements for 2008-11 are consistent in setting out the health and well-being of children and young people as a government and public service priority. In particular, PSA 12, whose aim is to improve the health and well-being of children and young people, is a key area for all children&#146;s trust partners to work towards. PSA 12 is supported by other, equally important PSAs. The aim of PSA 10 is to raise the educational achievement of children and young people; PSA 11 aims to narrow the gap in educational achievement between children from lower-income and disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers; and PSA 18 seeks to promote better health and well-being for all.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000178"></a>The NHS operating framework is a vital policy statement in guiding local NHS services in determining their priorities, yet the current guidance does not even mention the needs of looked-after children. That framework will be crucial in delivering the PSAs, as well as the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services and the <I>Every Child Matters</I> agenda. It is therefore imperative that it should be shaped to ensure that children in care have better and priority access to the full range of NHS care and support services, so that those children and young people can overcome the many obstacles in their present and past lives and become well rounded members of our communities.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000179"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0010.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08011510000327"></a>Baroness Butler-Sloss:</b> I very much support the amendments, as well as the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. I have had unhappy experience of cases going through the care system where both the PCT and CAMHS have been totally inadequate. The practical problem, which in a sense the amendments highlight, is the inadequacy of the services in many areas of the country, particularly the services of CAMHS, much of which is because it seems to be inadequately resourced. There are children who do not get a first appointment for up to 18 months. That is not good enough. To have a series of amendments like this would be a wake-up call to another government department that it has to co-operate to do something for children who have been so badly treated that they have to go into care. As has been said already, many have been physically, sexually or emotionally abused, or all three. They need more help, not less, but CAMHS is not there to help them. Even the PCT finds difficulty in providing even the most minimal support for these children.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000180"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0010.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08011510000328"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> I lent my name to the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, for the very reasons that my noble friend Lady Butler-Sloss has just given and because of the point highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord Judd. My experience in prison of the number of people who had not had any form of assessment or treatment while they were in care was appalling. By the time they arrived in prison, there had been far too many wasted years in their life along the way. As the brief that we have had from the NSPCC and others says, there is substantial evidence of inequality of health outcomes for looked-after children, as we have all experienced, and the current guidance has not had a persuasive impact on PCTs. Everywhere you look&#151;this includes the whole of the mental health area&#151;the assessment of things like speech and language therapy, which are so important to the development of relationships, are missing because they are not included in PCT plans. We see the outcomes of that when they arrive in care.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000181"></a>I hope that in his reply the Minister will remember his own remarks in the last statements that he made at Second Reading, quoting a remark made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth:</p>
<ul><a name="08011510000265"></a>&#147;we should regard this Bill as a wake-up call for everyone responsible for children in care and that ultimately ... depends on implementation&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08011510000216"></a>I agree wholeheartedly. So do we all. There is no area where a wake-up call needs to be sent more clearly than those responsible for the healthcare, assessment and treatment of children in care.</p>

That is a crucial part of the partnership, and the Government have done so well in making organisations work together. I thought this was a flaw that we might well want to look at, which is why I support the amendments.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000183"></a>There is a structural issue here. My attention was drawn to it particularly by the Local Government Association, which points out that councils do all they can to bring children into the services they need, with regard particularly to mental health services but also to services generally in terms of making assessments of their health. However, their partners, the primary care trusts, have to work to a set of objectives established by the NHS within which the needs of children generally, and children in care specifically, are usually not given high priority.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000184"></a>I quote two reinforcements for that. One is that when the Children&#146;s Rights Director, Roger Morgan, was trying to look at the needs of children and wanted to be helpful to children in hospitals, that was a really difficult area for him to get into.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000185"></a>Secondly&#151;I cannot quote the particular authority as it was a discussion under Chatham House rules&#151;in a discussion with a chief executive of a hospital trust about how he would give priority to children&#146;s needs and children&#146;s issues, his answer was: &#147;I wouldn&#146;t do that if it actually interfered with my acute targets&#148;. It is very clear that unless we take action children will not get the kind of service they need to promote their health, which will leave a huge gap in the Government&#146;s policy of pulling together the partnership to make sure that the total holistic needs of the child are met. This barrier in improving the outcomes for children is not the ill will of the staff of the PCTs but because of the structure that exists, and the Government will need to intervene.</p>

It is most important that we should now be specific in the Bill about the need for a proper assessment of mental health needs and have a method to ensure that those needs can be met, and make clear that there should be priority access to child and adolescent mental health services.</p>

I want to talk about my perception of the practical problems. We have heard a lot about the need for CAMHS to respond positively. Certainly, I would not doubt that. I recognise that the Government since 2001 have funded a large number of very helpful initiatives to set up specialist teams for the assessment and prioritisation of looked-after children and specialist services in CAMHS. At present they work well.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000189"></a>There are still difficulties in other areas. The real difficulty is getting the initial health assessment appropriately carried out when a child first comes into care. The children arrive very late. Often they have already had several different placements. One of the reasons services can be reluctant is that they know the children may not stay with them very long. But the real problem is that they are not getting the primary assessment of healthcare when they first come into care. The health assessment has been a sort of &#147;take it or leave it&#148; one. Some children object to the assessment. They say, &#147;Other children do not have to have an obligatory medical, why should I?&#148;. The truth of the matter is that these children are so disadvantaged and the rate of mental disorder is so high&#151;particularly psychosis, as the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, has already outlined&#151;that it is crucial that we get these children and young people into treatment very early on. That means quite a simple but well trained assessment by a nurse who is familiar with the process and the questions that need to be asked, and who understands that conduct disorder is often a symptom of very serious mental illness and should not mean the child is dismissed as a &#147;difficult kid&#148;. The real problem here is that we must get these children assessed.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000190"></a>While I accept entirely that PCTs must set up the appropriate services and have those obligations in mind, I think that really it is too late and too little.

On children&#146;s homes, for instance, the Warner report, <I>Choosing with care</I>, said that on the Continent it is a common practice that children&#146;s homes are supported on a regular basis by a psychiatrist, a psychotherapist and a psychologist, the staff have a chance at a weekly meeting to discuss cases with them and that the manager gets individual support. The system works so well. I have seen it work well in children&#146;s homes in this country but it is not universal. If the Minister can do anything in the guidance to promote that model it will assist in the retention of staff and lead to improvements in referrals of children to higher level CAMHS.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000194"></a>One final point. One could always tell care leavers in the past because of their dental condition and the way their teeth had been looked after. I know there have been improvements but this issue needs continued attention.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000195"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0010.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08011510000334"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> I shall detain the Committee for literally half a minute. The point has been made many times over, both today and on the previous occasion last week, that there must be cohesion and comprehensiveness in the services provided by a local authority for all children. Indeed, that is true also of agencies outside the local authority. It is the very failure of that cohesion in this field that amply justifies the amendment.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000196"></a>The Minister may say that this is catered for in A, B, C, D and other different ways, but if no such amendment is passed there is a very real danger that the present highly unsatisfactory situation will meander on in the same way. The psychological impact of the amendment would be very considerable. In the vast majority of cases one would be dealing with a care order situation, and before you can make a care order under Section 31 it is necessary to show that the child is suffering harm or is likely to suffer harm. Harm includes health, and health under Section 31 includes mental as well as physical health. So it is utterly specific, utterly central and very near to the heart, core and kernel of a high percentage of the cases with which we are dealing.</p>

<p><a name="08011510000197"></a><b><a name="80114-gc0010.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08011510000335"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> Perhaps I may start in my role as fact-provider-in-chief. The picture before us here is one of much done, but more to do. Between 2003 and 2006, there was a 78 per cent increase in the number of new cases being seen by CAMHS. The size of the CAMHS workforce has risen to its highest level: an increase of 26 per cent between 2003 and 2006. The number of children waiting to access CAMHS is reducing. Approximately 24,000 cases were waiting to be seen by specialist CAMHS at the end of 2006, which was a reduction from 29,000 cases in 2003. The number of looked-after children in social services-targeted CAMHS teams, the initiative to which the  


<notus-date day="14" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC458"></a><b>14 Jan 2008 : Column GC458</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, referred, rose from 62 in 2004 to 80 in 2006. Although my noble friend was right that not one in five but 17 per cent of looked-after children have not had their annual health assessment, the proportion who have had it rose steadily from 77.1 per cent in 2004 to 83.2 per cent in 2006. All those improvements have been made possible in part by a substantial increase in grant-funding to local authorities for CAMHS, which increased from &#163;10 million in 1999 to &#163;91 million in the current financial year. That grant is ring-fenced. As noble Lords will know, persuading the Treasury to ring-fence is a tough job. Funding to primary care trusts for CAMHS increased from &#163;10 million in 1999 to &#163;50 million in 2005-06.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000198"></a>I hope that the Committee will agree that improvements have been made, but there is still more to do. It is precisely for that reason that, in last month&#146;s children&#146;s plan, we announced an independent review of CAMHS, which will look at how we ensure that children&#146;s services support the well-being of children and young people, and provide integrated support across the spectrum of universal and specialist services, including for looked-after children. We are in the process of setting up that independent review, which will report in the summer.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000199"></a>I fear that the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, anticipated entirely my response on the law. The law currently provides in most but not all respects for what is necessary. There is one important respect in which we propose to make changes and to which I shall refer in a moment. Regulation 7 of the Arrangements for Placement of Children (General) and the Review of Children&#146;s Cases (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations already require that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011510000266"></a>&#147;before making a placement, or if that is not reasonably practicable, as soon as reasonably practicable after a placement is made&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08011510000217"></a>a local authority shall,</p>
<ul><a name="08011510000267"></a>&#147;make arrangements for a registered medical practitioner to conduct an assessment, which may include a physical examination, of the child's state of health&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011510000218"></a>The regulations provide also that the health assessment should have regard to the child&#146;s,</p>
<ul><a name="08011510000268"></a>&#147;physical, emotional and mental health&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011510000219"></a>This means that, unless it is not reasonably practicable&#151;for example, it may not be possible to carry out a mental health assessment of a young baby&#151;the assessment must cover each of these elements of a looked-after child&#146;s health. The involvement of health services in these assessments is further underpinned by the duty in Section 10 of the Children Act 2004 for PCTs and strategic health authorities to co-operate to improve the well-being of children.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000200"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, mentioned the professional status of those who conduct the health assessments. The guidance on promoting the health of looked-after children states that the medical practitioner who carries out a health assessment should,</p>
<ul><a name="08011510000269"></a>&#147;have training in the early identification of mental health difficulties&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08011510000220"></a>and that they,</p>

<a name="80114-gc0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000201"></a>In Amendment No. 47, the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Sharp, and my noble friend Lord Judd seek to ensure that PCTs have regard to guidance issued by the relevant national authority about the health and well-being of the children and young people who are looked after. The guidance,<I> Promoting the Health of Looked After Children</I>,<I></I>issued in 2002, is statutory for local authorities, but has no legal status for PCTs and other healthcare bodies. As stated in <I>Care Matters</I>, we intend to make revised guidance statutory for healthcare bodies as well as for local authorities for the first time. That provision is not in this Bill because the statutory authority to do it is given in Sections 10 and 11 of the Children Act 2004. It is on the basis of those sections that we will make the revised statutory guidance applicable to healthcare bodies. That will be a significant change in the direction sought by Members of the Committee.</p>

<a name="80114-gc0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08011510000202"></a>Finally, I shall deal with the issue of Healthy Care partnerships that was raised by my noble friend Lady Massey. My department and the Department of Health have funded the development of the Healthy Care programme for four years using regional and local partnerships to promote the health and well-being of looked-after children. Activities have included improving the understanding of health issues in respect of looked-after children, training for foster carers and the engagement of looked-after children in arts, music and drama programmes. I will

<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0801149000008"></a>The Harrier GR9 and the Tornado GR4 are both currently providing invaluable support to our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have signed two contracts on 21 December 2007, appointing BAES as the prime contractor, which will deliver further significant capability upgrades to both the Harrier GR9 and the Tornado GR4. Under the programmes, both aircraft will receive improved secure communications, tactical data links and the Paveway IV precision guided bomb will be integrated on to Tornado. These upgrades will enhance the ability of these aircraft to support future operations by improving survivability, increasing situational awareness and lowering the risk of fratricide and collateral damage. The combined value of the programmes, through life, is &#163;548 million.</p>

<a name="80114-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0801149000011"></a>The Government are today announcing the allocation of an additional &#163;11.5 million to the disabled facilities grant programme for 2007-08. The programme has proved to be highly successful with funding to local authorities more than doubling from &#163;57 million in 1997 to &#163;138 million now. These additional funds for the current year will help assist local authorities in meeting existing demand for the provision of adaptations. A table detailing the additional funds provided to individual authorities has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

Their presence in Germany is governed by the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) of 19 June 1951 and by the supplementary agreement relating to the status of foreign forces in Germany dated 3 August 1959. The two principal British Army units in Germany are 1 (UK) Armoured Division and United Kingdom Support Command (Germany). 1 (UK) Armoured Division's primary task is to prepare force elements and individuals for operations. United Kingdom Support Command (Germany)'s mission is to provide the necessary range of operational, personnel, training and infrastructure support to enable and sustain military capability.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="08011412000021"></a>These units continue to be based in Germany as the UK is committed to its contribution to NATO and co-operation with its allies in the alliance. The UK also benefits from the opportunity to train armoured units in Germany, and to make use of training areas in Eastern Europe, which are less accessible from the UK. With the approval of the German Government, we plan to continue to station two armoured brigades and their supporting units in Germany for the foreseeable future.</p>
