Those with a well founded fear of persecution will be granted asylum.

We recognise that persons who actively display their faith in public may attract adverse attention from the Iranian authorities and we believe that they have an absolute right legally to show their faith publicly. However, we have not found&#151;the COI Service looked into this&#151;that there is systematic persecution of them all. Current case law from the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal concludes that an ordinary convert will not face persecution. The issue of Christian converts was closely considered again as a result of a hearing in May 2008. We will alter our guidance if necessary based on the awaited determination from that study and review.</p>

The data are updated frequently and significant changes in country conditions are communicated quickly to decision-makers. It would be a little over the top if I said that we are absolutely sure all the time that every single bit of evidence is there, but we try to get all the evidence that there is. Indeed, after a debate on this issue in the past few months, we looked carefully at evidence from one noble Lord, which was extremely useful.</p>

The issue is complex. We make absolutely certain in our own minds that people will not be persecuted when they are sent back there, but there are great difficulties in trying to monitor this closely around the world. There is also a danger of putting the person at risk by making them very apparent, but there is a shortfall and I intend to talk to the team in the Home Office to see whether there is any way at all in which we can monitor this. It is difficult, but I will try to do that and I will get back to the noble Lord in writing.</p>

Indeed it is; I was a member of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal until a couple of years ago. It is all right if the person has become a Christian while he is in Iran, but there is a problem with people who become Christian converts as soon as they arrive in the UK. A group of Christians converted some Iranians to Christianity, but as soon as the Iranians&#146; leave to appeal was granted they reverted to their normal religion.</p>

We have to look at this on a case-by-case basis, rather than make a blanket recommendation. The noble Countess is right: sometimes these things change. Someone may come here saying that they need to be in this country because they are a Christian. Then they may say, &#147;Well, it is not that. It is because I am gay and I will be persecuted for that&#148;. Then they may say, &#147;Now I am part of a political organisation&#148;. There is a whole raft of measures. As I said, our caseworkers are well trained to conduct interviews in a professional manner. We have been engaging with religious organisations&#151;for example, the Evangelical Alliance&#151;to make sure that they know the right sort of questions to ask so that we can identify quickly those who really have a reason to be here. Our intention is not to return people who should be protected; it is to return those who should not be.</p>

Perhaps I may get back to the noble Baroness in writing. However, there are detailed statistics relating to this which go up to December 2006. We had issued 12,000 ASBOs,  50 per cent of which were breached. We go through a phase of warnings before we take custodial action. About 63 per cent of those who break an ASBO will end up with a custodial sentence.</p>

To what extent are the Government committed in the acceptable behaviour contracts to putting in resources which identify the problem and seek to deal with it at its heart, perhaps in the family?</p>

The number of ASBOs being used has declined because we are using a number of other tools and powers; for example, written warnings, home visits, acceptable behaviour contracts, and parenting orders and contracts. We have closed crack houses using premises closure orders, which have been very useful, and dispersal zones. We use the anti-social behaviour order only when there is nothing else we can do. It is very interesting that the Home Affairs Select Committee, the Audit Commission and the NAO report have found that 65 per cent of those people who had an intervention 1, a written warning, desist from anti-social behaviour after that; 85 per cent desist after an intervention 2, which is something like a parenting order and a contract; and 93 per cent of people desisted after an intervention 3, which is the ASBO. So it is having a dramatic effect and is making a difference. Admittedly, it leaves the 7 per cent, but very often, those people have each committed something like 31 offences.</p>

Accomplishing the census in May was a welcome milestone. However, the CPA faces significant risks. The recent fighting in Abyei reflects unresolved disagreements. Continued slow progress towards an electoral law may delay national elections beyond 2009. We are fully engaged with both parties, and with international partners, to secure full implementation of the CPA and to try to deliver a peaceful future for the whole of Sudan.</p>

What information does he have about the conflict he referred to in Abyei, a disputed oil-rich territory? The conflict has disrupted emergency efforts to supply food, water and medical supplies to the 50,000 people fleeing from previous conflict in the region, and has displaced a further 90,000 who are now living in hardship and hunger. Can he tell us what urgent measures are being taken to alleviate their suffering, and whether the conflict in Abyei represents a violation of the comprehensive peace agreement? If so, what has been the response of the Assessment and Evaluation Commission and other international organisations which are guarantors of the CPA?</p>

We therefore welcome the new agreement between the NCP in the north and the SPLM in the south to resolve the immediate crisis. Although we do not yet have the full details, the agreement includes a new joint integrated unit involving the militaries of both sides, access for UNMIS, the UN peacekeeping force in the area, and an interim administration for the Abyei area with a proposed new border and what should be an agreement on oil revenue-sharing, together with international arbitration. Additionally, the north has promised over $1 billion for the recovery and rebuilding of Abyei.</p>

Does he also agree that the responsibility to protect is now generally accepted in principle but frequently fails to deliver in practice? While I accept that the Government have made mammoth efforts up to this stage, will they urge on the UN Security Council the need to address the slaughter, disease, displacement, famine and slavery in the area, if necessary by direct international intervention?</p>

All of us who were involved in its development had hoped that Sudan, particularly the Darfur region, would be one of the first places for its effective application. Instead we face continuing conflict throughout Sudan which, as my noble and learned friend rightly observed, humanitarian assistance alone cannot address. The UN Security Council, under the joint leadership of the British ambassador to the council, has just been in Sudan trying to achieve political progress on Abyei and more generally on north/south and Darfur issues. We continue to press for a political solution here because Darfur and Sudan as a whole remains a blot on the collective international conscience.</p>

The statistics paint a sorry picture of reducing access, of seven international NGO workers killed this year, of more than 125 vehicles and trucks stolen, of more than 25 drivers of those trucks still missing, and, as I have said, of less and less access to different parts of Darfur.

Was a distinction made between energy-efficient biofuels made from cane sugar which come from Brazil, and the biofuels produced by corn farmers in America and Europe, which are energy-inefficient and are undermining food prices?

Senior officials who often labour long into the night negotiating for British interests in European fora, some distinguished alumni of which I see in their places today, are similarly aware of that necessity&#151;hence the need for the most effective possible parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08060916000075"></a>Since the Bill was in Committee, the noble Baroness the Leader of the House has engaged in extensive consultations, although not in any sense trying to&#151;perish the thought&#151;nobble committee members. She gave evidence to your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the constitution last week and, since then, has circulated a memorandum on justice and home affairs opt-ins. By the end of last week, she had succeeded in obtaining interdepartmental approval from the relevant government departments. Although, in an ideal world, it would have been convenient for the House to have had sight of the proposals at an earlier stage, as the Select Committee did, noble Lords who have been involved in seeking to achieve interdepartmental approval will recognise the phrase &#147;trying to herd cats&#148;. If I am reincarnated as a cat, there is nobody by whom I should prefer to be herded than the noble Baroness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08060916000076"></a>We look forward to hearing the proposals that the noble Baroness the Leader of the House has brought forward after listening to your Lordships. In the mean time, I beg to move.</p>

I say to the noble Lord that I am a fervent cat lover and, therefore, were he to return as a cat, I can assure him of my best attentions at all times. I agree with him that I was in no way seeking to nobble anyone; rather, I was seeking to listen, to take note and to put forward proposals on the back of the debate in Committee.</p>

<a name="80609-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08060916000078"></a>We have circulated details of the proposals to everyone who has spoken in Committee or on Report so far. I am extremely grateful to the Constitution Committee for enabling me to appear before it last week. I am also grateful to the EU Committee, which met on the back of my initial proposals and gave me helpful feedback. To be complete, I have incorporated into the proposal all suggestions made to me by both committees on how we might enhance that. I do not say this to &#147;herd&#148; them into having to agree with me on everything; I say it to make it clear that I did not stop there but took note of what was put before me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08060916000079"></a>I begin where I left off in Committee. I was struck, as I said to the Constitution Committee, by the fact  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_375"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 375</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that your Lordships were seeking to make sure that the existing scrutiny processes, which we consider to be extremely good, were looked at again in the light of changes that were going to be made to justice and home affairs and that the proper and appropriate role for Parliament and your Lordships&#146; House should also be considered. The original amendment tabled in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, was a serious proposition that the Government thought was worth looking at. We took it away and had a look at what might be feasible, bearing in mind contributions put forward in debate and in consultation with the offices of the Attorney-General, the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Justice, which have endorsed what has come before your Lordships today.</p>

<a name="80609-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08060916000080"></a>I will briefly take your Lordships through the proposal that we have in mind. We begin by taking on board something raised by a number of noble Lords, which is the desire to have a sense of where the Government are going in strategic terms on justice and home affairs and to deal with the issue that I raised in Committee of seeking not to salami-slice all the different opt-ins, making a decision on each one potentially out of context with the others. First, the Government commit to bring forward on an annual basis a report that looks ahead at what the approach to the justice and home affairs policy and forthcoming dossiers would be, including where we know what our position would be on the opt-ins. I say &#147;where we know&#148; because, as I explained in Committee, it is not always possible to know, not least because of the consultations with other departments, stakeholders outside and the devolved Administrations. However, certainly where we do know, we will make it clear.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80609-0003.htm"/>


<a name="80609-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08060916000081"></a>Every year that report would come forward to Parliament and it would be made available for debate in your Lordships&#146; House and another place. It would then form the basis of noble Lords&#146; understanding of the Government&#146;s strategic approach for the year. The European Union Committee would be informed of comments made during those debates, which would help it to understand where your Lordships felt that there were issues that needed to be addressed in greater detail and issues that might be brought forward again. At the end of the year, we would reverse the process and produce a retrospective report that said what we had done, what the application of the protocol for opt-in had been, where we had opted in and where we had not opted in. That way noble Lords would see both ends of the annual spectrum, if I can put it like that.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08060916000082"></a>When it comes to individual dossiers, the Government will put an explanatory memorandum before Parliament as swiftly as possible. We already agree that we would do it within 10 working days. &#147;As swiftly as possible&#148; means that we will endeavour to do it more quickly than that, but the maximum timeframe would be 10 working days. That would set out the proposal and, where possible, specific views as to whether or not the Government thought that it would opt in and the factors that were taken into account in making that decision. The committees in both Houses would then have the opportunity fully to review the proposal and the approach that the Government had taken on whether to opt in.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_376"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 376</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80609-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08060916000083"></a>Let me recap on the opt-in procedure. The Government have precisely 13 weeks from the proposal being given to make the decision whether to opt in. If the Government do not opt in, they cannot participate in the working group discussions, support other colleagues in the European Union or affect what happens in debate on the issue concerned. They have the right, once the decisions have been finally taken, to opt in at the end of the process with the permission of the Council and the Commission, but they will not have been able to participate. Not opting in to a proposition that we might wish to is a serious matter for your Lordships to consider.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08060916000084"></a>Provided that the committee presents its views on what the Government are proposing within 13 weeks, the Government will take into account the committee&#146;s opinion on whether the UK should opt in. During that time, committees can, as now, call a Minister to give evidence and they can make a report to the House. If they wish to make a report to the House recommending a debate, perhaps on a Motion on which there can be a vote, they can do so. In other words, within the timeframe that we have set, the committee can bring to your Lordships&#146; House for debate an issue that it believes is significant and that your Lordships would wish to consider and it can propose to your Lordships that there should be a vote, which the Government would take into account.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08060916000085"></a>In putting forward this proposal, the Government commit that they would find government time for such a debate, which would be agreed, as ever, through the usual channels. As I said, where this is done within eight weeks, we shall seek not to come to a conclusion before that, where possible. However, there is a tiny exception to that. When I looked back at all the different decisions that had been made, I noticed that there was one area in which decisions had been made more quickly, which related to the final text of a readmission agreement. These are often concluded with third states late in the day and concern people being returned to third states. Sometimes these come forward much more quickly to allow signatures to be sought at meetings. However, the committee will be familiar with those situations. Where a need to move more swiftly suddenly arises, we undertake to talk to the committee about how to deal with this procedure in that light. However, I stress that it is exceptionally rare for that to happen. I merely put it on the record for completeness. We shall ensure that we keep the committee fully informed if that were ever likely to happen.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08060916000086"></a>We shall ensure that a Minister is available to appear before the committee. We suggest that this package of measures&#151;comprising the annual reports at the beginning and end of the year, the explanatory memorandum, the guarantee of ministerial appearances, the Government&#146;s promise not to make a decision within the eight weeks, the right of the committee to bring forward debates and the right of your Lordships&#146; House to vote on that&#151;can be reflected in a code of practice. We also believe that, to obtain certainty in your Lordships&#146; House, we should either amend the scrutiny reserve resolution or bring forward a new resolution to sit alongside it. Lest your Lordships fear that we might pull a fast one by putting forward an  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_377"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 377</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>unamendable proposition, the resolution will be able to be amended in your Lordships&#146; House. It would also be voted on in your Lordships&#146; House and in another place. It would incorporate all that I have said, after we have gone into the finer details with the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, and his committee to ensure that we have captured absolutely everything. Your Lordships would then see it and agree to it or amend it to ensure that it was scrutinised. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, proposed that we should review this whole process&#151;it is always good practice to do so&#151;within three years to ensure that it is functioning properly.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08060916000087"></a>That is the process that we have put forward. I shall not say much more about it except to mention that I checked how many opt-in resolutions or proposals we thought there would be over the coming three to five years, bearing in mind the new position. At present the average figure is about 30 to 40 a year. Due to the coming out of and going back into a whole series of measures, your Lordships will be faced with between 50 and 90 opt-in proposals a year. Therefore, I consider that the filter mechanism of the committee determining which should come before your Lordships&#146; House is even more important. I hope that that is helpful to the House.</p>

I thank the noble Baroness the Leader of the House for the tremendous work that she has put in to try to find a way through this. I also thank my noble friend for the work that he and his committee have done. As he rightly said, these are matters of fundamental constitutional change. Therefore, I thought that it might be helpful if I indicated at an early stage the reaction of the Opposition to these proposals. Thanks to the noble Baroness I received at lunchtime today a copy of the proposals, entitled &#147;Statement on JHA Opt-Ins&#148;.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08060916000089"></a>I think that we are very well served by the committees of this House. I therefore pay tribute not only to my noble friend and his Constitution Committee but also to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, and the work of his European Union Committee. Indeed, I had the opportunity of sitting on that committee for a number of years.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08060916000090"></a>We welcome this very important amendment. It takes us to the heart of our relationship with the European Union in general and our entire approach to the treaty. It has never been an easy relationship. Every time I see the noble Lord, Lord Roper, in his seat, I defer to him on the details, but as my noble friend just reminded us, our accession to the then European Economic Community perhaps happened only because 69 Labour MPs&#151;guided personally by the noble Lord, as I recall it&#151;rebelled in one historic vote. Then the small Liberal group in another place stuck to its guns and supported the Heath Government in some very tightly contested divisions on the European Communities Bill. As my own party&#146;s troubles on Maastricht and other matters European proved, it does not necessarily get any easier. None the less, all those stresses and strains are the price we rightly pay for living in a parliamentary democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08060916000091"></a>It is, I suppose, a reflection of our troubled relationship with the European Union that these questions of protocols, opt-ins and opt-outs should arise at all. It is all a far cry from that original unifying vision of the six back in the late 1940s and early 1950s. But as the Union expands, so it must learn to show greater tolerance and flexibility. Indeed, as the noble Baroness the Leader of the House will know, in Clause 6 there are a number of provisions that follow the words:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08060916000251"></a>&#147;A Minister of the Crown may not vote in favour of or otherwise support a decision under any of the following unless Parliamentary approval has been given&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060916000235"></a>All the instances are covered from (a) to (i).</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08060916000092"></a>As I understand it, the noble Lord&#146;s amendment seeks to add to this list. The amendment makes it clear that he and his colleagues are addressing a recommendation from the Constitution Committee to ensure parliamentary approval of the decision to opt-in to any freedom, security and justice provisions. In order for parliamentary approval to be given, a Motion must be moved by a Minister of the Crown that,</p>
<ul><a name="08060916000265"></a>&#147;the House approves Her Majesty&#146;s Government intention to commit the United Kingdom to new obligations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060916000236"></a>I think that that is agreed on all sides. That is the purpose.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08060916000093"></a>We must put all that into context for a moment, as we seek to respond to the very detailed proposals that the noble Baroness has put forward. We are, of course, dealing with red lines. On 18 June 2007, when he was Prime Minister, Tony Blair stated to the Liaison Committee in another place that,</p>
<ul><a name="08060916000266"></a>&#147;we will not agree to give up our ability to control our common law and judicial and police system&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060916000237"></a>What could be simpler than that? As I understand it, this amendment seeks to prevent the Government deciding suddenly, between now and the next election, to completely change their view and to seek to go against that undertaking. But we have a new Prime Minister and new Ministers and we do not know what will happen tomorrow; we may have further people in charge. That is the fundamental constitutional change that we are talking about, together with Schengen.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08060916000094"></a>Let us judge what the noble Baroness is putting forward. I have always taken the view that it is a very good idea always to seek to improve our scrutiny procedures. That must be a given. I commend the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, on his constant attempts to try to make sure that we move forward in our reforms. Here, we have a draft code of practice to ensure that Parliament&#146;s views are fully considered. That is a point that we on these Benches find difficult to accept, because there is no scope for even having the Clause 6 proviso here if the amendment does not form part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08060916000095"></a>I recognise that the noble Baroness is determined, if she possibly can, to avoid any amendment to the Bill, but this is not a fatal amendment; far from it. It does not in any way affect the treaty of Lisbon, but it does affect the way in which we in Parliament approach the serious constitutional changes that may or may not take place if the Government decide to opt in. The noble Baroness the Leader of the House is committing  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_379"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 379</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to table a report in Parliament each year on whether the Government would opt in and&#151;if any views are forthcoming within eight weeks&#151;to take account of any opinions of the committees regarding whether the UK should opt in.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08060916000096"></a>I am always nervous of the phrase &#147;to seek&#148;. I am not going to quote <I>The Scarlet Pimpernel</I>, but to commit to seek to arrange a debate is not as forceful as arranging a debate. It is certainly not as forceful as saying that a debate and parliamentary approval are necessary before a matter can proceed. The final words of the memorandum are very clear; they are a commitment to ensure that Parliament&#146;s views are fully considered.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08060916000097"></a>It has also been my privilege to see the transcript of what the noble Baroness the Leader of the House told the Constitution Committee, which I believe is in draft form at present. I have a copy, and I hope that it will be made available. If I quote the noble Baroness incorrectly, perhaps she will take the opportunity to correct me. Let me quote her first&#151;</p>

I have no idea why the noble Lord has a copy; I do not have one.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08060916000100"></a>The noble Baroness acknowledged, on the idea of a vote, that it would not be binding on the Government. The noble Baroness nods. That is what worries me the most. She goes on to say that the technical answer is that the Government would remain in control of it. The whole procedure is under the control of the Government. Again, the noble Baroness nods. The noble Baroness was then asked whether the Government would feel legally bound by a vote. The noble Baroness said that she would not. Those quotations do not do anything other than remind us that we are dealing with some very important constitutional issues. The amendment is quite simple; it clearly says that if the Government are to proceed to cross a red line, they would need to come to Parliament to seek approval. I remind noble Lords that the words of the amendment are:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08060916000252"></a>&#147;A Minister of the Crown may not commit the United Kingdom to new obligations, or alter the obligations of the United Kingdom ... unless Parliamentary approval has been given&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060916000238"></a>That is the question before this House.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08060916000101"></a>It has been a traditional role of this place, which we prize beyond price, that we hold the Government to account. We are not debating scrutiny so much as parliamentary accountability. It is accountability that the debate turns on. I am afraid that the noble Baroness, for all her valiant attempts to seek to find a way through without amending the Bill, has neglected to give us the opportunity of utilising a crossing of the red line in the same way as we are going to deal with parliamentary control of decisions in Clause 6.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08060916000102"></a>I am reminded that Mr David Heath in the other place, who has some very strong views on this issue, said that we must take seriously the question of parliamentary approval. That is what this debate is all about. Will Parliament be given the opportunity of  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_380"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 380</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>giving approval to a crossing of the red line, and indeed the breaking of a firm commitment by Mr Blair, that we would not in any circumstances give up our ability to control our common law judicial and police system?</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08060916000103"></a>The noble Baroness is to be congratulated on trying to find a way through. I hope that we will be able to resolve today that parliamentary approval will be required if the Government decide to proceed in this direction. Whatever the result of this decision, if it means that the Bill goes back to the other place, the other place will have an opportunity to participate in the debate, which, because of the timetable Motion, it has not yet had the opportunity to do. It is vital that the other place, the elected House, has the same opportunity as we have to express its view on this important amendment, which I hope my noble friend will press to a vote.</p>

<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="08060916000104"></a><a name="80609-0003.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80609-0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08060916000774"></a>Viscount Bledisloe:</b> My Lords, I am a member of Constitution Committee, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, and I have added my name to this amendment. As your Lordships have heard, the noble Baroness the Leader of the House has toiled nobly and valiantly to discuss all the proposals with us. The question is: are the proposals on paper sufficient to enable us not to press the amendment, or should we insist on it? It is obviously right that these proposals do not amount to the totality of the amendment&#151;government proposals in response to amendments seldom do so. But are they sufficient? In my view, they are. The difference is that under the amendment no opt-in could take place without an affirmative resolution of each House. Both Houses would have to decide to opt in, to opt out or to do anything different. Under the noble Baroness&#146;s proposal the Government need only ensure that there is a debate. Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that it is very hard to criticise the noble Baroness for using the words, &#147;seek to arrange the debate&#148;. I am certain that a whole lot of constitutionalists in this House would have stamped their feet loudly if the Government had said that they &#147;would&#148; arrange a debate, because it is not in their gift. The noble Baroness should not be criticised for that, but I leave that on one side.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08060916000105"></a>If both Houses vote no, it is extraordinarily unlikely that it would happen. It would be a brave Government who went ahead and did it none the less. Of course, the other place might vote yes with the Government and this place might vote no. There would be no use of the Parliament Acts; there is no way that the view of the House of Commons can be imposed on your Lordships. So, there would be deadlock. I do not think that the Government can be criticised for saying that that would not be acceptable in the long run. They will consider the views of noble Lords but must have the power, if needs be, to override them. There may be ingenious behind-the-scenes diplomacy where it is badly needed. It would therefore be better if your Lordships did not press the amendment and accepted what the noble Baroness said.</p>

Can she make it absolutely clear that the review is intended to improve detail and the efficiency of the system but that it cannot detract from what is promised in her statement? Subject to that, I suggest your Lordships do not press the amendment.</p>

It would be exactly as the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, just said. I am sure the Minister will confirm that. It seemed likely that people would like to see exactly where we were going. I am a strong supporter of looking at what we have done as well as what we want to do.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08060916000108"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, I would like to put this in context. I will not go all the way back to 1973, although it is sometimes a little hard from these Benches to be accused of inconsistency on these matters. As the noble Lord rightly says, both individuals and parties here represented have been solidly consistent about the European issue during those years. Our approach to this Bill has been that, compared with both the original Act and the amendments to the treaty, it goes further than any other in the direction of strengthening parliamentary accountability. It did so even as it set off, which won favour on our Benches. Along with that commitment to Europe has been an equally strong, consistent support for greater accountability, as my honourable friend David Heath indicated in the other place.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08060916000109"></a>What has impressed us is how the parliamentary process has worked in this Bill&#151;the House should congratulate itself on that. We sought at an early stage bilateral meetings with the Lord President. We expressed a real and serious problem with parliamentary accountability, particularly in this area, and sought movement. At the same time, as the House has heard, she carried out negotiations with both the Constitution Committee and the European Union Committee. Looking at those discussions, again the process has worked. We are not being asked to accept either a pig in a poke or a done deal. We have been able to influence and develop the issue as the Bill has progressed.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08060916000110"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, my approach on this has been to ask how we maximise parliamentary accountability and at the same time maximise the opportunity for European co-operation on real issues that affect real people: crime, people trafficking, drugs and the rest. There is a danger in wanting to belt and brace the parliamentary accountability. A number of noble Lords who have intervened have long experience in government of how we get the parliamentary accountability while Ministers who have responsibilities to make decisions at that moment are able to do so in a reasonable way.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08060916000111"></a>It strikes me that because of what has happened during the passage of the Bill and the approach of the noble Baroness the Lord President, we have reached a point where Parliament now has within its grasp a greater opportunity for accountability on European matters. Of course, there will always be those who say that this does not go far enough and who want more

I should preface my remarks by emphasising to your Lordships that the European Union Select Committee has not taken a position on the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad.</p>

<a name="80609-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08060916000113"></a>I shall comment briefly on the practicality in the eyes of the European Union Select Committee of the scrutiny proposals that we have heard from the noble Baroness the Leader of the House. I am bearing in mind the fact that, in my view, parliamentary accountability is based on good scrutiny. We are grateful for the assurances that we shall receive an Explanatory Memorandum no later than 10 working days after publication of the proposal. It is important that that is strictly adhered to. I shall give the House an example. Sub-Committee F of your Lordships&#146; European Union Select Committee is currently studying a proposal for legislation which the UK would have to opt into if it wished to participate. The Explanatory Memorandum was signed six weeks after the date of the publication, leaving our committee with two weeks in which to examine the proposal. We have to avoid things like that. Eight weeks is a demanding timetable for the Government and Parliament, and we hope that the Government can be sure that we have proper time for examination of these proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08060916000114"></a>If we report within the eight-week period and recommend a debate, we are relying on the usual channels to give time for that debate before the Government opt in. That is not spelt out in so many words in the statement that the noble Baroness the Leader of the House read, and I understand why, but we need to be sure that the usual channels will unfailingly deliver when the situation arises and when called upon to do so. Without that, we cannot do proper scrutiny and this House will not have a chance to give its verdict on a government decision to opt in.</p>

The noble Baroness came to the Constitution Committee&#151;indeed, she invited herself&#151;to explain Her Majesty's Government&#146;s attitude to our amendment and the difficulties it posed. I welcome her initiative. More years ago than I care to remember, I was told that the first rule of Welsh politics was: go to the meeting, be there before the meeting, stay in the meeting and be there at the end of the meeting. That saved me endless trouble. I did not always succeed, but at least it was worth the effort, so I commend my noble friend&#146;s dialogue, which frequently achieves a great deal.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08060916000116"></a>The crucial point is that Her Majesty's Government have made a great deal of the importance of the red lines. The engineer is hoist by his own petard. The

The Government have come a long way to meet our concerns in the Constitution Committee, but I would be the first to concede that they have not come all the way. They have proposed that there will be an opportunity to scrutinise and, importantly, that the Government will take account of the opinions whether to opt in or out.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08060916000117"></a>The European Union Committee will be able to separate the minor items from those of much greater consequence, which will be the kind of matters that I anticipate they will put forward for debate. It will be able to make such a recommendation on those matters to which it attaches significance. The Government will undertake to arrange the debate within the usual conventions, through the usual channels.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08060916000118"></a>Crucially, the Motion, which I surmise will be in the name of the chairman of the European Union Committee, will be amendable. That is of the utmost importance; it will not be a Motion merely to take note, but one that is amendable. Therefore, there will be an opportunity for a Division and, in practice, for the House to approve or not to approve. That is of fundamental importance. Ultimately, it is for the Government to decide. I have furnished myself with a copy of the draft transcript of the conversations that we had in our formal committee meeting. I hope that as it has been referred to, there will be no objection to my doing the same and that it will not embarrass the noble Baroness. She said,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08060916000253"></a>&#147;It would not be binding on the government in the sense that the government&#146;s position would be that in the end a government takes a decision whether to opt in or not. My view is that a government faced with a decision not to opt in would, in a sense, find it extremely difficult to make an alternative decision to that&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060916000239"></a>If she emphasises the colossal embarrassment of going against the views of a committee of either this House or another place, she would do a great service to the House by emphasising the words in the draft, which so far have not been amended. I repeat that I am grateful to her for her efforts. It is the nearest we can get to a formal approval by the House. It would not be the end of the matter.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08060916000119"></a>I want to add one other point. I refer again to the draft transcript, where I sought to press her about the need for some approval to be enshrined in her words. She said,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08060916000254"></a>&#147;I am very happy to look at the wording. I am not trying to wriggle any government out of not listening to parliament. I am very conscious that I equally do not want to mislead you or the House in the word &#145;approval&#146; implying the government would never ignore it. What you are saying, quite reasonably, is that if you have a deadlock in both Houses then governments have to make a decision and time runs out. Can I think about how we can make it sound stronger?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060916000240"></a>I believe that this is as far as we can go. There could be a difference in either House; the elected House or ourselves. At the end of the day, the Government have to govern. It is the nearest we can get, as a signatory to the amendment, to a formal approval. In my view, it is more than scrutiny; it is scrutiny-plus. That is this House&#146;s role and I would be content with that.</p>

<a name="08060916000120"></a><a name="80609-0004.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80609-0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08060916000778"></a>Lord Lyell of Markyate:</b> My Lords, one is debating against the most charming opponent in the Lord President and one has to be deeply persuasive in order to carry the day. But, while I hugely respect the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, and the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, I hope that this is not as far as we can get in the matter. As my noble friend Lord Hunt pointed out&#151;I support his speech as well as the amendment&#151;under Clause 6 there are a number of important occasions where it is necessary for the Government to obtain the approval by a vote in both Houses. Therefore, the concept of obtaining that approval is not something that does not exist or could not be added to.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08060916000121"></a>We are talking about the Lisbon treaty. I have the honour of being a member of your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the Constitution. Our committee issued a report that stated that the treaty was constitutionally acceptable and did not represent a grave danger to the constitution. However, as my noble friend Lord Goodlad pointed out, we were advised that, but for the relevant red lines&#151;the provisions on justice, home affairs, criminal law and associated matters&#151;it would have meant very great constitutional change. So we are discussing matters of very great constitutional importance.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08060916000122"></a>The four red lines supported by Tony Blair and the Labour Government are an essential part of the present Government&#146;s attitude to the treaty&#151;I do not think that they have resiled from them in principle. They involve the possibility of opting out and opting in. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, said, there is no doubt that what the noble Baroness said has increased to a considerable extent our power of scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08060916000123"></a>However, let me give just one example to illustrate the reason for worry. I happen to be a very strong supporter of the jury system. The present Government have made at least two&#151;I think three&#151;concerted efforts through Parliament to truncate the jury system. They were prevented by votes in Parliament. Would they have been prevented by non-binding scrutiny? I beg to suggest that they would not. I see the noble Baroness waving her hands. Obviously, she has a brilliant answer to this and no doubt at some point she will give it. I will wait until we hear what she says when she speaks again. I believe that Parliament should ultimately have control.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08060916000124"></a>It has been said several times that it is for a Government to govern. Yes it is, but they govern if they have the support of Parliament. If they lose the support of Parliament, their entitlement to govern either in general or in particular should be either removed or truncated. It should be controlled in relation to these extremely important opt-ins and opt-outs. It is said that that is in practice very difficult; of course I defer to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, who has wisely warned the House that it is extremely important to keep to the extraordinarily tight timetable.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08060916000125"></a>However&#151;I welcome this&#151;as the noble Baroness has said that what the Government plan to do will be the result of a report at the beginning of the year, if they plan to make some significant amendment to justice and home affairs matters, why do they not tell us then and arrange to get approval in advance&#151;or at  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_385"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 385</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>least arrange to get the debate going and get approval during the relevant eight weeks of the negotiation? It does not all have to be rushed ahead. If we were talking about small technical details, it might be very difficult. When I first heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Quin, that there were about 50 to 90 a year, or 400 overall, I began to think that this was a serious problem, but actually they would be packaged and the big issues would be identified in advance. Consequently, that is in no way insuperable. Indeed, it would be in the best parliamentary traditions to announce them in advance and obtain approval within a reasonable time. For those reasons, the amendment, as originally tabled by the Constitution Committee and before your Lordships today, is reasonable, sensible and in no sense extreme. I am not, as I think will be well known, a Eurosceptic. That will cause displeasure among some, but I am a great believer in the support of our fundamental constitutional rights, and it is important that we should defend them today.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08060916000127"></a>From my parliamentary experience, the best possible Report stage of a Bill genuinely reflects the deliberations in Committee and consequently tries to address the issues that have arisen there. The process in Committee and between Committee and now is in the best possible tradition of a Committee-cum-Report stage. It is not only for the Minister to reflect on and address the issues, but for those of us who have spoken and who have argued the case, as I did in Committee, for the amendment. We must reflect on what we know. Do we know anything different? Do we know better? Do we need to adjust our position as a result of knowledge or experience gathered since?</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08060916000128"></a>I therefore draw the attention of the House to a couple of things that are influencing my thinking and my position. First, I frankly confess, although I am sure the vast majority of Members here today are not in my state of ignorance, that I did not fully appreciate the nature and number of these opt-in, opt-out decisions. Apparently they are nothing new. I have the list here. Since 2000, some 56 decisions have been taken to opt in and opt out.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08060916000129"></a>I had the view, like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, that there were just three or four major issues on which we should focus and on which we should ensure that Parliament could decide. The truth is that this whole curious process, which I had not fully appreciated, is very different in character and content. There is a variety of opt-ins and opt-outs, many of them routine, technical or constitutional. It is therefore not feasible, as our committee originally suggested, that every opt-in and opt-out that the Government bring up can or should be subject to a parliamentary vote of approval. In one sense, therefore, the amendment does not make provision for the difference between the variety of opt-ins and opt-outs that are routine and technical and the select number that may or may not come before the House and that give rise to serious issues of sovereignty and parliamentary accountability.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_386"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 386</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80609-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08060916000130"></a>That was my revision. I now understand rather more about this opt-in, opt-out procedure. I therefore welcome the Minister&#146;s concept of an annual report, because frankly most of the opt-ins and opt-outs passed me by, and as a long-standing Eurosceptic I have tended to watch these things rather vigilantly. I have a track record that goes back to voting for a general election before the 1972 Act ever came into force. I also have a track record, as Members opposite will know, on Maastricht; I belonged to a minority in the other House on the Maastricht treaty. I therefore address this issue as a Eurosceptic, but I genuinely do not think that it is feasible or possible for the House to consider and approve every opt-in and opt-out that comes before us. That is why there must be a fundamental filtering system that is run by our European scrutiny committee.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08060916000131"></a>Once we have had that scrutiny and our scrutiny committee has, I hope, identified serious issues with serious consequences that carry issues of sovereignty, the question is: what should be the procedure of the House? I do not believe that scrutiny for its own sake makes any sense. The whole idea is that it should inform the House so that it can make a better decision. But the House has to have the right to make a decision. Does my noble friend&#146;s proposal make that possible? I understand why she has rejected an affirmative resolution procedure as exists in Clause 6. I assume it exists in Clause 6 because that clause deals, in passerelles and simplified procedures, with amendments to the treaties themselves. It is a treaty-amending process and, presumably, has a dimension of its own. I am very encouraged that my noble friend and others have included those provisions so that we cannot be bounced into treaty changes without the full knowledge and, indeed, the pre-knowledge, of both Houses.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08060916000132"></a>Since that case has been made, should that procedure be applied to opt-ins and opt-outs? Opt-ins and opt-outs are matters of important public policy&#151;for example, law and order, justice and home affairs&#151;which governments should bring to the people and to both Houses. Like the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, on reflection, I do not support the principle that this House should have a unilateral veto over such procedures, which is what we have recommended until now. They are matters of public policy and the view of the other place should prevail if there is a difference. Therefore, I do not think that I can support a total old-fashioned affirmative resolution procedure, which puts in the possession of this House a veto over opt-ins and opt-outs.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08060916000133"></a>I am waiting for my noble friend to clarify further the process by which noble Lords at least will have the right to test the opinion of the House and to express an opinion in the House. I believe that that will be built into my noble friend&#146;s provisions and will be made available to the House. If the committee recommends that this issue is of sufficient importance, we are guaranteed two things in this code of conduct; first, that the matter will come before the House and, secondly, that it will be brought before the House in such a manner and way that it can be voted on and amended if need be. That means that this House   


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_387"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 387</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would have the right to express its opinion on any issue of consequence that the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, and his committee might bring to our attention.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08060916000134"></a>In this provision, we have at least the guarantee that noble Lords will be able to test the opinion of this House on a serious issue of opt-ins and opt-outs, and to vote on it. Therefore, I do not believe we should demand that further step and say that we should have a veto over such a proposal, especially if the other place goes another way. We are not just looking at issues of scrutiny. We are looking at scrutiny-plus, as my noble and learned friend Lord Morris suggested.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08060916000135"></a>Another of my concerns and why, initially, one may have looked at putting a provision in the Bill and, therefore, enshrining it in statute is the concept of a code of conduct. Codes of conduct do not have the same binding force, et cetera, as a clause in a Bill or a section of an Act. But my noble friend again has come a long way to what members of the Constitution Committee pressed her on when she came before us last week; namely, that a code of conduct should be embedded by parliamentary procedure to ensure that it cannot be unilaterally changed or altered by this Government or future Governments. If it has to be changed, the Government should have to come back to this House and the other place and seek to amend it properly. That provision was not in the original draft. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Norton, proposed it specifically and the rest of us supported it. If the code of conduct was embedded in the process, it would give an extra assurance to both Houses that no Government could change or alter the process without agreement.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08060916000136"></a>It is not feasible for this House to deal with every opt-in and opt-out that comes before us, but given a proper degree of scrutiny, a process by which the opinion of this House can be tested and voted upon and therefore exercised, and the embedding process that will ensure that this code of conduct can and will be truly accountable in parliamentary terms, I feel that I can support my noble friend&#146;s proposals. In Committee, I gently suggested to her that the kind of proposal that was in our amendment, and is now in her proposal, chimed in with the Government&#146;s attempt to bring constitutional renewal. We are doing so many other things to improve parliamentary accountability. I believe that my noble friend&#146;s recommendation chimes in with, and is part and parcel of, a process of parliamentary accountability. As someone who has been around in one way or another since 1966, and has seen parliamentary accountability wane and wax under governments of all complexions, I believe that, with this and a number of other suggestions, we are enhancing our parliamentary accountability. For that reason, I shall be supporting my noble friend.</p>

I have the privilege of being a member of the Constitution Committee. I take that responsibility very seriously. As a newcomer, I was deeply impressed by the way the process occurred,

As far as I know, this was a novel way of meeting and addressing that difficulty. As such, it would be desirable for it to have sympathetic and helpful consideration by this House. I am satisfied that it provides the protection that we need in regard to these opt-ins and opt-outs, which are not part of the everyday diet of this House. I see it as a way of achieving the same result, with deference to what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said, as would be obtained by the proposed amendment that was the initial way in which the Committee sought to safeguard what we are all concerned to protect. Like some, but not all, members of the Committee, I urge the House to accept this novel initiative.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08060916000139"></a>I sought to press the Lord President on one matter of which I am very conscious. As we are dealing with questions that go to the heart of the concerns of the judiciary, there should be some indication of how the judiciary would be consulted about this immediate and quick process. So far, the Lord President has not found a way of accepting the suggestion I made, but I ask her to give it further consideration. It may be that there was no opportunity for her to do so in the time available, but if I may say so, the particular opt-ins I am talking about are of great importance to the judiciary. In the future it will not be possible for the Lord Chief Justice of the day to get in a taxi, come here and address your Lordships directly, which could have happened before, and I respectfully suggest that this concern needs to be taken into account. If the Lord President would find a way of doing that, I think that the judiciary would be most grateful.</p>

As she will know, as well as the reference in the report of the Constitution Committee, paragraph 6.275 of the report on the Lisbon treaty by the European Union Committee, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, draws attention to the lack so far of any systematic scrutiny of opt-ins or opt-outs in the House and suggests that there is a need for us to work on that. We should congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, and the Constitution Committee on tabling the amendment, because we have been able to move far faster on this as a result of that and of the consequent concentration of minds than we might otherwise have expected. We now have a set of proposals before the House, although we do not have the important scrutiny reserve resolution that we will see at a subsequent stage.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08060916000141"></a>I take a different view from that of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, in that I see an important difference between these instruments and the passerelles. These instruments are of a special kind, on which the United Kingdom has to decide whether to opt in or  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_389"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 389</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>opt out, but they are much closer to other instruments that come before the scrutiny committee. Here I agree strongly with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris, that we want a scrutiny-plus system, as we have established here, rather than something that runs in parallel with the passerelle system, the Clause 6 provisions. It is important that we should be able to carry out scrutiny within this period of six weeks, then two weeks and 10 days, which would give us up to eight weeks, and then have an opportunity, if the European Union Committee felt it appropriate, to bring to the House the instrument that could be opted in to.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08060916000142"></a>I suppose that there could be occasions on which the Government would announce that they were not going to opt in, but the committee felt that noble Lords ought to be given an opportunity to consider whether or not they would want to recommend that course. The thing could work in more than one way in a debate. As the noble Baroness said in introducing her proposals, what is important is that almost every debate from the European Union Committee comes to the House on a Motion to take note&#151;that is, the Motion is not amendable. This would be scrutiny-plus because, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris, pointed out, it makes it absolutely clear that these would be amendable take-note Motions. It would be up to Members of the House&#151;not the committee&#151;if they so wished to table an amendment so that the House could express its view; indeed, that would be similar to the provision in another place. It would be surprising if, in those circumstances, when either or both Houses had expressed a clear view against a particular position, the Government would go ahead with it. Technically, the Government would not be bound, but there would be a significant political constraint. I believe, therefore, that we have found a satisfactory solution to this.</p>

<a name="80609-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08060916000143"></a>I end by thanking the Leader of the House for the amount of time that she has spent with her officials on finding the solution. We are anxious to see the scrutiny reserve resolution and we note that it is to be amendable, so if we are not satisfied it will be possible to have a further debate and, indeed, to make a change. In the mean time, I believe that we have a satisfactory solution and that it is therefore not necessary to support the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08060916000146"></a>I have only a few comments to make and will not detain your Lordships. The whole debate has gone from tiny details to huge issues. We were told that the British Government would die in the ditch for the red lines. I have always believed that to be so. Why, therefore, are the Government afraid of presenting their views on a situation in which we would want to opt in? Why are they afraid of presenting their views to both Houses of Parliament for debate, as is the normal procedure for debates in this House and as is the normal procedure for any government proposal in the Queen&#146;s Speech? This is the old, time-tested formula that has been in existence for centuries.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08060916000147"></a>I do not buy into the suggestion that, if we did not grasp something that came out of Brussels and go for it within eight or 10 weeks, we would be doomed for ever. That message is coming out from those who do not want to support the admirable proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad. I also do not buy into the view that a review in three years&#146; time is a great thing and utterly praiseworthy. By that time, we will have absolutely no hope whatever of changing anything. We can review, but the purpose of a review, particularly in business, is to ensure that we do not make the same mistakes again. By that time, there would be nothing to make a mistake about. I do not buy into that idea.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08060916000148"></a>This is not about dealing with between 50 to 90 opt-ins. We are dealing with just those on the justice and home affairs issues that are fundamental to our constitution. We are not dealing with anything to do with the size of this, the price of that or the length of the other; this is fundamental to our constitution, so we should not bypass Parliament and the normal procedures of scrutiny and debate. I come unstuck with what some speakers have already said because we are not talking about the House of Lords saying, &#147;You cannot do this&#148;; we are talking about the normal procedure. We would, as we always do, ask the Government to review something, the matter would go back to the House of Commons and we would know where the final decision would be made. I really want us to think clearly about this issue. We should think not about the 50 to 90 opt-ins or opt-outs, but about what we are doing to our long-term jurisdiction as parliamentarians.</p>

Much of what has happened in justice and home affairs has been a response to the ease of travel between here and the Continent because of, for example, the invention of the aircraft; I think that the noble Baroness has some familiarity with the airline industry. Are we not partly dealing with adaptation to the revolution that is globalisation and Europeanisation, in which the noble Baroness has the opportunity, as we all have, to travel easily between Britain and the Continent, as do many other people who are not so law-abiding?</p>

We have these sorts of discussions. The reality is that that is the way in which law evolves. This is something completely new and obviously we need parliamentary scrutiny even more so than on something that has been around for generations.</p>

<p><a name="st_71"></a>

On this issue, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, and the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, are on the other extreme of arguments from me, although perhaps the use of the word &#147;extreme&#148; in relation to a moderate body such as the Constitution Committee is not appropriate. There is a spectrum of views in the committee. The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, rightly referred to the fact that we are speaking as individuals in this debate.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08060916000152"></a>I warmly endorse the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, particularly in reminding us that parliamentary involvement in European affairs will be greatly improved overall by this treaty. That is particularly true with regard to justice and home affairs, where national parliaments across Europe&#151;not just here&#151;will have a more prominent role in JHA co-operation through the subsidiarity mechanism, through evaluating Eurojust&#146;s work and through greater scrutiny of Europol, as well as through a power to veto moves from unanimity to QMV in certain key areas. I believe that the arrangements that have been outlined for the Houses of Parliament in this country represent a considerable improvement on what has gone before. That is an important context within which we should view the current debate.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08060916000153"></a>In Committee, the view was frequently expressed that we should be careful about Governments trying to sneak important things through without Parliament being aware of them in the area of justice and home affairs. Indeed, my noble friend the Leader of the House referred to this when she used the phrase, &#147;pull a fast one&#148;. Other noble Lords have referred to this concern. I am not sure that there has ever been a real danger of that happening. In my own fairly brief experience as a Home Office Minister, when I regularly attended Justice and Home Affairs Councils, I was not aware of major decisions being made that were not brought to the attention of Parliament or on which we did not have a good idea of what Parliament&#146;s views were. I am not making a party-political point because I am not aware of previous Governments operating in that way in the European sphere, either.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08060916000154"></a>However, the additional changes that the Leader of the House has outlined are welcome, particularly the proposals for a report to allow both Houses to give a strategic overview of justice and home affairs, the reporting-back mechanism, whereby we can review more effectively what has happened in this area, and the timetable for specific proposals on opt-ins. A number of speakers have already referred to the fact that there can be a large number of opt-ins. My noble friend Lord Rowlands rightly said that the aim was not to give Parliament a cumbersome system that meant examining all kinds of minor proposals that, through the normal scrutiny process, would have been deemed  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_392"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 392</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be acceptable in any case. However, the procedure that the amendment envisages would be applicable in any possible consideration of opt-ins and so would give Parliament a cumbersome procedure. I believe that the arrangements that the Leader of the House has outlined are a great improvement on the ones envisaged in the amendment. I hope that the compromise that is on offer will be grasped with enthusiasm by Members of your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08060916000155"></a>I conclude by saying that, although I did not support the amendment in the Constitution Committee and do not feel as strongly on this issue as others do, I recognise that the pressure exerted by the committee has resulted in real change. For that reason, I pay tribute to the committee and its members.</p>

I have heard no wholly convincing argument for rejecting the proposal of my noble friend Lord Goodlad on parliamentary approval. The only alternative is the suggestion made by the noble Baroness the Leader of the House. In principle, if there were nothing else, I would of course accept that. However, there is something else. There is no real justification for choosing what the noble Baroness has said and rejecting the amendment. I hope that your Lordships will support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08060916000158"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris, said that this was not scrutiny but scrutiny-plus. I profoundly disagree. Over the next moment or two, I shall speak on the whole spectrum of parliamentary scrutiny. The proposal is clearly second-class scrutiny. Let us look at other forms of parliamentary scrutiny. Some statutory instruments are subject to affirmative resolution. Parliament is faced with 150 to 200 of those statutory instruments, which the Minster is not allowed to sign and turn into law unless there is a positive, affirmative resolution by both Houses.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08060916000159"></a>The proposal of the noble Baroness the Leader of the House denies that procedure to issues of opt-ins and opt-outs. Opt-ins are significantly the more important, so I hope that the noble Baroness will explain, when she responds, why there should be an inferior form of scrutiny for them. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, said, there are issues here that go to the heart of the judiciary. They are of huge importance. Many of those 150 to 200 statutory instruments are of infinitely less importance. They often go through both Houses on the nod, without debate, but must also be approved by both Houses in a debate.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08060916000160"></a>I ask the House to consider carefully whether it is wise, when we can equalise the level of scrutiny between statutory instruments and this issue, to give a future

As its chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, reminded us earlier today, that committee has not taken a common stance on the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08060916000164"></a>I profoundly disagree with the remarks that we have just heard from the noble Lord, Lord Jopling. Not all statutory instruments are subject to affirmative resolution. Not all matters that will be subject to opt-ins will be of profound importance; some of them may be quite unimportant. What is attractive about the procedure that has been advanced by the Lord President and was considered by the Select Committee is the possibility that scrutiny-plus will allow that committee to take into consideration the seriousness and the priorities of the issues and to table a Motion that will be amendable. Amendable Motions go beyond the normal scrutiny of statutory instruments, which are usually either rejected or affirmed. This seems to me a more sophisticated form of parliamentary scrutiny than what we have enjoyed before. For that, it is welcome.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08060916000165"></a>I congratulate the Constitution Committee on raising this issue. I do not find it surprising that it should have put forward a proposal that is on the surface in line with the provisions of Clause 6 of the Bill. However, it has to be acknowledged that the matters covered by Clause 6 are very different in kind from those that will be considered under the opt-in or opt-out arrangements that relate to justice and home affairs. The Clause 6 provisions, which provide specifically for a new form of control over the negotiating authority of the Government, are a new, almost revolutionary form of ex ante control and relate to the decision-making process of the European Union. They do not relate to substantive issues of policy, which are normally allowed in our parliamentary democracy to be matters for the Executive, subject, of course, to the approval of Parliament. The superficial similarity of treatment between the provisions of Clause 6 and the proposals in the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, and his colleagues can quickly be seen to be inapposite, because what is at stake in the case of the passerelle or different methods of decision-making can have a long-lasting effect on a wide range of issues. The matters that are covered by the opt-in and opt-out are precise, specific and eminently to be considered and decided by the Executive, subject to the approval of Parliament. It is wrong to erect such&#151;</p>

It is clear that the forthcoming Motions would be amendable and could be considered by this House, following consideration by the Select Committee. As I said, that seems to me a more sophisticated approach, enabling this House to take a balanced view on the importance of the issue before it. That view may be affected&#151;as it should be&#151;by the consideration that the opportunity to make a move may not necessarily recur quickly, which is something that the Government may be well placed to recognise in their continuing negotiations.</p>

It has not been an occasion on which positions have been taken up that are fortified by party allegiances or even stem from party allegiances; it has been a debate in which views have been advanced and modified. I suggest with great humility to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that he should modify the view that he expressed by listening to the views expressed by several members of his committee, which I believe were profoundly persuasive. I refer to the views of the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris. It seems to me that the House has moved forward since that important report was produced and has acknowledged the strength of the argument advanced by the noble Baroness the Leader of the House, which I hope will win the day.</p>

I have never heard so many weasel words being used&#151;inform, concede, consult, listen, debate, vote and take into account. I hope that what we are discussing today is not parliamentary consultation and influence but parliamentary control over the Government. I say that for two big reasons. First, I was lucky enough to be a member of the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, and I am now a member of the committee chaired by my noble friend Lord Jopling. How often have we seen that great phrase &#147;scrutiny override&#148; used? What is the reason for that? It is not so much that Ministers are ill intentioned but that they are often powerless.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08060916000172"></a>In her elegant and plausible introduction to the Government&#146;s policy the Leader of the House made an analogous argument to that on the scrutiny of policy. Yet, as we have seen from this debate this afternoon, at European level there are two separate issues for consideration: policy and competence. Competence is a different question from policy. One could describe our discussion in shorthand terms as concerning red lines and whether to cross them. I wish to make clear that I am not a Eurosceptic and I have no trouble with crossing red lines if it is in the national interest to do so. However, in the context of competence and red lines, we are talking about Parliament&#146;s authority. In the context of whether parliamentary authority should be granted, I believe that Parliament and not the Government should be in charge. If too many proposals come before Parliament for it easily to handle, it is for Parliament to change its rules in order to be able to deal with them. This particular cart and horse should be that way round.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08060916000173"></a>We have heard a lot about accountability but I do not believe this is about that; it is about authority. The citizens of this country understand the distinction between accountability and authority and expect it to be understood and included in the Bill.</p>

I see the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, nodding. I apologise to my noble friend but I did get that sense.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08060916000177"></a>I am extremely grateful to everybody who has spoken. It is wonderful to see some people who I have not seen for a while. I promised myself that I would tell the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd-Webber, that I enjoyed &#147;American Idol&#148;, in which he featured. I am a huge fan of the programme and I think that the right guy won. The noble Lord will know what I mean by that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08060916000178"></a>At the beginning I said something about the transcript and that I was slightly shocked. I was shocked because I understood that the process normally adhered to is that members of the committee receive the uncorrected transcript, but normally the witness receives it as well and has a chance to comment. I had not seen it until after the noble Lord, Lord Hunt Wirral, who is not on the committee, had made reference to it. I do not know how the noble Lord got a copy of it, and I have tried to find out exactly why I did not get one. I have no objection to the noble Lord having a copy, but if I looked startled, that was what it was about. I hope to get an answer to that today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08060916000179"></a>I want to explore the myth that this 13-week timetable may be infinitely moveable, flexible or is somehow known about long before the proposals come forward. Although we may know in general terms where proposals might be coming forward, it is my personal experience&#151;and probably that of other noble Lords who have been in the same position&#151;that until the proposal is received on the first day of the 13 weeks, one is not sure exactly what is in the proposal and or what the position should be. I would not want that to be misunderstood. Equally, like other Governments, we believe very strongly in consulting properly on what is in those proposals. Indeed, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, will remember that he chaired meetings at the Bank of England for me on Rome I when we were looking at the proposals. So it is a very tight timetable and that is one of the factors that I have tried to take into account.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08060916000180"></a>I am extremely pleased that noble Lords have thanked me for my contribution to the Constitution Committee. It was a great privilege to appear before the committee. I am delighted that of the four people who have put down their names to move this amendment, three have already indicated that they are satisfied with what I did. I accept that everyone is speaking in a personal capacity but I hope that the House will take note of that.</p>

<a name="80609-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08060916000181"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, said that we must be absolutely sure that we cannot go backwards in a review. That will be written into the procedure to make sure that that could not happen. The review is intended to refine and move forward, not to dig up what is agreed in this process.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80609-0006.htm"/>


<a name="80609-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08060916000182"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, wanted to ensure that there is a guarantee of a debate and not just the usual channels and so forth. We will write that in to the scrutiny. I know that the usual channels will be comfortable with that and we will find a form of words. As I indicated, I think that the best way forward is to put alongside this a separate scrutiny reserve resolution that your Lordships will see again, debate and vote on in full before it is approved. That should be drawn up in conjunction with the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell. It will be drawn up with Mr Connarty in another place so that it is absolutely clear that the procedures of each House will be fully adhered to. The promises and commitments that I have made will also be adhered to. That will be amendable in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="80609-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08060916000183"></a>In response to my noble and learned friend Lord Morris of Aberavon, the vote on the proposals that might come out of the committee would also be an amendable resolution. It is not the equivalent of a statutory instrument, which I know is one of the concerns of noble Lords. I talked in the committee about the difficulties of a vote in both Houses leading to a deadlock, not least because of the 13-week timetable. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, is right&#151;some of these issues are minor and technical, some of them are more substantive. Although I know that in my conversations with noble Lords the focus has been about whether the Government choose to opt in, it is also important to look at whether they choose to come out of something. That is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08060916000184"></a>It may well be that the day would come when a committee of your Lordships&#146; House felt that it was important that the House debated and voted on whether the Government should pull out of something, in the interests of this country. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, was concerned that these might come in packages. It has never been my experience that they come in packages, and even if we had them coming one on one, they are all separate legal instruments that must be debated under the proposal and voted on individually. It is not a case of packaging it all together; they would have to be taken separately. As I have already indicated, we do not always know at the beginning of a year exactly what will be forthcoming, but we can set out our strategy and our view on the issues that we know will be coming up.</p>

<a name="80609-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08060916000185"></a>I say to my noble friend Lord Rowlands that what my noble friend said in Committee about not necessarily being aware of all the issues around justice and home affairs and the opt-ins led to the proposal for an annual report at the beginning and an annual review at the end. It is entirely down to what he said that that will happen. I am delighted that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, is satisfied. I am looking at the judiciary. I do not have to have it for this process, but I have taken it on board and I have fed it in, as the noble and learned Lord would expect. I promise to come back to him on that.</p>

<a name="80609-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08060916000186"></a>A number of noble Lords, not least the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, have asked about the  13 weeks, which is a very strict deadline. After 91 days, if you are not in the proposal, you are not participating in the discussions and debates. You are not in the working groups, you are not influencing the decisions and you are not supporting other member states that would find it incredibly valuable to have the UK on-side. You are not amending the proposal, which may be fine, but which you may like to see made stronger. You are not there, and you are certainly not being allowed to speak in the discussions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council on the issue, because you are not part of it.</p>

<a name="80609-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08060916000187"></a>When the process is complete, we could, if we wish, seek permission from the Commission and the Council to join the proposal, and that may well be forthcoming. However, it would be on a proposal that we would have had no say in, which we may have initially thought was in the interests of the UK, but which could be made stronger. That is an important point&#151;</p>

If, as she appears to be arguing, we are going to, in effect, deny the other place the opportunity to look at this issue again, we need to be absolutely clear about what she is proposing. The proposal makes an exception. It says that where an earlier opt-in decision is necessary, those rules will not apply. In fact, it will be in the Government&#146;s gift to say, &#147;I am sorry, we have overridden that particular opt-in opportunity&#148;. Does that fit in with the detail of the timetable that she is talking about?</p>

I checked, and the Home Office has overridden scrutiny only once in the past year. There is a procedure whereby, when one is looking for readmission agreements with third countries&#151;to return third country nationals from the European Union&#151;there have been occasions when the signatories needed for the countries to agree that they are going to send back third country nationals have taken place within six weeks. That has led to a quicker process. That is the only example that I could find, and I raise it specifically to make it clear that there could be exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08060916000190"></a>When we look at the scrutiny or reserve resolution that we put before your Lordships&#146; House, we will have had time by then to discuss with the EU Committee how it wishes us to handle it. I do not want to pretend that it has never happened, because it has. There were a specific set of circumstances in which it did happen. Therefore, I cannot pretend that it may never happen again. Such an agreement might come forward, and we will find a way of dealing with that.</p>

<a name="80609-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08060916000191"></a>The noble Lord is right to raise the &#147;weasel word&#148; point made by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford; whether there is anything that is weaselly in any attempt to say that there will never be such circumstances or that the Government could say, &#147;Actually, there are 20 times when that would happen&#148;. Hence, my being very precise about it. We will make sure that we cover that in the resolution. It will come back to your Lordships&#146; House, it will be amendable, and noble Lords will be able to vote on it.</p>

<a name="80609-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08060916000192"></a>I cannot say that it will never happen, but it will be extremely exceptional. We will find a process of dealing with it that does not take away from the committee the opportunity to consider it, bearing in mind that that will be the timetable. I hope that that will help the noble Lord. Alan Clark&#146;s diaries are very good but I do not see them as an authority on this issue. I would rather go on my own experiences of the European Union and, in particular, of the Justice and Home Affairs Council.</p>

<a name="80609-0006.htm_para9"></a>

I do not know what the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, will do&#151;we are in his hands&#151;but I am grateful that the other three noble Lords who added their names have thus far indicated that I have done enough to demonstrate the Government&#146;s commitment to ensure that Parliament has a proper place in this.</p>

<a name="80609-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08060916000196"></a>My view&#151;I speak purely for myself; other members of the Constitution Committee have expressed their own views&#151;is that the constitution should be clarified in the Bill. We heard the commitments that the noble Baroness made on behalf of the Government and the aspirations that she expressed; some of them were inchoate but no doubt they can be clarified. As I mentioned, many noble Lords have worked in the vineyards of the hustings, in Parliament and elsewhere over many years to support the cause of Britain in Europe, and many public officials, some of whose alumni are in their places today, have sat up late at night negotiating on Britain&#146;s behalf. All are equally aware of the necessity of maintaining public confidence.</p>

<a name="80609-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08060916000197"></a>It is preferable that provision for parliamentary scrutiny is in the Bill, and in my view the best shot so far as been in the terms of the amendment. If that is not the case, it can be returned to at Third Reading. Such has been the widespread support for that view in this House that it is within our traditions that the opinion of the House should be sought.</p>

The Eurosceptic movement in this country often quotes one of its principal declarations, to condemn the project of the European Union. That declaration states:</p>
<ul><a name="08060916000267"></a>&#147;no foreign prince, person, prelate, state or potentate hath or ought to have any jurisdiction, power, superiority, pre-eminence or authority, ecclesiastical or spiritual, within this realm&#148;.</ul>

Bagehot held that the sovereign had three principal rights or powers: to be consulted, to encourage and to warn. Inherent in those three rights is of course a fourth: the right to be informed. As I understand it, that is still the generally accepted position today and is reflected in the Prime Minister of the day&#146;s weekly private audience with Her Majesty.</p>

<a name="80609-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08060916000208"></a>I think that it is also generally accepted that the Queen has one further duty, which is to maintain a Government. One thinks here of a possible hung Parliament and the situation that arose in 1974.</p>

<a name="80609-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08060916000209"></a>There are two other vital aspects of our unwritten constitution. One is that the Queen acts on the advice of her Ministers. The other is that in her Coronation Oath, the Queen promised to govern us and the Commonwealth according to our respective laws and customs. Many feel that those two aspects have been growing steadily more uncomfortable with each other since we joined the European Community in 1972, but that they may be brought into irreconcilable conflict by the treaty of Lisbon and as the European Union develops the powers that it will receive under that treaty.</p>

<a name="80609-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08060916000210"></a>The first of those positions&#151;that the Queen acts on the advice of her Ministers&#151;is well put in the letter that Buckingham Palace is currently sending out to the large number of people who are writing to the Queen asking her to withhold her consent from the Lisbon Bill, unless it has first been supported in a referendum of the people. I cite the relevant passage from that letter:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08060916000261"></a>&#147;Policy on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union and the strengthening of relations between Member States is entirely a matter for the Queen&#146;s Ministers and not one in which it would be constitutionally appropriate for Her Majesty to intervene&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060916000242"></a>The possible conflict between that tradition and the Queen's Coronation Oath turns on the interpretation of what are &#147;our respective customs&#148;. There are those&#151;I imagine that the Government are among them&#151;who hold that our respective customs include the custom that the Queen acts on the advice of Ministers, whatever it is and from wherever it comes. That is the end of the discussion as far as those who adhere to that position are concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08060916000211"></a>Many do not agree&#151;mostly in our Eurosceptic movement, of course, which now comprises a majority of the British people. They point out that, at the time of her Coronation Oath, the advice that Ministers gave to the Queen was unfettered by our membership of the European Union. They suggest that the British  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_404"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 404</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people&#146;s most important custom was that they elected and dismissed all those who made their laws. They say that that is still our most fundamental custom.</p>

<a name="80609-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08060916000212"></a>However, we have now reached the point where a majority of our national law is imposed by Brussels, on much of which the Government of the day can be outvoted and for which the House of Commons and your Lordships' House have become irrelevant. They fear that that situation will become worse under the Lisbon treaty, which grants the EU its own legal personality superior to that of the member states. They ask: who is and who will be really giving advice to the monarch? Is it her Ministers, or have they become merely the mouthpiece for much of what they propose? They also ask such questions as where the new EU president will leave the position of the sovereign as his role evolves. Will he come to receive ambassadors and sign treaties on behalf of the European Union with its new legal personality? Who will take precedence if the Queen visits the institutions of the European Union? These are the sorts of questions that the report requested by the amendment should seek to answer. We expect the amendment to be supported on all sides of the House. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="08060916000213"></a><a name="80609-0007.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80609-0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08060916000806"></a>Lord Dykes:</b> My Lords, perhaps the amendment is not really necessary after all and should not take too much of your Lordships&#146; time, particularly after the previous substantial debate. One comes back to the origins of the text, which for good Europeans is sacred. Article 3a(2) of the treaty of Lisbon reminds us:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="08060916000262"></a>&#147;The Union shall respect the equality of Member States before the Treaties as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional, inclusive of regional and local self-government. It shall respect their essential State functions, including ensuring the territorial integrity of the State&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060916000243"></a>Article 3b states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="08060916000263"></a>&#147;The limits of Union competences are governed by the principle of conferral. The use of Union competences is governed by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060916000244"></a>Furthermore, Article 2(6) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="08060916000264"></a>&#147;The Union shall pursue its objectives by appropriate means commensurate with the competences which are conferred upon it in the Treaties&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80609-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08060916000214"></a>These are sovereign countries&#151;positive Europeans working together agreeably more closely, as envisaged by the founding fathers, although they were not aware of the future details. We have seen how this has evolved gradually as a process: sovereign countries remaining national sovereign entities and in no way reduced by any co-operation between them on signing the series of international European treaties that brought together the previous two principal treaties of 1957 and Maastricht and have now culminated in the composite Lisbon treaty. I therefore find it difficult, as will other noble Lords, to understand why the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, is worried about this matter. The position of the monarch is in no way affected by our membership of the European Union.</p>

<a name="80609-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08060916000215"></a>There are seven monarchies in the current list of 27 member states. Of those, I am pretty sure&#151;I speak from memory so I hope that I am right, because it is not always possible to read all versions of <I>Hansard</I> of all the other national Parliaments&#151;that the Kingdom  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_405"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 405</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Spain, which is also armed with more than 1,000 years of history, the King of the Belgians, King Carl Gustaf of Sweden, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg and the other monarchies have no anxiety about this, and I do not think that in any of those national Parliaments a single amendment has been proposed to the Bill that is going through its various stages to enact and ratify the Lisbon treaty. The reason for this strange suggestion is therefore beyond me and, I think, most people.</p>

<a name="80609-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08060916000216"></a>I recall, too, that Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh paid&#151;</p>

He has just said that they believe in pooled sovereignty. Behind this question is the deep underlying anxiety of the British people about how one can pool sovereignty and maintain democracy. The two are irreconcilable. I hope that he will answer that point.</p>

<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="08060916000218"></a><a name="80609-0007.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80609-0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08060916000808"></a>Lord Dykes:</b> My Lords, I suggest that the noble Lord simply reads the treaty. It upholds the intrinsic sovereignty of the national state&#151;the national entity. That is repeated throughout the treaty, as it was in the previous treaties. Those things are literally unaffected under international law by the treaty-making experience of history and by the ability of sovereign countries to decide to work together. They lose nothing, even at the margin of their intrinsic national sovereignty. They take sovereign decisions so to do, mostly through their parliamentary machinery&#151;Ireland being the only exception this time, with a referendum on Thursday.</p>

<a name="80609-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08060916000219"></a>I believe that about 14 years ago Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh paid a notable and interesting visit to the European Commission and other institutions in Brussels. Although no official report was made&#151;it was a private visit&#151;they were extremely interested, we understand, in these developments, which are a mirror image of the other kinds of international treaties that this country signs with other international bodies and that create ever-larger bodies as the membership of those particular entities increases. But, because of the closeness of working together under the European Union, it can be sometimes misunderstood, quite understandably, by people who have a more sceptical turn of mind such as the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, that that means somehow giving up your own intrinsic power. That is not the case and never has been. It has always been envisaged that these are sovereign member states working together. In fact, robust Parliaments elsewhere have not seen a single amendment proposed reflecting the anxieties of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, on these matters.</p>

<a name="80609-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08060916000220"></a>Ultimately, it comes into the realms of Euro myths. I was chairman of the European Movement in Britain when Giscard d&#146;Estaing was chairman of the whole European Movement throughout Europe. I remember vividly how we decided to have a kind of contest whereby people in various member states could submit myth stories that they thought was true, including, for example, myths about straight bananas, blue tomatoes and a wonderful panoply of stories. We remember with great affection the <I>Daily Express</I> headline   


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_406"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 406</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>20 years ago, &#147;English student killed by German thunderstorm&#148;. The British press has not changed much because it still writes stories like that. According to my contacts with Giscard d&#146;Estaing&#146;s staff in those days, not a single suggestion that was submitted to any national European Movement, or submitted to the British European Movement, by any of the anti-Europeans turned out to be correct. All stories were looked at carefully, including stories about hairnets for fishermen or not carrying condoms on fishing boats. All that rubbish was investigated thoroughly time and time again, and not a single so-called myth story was true.</p>

<a name="80609-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08060916000221"></a>The heads of state of the republics and the monarchies in the European Union are sacrosanct. They belong to the national entity, which is a national member state fully sovereign in its fundamentals all the way down to the depths of its local political society. That is not in any way affected. I hope that&#151;after the profound debates we had on such an important subject previously and in congratulating, without embarrassing I hope, the Leader of the House on a positive result in that case&#151;this amendment will not be pressed to any suggested vote.</p>

I suspect that the Government will argue that ratification of the Lisbon treaty will have no detrimental effect on the constitutional position of the monarch and that  the amendment is therefore unnecessary, rather like the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, did. But if they are so certain why do they resist the amendment, acceptance of which would greatly reassure the public who are not reassured at present? It is not as if acceptance would involve expenditure of time or money. This amendment is not remotely in the same league as an earlier one moved also by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, which sought a cost-benefit analysis of the Lisbon treaty.</p>

In contrast, this amendment, assuming that the Government&#146;s confidence is well placed&#151;that is a big assumption&#151;would require only a one-sentence statement by the Minister to the effect that the monarch&#146;s position is totally unaffected by the passage of the Lisbon treaty and our ratification of it.</p>

Since they have been raised again by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, perhaps we will get a better answer today. I will not repeat what he has said or repeat my questions.</p>

<a name="80609-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08060916000226"></a>I emphasise that the constitutional position of the monarch is that he or she acts on the advice of their Ministers. However, in matters concerning the European Union, especially in matters decided by QMV, Her Majesty will not act on the advice of her Ministers, but on advice tempered by the decisions of 26 other countries&#151;decisions that British Ministers might very well have opposed. The advice tendered to the monarch will not necessarily reflect the policy of Her Majesty&#146;s Government, nor that of Parliament. It will be decided by a group of foreign states. That constitutes a significant change in Her Majesty&#146;s relationship with her Government and Parliament.</p>
<a name="time_13"></a>
<a name="80609-0007.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08060916000281"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80609-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08060916000227"></a>There is also Her Majesty&#146;s position relating to the Commonwealth. This will now be quite different from her relationship to this country. Presumably she will still be offered advice by her Ministers in the Commonwealth, but that advice will not be constrained by a group of foreign countries. These implications for the monarchy should be explored properly by the Government and explained to Parliament. That is what the amendment asks&#151;no more, no less.</p>

<a name="80609-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08060916000228"></a>Many will say that the position of the monarch is safe. However, there can be no doubt that, as greater EU integration proceeds, the institution of the monarchy could be seen as an anachronism. Many of our institutions have been undermined or reformed radically in the past 10 years. Hereditary Peers have been sent packing. The role of the Lord Chancellor has been all but abolished and the whole of the office dismissed from the House of Lords. The Law Lords have been ousted from Parliament and a Supreme Court established instead. Now the House of Lords is in danger of being abolished and, only recently, the role of Black Rod was diminished considerably, apparently without any real consultation with Black Rod himself. There have been a lot of changes over the past few years.</p>

<a name="80609-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08060916000229"></a>Some noble Lords will not believe that the position of the monarch is under threat. However, I remind them of the behaviour and presidential style of the previous Prime Minister. Mr Blair attempted to muscle in on matters that were clearly the proper province of the royal family, and failed to correct the tendency of sections of the press and others to refer to his wife as the &#147;first lady&#148;. Some people notice these things and are offended by them. Furthermore, it seems to me that the police and perhaps even the Armed Forces now believe that their allegiance is to the Government of the day rather than to the monarch.</p>

<a name="80609-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08060916000230"></a>With all these significant changes, constitutional and attitudinal, to the way that we are governed, it is little wonder that there is concern about the position of the monarchy in relation to the European Union&#151; which, step by step, ratchet by ratchet, is proceeding to full union, a country called Europe. That is why we need this debate and the amendment, which seeks to ensure that the Government report to Parliament on the position of the monarch in relation to Parliament

Since I have added my name to it, of course I support the amendment.</p>

That is wholly untrue. On behalf of my party, let me make it clear that our position is, and always has been, that of course we believe in the nation state; of course we believe in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom; but we also believe in sharing sovereignty in the interests of the people of this country. Sovereignty is not like virginity, something that you either have or do not have. Sovereignty is the exercise of powers, which you may do on your own on issues that can be settled at national, regional or local level; or which may demand transnational&#151;European or international&#151;co-operation on issues such as climate change, pollution, terrorism, migration and fisheries. It is the belief of my party, and of many in the Conservative Party&#151;some of whom are in their places today, but whom I will not embarrass by naming&#151;and I believe is the position of Her Majesty&#146;s Government that sharing sovereignty is in the interests of this country and its people.</p>

<a name="80609-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08060916000232"></a>My second point is in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Monson, who asked, &#147;Why resist this amendment?&#148;. One reason for resisting this amendment is because it is wholly unnecessary. The constitutional position of the monarch in relation to the monarch&#146;s people, Parliament and Ministers, prior to ratification of the treaty of Lisbon and following ratification of the treaty, will be precisely the same. What is that position? The position of the sovereign since 1688-89, and the Act of Settlement 1700, is that we no longer operate a monarchical constitution. We operate under the principle of parliamentary sovereignty or supremacy. The Queen&#146;s Ministers advise the sovereign. The sovereign does not act in her personal sovereign capacity. As a constitutional monarch, the sovereign gives effect to the advice of Ministers who are accountable to Parliament and to the courts. Therefore, whether before or after ratification of the treaty of Lisbon, there will be no change in her constitutional position, nor in her relationship with her citizens or with other institutions of government.</p>

Of course one should share big issues&#151;we have tried to in the United Nations and elsewhere. However, almost all the minutiae of our lives are being dictated by Europe. Currently 80 per cent of our regulations come from Europe and the figure is rising. This is not shared sovereignty, this is giving away sovereignty&#151;and that, if only the noble Lord and his party would realise it, is what deeply worries the British public.</p>

However, it is catered for in the treaty of Lisbon. Unlike previous treaties, it makes sure that the principle of subsidiarity, which states that Brussels and the European Union should not legislate or interfere where the matter can be dealt with better at national or local level, is not only a principle of the treaty, but a principle that national parliaments such as ours will,

As the noble Baroness will confirm, either in her reply or later, one protocol of the treaty of Lisbon ensures that if both Houses of Parliament consider that there has been overreach in relation to any legislative innovation, then both Houses may send a reasoned opinion objecting to a particular proposal and, if necessary and with the co-operation of the Government, they will have access to the European Court of Justice to seek a judgement that there has been overreach&#151;a breach of subsidiarity. Built into this treaty are new democratic safeguards for our country, people and institutions. There is no dispute that the principle of subsidiarity must be respected. Nor is there any dispute that we are not looking to a new Holy Roman Empire in which there will be a single state of Europe.</p>

The word &#147;federal&#148; is the most misunderstood term in the English political language; it is widely construed as relating to a highly centralised system of government, whereas as anyone can see in the federal constitutions of, for example, Germany or Canada, it is a system of allocating power to central government and to the constituent parts of that government. The degree of central control depends on the particular system. The European Union system is in one sense a federal system in that there is centralised lawmaking and devolved or decentralised lawmaking. I do not believe in a federal Union that gives most or all power to the centre within Europe. I believe, and I believe this to be true of my party, in an allocation of powers between what is in Brussels and what is in the member states. I also strongly believe in the nation states and the need to preserve their position. There is nothing defensive about that, but it is easy to characterise what I have just said as some kind of betrayal of national sovereignty. That is wholly untrue and I would be the first to leave my party if I thought otherwise.</p>

The report makes no mention of the role of Her Majesty the Queen for the simple reason that the treaty will have no effect whatsoever on the constitutional position of the monarch. I said this in the closing part of my speech at Second Reading and I repeat now that the position of Her Majesty the Queen is completely unchanged by the treaty. This also means that the status of the Queen as the head of the Commonwealth is in no way changed by the Lisbon treaty. The  creation of a permanent President of the European Council also does not affect the status of the monarch in any way. I hope that that gives absolute clarity on why this amendment is unnecessary and can be  withdrawn.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Dykes, told us yet again that the EU is a collection of wholly sovereign nations collaborating together. He quoted some words that have been included in the treaties since the start. The general gist of what he quoted has always been with us but has not managed to make any difference to the inexorable secession of our right of self-government to Brussels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08060924000008"></a>I am particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Vinson, who put his finger on the heart of the matter in responding to the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, and to what the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, had to say, so I will not repeat his words. However, the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said that sovereignty is not like virginity in that you can share sovereignty, and he gave various examples. That is a fundamental point of difference between us. We say that sovereignty is indeed like virginity&#151;you either have it or you do not. People say that we have given it up to Brussels, but we are actually paying Brussels billions of pounds a year to take it. Perhaps that is a separate matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08060924000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester, also claimed that Ministers are still accountable to Parliament and the courts. That relates to the very point that I sought to make. Ministers are no longer wholly accountable to Parliament; they are now accountable for decisions taken, often by majority voting, in Brussels. That is the difference and I suggest that it may affect the position of the monarch, who is our sovereign, and so her position is reflected in our position.</p>

It was criticised for rather lacking focus, but it gave me a chance to refer to how some other member states handle problems concerned with the scope of the powers of the institutions of the Union. Today, I have a sharp focus by concentrating on two powers to be denied to the European Court of Justice by, in one case, the treaty&#151;no jurisdiction in relation to the common foreign and security policy, subject to specified exceptions&#151;and, in the other case, by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, backed up by a specially created protocol saying that the rights referred to in the charter cannot be used to strike down legislation and practices in the United Kingdom. I do not need to give noble Lords the references because they know where they are&#151;in the treaty in the first case and in the protocol in the second. My amendment tracks the language of those two treaty provisions. I say that because the protocol is declared to have the same force as any provision in the treaty.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="08060924000108"></a>&#147;In general, in the Treaty and the text we are content with the powers, remit and competence of ECJ. The significant areas we were keenest on was the relationship between the ECJ and CFSP and that is clear, and perhaps it could be argued that it just confirms what happens at the moment but it confirms in Treaty text that there is no role for the ECJ in terms of Common Foreign and Security Policy, and that was important for us&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08060924000015"></a>I pause at this point to draw attention to the fact that our European committee picks up that passage and quotes part of it in the first volume of the report, at paragraph 4.155 on page 75:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000078"></a>In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, at question 280, the Minister for Europe told the Select Committee that the other significant area where the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice was dealt with,</p>
<ul><a name="08060924000132"></a>&#147;was on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and ECJ competence. Those were the really significant in principle protections that we were looking for&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000079"></a>In my amendment, I focus rightly or wrongly on the two provisions about the exclusion of jurisdiction on which the Government had the strongest views. That is quite clear from the Minister&#146;s oral evidence.</p>

<p><a name="08060924000080"></a>Secondly, he asked whether the Minister would,</p>
<ul><a name="08060924000134"></a>&#147;accept as inevitable the ECJ over the course of time developing jurisprudence in the field of fundamental rights by reference to the Charter and that this might in the long run undermine the Government&#146;s &#145;red lines&#146;?&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000081"></a>The essence of the answer from the Minister was:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="08060924000110"></a>&#147;We are very clear indeed both politically and legally as to where we are&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000082"></a>I shall return to the word &#147;legally&#148;. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="08060924000111"></a>&#147;There is an acknowledgement, or perhaps acceptance ... across Europe that the Charter in and of itself does not create any additional new rights&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000083"></a>Then, in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="08060924000112"></a>&#147;There were specific concerns in the UK that also existed in Poland and we sought to address those concerns ... about future competence creep of the ECJ in developing jurisdiction through case law elsewhere relying on the Charter. We wished to put it beyond any doubt whatsoever and that is the purpose of the UK and probably the Polish Protocol on the Charter of Fundamental Rights ... The horizontal articles do confirm that the Charter cannot expand any of the EU&#146;s powers at all. If you like, more colloquially put, it is a belt and braces approach. We are very clear, and all other countries are very clear, that the Charter does not create new rights, that is the belt, and the braces is we have got a Protocol for the avoidance of any doubt&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08060924000017"></a>I move on from what the Minister told the committee and take the House to a speech that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, made in January at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. I declare an interest. I have been a member for  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_413"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 413</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some time. I think I am probably on the council. The last chairman was the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goff of Chieveley, and I think that I am right in saying that the current president or chairman is the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham of Cornhill. Academically, it is an extremely distinguished body. The attention of the House is drawn to this lecture because it is specifically referred to in paragraph 5.102 of the Select Committee&#146;s report, where the reference is given. The paper was given on 15 January this year. The typical audience would have been judges, law dons, professors, barristers, solicitors and law students.</p>

<a name="80609-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08060924000018"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, said that he had been involved with the charter since 1999. He had been asked by the then Prime Minister to be one of the draftsmen drawing up the charter and this list of rights. He said that that was a taxing job, which took much longer than he thought. The aim of drawing it up was visibility. The draftsmen were not then thinking of it in terms of it being a legally binding document. They wanted the various rights, which were scattered in conventions and other odd places where we were party to provisions that accorded rights, to be collected together in one place. However, no new rights were to be &#147;minted&#148;&#151;that was the word used by the noble and learned Lord.</p>

<a name="80609-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08060924000019"></a>After a year and a half, the Council, the Commission and Parliament &#147;solemnly proclaimed&#148; the charter as a political text&#151;no legal status then. Time rolls on a little and we come to the constitutional treaty and the Lisbon treaty, when there was a move to give legal status to the charter. The Government insisted that the horizontal clauses should be strengthened. That was agreed and was done, but something more was needed for specific application to the UK. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, said in his lecture:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="08060924000113"></a>&#147;However, going into the Treaty negotiations it was clear that some within the UK still needed reassurance about the possible effects of a legally binding Charter&#151;particularly with regard to protecting UK law. The negotiations at the June European Council and subsequent Intergovernmental Conference provided Government with the opportunity to bolster the existing safeguards and set in stone how the Charter will operate in the UK, as in all Member States&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80609-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08060924000020"></a>Notwithstanding all this care to create safeguards and notwithstanding the existence of the belt and braces, is it conceivable that the jurisdiction of the ECJ could trespass into the forbidden zone? Could there be what Mr Jim Murphy, the Minister for Europe, called a &#147;competence creep&#148; in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice?</p>

<a name="80609-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08060924000021"></a>I come back to Mr Jim Murphy being questioned by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell. At question 284 on page S75, the noble Lord said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="08060924000114"></a>&#147;We had a former judge of the European Court before us here giving evidence and he rather charmingly said that they do not do propensity in the European Court, which is to say that there was not a propensity to get more and more proactive, but at the same time we were left with the clear impression that the Court will develop considerable jurisprudence in the years to come and that one of the sources of that jurisprudence will be the Charter. Therefore, even though the Charter itself will not be creating any new rights, the European Court&#146;s jurisprudence will in fact be leaning very heavily in some instances on Charter rights&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="08060924000084"></a>In response, Mr Murphy said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="08060924000115"></a>&#147;On that basis, of course, my Lord Chairman, the UK Protocol in that scenario, contrary to what has been suggested, would be significant on the basis that the Protocol is clear that no right can be derived from reliance upon a text of the Charter or the rights contained within the Charter, no new EU rights can be extended as a consequence. That is the purpose of the Protocol&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000085"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="08060924000116"></a>&#147;We will see if that turns out to be the case and time will tell&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80609-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08060924000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who is not in his place any more, intervened to say that the version of the charter rights that the European Court of Justice had been citing did not contain the horizontal clauses. I rather think that he meant that the charter rights did not contain the clauses in the form in which we now have them, as they have been in since 2000. In his opinion, the protocol was unnecessary and he said that there was no reason to fear what he called,</p>
<ul><a name="08060924000135"></a>&#147;a constructive interpretation by a dynamic Court&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000086"></a>However, we know as a fact that the Government did not act on that view. They thought that the protocol was necessary and persuaded the other member states to sign up to it.</p>

<a name="80609-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08060924000023"></a>Let us suppose that the unexpected or the remote happens and that the European Court of Justice, at some time in the future, uses an interpretation of the charter that it has adopted to strike down rights in United Kingdom legislation. It may be difficult for your Lordships even to think about that, but suppose that there were some creep into this area. What would happen? The best guide to that is the advice that we have from the lecture given by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith. I am now turning to the end of it; I have got to page 24. The earlier part is narrative; it is about the part that he played and how he was concerned with the original drafting, then with the protocol and with the horizontal clauses. Then he has this heading in his lecture: &#147;What if the Charter is used to create/extend rights?&#148;. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="08060924000117"></a>&#147;Despite the inclusion of these clear and binding safeguards, I&#146;ve been asked what would happen if the safeguards don&#146;t work and the Charter is used to create new rights or extend existing rights. I cannot foresee how the Charter could be used to create new rights. Were I still a politician, I would simply and rightly say that I do not comment on hypotheticals. But in this more learned environment I am free to be more speculative&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80609-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08060924000118"></a>I hope that your Lordships appreciate that. He continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="08060924000119"></a>&#147;Were the courts to disregard the clear provisions in the horizontal articles and explanations and seek to conjure new or extended rights out of the Charter, then the UK&#146;s Protocol would indeed have teeth. It is, after all, a legally binding Protocol with exactly the same status as the Treaty provision which gives the Charter legal rights. As such, neither the ECJ nor UK courts would be able to rely on such expanded&#151;and I would consider exorbitant&#151;interpretations of the Charter to strike down national laws and practices or require the UK Government to change its national law and practices. In such remote circumstances, the Protocol would indeed become an opt-out. That would mean that there was a non-uniform application of uniform Union law, but there are plenty of examples of the variable application of Union law, whether by virtue of opt-outs, derogations or whatever, which are permitted or required by the Treaties themselves. Such would be the case here. But I stress again&#151;this is entirely hypothetical&#151;that the guarantee that the Protocol represents in this regard would only kick in in the circumstances where the clear safeguards in the Treaty of Lisbon and explanations were ignored, I cannot see that happening&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08060924000024"></a>The noble and learned Lord is clearly saying that, if the unforeseeable, very remote, actually happened, such a judgment&#151;this is how I interpret it, although noble Lords can place their own interpretation on the words&#151;by the ECJ, adopting what he calls an &#147;exorbitant&#148; interpretation, would not be binding.</p>

Would he not agree with the reply given to me a week ago by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, that if the Council of Ministers and the Parliament thought a policy interpretation by the European Court of Justice was not what it had meant, they would be able to change it? The noble and learned Lord added that that was the way that the procedure would work; there was no question of running amok. That was how it worked when he was president. We live in a democracy. That is what would happen with regard to the European Court of Justice. It happened in Britain with the Taff Vale judgement and the Trade Disputes Act 1906. Reversing it takes exactly the same logic. Does the noble Lord not accept that?</p>

My experience would be that, once the court has given a judgment, it does not go back to its debating room and say it has made a mistake. There have been cases where it has looked again at a judgment but that is very rare. I do not think the Taff Vale case would be as good a precedent as the noble Lord supposes. I think that he mentioned that the other day.</p>

<a name="80609-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08060924000027"></a>The Minister is telling us that the European Court of Justice cannot rely on the charter. He refers to the protocol being invoked then and says that we are very clear legally as to where we are. He also said that there was a legal answer if the European Court of Justice moved into this unexpected territory. One is, perhaps, entitled to infer that the Minister knew something of the views of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith; the noble and learned Lord is now with us, so we may have the benefit of his comments on this topic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08060924000028"></a>The idea of having different decisions in different parts of the EU, the variable geometry, is clearly contemplated in what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, was saying. May I give the legal argument, as I see it, as to why the UK would not be bound by a judgment of the European Court of Justice if rendered outside its jurisdiction? By the treaties, there is a transfer of competence to the Union within defined limits. That can be found in the EU treaty in the consolidated volume at articles 4.1 and 5.1 Here we have an express provision that jurisdiction is not conferred&#151;it is a negative&#151;as regards CFSP. We also have a bar on using the charter to create new rights or extending existing rights. That is the combined effect of the horizontal provisions and the protocol.</p>

However, I would be surprised if we were ever faced with those circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08060924000045"></a>Our problem is a more subtle and insidious one, resulting from the slovenly way in which the Government negotiated this protocol in the course of the treaty negotiations. It is clear that the charter applies in this country unless it is cut down by the terms of the protocol. The flaw of the protocol lies in its preamble, which says that the protocol is expressed to be,</p>
<ul><a name="08060924000137"></a>&#147;without prejudice to other obligations of the United Kingdom under the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and Union law generally&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000090"></a>The point was not originally made by me from this Dispatch Box&#151;one would certainly not have expected that anyway&#151;but emerged in the course of the Committee examining the Bill in another place. It rightly pointed out that, in the context of the charter, the interpretation by the European court of measures which apply to all European Community member states, including this country, as a consequence of litigation emerging in other member states, would apply in this country even if they extended the interpretation in such a way that changed the law here. That flows from the way in which the preamble was negotiated. As the committee in another place said, it would have been so much better if, instead of the words,</p>
<ul><a name="08060924000138"></a>&#147;without prejudice to other obligations&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000091"></a>the protocol was expressed to have effect &#147;notwithstanding&#148;,</p>
<ul><a name="08060924000139"></a>&#147;other obligations of the United Kingdom&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000092"></a>The fact that the Government failed to do this means that that those red lines are not watertight.</p>

<a name="80609-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08060924000046"></a>I hope that the Government accept Amendment No. 28. It requires them simply to undertake a reporting obligation. The Constitution Committee&#146;s report of 19 March rightly reflects what has been said in a number of debates in your Lordships&#146; House: that probably the most worrying consequence of the Treaty of Lisbon is how the scope of the European Court of Justice has widened to cover so many more competences. In effect, the only one likely to be left untouched by the European Court of Justice is that of security and international relations. In particular, the committee points out, whole tracts of justice and home affairs that previously were excluded from the jurisdiction of the court now fall within it. The Constitution Committee&#146;s recommendation is in paragraphs 122 to 124, and I conclude my observations by quoting them. They succinctly make all the points that I would have wanted to make:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="08060924000122"></a>&#147;Many of the issues we have examined in this report&#151;including the competences of the EU, the interpretation and application of the Charter, the detailed working out of the consequences of the UK opt-outs and opt-ins (particularly in relation to the area of freedom, security and justice)&#151;will be shaped by the European Court of Justice&#146;s adjudications in the years to come. Insofar as the European Union is an organisation based on the rule of law, there can be no complaint that this is so, even if from time to time the developments introduced have taken Member States by surprise.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="08060924000123"></a>In order for Parliament to be fully informed of the European Court of Justice&#146;s interpretation and application of the Lisbon Treaty provisions, we recommend that the Government lay before

In interpreting and applying the Charter, the European Court of Justice will increasingly refer to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and so the relevant rulings of that court ought also to be covered in the Government&#146;s annual report.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="08060924000124"></a>The provision of such an annual report would complement Parliament&#146;s efforts in recent years to seek greater information about the operation of the United Kingdom&#146;s courts through, for example, the requirement of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 for the Supreme Court to make an annual report and the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s proposed regular reports on the court system in England and Wales&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08060924000047"></a>The Government, in a speech by the Leader of the House this afternoon, have expressed their intense interest in deepening the scrutiny of European matters. Why on earth should this not be seen as a further constructive contribution to that process of deepening and will the Government please accept this amendment?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08060924000049"></a>I notice that the former Attorney-General is in his place. I had not before read the very interesting speech that he made on 15 January 2008. In dealing with the charter, he summed up the Government&#146;s position. I totally agree with him but his words are very important. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="08060924000125"></a>&#147;The aim was not to deny the importance of fundamental rights, but precisely the opposite: to prevent them being confused or diluted or the status of the European Convention on Human Rights and of the Strasbourg Court downgraded by the introduction of a rival set of rights&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000093"></a>I believe that is a serious and valid objective. It has been a very important decision to make the European Court of Human Rights charter justiciable in this House. I would have liked to have done it in 1978 when an attempt was made inside the Labour Cabinet. Despite a lot of alarmist predictions, it has withstood pretty well the passage of time.</p>

<a name="80609-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08060924000050"></a>It is rather selfish of us to deny those new states in the European Community which may not have been involved in the European Convention on Human Rights for very long, or not at all in rather more cases, their own home-grown fundamental rights. I do not cower from the fact of introducing fundamental human rights but I think the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, are extremely important. We know that there are people who want to replace the European Convention on Human Rights with the charter of fundamental rights and there are people who want to expand the wording. We therefore do need safeguards. The interpretation put on the speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, is a fair one. I am sure he will leap to his feet if he thinks there has been any misinterpretation of his words. He made it perfectly clear that he thought there would be no change in the protocol, a point which was also made by the spokesman for the Official Opposition. This is not good enough. We have an opportunity here to make sure that there are no changes. We know that there are serious people out there who have anxieties about this treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08060924000051"></a>I would like to take up a little more time of the House on the other aspect of this amendment that deals with the common foreign and security policy. Here I call in aid a very interesting memorandum by Professor Takis Tridimas of Queen Mary, University of London, to the Sixth Report on the European Union (Amendment) Bill of the House of Lords Constitution Committee. In that evidence he says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="08060924000126"></a>&#147;Under the Lisbon Treaty, the Court&#146;s jurisdiction continues to be excluded from matters falling under the Common Foreign and Security Policy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000094"></a>We have heard that very often in this debate.</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="08060924000127"></a>&#147;Such exclusion applies both with respect to the provisions relating to the common foreign and security policy and &#145;with respect to acts adopted on the basis of these provisions&#146;. It is not clear whether this provision excludes jurisdiction only in relation to acts adopted wholly under the CFSP or also in relation to acts adopted under a dual legal basis ie based both on the CFSP and another Union policy, for example, freedom, security and justice&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000095"></a>In my view it is quite likely that that is the area where we must focus our attention. He goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="08060924000128"></a>&#147;Such dual basis may be used, for example, for anti-terrorist measures. Since restrictions on the right to judicial protection are to be interpreted restrictively, it is more likely that the ECJ will be willing to review measures based partly on CFSP&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000096"></a>There is again here a potential loophole and the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, closes that loophole as far as it is possible to do so.</p>

<a name="80609-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08060924000052"></a>I have already pointed out that the other loophole is that the activities of the new President of the European Council will come under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Since the bulk of the activity of the President of the European Council deals with common foreign and security policy, particularly in areas where it may link into terrorism, it is in that area that some of us feel that there needs to be some restriction on the authority and the legality and its follow-through for the president of the Council. This new post is unfettered other than by the Council Members. If the European Court of Justice was to use this as another lever, that possibility would be closed and limited by Amendment No. 27. I hope the House takes the opportunity of having this on the statute book. As far as the Government are concerned, it seems to me the very minimum of a belts-and-braces safeguard.</p>

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="08060924000053"></a><a name="80609-0009.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80609-0009.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08060924000164"></a>Lord Waddington:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, very helpfully went into a great deal of detail. In support of his amendment, I would like to try and refine the issues. In essence they are quite simple. The Government wish to limit the jurisdiction of the European Court when it comes to the charter of fundamental rights and to exclude it entirely in the area of foreign and security policy. They say that the protocol and the opt-out are necessary in Britain&#146;s interests but plenty of very knowledgeable people have said that neither the protocol nor the opt-out is watertight. I am not going to rehearse in detail what has been said by the Commons committee, Open Europe and other bodies, but I would remind your Lordships that the EU Committee of this House says at paragraph 5 of its report:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a><a name="08060924000129"></a>&#147;The interpretation of the protocol is a matter for the courts and ... we do not think it is possible to predict precisely what the courts would decide if faced with the task of interpreting the Protocol&#146;s language&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000097"></a>You can say that again.</p>

<a name="80609-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08060924000054"></a>It is also interesting to note that paragraph 7.40 of the impact assessment records:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a><a name="08060924000130"></a>&#147;Open Europe expressed scepticism that the Court could be kept out of the CFSP, submitting that the extent of the [ECJ&#146;s] jurisdiction over areas within CFSP remains unclear&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000098"></a>The relevant passage in the evidence is C39, and it is plain from that evidence that Open Europe is not alone in taking that view. So the question arises of what happens if the European Court determines that the protection Britain thought she had won, and the protection that the other member states thought they had given Britain, simply does not exist. Some in this place seem to say that there is only one answer, &#147;Bad luck Britain. The court is supreme and master of its own jurisdiction. Sorry, Britain, but the court has concluded that you were sold a pup&#148;. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, even went so far as to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="08060924000131"></a>&#147;There is no way that a regional system of justice can avoid accepting the principle of uniformity&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/5/08; col. 1057.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060924000099"></a>The use of the word &#147;regional&#148; slightly grated with me. It is hardly encouraging and throws light on the cast of mind of some engaged in the European project, but I shall pass over that. The point is that those remarks made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, were a prelude to his conjuring up a picture of chaos which he thought would result if each country&#146;s court could place its own interpretation on European law. But where is the risk of chaos when we are not talking of every country claiming the right to disagree with the Court&#146;s interpretation of a law properly passed but about what is to happen when the Court claims jurisdiction in an area where every country has decided at the time of ratification of the treaty that it has no business in that area?</p>

<a name="80609-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08060924000055"></a>Judging by his speech on 15 January, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, does not seem to think that if the European Court was to conjure up new rights under our charter, our courts would have to apply them. Therefore, this amendment is designed to make plain that if the European Court of Justice tries to bite into the protection from its jurisdiction which the treaties have tried to afford, and which every member state has agreed to, a court in this country can rule that any such judgment or opinion will not be binding in the United Kingdom. It is really a matter of belt and braces and a reinforcement of the protection the Government say is necessary, the protection which the Government have tried to procure through the protocol and the opt-out. How on earth can that be bad?</p>

<a name="80609-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08060924000056"></a>I shall not repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, said about Poland and Germany except to pose the question: why should the United Kingdom not assert in the same way as Germany and Poland have done that it has the right to judge whether the ECJ has gone beyond the four corners of the treaties? I am happy to support the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

There are always questions of the interpretation of statutes at all levels from the international, such as the EU, down to local authority powers. However, we cannot legislate here in the

As those who listened to the remarkable speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, on 29 April during the second day of the Committee stage will have appreciated, this really is not the case. The ECJ will not become irrational, nor will it deliberately misinterpret EU legislation in order to extend its own powers. We cannot, and must not, legislate on that basis.</p>

<a name="80609-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08060924000058"></a>Amendment No. 27 seeks to introduce a new clause, subsections (1) and (2) of which simply restate, accurately enough, the relevant provisions of the Lisbon treaty. Subsection (1) relates to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice over the common foreign and security policy, the CFSP. Subsection (2) relates to the jurisdiction of the EDJ in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It seems that these provisions are intended to apply only if a case has been decided by the European Court of Justice to the disapproval of those in this country who take a different view. The amendment has technical defects. First, it is not clear whether the jurisdiction under the new clause can be exercised only if an issue has been raised in a hearing before the European Court of Justice about the extent of its powers, or whether it can be raised under subsection (3), even if no jurisdictional issue was raised before and decided by the ECJ. Secondly, it is not clear who can raise the issue in the United Kingdom or how they can raise it.</p>

<a name="80609-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08060924000059"></a>However, even without these defects, which no doubt would be capable of being cured, the amendment is much more deeply and fundamentally unsatisfactory. It is a basic rule of a legal system that a court decides on the extent of its own jurisdiction in accordance with the rules and laid down by statute and precedent. That decision is binding unless it is reversed on appeal by a higher court. It is plain that no court in the United Kingdom is a higher court than the ECJ. On ECJ matters, it is obviously the other way round. That is why, for example, if a serious question of European law arises in a case before the House of Lords or a lower court in the United Kingdom, that question must be referred to the ECJ for decision. That decision binds all the courts in this country, including the House of Lords, or the Supreme Court, as it will soon become.</p>

<a name="80609-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08060924000060"></a>The reasons for this are obvious. Only the ECJ can give a decision which is binding on all the member states. Any decision by the House of Lords will be binding only in this country. A similar situation applies as regards any decision by the courts of any country from Cyprus to Portugal. An impossible situation would arise if 27 national supreme courts could give a different interpretation to EU treaties. That is plainly obvious as regards decisions on the CFSP covered by subsection (1) of the amendment. We cannot have different meanings attributed to the CFSP by different states. At first sight this may be less obvious in relation to subsection (2) of the amendment, which repeats Article 1, paragraph 1, of the protocol, which applies only to the United Kingdom and Poland. However, the question here is: what does Article 1, paragraph 1, mean? It is a negative provision which states that the powers of the ECJ are not to be extended. Therefore,  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_423"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 423</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we have to start with a decision by the ECJ that has not extended its powers, either actually or by implication, and that the decision is being challenged in proceedings in the United Kingdom. If the United Kingdom court has power to decide that the ECJ has exceeded its powers, and that the decision of the ECJ must be ignored, one is allowing an inferior court to override a superior court. That is not relevant just to what happens in the United Kingdom. A decision on what are the existing powers of the ECJ taken by the ECJ itself will affect all EU member states.</p>

<a name="80609-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08060924000061"></a>The preamble to the charter says that it reaffirms rights; it does not say, and we all agreed on this, that it extends them. Any decision by the United Kingdom court that the ECJ had extended its powers would involve the interpretation of what those powers are not only in relation to the United Kingdom but in relation to all states, subject to the charter. That must be a decision for the ECJ and not for the United Kingdom court because if it is the other way around, we end up in the same position, that the supreme court in each independent state within the EU can decide the existing powers of the ECJ.</p>

<a name="80609-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08060924000062"></a>The motive behind this amendment seems to be the belief that the ECJ will consciously use its powers to reduce the powers of the UK courts and to increase those of the ECJ by means of decisions which are plainly inconsistent with its powers under the EU treaties. That should&#151;although I doubt if it will&#151;put to rest what I regard as the essentially paranoid views of some opponents of the Bill about the way in which the ECJ works. It is not an organisation which will deliberately set out to impose its own views on the EU as a whole. It can, and surely will, as it has in the past, operate on the basis of a proper, serious and thought-out view, assisted by the Advocate General who is a figure of considerable power, about the questions that come before it.</p>

<a name="80609-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08060924000063"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 28. This amendment is considerably less harmful&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08060924000065"></a>There is also the use of Article 308 of the treaty of Rome, which the court has decided does not have to be in the course of the operation of the Common Market as it should be, but very much wider.

But that is an entirely different matter and it does not undermine the idea that member states of the EU should accept decisions whether they like them or not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08060924000069"></a>The reports and decisions of the ECJ would of course be available, without the necessity for a report by the Government, to anyone who wanted to read them. The amendment requires that the report will also contain an assessment of the impact of decisions on the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is already awash with impact assessments from several different sources. Those who want to believe the Government will do so; those who do not want to believe them will not. The Government may well wish to lay an impact assessment before Parliament, but it is surely a waste of time and money to require that at annual intervals. The amendment ignores the ability of the EU Committee of your Lordships&#146; House and other Select Committees to carry out their own investigations which may be more highly regarded than something produced by the Government.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08060924000070"></a>Further, the amendment ignores one important fact which is that the treaty of Lisbon will, in effect, cease to exist the moment it comes into force because it consists entirely of amendments to existing treaties. The elements of the Lisbon treaty and of earlier treaties will, therefore, be merged. There are some aspects, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which are plainly introduced by the Lisbon treaty. But in many cases, it will be difficult, if not impossible to decide whether an ECJ judgment is a judgment on amendments introduced by the Lisbon treaty, and civil servants will have to waste time considering that.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08060924000071"></a>The amendment goes further still and requires judgments of the European Court of Human Rights which affect provisions of the Lisbon treaty&#151;not the treaty as a whole&#151;to be set out in the report alongside the judgments of the ECJ. I cannot imagine what useful purpose could be served by putting that provision in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08060924000072"></a>I cannot believe that the noble Lords whose names are on this amendment take it particularly seriously. It seems to be one which serves no useful purpose and should not be taken any further.</p>

<a name="08060924000073"></a><a name="80609-0010.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80609-0010.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08060924000168"></a>Lord Blackwell:</b> My Lords, I would like to speak briefly in favour of both these amendments which follow on from some issues raised in an amendment I tabled in Committee. In particular, I will address the issue raised in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Article 1 of that charter offers the protection that the charter cannot be used to extend the ability of the ECJ to find that laws and regulations of the UK are inconsistent with the charter.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08060924000074"></a>The problem is that it does not specify who has the authority to say whether or not it extends the ability of the ECJ. But it is clear that under this treaty the ECJ would, unless otherwise stated, have that ability to decide whether its decisions extend to the law of the UK. As the committee of this House made clear in its report, there is a strong point of view that the reason the Charter of Fundamental Rights is held not to be important is that it does not extend to the law of the UK because it is based on other international agreements. That is the case being put forward for why it does not have a significant effect. Therefore, it is entirely possible that the ECJ will conclude that any decision it makes based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights does not, by definition, extend to the law of the UK. It is then up to the ECJ how it will interpret the charter, on the assumption that it does reflect the UK laws.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08060924000075"></a>There is a further problem which is that the introduction to the protocol makes clear, as we have discussed, that the charter contains provisions which are civil and political in character as well as those which are economic and social. So we have the possibility of the ECJ deciding that in interpreting the charter it is not extending the law of the UK and then making its judgment on issues that are political and social.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08060924000076"></a>You do not have to believe, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, suggested, that the ECJ would be irrational or deliberately misleading to interpret political and social matters in a different way from a UK court. As a result, as the treaty stands, it is perfectly possible that you could have judgments made by the European Court that it claims do not extend UK law and applying its interpretation under the charter of social and political issues. The ECJ is not absolutely a superior court; it is only a superior court on those issues on which it has jurisdiction. The whole question here is whether it has jurisdiction on these issues and interpretations.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08060924000077"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Neill, puts beyond doubt that UK courts should decide on the extent of UK law and whether a measure extends UK law. UK courts should decide on the interpretation of the political and social issues that are covered in the charter. If the Government object to that, they have a difficult case to make the people of the UK.</p>

I would not rise to speak but for the fact that what I said in a particular speech has been much relied on by him and by the noble Lord, Lord Owen. I thought that I owed it to your Lordships to explain what I was trying to say, in the hope that that will help noble Lords to reach a view on the amendment.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="0806102000005"></a>I arrived just a moment or two before I came into the Chamber and was told that the noble Lord, Lord Neill, was referring to me. Gratified, I rushed into the Chamber, only to find the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, describing something that I had had something to do with as slovenly, so perhaps I should have stayed away.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="0806102000006"></a>I want to say two or three things that I hope are relevant to your Lordships&#146; considerations. I know that today is not the occasion to go into the history of the charter in any depth. At one stage, it became my special subject, because I had the job, on behalf of this country, of negotiating the charter, before I took office in the Government. There are two critical things about the charter. First, the charter was never intended to be applied directly to member states in dealing with those matters that member states have the competence to deal with. It was always intended to constrain the European Union institutions. The reason was relatively simple: by this stage, the European Union, having started off as an economic union, had gained more and more powers. How could it be, when each member state was constrained by constitutions, or by the Human Rights Act, or by the European Convention on Human Rights, that the European Union institutions&#151;Brussels, if your Lordships will&#151;were not so constrained?</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="0806102000007"></a>The European Court of Justice had developed some jurisprudence, but it was not clear just what were the restrictions on the European Union, and that is why the charter particularly says in one of the horizontal articles that it is directed at the institutions and only at the member states when they are implementing Union law, which is really a way of saying that the member states are acting as agents of the Union. It is not therefore a substitute for the Human Rights Act, or whatever the equivalent is in other member states. The noble Lord, Lord Owen, absolutely rightly divined one of the issues in the negotiations for the charter, which was to make sure that we did not create confusion about the different rights by having a competing set of rights alongside those which at the time we were only just bringing into force in the sense of making them justiciable in this country through the Human Rights Act; though they had been laws that affected the Government in this country since the 1950s.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="0806102000008"></a>We also wanted to make it clear that the purpose of the charter was not to give the Union new powers. So it says in terms in the horizontal articles&#151;which lack the poetry of any treaty but which are there specifically to make it clear what the constraints on the charter and the use of the charter are&#151;that it does not extend the power or the mission of the Union.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="0806102000009"></a>Against that background, the Government&#146;s view when I was part of them, and, as it happens, my view as well, was that the charter did not create the risks and problems that some attributed to it, because there were clear rules as to its interpretation, because it was  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_427"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 427</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clear that it applied not to the member states in their own right but to the European Union and because it was clear that it did not extend the competence of the Union in any respect. That is why in the speech to which noble Lords have made reference, I summarised the position by saying that the United Kingdom&#146;s position, like my position, has always been that the charter affirms existing rights, it does not create any new justiciable rights in any member state and does not extend the power of the courts. Moreover, in many cases the charter rights are based on national laws and practices and so they must mirror the extent and content of those national provisions. I give way to the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="0806102000010"></a><a name="80609-0010.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80609-0010.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0806102000749"></a>Lord Campbell of Alloway:</b> My Lords, is what the noble and learned Lord has just said twice put in writing anywhere&#151;that these charter ideas apply only to institutions? Is it anywhere in writing?</p>

It is one of the horizontal articles. Noble Lords will forgive me that I do not have the text in front of me; the numbers change from time to time. It says that the purpose is to apply to the institutions and only to the member states when they are implementing Union law and not otherwise.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="0806102000012"></a>The purpose was therefore not to add to existing rights or mirror existing rights to apply to the European Union institutions so that they did not trample on our rights in the same way as we accepted this Government should not trample on our rights. Against that background noble Lords may well ask, &#147;Why bother with the protocol? If that is clear, why bother with it?&#148;. My answer to that is, &#147;Why bother with it?&#148;. It is something that was thought to be helpful, to make it clear. The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, said, &#147;Let&#146;s have belt and braces&#148;. The purpose of the protocol was to be belt and braces; not that we believed that it was necessary, but it would put the matter beyond doubt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="0806102000013"></a>I have two difficulties with what has been said. First, I understand from the report I have had&#151;I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, if I have got this wrong&#151;that the noble Lord has relied on what I said as indicating a doubt on my part about the efficacy of the provisions that we put in the charter, or a doubt on my part that the European Court of Justice might go beyond its intended function.</p>

Be that as it may, it was about reassurance, and it was belt and braces. This is the fundamental point that I want to make to your Lordships.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="0806102000016"></a>The difficulty that I have with Amendment No. 27&#151;I shall say nothing about Amendment No. 28&#151;is that if you have belt and braces, what more do you want or can you have? If something is holding your trousers up round the middle and supporting them from the top, I am not sure what else you can have. You have some degree of support that is in mid-air, and with great respect to the noble Lord, that is what his amendment is as well. It does not change the fundamental point of what is the obligation; it seeks to create a remedy where one is not necessary and cannot be created.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="0806102000017"></a>The noble Lord may have referred to this passage, too, and if so I apologise for repeating it. I said in the lecture at page 13 that although I did not believe the protocol was necessary, if the courts in the UK or  the ECJ were to disregard the clear provisions in the horizontal articles of the charter, then the protocol would have teeth.</p>
<a name="time_19"></a>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="0806102000018"></a>The point is that the protocol is a treaty which has exactly the same legal effect as any other treaty. Therefore, neither the European Union courts nor the United Kingdom courts could disregard the clear provisions of this treaty, which we call a protocol. They therefore cannot apply exorbitant or extensive interpretations of the charter. They are bound by the terms of the treaty, which is the protocol.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="0806102000019"></a>What would the noble Lord&#146;s amendment do? It would do no more than say the same but that some national court had the ability somehow to rule on it. I know that certain people and possibly some noble Lords do not like it but&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said&#151;the structure of the European Union is such that the European Court of Justice is the final decider of issues within its competence. If the European court sought to take a decision, a national court cannot strike down what the court has said. Therefore, the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is the third suspension that is in mid-air. It can have no teeth, but it does not need any. The belt and braces are there to meet the concerns that the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, put forward. For myself, I could not possibly support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen.</p>

It is about the power in Europe&#151;a much broader issue. It is the fact that the member states, which have the power ultimately to set the terms of the relations between member states, have the ability by new treaty agreement to take a different view from that taken by the European Court. It is not as straightforward as Parliament but they can do it. But in my judgment that is not particular to this debate.</p>

I do not wish to prolong this debate more than I need to, and I do not need to very much because I agree with everything that has been said by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, and by my noble friend Lord Goodhart. However, I would like to draw the House&#146;s attention to the fact that the Select Committee on the European Union sub-committee on which the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, and I served looked thoroughly at each provision of the treaty of Lisbon but especially at the charter of fundamental rights. In paragraphs 12.40 to 12.41 and paragraph 12.44 of the report, we summarised our conclusions.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="0806102000025"></a>First, we said that the charter does not confer new rights; the rights referred to are already contained in the international human rights treaties by which all member states of the European Union are bound. Secondly, we found that we could discern no threat to the public interest of the United Kingdom or its citizens in anything contained in the charter, given that it is there to shield, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, has indicated, our citizens&#151;the peoples of Europe&#151;against the abuse of power by the European institutions. It is therefore to protect our citizens against abuses of power and does nothing more than is already binding on member states, as I have said.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="0806102000026"></a>Thirdly, we looked at the protocol and the terms of the treaty itself. We concluded that it is indeed a question of belt and braces. My own view is that either the braces or the belt were necessary only to give reassurance to noble Lords, such as the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, who for years has made plain his opposition to the European court&#146;s activism, as he sees it. I do not believe that it was strictly necessary, but I am absolutely clear that the way in which it has

I do not know what he meant by that. It does not apply to the United Kingdom in the way in which the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights apply to the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="0806102000027"></a>In Amendment No. 27, the court can indeed,</p>
<ul><a name="0806102000170"></a>&#147;find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or action of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="0806102000158"></a>human rights in the Strasbourg court of human rights. It does so with the highest aspirations of Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan and the former head of my chambers, Sir John Foster, at a time when the Conservative Party was the European party within our political system. That is what it does. Its judgments are binding and our judges have a duty to apply the convention rights directly as a result of the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="0806102000028"></a>I cannot understand why Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 propose complicated provisions that in the first place violate the supremacy of European Union law for the reasons given by my noble friend Lord Goodhart. They seek to place UK courts above the European Court of Justice in a way that is unlawful under European law.</p>

<a name="80609-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="0806102000029"></a>Moreover, I do not understand this sudden concern about a possible overreach if the belt and braces do not work. No one has produced even a hypothetical example. The example of the German Constitutional Court is simply an example of a written constitution that states basic rights and freedoms in a way that need to be protected under the German system which had to be reconciled with the paramount law of the European Union. The German Constitutional Court, in its discussions with the European Court of Human Rights, managed to reach a sensible compromise on that question. The fact that there is a now a pending case about all this in Germany is nothing to the point. There has not been a German case I am aware of that would suggest even remotely that the charter could threaten the public interest of this country or its inhabitants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="0806102000030"></a>As I say, we are to take a decision based on evidence. What was our sub-committee doing week after week? It was taking evidence, going through the charter, the red lines and horizontal effect, in order to see whether the view of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, was correct. We came to the view that it was completely correct and that he had reached the right conclusion. These amendments are not appropriate or necessary.</p>

That is relevant to paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="0806102000032"></a>From the day the European Community was founded and member states joined&#151;one by one or three by three&#151;it was fully accepted that there had to be uniformity in its law. The only way to achieve that was to give primacy to Community law. The European Court fully endorsed those principles adopted by the member states. Lawyers and judges not just in the European Court but throughout the Community have fully accepted this concept of the primacy of Community law. There is no possible justification or reason for departing from it today. Certainly, this treaty does not seek to do so.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="0806102000033"></a>I will deal briefly, because of the time, with the two important points which the noble Lord, Lord Neill, raised. First, he spoke about the common foreign and security policy. When the pillars of the community were set up, one pillar was confined to the common foreign and security policy. It was accepted universally that that should not be subject to review by the European Court of Justice. That has not been challenged. Every time it was suggested that the pillars should be changed, that the Court should have more jurisdiction over justice and home affairs, nobody suggested that the foreign policy should change.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="0806102000034"></a>The present Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes it absolutely plain that the European Union Court of Justice shall not have jurisdiction over provisions relating to the common foreign and security policy, nor to Acts adopted on the basis of those provisions. Yet it introduces in Article 275 that the Court shall have jurisdiction to deal with certain matters, particularly those which review the legality of decisions providing for restrictive measures against natural or legal persons&#151;this is important and justified. I will not read Article 275 but that is an important and in no way restrictive position. The provisions included in the treaty follow what has happened and do not violate the principles we have observed today or which we should continue to observe. I regret that I may be totally inaudible or at the least extremely irritating in suffering either from a bug picked up in an airplane or from some cold from foreign parts.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="0806102000035"></a>Secondly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been severely criticised for the way in which it happens. It has been made plain in the charter that its underlying rights include charter safeguards. The general articles are of great importance. That the charter is addressed primarily to the Union institutions and affects member states only to the extent that they implement European law is important. I will not say more about that. It is quite plain that the charter is not intended to extend existing rights. Those explanations will lead the court to follow the principles which are intended. It is important to remember in Article 1(8) of the treaty of Lisbon that,</p>
<ul><a name="0806102000171"></a>&#147;the Charter shall not extend in any way the competences of the Union as defined in the Treaties&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80609-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="0806102000036"></a>The protocol, which has the same force as the treaties, is clear. The European Court of Justice not only cannot ignore it but also must enforce it. It cannot strike it down. The general principle we have followed should apply equally. I am being much briefer than I intended to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="0806102000037"></a>On Amendment 28, your Lordships&#146; House and others already have all the reports of the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. The Government intend, I understand, a statement of what has been achieved by the European Court and Court of Human Rights&#151;it is already available in many other forms. It is a matter for the Government and Lord President to decide whether what is there is enough or whether we really need more, as proposed.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="0806102000038"></a>Finally, I remind your Lordships that the European Community is now to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights. That imposes obligations on the European Union and on the court. It will likely have the effect of restricting some of these exorbitant ideas which have been passed around, that the European Court is going to run amok and do some crazy things in order to defeat the objectives of the charter. It will not do so and what is in our present treaty is an adequate way of dealing with the matter. Again, I apologise. I thank your Lordships for your patience and hope for some audibility.</p>

When I attempted to speak to him last week, he had no voice at all. I know the House wishes him well and hopes that his voice will return. To quote the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I am going to be telegraphic in my remarks because I do not need to repeat a lot that has been said and could not do so with the eloquence of my noble and learned friend Lord Goldsmith, the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Lester, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, with whose remarks I would like to associate myself and the Government. I am not going to try to cover what they have covered so adequately. I am also mindful of the time and that noble Lords will wish to reach a conclusion on this.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="0806102000040"></a>Amendment No. 27 covers common foreign and security policy and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. There are very clear reasons, which noble Lords have eloquently set out, why the Government have put in place the measures that they have. In doing so, the Government wished to reassure this House, another place and beyond, and to make clear what does and does not apply. We have made it clear that the European Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction over common foreign and security policy. There are two tiny exceptions to that, which I laid out fully in Committee, about policing the boundary between the two. They are that under the new treaty, the court has to protect the distinct character of the common foreign and security policy against encroachment from non-common foreign and security policy provisions, as well as vice versa, and the sanctions that apply to individuals that could come about under this. Beyond that, the European Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction in the way about which noble Lords have expressed concern.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="0806102000041"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, was worried about the preamble,</p>
<ul><a name="0806102000172"></a>&#147;without prejudice to other obligations&#148;</ul>

<p><a name="0806102000159"></a>in the EU treaty. That is a misunderstanding about how the protocol works. Any judgment given on the basis of the charter cannot extend the ability of the European Court of Justice to affect the law of the United Kingdom. If the European Court of Justice did the completely unthinkable&#151;we are back to the belt, braces and suspension in midair point&#151;and ignored all the other safeguards in the charter and interpreted European Union law for other member states&#151;a concern that was raised&#151;using the charter to create new rights, it cannot affect our law. That is clear from Article 1.1 of the protocol, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="0806102000163"></a>&#147;The Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice of the European Union, or any court or tribunal of Poland or of the United Kingdom, to find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or action of Poland or of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that it reaffirms&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806102000160"></a>That is in the protocol, and the protocol stands.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="0806102000042"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Owen, previously raised the issue of the president of the European Council and the fear of seeping through the president into a jurisdiction. The European Court of Justice has jurisdiction over measures of the European Council with legal effects. It does not have jurisdiction over the political discussions or conclusions of the Council. Were the European Council to adopt legal measures relating to common foreign and security policies, which are extremely rare, they are clearly covered by what I describe as the &#147;carve out&#148; under Article 275. They would relate to the CFSP provisions, and so have jurisdiction on the president. If noble Lords refer to the treaty and look at what has been said, it is clear that there is no need for any additional provision.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="0806102000043"></a>My noble and learned friend has gone through the issues around the charter in great detail. I am not going to try to set them out again because noble Lords have listened very intently. My noble and learned friend referred to the interpretation and application of the treaty, but he did not have the reference in front of him. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="0806102000164"></a>&#147;The provisions of this Charter are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806102000161"></a>That was the particular point to which my noble and learned friend was referring.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="0806102000044"></a>I am not going to go into all the details about what has been covered on the charter and the safeguards that have been put in place, not least due to the incredible work of my noble and learned friend in negotiating that position. Suffice it to say that the issue that underpins Amendment No. 27 is the primacy of European Union law and the role of the European Court of Justice. If you sign up to a club&#151;which, in a sense, we have done&#151;with 27 member states, you also sign up to the referees that you put in place. The European Court of Justice is in a sense a referee. That is its function. Noble Lords may not like it and may wish that it did not exist, but that is what it does. Its work is important in making sure that the implementation and the work of the European Union is consistent. We have benefited from that. Noble Lords can point to many cases where the European Court of Justice has  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_434"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 434</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>demonstrated that to our benefit. That is what underpins this amendment and is why the Government will not accept it.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="0806102000045"></a>I shall turn briefly to Amendment No. 28. So far, we have asked for 23 reports during our deliberations. I am mindful of not bombarding noble Lords with further information. In speaking to this amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred to the Constitution Committee report, and I refer to the response to that report that the Government have already published. We have already committed to ensuring that a copy of the European Court of Justice&#146;s annual report is deposited in the Libraries of your Lordships' House and another place. We have also committed to providing explanatory memoranda on all judgments during the preceding year in which we were a party, where we intervened or where we submitted observations. Just to make sure that noble Lords understand the context of that, it will be considerable number of cases. Of the cases lodged with European Court of Justice in 2007, we intervened or submitted observations in just over 50, and of cases lodged with the Court of First Instance, we intervened in just under 20 cases. We believe that by putting in the Libraries the European Court of Justice&#146;s annual report and memoranda on everything where the UK has had an interest, we will fulfil what was behind the Constitution Committee&#146;s requirement and request to us. That is a much better option than yet another amendment that takes us into another report. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will agree.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="0806102000046"></a>We already work closely with the Joint Committee on Human Rights. We think that that is the best way to continue our work rather than setting up a parallel process replicating what is already done. That is all I am going to say. Everything that could have been said in this debate has very usefully been said. I am extremely grateful to noble Lords who have spoken. I hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

I was surprised to hear the noble Baroness say that full protection has been achieved by the first sentence of Article 1 of the protocol. That seems a strange statement in view of the fact that the horizontal articles were not good enough, but something that says almost exactly the same thing, but introduces the word &#147;UK&#148; gives complete protection. That is among the answers she gave. We heard the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, will listen to his advice and bear in mind the respect we owe to his speech.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="0806102000048"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said that we cannot legislate on the basis that the ECJ will err, but that is precisely what the Government did in calling for the protocol. There were references to paranoia. I shall not demean the argument by answering them. I do not believe that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, answered the passage I read from his speech saying that the protocol would bite in the event that this extraordinary thing happened. We never really had an answer to that. His position is probably that it cannot happen here. That is all I wish to say. We have had arguments both ways, and I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="0806102000056"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, scarcely a day passes without warnings about obesity appearing in the media: how, in its various manifestations&#151;obese, morbidly obese and super-morbidly obese&#151;it endangers the nation's health and is on the increase. Obesity in pregnant women is seldom referred to, although it has  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_438"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 438</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been called the biggest threat to women during pregnancy. In the Government&#146;s large, tripartite obesity document, <I>Foresight</I>, I was unable to find any specific reference to obesity and pregnancy.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="0806102000057"></a>The problems are serious. Midwives and obstetricians have been aware of them and have been dealing with them for several years. Recently, things have changed. Due to the current obesity epidemic, if such it can be called, an increasing number of extremely overweight women are becoming pregnant. The rate of that increase is alarming. In 1980, no more than 8 per cent of women in England were classified as obese and the word itself was seldom used. If we heard it, a good many of us would not have known what it meant. That would be laughable today, for the prevalence of obesity had nearly trebled to 21 per cent of women by 1998 and current figures suggest that it may have reached 25 per cent. It is estimated that that figure will have increased to 50 per cent by 2050. It is clear that obesity is one of the greatest public health challenges facing healthcare professionals and that this trend must be reversed.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="0806102000058"></a>Body mass index is measured by dividing an individual's weight in kilos by height in metres and then dividing the result by height in metres again. An ideal weight for women is between 18 and 25. The <I>Confidential </I><I>E</I><I>nquiry into Maternal Deaths</I> of 2004 reported that 35 per cent of women who died were identified as clinically obese, with a body mass index of 30 or more, while a body mass index of more than 40 indicates morbid obesity. The latest <I>Confidential </I><I>E</I><I>nquiry</I>, that of 2007, shows that out of the 295 women who died 119 were overweight and 64 of those were morbidly or super-morbidly obese. In 30 per cent of women who experienced a stillbirth or perinatal death, the maternal BMI was recorded at more than 30.</p>

<a name="80609-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="0806102000059"></a>Maternal obesity during pregnancy is associated with increased complications for both mother and baby. The risks to mother include miscarriage, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, hypertension, thromboembolism, post-caesarean wound infection, prolonged labour, postpartum haemorrhage and many others. The risks to the baby may be child adiposity, early neonatal death, intrauterine death and hypoglycaemia. In adults, obesity increases the likelihood of type-2 gestational diabetes dramatically&#151;by up to 80 times that of the non-obese. Although this will disappear after pregnancy, it may be a precursor of developing diabetes in later life, which can be a cause of high blood pressure and coronary heart disease. Obesity is also associated with less serious but debilitating conditions such as shortness of breath, back pain and reduced mobility. In some cases, midwives find taking specimens from and conducting examinations of obese women complicated if not impossible due to their excess weight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="0806102000060"></a>Pre-eclampsia has increased nearly fivefold in morbidly obese women compared with normal-weight women. The risk of caesarean section has increased threefold and instrumental deliveries have increased by 34 per cent. In comparison with normal-weight women, there is evidence that maternal obesity is also associated with foetal abnormalities, particularly spina bifida and heart defects. It appears that women who were obese prior to pregnancy are more likely to have a  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_439"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 439</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>baby large for gestational age. Generally speaking, obese parents have obese children. The odds of an obese one to two year-old child being obese as an adult is one in three.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="0806102000061"></a>A survey carried out in 2005 identified that maternal obesity resulted in, among other defects, a twofold increase in stillbirths and neonatal death compared to birth outcomes in women of normal body weight. Excessive weight gain in pregnancy is an independent risk factor for caesarean birth; it has been estimated that a significant number of caesarean sections could be avoided each year if women's weight did not exceed the level recommended by the Institute of Medicine.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="0806102000062"></a>Morbidly obese women&#151;those with a body mass index of 40-plus&#151;have risks for complications that are significantly greater. It has been found that those women are at risk of prolonged labour, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, surgical birth, postpartum endometritus and prolonged postpartum stays in hospital. Also, larger women often have restricted mobility and may not be able to get into a position ideal for a safe delivery.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="0806102000063"></a>We also have to consider, although it may be a secondary consideration, the added costs to the NHS associated with the safe management of obese women in pregnancy and the resources needed to achieve that, as specialist equipment may be required. For instance, serial scans may be required to assess foetal growth, foetal monitoring by an external transducer may be needed and a foetal scalp electrode may be applied if the foetal heart is impossible to record. Delivery may have to take place in a consultant unit or, if an emergency caesarean must be carried out, two obstetricians are required to be present.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="0806102000064"></a>It has been suggested that pregnancy is not a time to lose weight. However, antenatal booking may be the ideal time to discuss diet with women who have been identified as obese or morbidly obese, as well as the conditions in pregnancy that may result from obesity. Midwives say that the myth that the weight should not be lost during pregnancy should be dispelled. However, this is not the place to go into causes of obesity or weight-loss regimens. The media instruct women in these procedures almost every day and it is hard to believe that anyone who has a problem can be unaware of them. A recent proposal, which should meet with derision, is that of paying people to lose weight, which has been the subject of television programmes shown in the past two weeks. Contrary to popular belief among the thin, overweight and obese women are well aware of their obesity and many, far from being complacent in the well known image of the jolly fat person, are made miserable by their condition.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="0806102000065"></a>Unfortunately there is a growing trend to accept overweight verging on obesity as the norm&#151;the condition of what the media call real women&#151;while leanness must be attributed to excessive dieting, if not anorexia. This attitude may be seen as encouraging obesity in pregnancy where eating for two as a principle, if old-fashioned, is still a current belief. The fact remains that the <I>Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health</I> in 2007 estimated that at least 360 existing children and 160 live newborns lost their mother. One hundred and nineteen of the women who died were  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_440"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 440</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>classified as obese. It is deeply distressing to contemplate these orphaned children who were deprived of that unique figure in everyone&#146;s life, not through disease in its usual sense but through a failure to be given dietary and exercise help before and during pregnancy.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="0806102000066"></a>However, although gestational obesity is a growing problem and presents severe risks to both mother and baby, currently there is no national guidance for midwives on how to care for this increasing number of women. Women are repeatedly told not to drink alcohol while pregnant, or to drink it in very small quantities. It is now taken for granted that they should not smoke while pregnant, but obesity is not subject to similar condemnation, nor is a woman warned that she may be carrying too much weight for a safe pregnancy and satisfactory delivery. Something on the French model might be considered, where women&#146;s health and weight are monitored throughout the pregnancy. Does the Minister believe that the Government should give guidance to midwives nationally and that attention should be focused by health professionals on young women who are obese prior to their becoming pregnant?</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="0806102000068"></a>The subject of today&#146;s debate is of real relevance at a time when there is wide general concern at the growing number of people who are overweight and growing evidence of the dangers of obesity to both mothers and their babies during confinement in particular. Interestingly, an article was published in <I>G2</I> today about the growing number of large babies in general and the problems that they can suffer during the birth itself. However, that is probably beyond the bounds of today&#146;s debate, because although recent research indicates that obesity in pregnancy is linked with the high birth weight of the baby, it seems likely that other factors affect birth weight, such as the height of parents, which are rather beyond today&#146;s subject.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="0806102000069"></a>The report to which the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, referred clearly indicates a link between a mother&#146;s high body weight and a number of serious problems, which the noble Baroness has rehearsed for us already. One of the effects has been increased costs to the NHS in the number of days in hospital during pregnancy, in a fivefold increase in the costs of neonatal care and in the increased likelihood of the child being admitted into a neonatal intensive care unit. Worryingly, no single clinical guideline is available in the UK on the best way of dealing with these problems, although work is being done and evidence collected on the best way to handle the problem medically. I join the noble Baroness in asking the Minister whether such a guideline is currently being prepared.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="0806102000070"></a>Overweight, or a high body mass index, is caused by factors well beyond the power of doctors alone to deal with. Home Office figures published this year show a strong relationship between obesity and social class. I suspect that that is really a relationship between being better off and being less well off. In 2006, about a fifth of the richest quintile of women was obese  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_441"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 441</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>compared with a third of the poorest quintile. Furthermore, four times as many of the poorest women are morbidly obese compared with their richer sisters. These differences seem to be associated with a low-activity lifestyle and a less healthy diet among poorer women when compared with the wealthy. These trends begin in childhood, with lower levels of physical activity among girls than boys, particularly after the age of nine, and fewer children of poorer families getting the desired five portions of fruit and vegetables daily.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="0806102000071"></a>Given the costs to the individual woman and to the NHS of excess weight, what can the Government or individual women do about it? Perhaps better advice to women about the risks to themselves and their babies from overweight would be useful. I had my babies when free orange juice was still available from baby clinics; I certainly listened to what the nurses had to say and tried to follow their advice. The fact that my three children weighed 9 pounds 10 ounces, 8 pounds and 8 ounces and 8 pounds respectively might suggest to some that I did not listen hard enough, although they all grew up perfectly normal.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="0806102000072"></a>In an age when mothers of children at school can encourage them to refuse healthy school lunches and push burgers and fries through the schoolyard fence to keep them from starving, we need to do more. Clearly, educating children about health and exercise and healthy eating from their earliest years would be a start. As anyone knows who has frequently visited five and six year-olds in their classrooms, one can teach a child almost anything at that age, always provided that the teaching matches the child&#146;s understanding. Doing some of this on days or at times when parents can be present would be even better.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="0806102000073"></a>A programme of age-related teaching financed by the Government might be cost-effective, given the high costs to the NHS of obesity in women, to say nothing of the costs to the women themselves. A greater emphasis on PE and games would clearly be beneficial, as the gap between the activity levels starts early and is widest in the children of the poorest families. There seems to be a real difficulty in that girls in general seem to be turned off team games from quite an early age, but the Government are making a good deal of effort, in the context of the Olympic Games, to encourage more participation in sport of all kinds. Perhaps less concentration on team games and more encouragement of swimming&#151;very good for the figure&#151;and gymnastics, dance or aerobics in all-girl contexts would be more attractive to girls than having to exercise in the school playground or on the hockey pitch with the boys looking on and jeering.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="0806102000074"></a>Of course, I understand that there are forces working against such ambitions, not least the increasingly early sexualisation of young girls as a result of high-pressure sales techniques. We also need to be concerned about the understanding of women who are now in their childbearing years of the malign effects of being seriously overweight on their efforts to carry and give birth to a healthy baby. Do the Government ever consider getting this sort of message across in women&#146;s magazines, without anyone ever realising that it is a government message of course? The medium really can be the message if handled tactfully.</p>

It is extraordinary that, in an education system that began by teaching children how to look after their babies, we have got so far away from practical education of that kind and from an interest in teaching children how to look after themselves physically as well as mentally, and that we are suffering from a ridiculous and dangerous epidemic of obesity that is causing harm both to mothers and to their children.</p>

For a minute, I thought that she was going to ask us all to declare our BMI before we speak. I would not like to admit that mine is approaching that crucial number. I hope that I will be able to keep it under control.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="0806102000077"></a>We all know that obesity in our country is of epidemic proportions&#151;more so than in any other western European country. What is worse is the fact that childhood and adolescent obesity is on the increase, with nearly 30 per cent of children and adolescents classified as obese. In the longer term, that will have its effect in all areas of healthcare, not just in pregnancy. What is now happening in terms of maternal perinatal mortality and morbidity will have its effect in the longer term.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="0806102000078"></a>The proverb, &#147;You are what you eat&#148;&#151;and maybe even drink&#151;is familiar to all of us. What is less well known is that it is also true that you are what your parents, and even your grandparents, ate, which is based on the established science of development biology. As we understand more about the genes we inherit and the environment in which we live, and the increased understanding of foetal health and its relation to parental diet, we are beginning to see the link between a predisposition to certain adulthood diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity, as well as to foetal development and maternal obesity. The roots of these diseases are laid down before birth. There is a strong co-relation between maternal insulin sensitivity in late pregnancy, and birth weight and fat-free mass in the body.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="0806102000079"></a>So what does all that mean? There is a strong link between obesity in pregnancy and weight at birth, and subsequent obesity in children. In mothers with a BMI of more than 30 kilograms per square metre in the first three months of pregnancy, the prevalence of childhood obesity&#151;that is, a more than 95th percentile weight at the ages of two, three and four&#151;in one study was 15, 20 and 24 per cent. The rise in babies born large for gestational age&#151;with a birth weight of more than four and a half kilos&#151;in the most part is related to maternal obesity and diet, which will then lead to a rise in adulthood diseases.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="0806102000080"></a>These are the long-term effects of maternal obesity. The immediate effect is an increased maternal and perinatal mortality, which the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, has already mentioned. That may well be associated with higher maternal mortality in the United Kingdom than in other western European countries. Let us admit that we now have a rising maternal  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_443"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 443</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mortality rate. Fifty per cent of deaths reported in the confidential report on maternal deaths and nearly  30 per cent of perinatal deaths are associated with obesity in the mother. Add to this the fact that the prevalence of obesity is higher in lower socio-economic groups, which is already a significant factor in maternal and perinatal deaths, and we have the reason for this increase in numbers. Complications such as pulmonary embolus, pre-eclamptic toxaemia, pre-term labour, small-for-gestational age babies&#151;that is, small babies&#151;are also higher in obese mothers.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="0806102000081"></a>Care of obese mothers requires personalised care from experienced staff and the interpretation of tests, both antenatally and intrapartum, is problematic. The incidence of surgical intervention, such as caesarean sections, is high and fraught with difficulties. I still remember the case of a very large lady on whom I was called to do an emergency caesarean section because of foetal distress. The foetus was not being oxygenated well. The consultant has to deal with the problem. After six hours of surgery, which normally takes 40 minutes, and 25 pints of blood, I was exhausted and my hair turned the colour it is now. In obese women, any surgery is fraught with difficulties. The Minister may be able to use his laparoscope or his robot, but I cannot use those for a caesarean section.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="0806102000082"></a>Anaesthesia and post-operative care are also problematic, as is neonatal resuscitation. Babies born to gestationally diabetic mothers, which obese mothers often are, mostly consist of fat and water, and have difficulties in the neonatal period.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="0806102000083"></a>What do we need to do? What should the Government&#146;s policy be? First, there should be a better, continuous strategy for the prevention of obesity in children and adolescents, particularly young girls, which is rising. Secondly, with the incidence of obese pregnant women attending clinics in some maternity units as high as  22 per cent, there should be better resourced maternity units. They need equipment, such as bigger blood pressure cuffs, which noble Lords may think are easy to get; stronger operating theatres; and, importantly, skilled, experienced staff, particularly midwives. The Government&#146;s proposal to increase the number of midwives by 4,000 is good, but what steps are being taken to make that happen? We need more midwives to enter not just education but also to practise.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="0806102000084"></a>The increasing incidence of obesity in pregnancy will be a sign of a failed strategy for reducing childhood and adolescent obesity, and will lead to greater demands on healthcare in the future. Under-resourced maternity care will lead to an increase in maternal and perinatal deaths and disability. Maternal obesity is a serious problem. Prevention is key in the long term. In the short term, we need better resourced maternity units.</p>

It is very timely as we see obesity and morbid obesity increasingly account for maternal and child mortality, and morbidity in pregnancy and childbirth, as has already been outlined. In preparing for this debate, my literature search identified a series of  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_444"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 444</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>papers, 14 of which were very high-quality studies, and the consistency of their findings rang out loud and clear. The complications for mother and baby are worse the fatter the woman is. Even when you exclude women with diabetes and high blood pressure, the risk from obesity itself is evident, stark and statistically significant in all the studies.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="0806102000086"></a>The 2000-02 report, <I>Why Mothers Die</I>, found that 35 per cent of all women who died were obese&#151;a figure that has already been alluded to by the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell. The problems can be considered under various phases of the pregnancy and birth. Pre-existing obesity risks adverse outcomes in pregnancy. In early pregnancy, there is an increased risk of spontaneous miscarriage and congenital abnormalities. These include cardiac problems in the baby; omphalocoele, which is when the abdominal wall does not close and the baby&#146;s guts are exposed; and spina bifida.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="0806102000087"></a>As pregnancy progresses, the risks to the baby are of oversized organs, which can lead later to obstructed labour, and of premature labour and of stillbirth, which is sometimes because the placenta comes away with potentially massive haemorrhage. These mothers are at risk of high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia and diabetes in pregnancy, all of which put the placenta at risk. In the morbidly obese women, the babies are at risk of being dangerously small through placental insufficiency, but for most obese women, the babies are dangerously large, which applies right across the board.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="0806102000088"></a>Some women are so obese that they have sleep apnoea. They literally cannot breathe properly when they are asleep. The mother is more likely to go into labour at the wrong time, either prematurely or post-term. When in labour, if the head is delivered, the shoulders are at risk of getting stuck and in the process of delivery the baby&#146;s collar bone is at risk of fracturing. The fragments can go through the brachial plexus, which is the main nerve trunk to the arm, and the baby has a paralysed arm. The baby is much more likely to be severely distressed in labour in obese women and after delivery may need resuscitation, which is hard because of the metabolic disturbances that the baby has had.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="0806102000089"></a>Caesarean sections certainly are not the answer. Anaesthesia is so hard in these women that they may not ever have adequate sedation because the fat just soaks up the anaesthetic agents. They are extremely difficult to intubate and then they are very hard work to ventilate adequately to maintain oxygen levels to the brain. It is hard to put in an epidural because none of the landmarks are there to guide safe insertion and surgery is complicated by this apron of fat, as has already been alluded to. The wound is then more likely to break down. The women are at risk of genital tract and urinary tract infection and of post-partum haemorrhage. Tragically, the main cause of death in women is thromboembolism when a deep vein thrombosis breaks off as a pulmonary embolus and blocks the blood supply to the lungs, and the woman dies.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="0806102000090"></a>The other problem for the baby is that these women are less likely to breastfeed, so there are ongoing nutritional problems in the infant. Should the women have a catastrophic event, resuscitation is harder because

Indeed, midwives have said that even finding beds strong enough to hold some of these women is very difficult. Monitoring the foetus during labour is extremely difficult, because normal pieces of equipment to monitor the foetal heart cannot be attached easily. There is also the problem of back injuries and strain if these women have to be moved or lifted.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="0806102000091"></a>In going through the literature, I also found an interesting study from work done on animals. Maternal junk food diets during pregnancy and lactation play a role in predisposing the offspring to obesity. This food alters the metabolism of the offspring. Giving the mother junk food has a subsequent lifelong damaging effect on the offspring.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="0806102000092"></a>We have before us the Health and Social Care Bill, which features the grant in pregnancy. It is a unique opportunity to engage women in education on health issues, on issues around breastfeeding and on parenting. There is another aspect that we must not ignore. Quite a few morbidly obese women who present are like that because they are desperately unhappy and have been abused. We should use this opportunity to screen for abuse women and other members of their family. There is also the potential problem of substance abuse&#151;particularly of alcohol, but of other substances as well.</p>

<a name="80609-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="0806102000093"></a>Severe obesity is not a reason to chastise a woman, because it may be a pointer to there being a great deal of dysfunction in many aspects of her life. I hope that the Government will use the Health and Social Care Bill to take forward positive health education for these women. When you are giving them a grant, you have a captive audience.</p>

I suspect a lot of things that need to be said have been said. However, I have a few things to add. Of 12.95 maternal deaths per 100,000 births in this country, nearly half&#151;six&#151;are due to obesity in some form. That is disgraceful in a civilised society, with a National Health Service that gives treatment free at the point of need.</p>

This happens&#151;women of normal weight can grow obese during pregnancy, for emotional or feeding reasons, or perhaps because they have given up smoking. No one has mentioned the link between women smoking and keeping their weight down. This is important, particularly to young women. In one of my pregnancies, for no reason that was ever explained to me, I could be described at term only as a gasometer on legs, because I had put on so much weight. Thankfully, a lot of it&#151;though not all&#151;has disappeared since. However, it does happen, and it can be very dangerous for the woman and her baby. I was fortunate: it had no consequences for me or my baby.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="0806102000096"></a>Obesity can also cause reduced fertility, and not just because of the physical difficulty of getting pregnant. I have seen many women who get pregnant once they have addressed their diet and begun to lose weight. The noble Baronesses, Lady Rendell and Lady Finlay,  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_446"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 446</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and the noble Lord, Lord Patel, have described the many complications at birth, including the damage to the baby at delivery. I read in a paper published about two years ago that there is also a higher incidence of foetal abnormalities in women who are obese when they get pregnant. Diabetes is an obvious complication, along with high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia. There are also enormous problems for the midwives and staff who deal with obese patients. This should not be played down: it is very dangerous. If doctors, nurses and midwives find you difficult to handle, you will not have as good an outcome as if you were easier to handle. I think that sometimes people do not realise that. They think that once they get to the National Health Service, all problems will fade away and the doctor will be able to do the right thing and make them better.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="0806102000097"></a>The causes are the same as among the general population. Poor education and deprived backgrounds are major factors in obesity. Girls in school are given sex education, and some relationship education if they are lucky. They are taught about the risks of contracting infections. But what about the risks of obesity in pregnancy and the importance of keeping themselves healthy and fit if they want in future to have healthy and fit babies? Do we address that enough when we educate our girls?</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="0806102000098"></a>I have mentioned in previous debates the confusion over health messages. Yes, people should give up smoking. However, if patients then put on an enormous amount of weight, you have to address that with them as well, because it can be very difficult. Yes, they must give up drinking, but if their only solace is drinking, will they start overeating to replace the drinking? People with addictive personalities often have to do something to stave off their unhappiness, depression or misery. Treatment is often much more complicated than simply telling them to stop doing something.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="0806102000099"></a>Breastfeeding has been mentioned. It is terribly important that babies should be breastfed from birth, because that leads to much better health as the baby moves into childhood. Habits formed during babyhood and childhood are terribly important: noble Lords do not have to be reminded of that.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="0806102000100"></a>There is sometimes an element of the Government not quite joining up in this area. We hear a lot about joined-up government, but since introducing massive choice in primary schools so that parents could choose where they wanted to send their children, the tendency has been to choose the school far enough away to require using a car rather than the school around the corner. So many children are now driven to school either because it is too far to walk, because their mothers have been encouraged back to work and they are being dropped off on the way, or because mothers are terrified by all the media attention on child abduction and child abuse. Children do not get that natural exercise at the beginning and end of the day which is so important to their development. With my children, being able to walk to school by themselves once they were in primary school was part of their social development and education. They had to be able to do it. So few children have that nowadays, so they are lacking in exercise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="0806102000101"></a>I know that the Government are trying to address the problem, but the sale of school playing fields and the dumbing down of compulsory sports in the curriculum has resulted in a tendency for both girls and boys to get fatter because not as much exercise is built into the school day. Government departments need to get together and carry out an audit on what effect this will have in terms of people&#146;s health as well as their education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="0806102000103"></a>My noble friend Lady Thomas made an important point. We should remember the days when we had community clinics. We had baby clinics, health visitors, free orange juice and the opportunity for mothers to chat and to speak to community nurses. They were meeting points for young mothers to share information about their babies and receive the correct advice. When the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, responds to the debate, I would like him to promise me that if and when his polyclinics are set up&#151;I have to confess that I am a fan of such clinics for some areas&#151;please, please can we have preventive and community health in order to provide sensible advice for mothers, the elderly and people with long-term diseases. That is what we are lacking now. A lot of GPs have tried to provide those services, which used to be available in community clinics, but many do not. They are particularly important in deprived areas. For a long time I worked in Southall in Middlesex where such clinics were essential to the community. I hope that the Minister will address this point and promise that those services will be brought back.</p>

It is not there to allow us to abuse our bodies and do what we like, just so that the health service can pick up the tab and make us better, whether ourselves or our children. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

It is also one on which government pronouncements have been comparatively few. I congratulate the noble Baroness on tabling her Question and for the compelling way in which she spoke to it.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="0806102000106"></a>When we look at the statistics for maternal deaths in this country, I think it is important that we do not overplay the scale of the problem. The UK has one of the lowest rates of maternal deaths in the world, but the death rate is beginning to rise. It is about 40 per cent higher than it was 20 years ago, and for the first time deaths from cardiac causes, which are often linked to obesity, are the commonest type of death among women in pregnancy and childbirth. If a woman is obese when she is pregnant, she dramatically increases her risk of death or serious complications in childbirth. The CEMACH report of last December described obesity as,</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_448"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 448</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="0806102000173"></a>&#147;one of the greatest and growing overall threats to the childbearing population of the UK&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806102000162"></a>That is surely a wake-up call.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="0806102000107"></a>The threats are not only the ones directly associated with obesity, like sepsis and blood clots. They also lie in the fact that women from less affluent backgrounds are more likely to be in poor overall health and less likely to have regular contact with maternity services. The evidence of risk is quite clear, and we have heard about it from all noble Lords. An obese woman is three times more likely to miscarry, two or three times more likely to suffer from pre-eclampsia and twice as likely to need a caesarean section. She runs a fourfold risk of having gestational diabetes.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="0806102000108"></a>When we look at the health of the child, there is an equally worrying picture. Obesity in the mother is associated with an increased risk of her baby being born unusually large, which in turn makes it more likely that the child will suffer injury or need intensive care. As the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, said, obese mothers are less likely to breastfeed, which often leads to babies gaining weight more rapidly than they otherwise would. The risk of spina bifida is multiplied threefold. In the longer term, there is evidence that children of obese mothers may be pre-programmed for increased obesity and impaired cardiovascular health when they are older, which tends to suggest that the problem, as the noble Lord, Lord Patel, pointed out, could, in this sense, be self-perpetuating.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="0806102000109"></a>The trouble is that, as so often with health matters, the messages for women are not completely straightforward. Obesity may be harmful, but having a lower than normal body mass index is equally bad. Underweight women are subject to pregnancy-related complications such as giving birth prematurely and having a child of low birth weight. So it is important to be balanced in pitching any public health messages in this area.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="0806102000110"></a>However, even this is far from easy because it is not simply a case of saying to women that before they think of becoming pregnant they should aim for an optimum weight. It has been found that, for women who have already had a child, putting on or taking off weight between pregnancies carries its own quite considerable health risks. Increases in the body mass index of only one or two units were associated with significantly increased rates of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and hypertension, and also led to babies who were excessively large. An increase of more than three body mass index units significantly increased the rate of stillbirth and perinatal complications, quite independently of whether the woman was overweight or not. Equally, women who lost five or more body mass index units between pregnancies were found to have a higher risk of giving birth prematurely than women whose weight remained stable or who gained weight. So gaining or losing a lot of weight between pregnancies poses its own serious risks to a mother's health and to that of her baby. That means that getting to, and keeping to, a normal weight before, during and after pregnancy is, ideally, what women should aim for.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="0806102000111"></a>What we know about the increased risk factors for women in pregnancy does, I think, have some serious implications for IVF services. It has been recognised  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_449"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 449</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for many years that obesity reduces the chances of successfully achieving conception. But if obesity also adds to risk, then it is questionable whether public funds should be spent in cases where the risk factors are very obviously present. Currently, NICE advises that patients should ideally have a BMI of between 19 and 30 when seeking IVF. However, about 18 months ago, doctors in the British Fertility Society recommended that women with a BMI of 36 or more should be disqualified from treatment altogether, and women with a BMI of between 30 and 36 should be accepted only if they engage in a regime of diet and exercise. I should be glad if the Minister would comment on that.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="0806102000112"></a>At the moment, there are no national eligibility criteria: it is up to individual PCTs to set their own limits and restrictions. The result really is, I am afraid, reminiscent of a lottery, and at the very least there must be a case for basing the criteria on the clinical evidence and, at the same time, making them much more transparent. In New Zealand, where strict eligibility limits have been applied based on a woman's BMI index, the results have, I understand, been encouraging, because women are made to take control of their own health.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="0806102000113"></a>Part of the problem with conveying the necessary public health messages about obesity is that even today, after several years of media coverage of the problem, the public are still generally ignorant of the health implications of being obese and why they are so serious. At the same time, social etiquette dictates that we never tell a person to their face that he or she is too fat, because nowadays that is considered offensive. As a result, in many cases, obesity is given every encouragement to continue unchecked. The CEMACH report was quite unequivocal in saying that women who are obese, and especially those who also have a pre-existing medical condition such as diabetes or epilepsy, should have proper counselling and support.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="0806102000114"></a>In my view, the case for the hazards associated with obesity to form a key part of a new national service framework on the care of women before and during pregnancy is compelling. All relevant professionals should be made to appreciate the importance of advice and counselling on obesity in this context; and we should try to look at new ways of bringing home to women contemplating pregnancy that if they are obese or severely overweight they are playing Russian roulette with their lives and the lives of their future children. I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that these matters are receiving a serious degree of thought in his department and that the messages from this debate will be closely heeded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="0806102000117"></a>The CEMACH report, <I>Saving Mothers</I><I>&#146;</I><I> Lives</I>, published in December 2007, looked in detail at the causes of maternal death for the period 2003-05. Overall, the number of women who died of obvious pregnancy-related causes has remained at seven per 100,000 maternities. The report highlighted that maternal obesity is emerging as a major and growing risk factor. Currently, around 20 per cent of all pregnant women have a body mass index of more than 30 and are therefore classified as obese. However, more than half of the mothers who died in the UK between 2003 and 2005, the period covered by this report, were overweight or obese, with 27 per cent of the mothers recorded as obese and more than 15 per cent as morbidly obese.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="0806102000118"></a>The report&#146;s findings reinforces research studies which have produced overwhelming evidence that obesity in pregnancy contributes to increased morbidity and mortality for both the mother and the baby, as eloquently described by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. The evidence is clear on adverse outcomes not just for the mother but also for the baby. For example, CEMACH&#146;s 2005 report into perinatal mortality found that approximately 30 per cent of mothers who had a stillbirth or a neonatal death were also obese.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="0806102000119"></a>How, then, do we tackle these growing problems? Maternity services are already responding by developing local protocols and guidelines. There are a number of national initiatives under way and some further lessons from the research evidence which I would like to highlight. I will also highlight the further work that we will do with experts outside the department to help us collectively address these issues.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="0806102000120"></a>Many noble Lords in this debate raised the issue of prevention.<I></I>Prevention is the best way to tackle this and we should be encouraging weight loss before pregnancy as much as possible as part of our overall strategy to tackle obesity. As <I>Saving Mothers</I><I>&#146;</I><I> Lives</I> says, it is vital that we lose no opportunity to explain clearly but sensitively to women of childbearing age who are overweight or obese about the benefits of achieving a good body weight and adopting a healthy lifestyle before conception.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="0806102000121"></a>There is also a clinical consensus that women with a BMI of over 30 should be cared for by a multidisciplinary maternity team so that their individual needs and risks can be managed. This is the safest form of care for them and their baby. In the case of very obese women, as for any other patient, this will include risk analysis  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_451"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 451</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>decisions about the facilities and resources required to support the birth. To do this effectively, services need to ensure that all pregnant women, and particularly women in relatively high-risk groups including obese women, have access to maternity care early in their pregnancy so that they receive the right advice and get access to the right services from the outset. This is the cornerstone of our maternity policy as set out in <I>Maternity Matters</I>. We will be working with primary care trusts to increase the percentage of women who access services for a full assessment of their needs, risks and choices by the twelfth completed week of pregnancy.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="0806102000122"></a>In 2009, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence will be publishing a tool kit to enable each pregnant woman to have her own risks and needs identified so that she receives the best possible help and support during her pregnancy from the most appropriate professionals. Local protocols have also been developed covering, for example, appropriate scan and screening to enable referral to specialists to manage risks such as diabetes, hypertension and thromboembolism; assessment to identify appropriate facilities and equipment for labour and delivery, including increased diagnostics such as ultrasound, suitable surgical instruments, listening devices and beds; and assessment and management of any complications following the birth.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="0806102000123"></a>Once their individualised care plans have been established, these women will be closely monitored and supported by their midwife, obstetrician and other members of the maternity team, including nutritionists. Women for whom obesity may pose a significant problem at birth will require an antenatal assessment to discuss the least risky method of birth for both themselves and their babies, and an antenatal anaesthetic assessment to discuss analgesia and anaesthesia should caesarean section be necessary.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="0806102000124"></a>Although <I>Maternity Matters </I>gives us the policy framework, there is much more to do to address the problems highlighted in the <I>Saving mothers</I><I>&#146;</I><I> lives</I> report. We are working with outside experts in two areas: improved advice on prevention of excessive weight gain in pregnancy and the scope to develop evidence-based UK guidelines on the optimum management of obese women in pregnancy.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="0806102000125"></a>First, on prevention, we have asked the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to develop guidance on prevention of excessive weight gain in pregnancy. This will add to a suite of guidance on pregnancy and childbirth which already includes guidance for improving nutrition for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. We will also be looking to improve information available to clinicians on the care for this group. We have asked the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to consider developing a national clinical guideline for the management of obese pregnant women, both using the numerous local guidelines already in existence and in light of the results of the current CEMACH and National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit research programmes. The need for such a guideline was a key recommendation in the <I>Saving mothers&#146; lives</I> report. We will work closely with the royal colleges on this.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="0806102000126"></a>On some of the specific issues raised in the debate, I am grateful for the acknowledgment by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, of the polyclinics. I should probably restrain myself from talking about that subject today. However, I could not agree more that we wish to see an NHS in the future not for sickness but for well-being.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="0806102000127"></a>Children and their parents have access to children&#146;s centres, supported by two departments: the Department of Health and the DCSF. These centres bring together services for education and health, and have an important role to play in preventive care. They also provide opportunities for mothers to meet and gain experience and support from these different resources.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="0806102000128"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, mentioned the current guidelines for IVF and the BMI rates. Most PCTs currently have a policy that, before receiving fertility treatment, women should aim to have a BMI of 19 to 30. The NICE fertility guidelines on the assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems say that women with a BMI of more than 29 should be informed that they take longer to conceive and that losing weight is likely to increase the likelihood of conception. They also refer to men; men with a BMI of more than 29 are likely to have reduced fertility.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="0806102000129"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, raised the important point of the role of the Health and Social Care Bill. The Bill includes the provision to inform parents of their child&#146;s weight, height and BMI when measured at school at the entry age of 5 and at age 10 to 11. This will alert parents to their child&#146;s weight and, it is hoped, promote them to take action.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="0806102000130"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Finlay and Lady Tonge, asked what the Government are doing on breastfeeding. Our main challenge is to focus on interventions that will promote breastfeeding. We know that health professionals such as midwives and health visitors can play a vital role in encouraging more mothers to initiate and sustain breastfeeding beyond the early weeks.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="0806102000131"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, mentioned the Government recruiting an additional 4,000 midwives. Many of these midwives will be new to the profession but there are also former midwives whose expertise could be brought back into the NHS. The department, along with the Royal College of Midwives, will therefore launch a return-to-practice campaign this summer, with incentives including free training support with childcare and travel costs.</p>

<a name="80609-0013.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="0806102000132"></a>I am running short of time so I will conclude, but I will be more than happy to address some of the other issues raised today. The Government take very seriously the need to address this country&#146;s obesity epidemic and the health implication which stems from it. I hope I have demonstrated that we take equally seriously the need to support high-risk groups, such as obese women who are, or may become, pregnant, recognising the health impacts for them and their babies, so ably described by noble Lords. I thank the noble Baroness once again for bringing this subject forward and also all the noble Lords who have contributed to today&#146;s important debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="0806102000139"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, proposals for a European Public Prosecutor are not new but, as our European Union Committee stated in its report at paragraph 6.209, this is the first time the structure for implementing this idea has been included in the treaties, and the inclusion of the relevant article makes it more likely that this post will one day be created. We have raised this question from time to time because it causes concern.</p>

<a name="80609-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="0806102000140"></a>This amendment seeks to ensure that Parliament has the opportunity to scrutinise and vote on any proposal to set up the role of a European Public Prosecutor, or to extend his or her role. As with so many other amendments that we on these Benches have tabled, this will not in any way tie the hands of the noble Baroness the Leader of the House or force her or any of her colleagues to take action that they have not already indicated they wish to take. Along with most of the provisions that we have attempted to scrutinise, these two were utterly opposed by the Government originally. Some Labour Back-Benchers in the other place expressed their opposition to them and others in the Liberal Democrat and Labour Parties have admitted that these provisions might be a cause for concern.</p>

<a name="80609-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="0806102000141"></a>I am fully aware that there is a lock on these provisions. It would be necessary for the United Kingdom to opt in to this area before there was any possibility of the public prosecutor having the right to operate here. I am also aware that Ministers say that it is very  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_454"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 454</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>unlikely that we will ever opt in. Unfortunately, we have come to accept that we can take little comfort from such ministerial assurances. I hope I am right in saying that there can be very few remaining in this Chamber who do not accept that a parliamentary vote is a necessary and valuable safeguard to protect against any change in policy on the part of the Government or, indeed, any ministerial U-turn on a subject as important as this. Nor is it just a matter of holding the Government to their stated policy: it is also a matter of protecting the United Kingdom against the negotiating triumph that the Secretary of State claimed in the other place when 38 out of 40 amendments that the Government proposed to the treaty were not accepted.</p>

<a name="80609-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="0806102000142"></a>Many of us have from time to time been troubled by the idea of the public prosecutor. These provisions are therefore worrying and their implementation will always be controversial. I very much hope that I shall be able to persuade the Minister that she ought to give an undertaking to this House that a measure such as this will never be implemented without the profound and meaningful involvement of Parliament. If she is so persuaded, this amendment would be a fast track to bring about that objective. I beg to move.</p>

It assumes that we will have already opted in to Article 86 under the protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland. That is because if we had not opted in by that stage, the Minister would, of necessity, have no part in the adoption of the regulations under Article 86. Frankly, it is very unlikely that any Government of the United Kingdom will wish to opt in to Article 86 in the foreseeable future. Setting up an office of the European Public Prosecutor in the United Kingdom is in my view, and I think that of a large majority of Members of your Lordships&#146; House, neither necessary nor desirable. The European Public Prosecutor may well have a role to play in some other countries, as suggested by the witness mentioned in chapter six, paragraph 200, of the EU Committee&#146;s report. The simplest way of excluding the European Public Prosecutor from operating in the United Kingdom is simply not to opt in.</p>

<a name="80609-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="0806102000144"></a>If the Government wanted to opt in, the best way to provide for parliamentary procedure would have been to require parliamentary consent to the opt-in rather than at the point at which the United Kingdom has to vote on the proposal. But your Lordships&#146; House has decided today not to require a parliamentary procedure in the Bill for opt-ins under Article 3 of the protocol, which covers opt-ins under Article 86 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</p>

<a name="80609-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="0806102000145"></a>For the reasons given by several speakers in the debate on Amendment No. 25, which I will not repeat, I think that that decision was correct. I therefore see no justification for treating the opt-in to the European Public Prosecutor as requiring any different treatment by imposing a parliamentary process at a subsequent stage.</p>

I agree with everything that he said. We have secured  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_455"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 455</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legally watertight safeguards in the treaty against any move towards a European public prosecutor or subsequently, and just as important, towards extending that prosecutor&#146;s role. It is what we would call a double lock. We do not see any need to do anything different from what we have already achieved.</p>

<a name="80609-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="0806102000147"></a>Lock number one, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, is that we apply the UK opt-in. That means that the procedure that I outlined earlier today for your Lordships&#146; House and another place would apply. The proposal would go to the committee and it would be part of the discussions that noble Lords would have in the annual report if we were aware that it was coming. There would be discussions in the committee, which could refer the matter to your Lordships and a vote could be taken, of which the Government would take note.</p>

<a name="80609-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="0806102000148"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that it would be extremely unlikely that we would choose to opt in to such a proposal in any event. However, if we did opt in, if the matter went through that scrutiny-plus procedure, as noble Lords have referred to it, and if we did end up finding ourselves discussing the possibility of establishing the European public prosecutor, we would still have unanimity, which is retained for any decision to establish a prosecutor and to extend the powers of such a prosecutor. So there is a double lock. The opt-in procedure applies, Parliament will let its views be known and the Government will put forward their proposals. The Government would then, if they so chose, which is highly unlikely, have the discussions and could determine by unanimity if they did not wish to participate. That would be the end of that.</p>

<a name="80609-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="0806102000149"></a>As noble Lords will know, under enhanced co-operation, if at least nine other states wish to proceed, they can. That does not affect the United Kingdom in any way, shape or form. It is quite right that the Lisbon treaty gives member states the flexibility to proceed if they choose, but, even if they did, the European public prosecutor would have no role in the UK. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will feel that there are enough safeguards clearly written into the treaty and the procedure to feel comfortable to withdraw his amendment without fear that this is something that would happen by the back door or in any way that he would not be aware of.</p>

I do not want to go back over previous debates, although they have been referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and by the Minister, but I really ought to correct what the noble Baroness said about noble Lords describing the procedure that she outlined earlier as &#147;scrutiny-plus&#148;. I thought that the most effective description of that procedure came from my noble friend Lord Jopling, who pointed out that it is very much a second-tier, or second-class, system.

I recall that, when the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and I sat on a sub-committee of the European Union Committee, we used to hear evidence from time to time about the efficiency that would be introduced by some form of cross-border justice system. Both he and I had a healthy scepticism of any such move in that direction. I suppose what I am seeking to do here is to say that there are a number of other situations where parliamentary approval would be required. After all, all this amendment does is to say that&#151;</p>

I do not wish to second-guess the Minister, but I do not think that she said that a proposal for the European public prosecutor would never happen and would never come forward. She was talking about the safeguards if it ever did. Does the noble Lord accept that the fact that Eurojust is being strengthened under Article 5 of the treaty shows that there is a strong need to enhance the capacity for cross-border investigations and prosecutions in the EU? The fact that Eurojust is being strengthened should weaken the argument for a European public prosecutor. If we can get Eurojust to work as an EU institution&#151;the legislation is going through now to make it an EU body as opposed to just an intergovernmental one&#151;that should, if not obviate, at least weaken the argument for a European public prosecutor. Eurojust has been led by a British official for some years. I am not saying that no one will ever put forward a proposal for an EPP, but that is less likely with Eurojust being strengthened, enhanced and made more effective.</p>

Eurojust&#146;s mission is to support and strengthen co-ordination and co-operation between national investigating and prosecuting authorities in relation to serious crime affecting two or more member states, or requiring prosecution on common bases&#151;on the basis of operations conducted and information supplied by the member states&#146; authorities and Europol. Of course, the European Parliament and the Council are empowered to adopt regulations to determine Eurojust&#146;s structure, operation, field of action and tasks. Those tasks include the co-ordination of such investigations and prosecutions and&#151;the noble Baroness is absolutely right&#151;strengthening judicial co-operation.</p>

However, I go back to our earlier debates and say that there is nothing quite as good as requiring parliamentary approval. That is why I seek to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="0806108000003"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this subject was to some extent covered in Committee in a rather dismissive debate. It is the question of the new presidency roles that are being created, a matter about which the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, who is not in his place because he has not been very well, warned us to be very careful when it came to agreeing to Bills creating new presidential posts, particularly those where the job specification remains gloriously uncompleted. The  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_459"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 459</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>debate in Committee confirmed that it is yet to be decided exactly how these roles will be fulfilled and how they will work. There are some sketchy propositions in the treaty, but that is all.</p>

<a name="80609-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="0806108000004"></a>In Committee it was asserted that the unity of the two posts was unthinkable, that no one was advocating it, that it could not happen under the treaty and so on. It is not quite like that, and we need some more reassurance because it would be sad if&#151;looking back on this time, should some of the predictions that there will be a merger of the two come to fruition&#151;we in this Parliament were criticised for failing to be on our guard. The much quoted Val&#233;ry Giscard d&#146;Estaing said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a><a name="0806108000084"></a>&#147;We will probably have to have at least two executives in the beginning, but the process of reform will not be complete in 12 months&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000064"></a>implying that it would be completed. The Italian Prime Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a><a name="0806108000085"></a>&#147;We should ask ourselves whether it makes sense to maintain two presidents of the executive, one for the Council and the other for the Commission, or whether it would be better to have a single office, presiding over both institutions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000065"></a>The idea is around, and it is not true to say that there is no question of it. We need to be reassured on it.</p>

<a name="80609-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="0806108000005"></a>This amendment simply urges that we should have one more addition to the famous list of passerelle-guarding provisions in Clause 6. We shall come to a good many more of the passerelle issues that somehow got left out of Clause 6. We tried one earlier this evening and, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, reminded us, this House voted the other way, so those provisions, which were more strictly defined as opt-in provisions rather than as passerelles, were excluded. However, this would be a good one to have in the Bill. It is puzzling to know who decided which of the many provisions and passerelles in earlier treaties that are included in the Lisbon treaty should be listed in Clause 6 and which should be left out. That is a puzzling issue, and I shall share some thoughts about that matter with your Lordships in the next amendment. In the mean time, this amendment would be useful and reassuring, and when it eventually happens, if it does, or when the pressure comes up for it, it would prevent future commentators turning round and criticising us for not being on our guard and at least seeking some reassurance that Parliament will be fully involved when and if it occurs. I beg to move.</p>

I remain wholly puzzled about the proposition the noble Lord has put forward. I well understand the need for probing&#151;it is the job of any opposition, and the Opposition are doing it thoroughly&#151;where there are uncertainties, lacunae, matters to be uncovered or potential dangers foreseen, but this is not one of those matters. In no way can the treaty be clearer about the proposition. The treaty was quoted in Committee. The president of the Council cannot also be President of the European Commission. The treaty makes clear that:</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Howell, can feel confident that no one will ever accuse him of that. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, said, the treaty itself is extremely explicit so far as the responsibilities of the President of the Commission are concerned, in a way that seriously and totally precludes the sort of nightmare scenario suggested in this amendment. I would have thought&#151;the noble Baroness the Leader of the House can no doubt confirm this&#151;that in order for this to come about, you would have to change the treaty. In which case you do not need this amendment, because if you change the treaty you will have to have the full ratification procedure as laid down, and as we are now painfully but enjoyably undergoing in this House.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="0806108000010"></a>If the noble Lord receives sufficient satisfaction from the Leader of the House I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="0806108000011"></a><a name="80609-0015.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80609-0015.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0806108000116"></a>Lord Wallace of Saltaire:</b> My Lords, the justification for moving the amendment is not that this is likely but that &#147;the idea is around&#148;. A great many ideas about European integration are around. During the dinner hour I ran across the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, on his way home and I upbraided him for going home. I was imagining that if he had stayed here he might have wanted to raise the question of whether it was possible to envisage a European federation eventually having a European emperor. After all, there are some candidates for this&#151;a Hohenzollern or two, a Bonaparte and a Habsburg. Some of us have met Otto von Habsburg, who was a Member of the European Parliament for the Christian Social Union in Bavaria. Some noble Lords may also remember a wonderful story. He was asked one evening whether he was going to watch the Austria-Hungary football match. He said, &#147;Yes, perhaps I will. Who are we playing against?&#148;.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="0806108000012"></a>The fact that these ideas are around does not necessarily mean that we should be taking them seriously. In the <I>Daily Mail</I> this morning, Melanie Phillips tells us that the European Union is incompatible with democracy. The idea is around. Should we take it seriously? There are some on the Conservative Benches who do take that seriously, but I trust that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, does not.</p>

What I interpreted from our previous discussions, as noble Lords have just done, is that there is very little to say on the matter, because the treaty is so clear. It is therefore difficult to extrapolate in great detail. Let me say that noble Lords who have just spoken are right that the treaty is clear. Article 245 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union states:</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_461"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 461</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="0806108000104"></a>&#147;members of the Commission may not, during their term of office, engage in any other occupation&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000066"></a>as my noble friend Lord Anderson said. Article 17(3) of the treaty on European Union says that members of the Commission, which includes the president,</p>
<ul><a name="0806108000105"></a>&#147;shall neither seek nor take instructions from any Government or other institution, body, office or entity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000067"></a>If we have three positions and two of them are forbidden to hold any other role, then&#151;unless my logic has gone completely astray&#151;you cannot double hat any one of them. There are not enough of them to achieve that.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="0806108000014"></a>The first proposition is that the treaty does not allow it: it is not a question of interpretation and there is no ambiguity; it is absolute clarity. Equally under the treaty there is no provision that we could do this by any passerelle provision: it is not there and does not exist. Indeed, as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, has said, the only way that the two posts could be merged would be by a treaty change and that could happen only via an Act of Parliament, because this would be an EU amending treaty and it would have to be approved by an Act of Parliament.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="0806108000015"></a>Noble Lords opposite have said that in their view, the most positive way to ensure that nothing that they are fearful of happens is by Act of Parliament; here it is. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

I say to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, that the old jokes are definitely the best and I look forward to more old jokes from that direction.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="0806108000017"></a>I am a bit reassured by the noble Baroness that, although this raises a much broader question, in the treaty and the Bill as they are presented to us, the ideas that I have been taken to task for saying are around&#151;and they certainly are; I have many more quotations that I could bring to your Lordships&#146; attention, but I shall not&#151;are unlikely to happen, or could not happen, without changes. I am interested that she thinks that there is no loophole through the passerelle system, but that it would require a new treaty or a major amendment to the treaty and an Act of Parliament. That is the kind of language that we like on this side of the debate. One of our worries&#151;this is almost bringing me on to the next amendment, so I shall say only a few words&#151;is that this is the very open-ended treaty. It is a treaty made of that substance&#151;amoebic jelly, or something&#151;that keeps expanding in horror films. One just does not know what kind of powers can be introduced and at what point.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="0806108000018"></a>In a moment, I will come in detail not only to the passerelle loophole, but to others and to the question repeatedly asked from this side of whether our constitutional system, our Parliament, has enough control over the movement and redistribution of powers in the European Union. Some of them may be unfavourable to us; some of them may be helpful. That is the background against which one still asks whether we can have the total reassurance that we require. The noble Baroness is in a reassuring mode, and I am reassured by her, at least for the moment, so I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="0806108000022"></a>That sounds like yet another debate on passerelles but of course it goes much further than that. We now have another article&#151;I hesitate to state the number because in my copy of the treaty it is Article 308, but I believe that it has somehow become Article 352. That has received curiously little attention, but it is an article that we should discuss and consider carefully if we are to attempt to do our duty in examining the whole Bill properly. The article, which in my version of the treaty is Article 308, but which I think has become Article 352, states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a><a name="0806108000092"></a>&#147;If action by the Union should prove necessary, within the framework of the policies defined by the Treaties, to attain one of the objectives set out in the Treaties, and the Treaties have not provided the necessary powers, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000068"></a>a body about which we have heard an awful lot recently&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0806108000106"></a>&#147;shall adopt the appropriate measures. Where the measures in question are adopted by the Council in accordance with a special legislative procedure, it shall also act unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000069"></a>Could we have some real illumination of the real implications of that, what it might mean in the future and what we are signing up to? It is not very clear, it needs to be clear and we need to have the right clarification on the record.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="0806108000023"></a>In addition, I have some comments on the objectives of the treaty and the powers that can be mobilised to achieve them. We had a very interesting debate this afternoon. My noble friend Lord Hunt made a brilliant speech&#151;alas it did not carry the day in votes, but it was brilliant all the same&#151;on the proposals in the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad.  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_463"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 463</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The debate was really all about whether opting in should have the same parliamentary brakes on it and the same statutory controls in the Bill as the other passerelles in Clause 6. The House decided that it should not.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="0806108000024"></a>The excellent report of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, also reminded us of what might be called the hidden worry about the treaty: the whole range of other passerelles that it has inherited from past treaties and that are not listed in Clause 6 and are not in the Bill. There is a whole string of them. After the debate, I learnt by looking at a document that had been deposited on my desk that the Government had replied to the Bill and the treaty of Lisbon implications for the UK constitution. I refer to the report of the Constitution Committee, which unfortunately had not reached me. Ministers may say that that is the incompetence of my not-very-large organisation, that it should have reached me and that it was tabled and reached the Printed Paper Office, but I felt it rather sad that it did not reach me until this afternoon after the debate. I may be wrong. Perhaps the noble Baroness referred to it in the debate. I am not sure whether she did. Perhaps she could tell us when she comments in a moment. Here it is, and it is full of information that I wish I had had&#151;I also wish my noble friend Lord Hunt had had it because he did not have it either&#151;for this afternoon.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="0806108000025"></a>I shall concentrate in particular on the information that was prompted by the comments in the report by the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, which suggests that past issues under the parallel procedures should also be taken into account. Indeed, the report says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a><a name="0806108000093"></a>&#147;We call on the Government to provide a list enumerating all these provisions in order to allow Parliament to consider during the passage of the Bill whether each one should or should not be subject to parliamentary control under clause 6&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000070"></a>That is quite an important statement, which did not feature very much this afternoon. If I had known the nature of the Government&#146;s reply to it, I would have certainly urged others to raise it or raised it myself. It tells us that there is indeed a big and powerful list of issues that allow treaty changes without resort to any kind of intergovernmental conference.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="0806108000026"></a>There is the provision in the first paragraph, which allows the European Council by unanimity&#151;that is quite fair; I am not making QMV points at this stage&#151;to amend the number of commissions. That is an old one, but it is there still. There is the provision that allows the Council to strengthen or to add to citizens&#146; rights. That is an important provision that comes from a previous treaty&#151;the Maastricht treaty&#151;and is there still. One is always open to the gibe, &#147;Why didn&#146;t you think of more accountability on that at the time of the Maastricht treaty?&#148;. &#147;I do not know, I cannot remember&#148;, is my answer. Now that we are piling up these provisions, which allow the treaty to be elasticised and expanded, we are starting to become anxious about it, and rightly so.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0806108000027"></a>There is the provision that allows the Council to confer jurisdiction on the European Court of Justice in disputes relating to legal acts creating EU intellectual property rights. We did not hear much about that this afternoon; yet here is an important provision, again inherited I think from the treaty of Nice but one that  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_464"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 464</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could be used in the future and that allows an extension of the powers and involvement of the ECJ. Another provision allows the Council to add to the list of criminal offences defined at EU level and, again, every member state must agree, but there it is. A &#147;member state&#148; means a government in the European Parliament&#151;not the national Parliaments, incidentally&#151;so that one could be flicked through. There is a provision that allows the Council to add to matters for which directives can be made on criminal procedural law. Again, member states must agree in the European Parliament. Another provision is to extend the European public prosecutor&#146;s powers to include serious crime having a cross-border dimension; and so on. I quote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a><a name="0806108000094"></a>&#147;Each of these passerelles is limited to specific and clearly demarcated policy changes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000071"></a>As I have emphasised, they do not provide a specific move from unanimity to QMV, although presumably under other parts of the passerelle machinery they could be moved from specific unanimity to QMV.</p>
<a name="time_33"></a>
<a name="80609-0015.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="0806108000111"></a>9.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="0806108000028"></a>So I have a little complaint. It is fair enough for the Government to confine their own information to the debate and everything else, but we are trying to improve this Bill. So far we have not had all that much success because zero amendments have been achieved, but even by our debate, if not by voting things through, we are trying to improve it. It would have been helpful for those of us who have the honour, the privilege and the duty to move these various amendments in order to fulfil our line-by-line examination and duty to get the right documents at the right time.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="0806108000029"></a>I repeat that this document arrived on my desk after the debate on the committee&#146;s report this afternoon. I do not think that that is right. But that is probably background to the broader issue of the need to look very carefully at the ways in which the powers exist and can be expanded, developed, lengthened and strengthened for achieving the treaty&#146;s objectives, and how that can be done with or without proper parliamentary control. We prefer it to be with effective parliamentary control and not too much power for the Executive. Others have a different view. I understand it, but I think that it is wrong and out of date. In the mean time, I beg to move.</p>

<a name="0806108000030"></a><a name="80609-0015.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80609-0015.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0806108000120"></a>Lord Dykes:</b> My Lords, following the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Howell, one is bound to express some sympathy. It is always very awkward for any Members, particularly those who are proposing amendments, not to have the chance of seeing crucial documents at the right time. I do not seek to interfere or to explain the background because I am not aware of it. However, in contrast to that, throughout our proceedings in Committee and on Report I have found&#151;I think that other noble Lords would echo this&#151;that the Government have been very assiduous and efficient in making sure that Members are well informed in advance on all the modalities and matters to do with any amendments that are tabled and so on. So I repeat my feeling of surprise that that has apparently happened and I, too, look forward to hearing the explanation of Leader of the House in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Howell.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_465"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 465</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80609-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0806108000031"></a>I do not wish to embarrass the noble Lord, but I also have some sympathy with him on his initial remarks about Amendment No. 28E. As he said, this refers to Article 352 of the TFEU, which was originally the famous Article 308. Bearing in mind that on the previous amendment my noble friend Lord Wallace said that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, had apparently gone home, I couple my surprise and sympathy for  the noble Lord, Lord Howell, with shock because the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, used regularly to raise the famous Article 308 matters in legislative proposals and in parliamentary Questions. For him to miss this opportunity on such an important matter seems to be surprising.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="0806108000032"></a>Noble Lords will remember that the famous old Article 308 gave those extra powers to the Union or the Community and the Council of Ministers to make decisions where there was nothing covered in other treaty articles and provisions. The flexibility clause, as it has been named colloquially, gives the Union institutions the ability to adopt measures to achieve one of the objectives set out in the treaties where the treaties themselves do not provide the necessary powers. This means the Council acting by unanimity in adopting the measures and there is, therefore, always the use by member states of the national veto if that is deemed to be necessary. One would expect that to be a very rare occurrence.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="0806108000033"></a>The flexibility of the clause therefore is more to do with competence and implied powers of the Union rather than the flexibility of either the interpretation of the treaty articles or the flexibility of member states to opt in or opt out of the provisions. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, alluded to a number of changes made to the article. In particular, the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="0806108000107"></a>&#147;the objective of the measure is in relation to the internal market&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000072"></a>has been removed. The original justification for Article 308 was to deal with those matters in the internal market provisions that were not going to be covered by other treaty articles. There was a good deal of United Kingdom sympathy for that, because of our deep affection for the single market and the creation of the internal trading market of the European Union. This contrasted with our objections about extending powers in other areas of the Community&#146;s endeavours in future legislation. The article has since been expanded to state that national parliaments will be informed of the proposals of any measure that will not lead to harmonisation of the laws of the member states. The article cannot serve as a basis for legislation in relation to CFSP.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0806108000034"></a>Sometimes there are misunderstandings in these matters. One can range over a number of issues that come up in respect of this article and other examples not related to this. I have&#151;quite legitimately&#151;come into possession of a copy of a recent ministerial letter to a noble Lord. I will not name the Cross-Bench Peer. I tried to find him this evening to ask if I could mention his name. I could not find him and therefore, for what I am sure are understandable reasons, I prefer not to name him. The ministerial reply is dated 29 May. It is from the Government and concerns the anxieties of the noble Lord, Lord X, about whether, if  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_466"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 466</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>one burned the European Union flag, one could be prosecuted under UK law for stirring up racial hatred or animosity. The ministerial reply states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a><a name="0806108000095"></a>&#147;I can confirm that, in itself, burning the European Union flag would not lead to prosecution under racial hatred legislation in the UK. Where the flag belonged to someone other than the individual who set fire to it, it might be possible for the individual to be prosecuted for criminal damage. In addition, if the individual&#146;s behaviour more generally was deemed to stir up hatred or public disorder, their actions might be investigated with a view to prosecution&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000073"></a>It continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74"></a><a name="0806108000096"></a>&#147;If a directive in this area were to be proposed under the Lisbon treaty, the UK opt-out would apply&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000074"></a>Noble Lords getting into such phantasmagorical territory as the voluntary or compulsory burning of the EU flag in order to make a point against the European Union seems to us on these Benches utterly daft. What on earth are people anxious about in the rational development of the modern European Union of 27 countries&#146; machinery to make the working of the Union effective? One must have that essential machinery: that is what the Lisbon treaty Bill is about.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0806108000035"></a>I find the anxieties about Article 352 also to be overstated by people thinking that it is an &#147;open sesame&#148; to any agreement on extending powers. After all, it has to be by unanimity&#151;we need to keep reminding ourselves about that. Some noble Lords, because of their original views and antipathy towards the European Community and all its works, get carried away with a lot of nonsense on these occasions. We were reassured on 13 March by the famous Lisbon treaty impact assessment of the EU Select Committee, of which I have the honour to be a member. It stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a><a name="0806108000097"></a>&#147;Article 352(2) of the TFEU, which applies the yellow card procedure expressly to measures under Article 352, (the &#145;flexibility clause&#146; ... ) does not add anything of substance. Proposals adopted on the basis of Article 308 are no different from other proposals and fall under the subsidiary monitoring procedures without any special article. ... The reformulation of Article 308 to exclude the reference to &#145;the operation of the common market&#146; makes clear that, in future, new Article 352 can be applied to any area of the EU&#146;s activities&#151;except CFSP&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80609-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0806108000036"></a>I think it is fair to say that the Committee did not sound worried about that. It seemed to be a common-sense addition, as the growth of the treaty has meant other activities must be covered. As the Lisbon treaty puts it beyond doubt that the Article 308 machinery does not allow the EU to expand or circumvent the limits set by the treaties&#151;</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a><a name="0806108000098"></a>&#147;Measures based on this Article may not entail harmonisation of Member States&#146; laws or regulations in cases where the [treaties] exclude such harmonisation&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000075"></a>I am reassured, and I think that Members on these Benches are reassured, by these welcome declarations.</p>

<a name="80609-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="0806108000037"></a>The further clarification we have is that not only is CFSP excluded, which has reassured a number of noble Lords in recent debates, but that the consent of the European Parliament is also now required. Personally, I welcome that, but I accept the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that it needs to be explained more thoroughly by the Government. Finally, we have a veto. There is a famous obsession with vetoes, but in this case it might be justified depending on what matter needed to be vetoed in the future. In the mean time, we feel that it is not necessary for the amendment to be pressed tonight.</p>

It is something of a miracle that the authors of the treaty of Lisbon have managed to arrange the same three figures in a different order. I am sure that if the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, had been in his place he would have told us that it had some cabbalistic significance equal almost to 666 being the sign of the devil, but he is not here so we shall be spared that. However, it is Article 235 of the Rome treaty which noble Lords opposite ratified along with the rest of us when we joined the European Community, as it then was.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="0806108000039"></a>Is it a passerelle? No, it is not. A passerelle is a provision that enables the Council to change something in the Lisbon treaty without going through the whole process of treaty change. This provision does not allow that. It allows the Council to do something which is not provided for in the Lisbon or any other treaty if, by unanimity, the Council so wishes to do it. That is not a passerelle, I am sorry to say, so it is wrong to call it that. It is a provision, I agree, that allows for some flexibility, and in the past it has been used&#151;quite often, or in fact invariably&#151;with the agreement of this country because it has been seen to be in our overall interest. Since it requires unanimity, I have no doubt that that is the touchstone that will be applied in the future.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="0806108000040"></a>As to the past passerelles of which noble Lords have been reminded by a letter from the Leader of the House, I say merely that it is an admirable thing to have done. It is quite right to remind us that they exist, but they are not in any sense sinister. They are something to which successive British Governments have agreed over the years and fall, therefore, under the rubric of pactus sunt servanda, which now that the Mayor of London is favouring the use of Latin in schools, will perhaps come to be more regularly understood and less mocked than it has been in the past. It is a fairly important aspect of the way the European Union works. It is right that the Government have reminded noble Lords of the existence of these passerelles&#151;they are passerelles that have been agreed in the past&#151;and how they continue to exist, but I do not think there is anything sinister about them. I hope that, on reflection and in the light of assurances given by the Leader of the House, the noble Lord will feel it is possible not to proceed with the amendment.</p>

<a name="0806108000041"></a><a name="80609-0016.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80609-0016.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0806108000122"></a>Lord Blackwell:</b> My Lords, this is one of the most significant provisions in the treaty and it is sad that having run out of time to discuss it in Committee, we are now considering it at this late hour on Report. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, says that it is not a passerelle, but this is a measure which allows the EU, through the Council, to extend its competences. Under this clause, the EU can take powers to pursue its objectives where the treaties do not provide for them. As we know, the objectives are set out in very broad terms in Articles 2 and 3 of the treaty, and at the moment at the end of Article 3 it states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a><a name="0806108000099"></a>&#147;The Union shall pursue its objectives by appropriate means commensurate with the competences which are conferred upon it in the treaties&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000076"></a>So it is limited to the competences in these treaties.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_468"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 468</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="time_34"></a>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="0806108000042"></a>We have heard a lot about the fact that the competences of the EU are only those set out in these treaties. Lo and behold, we now have an article which says that if there is a competence that the EU needs to pursue those objectives but which is not set out in the treaties, we can decide to adopt that competence. I do not find much reassurance in the constraint that if the treaty says you cannot harmonise laws, then it cannot be used to harmonise laws. I am aware of only a small number of cases where the treaty specifically prohibits harmonisation of laws&#151;some under the area of freedom, security and justice&#151;but I do not think most competences that the EU might want to take on are covered by that restriction. Yes, it excludes defence and foreign affairs, for which we should be grateful, but that still allows huge scope for extension of competences to achieve these very broad objectives in Article 3 for any measures that the EU wants to take which are not currently set out in this treaty.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="0806108000043"></a>It is true that Article 308 provided very similar powers and the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, is right that those went back to earlier treaties, but they were, as was described earlier, constrained in the wording of the earlier article by the need for the measures to be necessary for the operation of the Common Market or the internal market. That is a very different scope from a clause which removes that condition and allows any competence to be taken on board to meet any of these very broad objectives which, I remind your Lordships, include things such as achieving a highly competitive social market economy, social progress, technological advance, and solidarity between generations. There is no end of things that could be taken on board to meet those objectives under this clause.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="0806108000044"></a>As we know from the inquiries made by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, of various Ministers across the Dispatch Box, Article 308 has been used in the past to provide measures which went beyond the internal market because, although we are told that the European Court never exceeds what the treaty says, the law has been interpreted here in a very permissive way to allow Article 308 to be stretched beyond the original meaning. In that sense, this clause tries to legitimise the abuse that has been made of Article 308 in the past, but in doing so it not only legitimises that position but opens up huge opportunities for further development of competences under this treaty. To my mind, that would traditionally have needed a new treaty. Extending the competences of the European Union should not happen without a proper treaty. This article allows it to be done by unanimity, but by the Executive.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="0806108000045"></a>The whole purpose of these amendments is to ensure that there is proper parliamentary scrutiny of things which otherwise would have required treaties. I am amazed, and would have brought this up in  Committee if we had discussed it, that this is the one huge provision which is not included in the Bill  under Clause 6, where the Government believe that parliamentary control of decisions is needed. Paragraphs (a) to (i) are listed but the biggest gateway to the adoption of new competences is not apparently seen as worthy of the same level of parliamentary scrutiny as the other decisions listed under Clause 6. I believe it

If the Government were to add it to the provisions in Clause 6, that would be a satisfactory measure. In the absence of that, I believe that this amendment is essential to protect proper parliamentary scrutiny of the treaty. If my noble friend is not satisfied tonight, I very much hope that he might consider bringing this back at Third Reading. I think it is far too important to pass at this late hour without proper debate.</p>

<a name="0806108000046"></a><a name="80609-0016.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80609-0016.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0806108000123"></a>Baroness Ludford:</b> My Lords, I have a somewhat different view and interpretation of Article 352 from that of the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell. He said that it allows the EU to take any measure that it wants. I do not think that that is correct. I would even take issue with his description that it allows the EU to extend competences. It uses the words:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78"></a><a name="0806108000100"></a>&#147;If action by the Union should prove necessary, within the framework of the policies defined by the Treaties, to attain one of the objectives set out in the Treaties&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000077"></a>This has to fit within a policy in the treaties to obtain one of the objectives. I do not think, therefore, that you are extending competences if you invoke Article 352 and it is certainly does not apply to any measure that the EU might want to take.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0806108000047"></a>We have had a lot of talk this afternoon and this evening about double locks and triple locks. I think that there is a seven-part lock on this article. The first is the use of the word &#147;necessary&#148;, as opposed to &#147;useful&#148; or &#147;desirable&#148;. I am sure that there would be litigation over the term &#147;necessary&#148;, if necessary. Then you have this criterion referring to action,</p>
<ul><a name="0806108000108"></a>&#147;within the framework of the policies defined by the Treaties, to attain one of the objectives set out in the Treaties&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80609-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0806108000048"></a>That is the second lock. Then you have the need for unanimity, which means a veto, including by the UK or other member states. Then you have to obtain the consent of the European Parliament. Then there is the yellow and orange card procedure for national parliaments. I would say that, with the European Parliament role and the national parliamentary role, there is proper parliamentary scrutiny, as well as what would happen at Westminster under whatever procedures are agreed here. I do not accept that there is no proper parliamentary scrutiny. Then you have Article 3, which the noble Lord dismissed. I happen to think that it is quite important. It states strongly and clearly:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79"></a><a name="0806108000101"></a>&#147;Measures based on this Article shall not entail harmonisation of Member States&#146; laws or regulations in cases where the Treaties exclude such harmonisation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80609-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="0806108000049"></a>Finally, as has been said, this cannot be used to extend the CFSP provisions or, indeed, something do with Article 40&#151;I think that it is to do with agriculture, but I am afraid that that is outside my pay grade. I just submit that there are considerable safeguards within Article 352. The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, described it as meaning that you can just come along and say, &#147;We want to do something else&#148;. That is a misrepresentation of Article 352.</p>

Copies were placed in the Printed Paper Office, where noble Lords have been able to find it since last Wednesday. It was sent to the Libraries of both Houses. I also asked that it should go to Members who had spoken in debate. I will have to check whether that happened, as I have not had a chance to go back to my office. Certainly, all the usual procedures of how we publish a document were followed. I referred to the response at least once earlier in today&#146;s debate. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, found it on his desk. I am not suggesting that he was implying that that was my fault, as it certainly was not. I have obeyed, as noble Lords would expect, every process. In fact, I have done everything that I can think of to inform noble Lords, including copying every letter to everybody. Every process has been adhered to extremely strictly. I hope that the noble Lord will accept that that was the case.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="0806108000051"></a>While noble Lords were talking, I was just reminding myself of what Article 352 says. When we talk about it, it is important to consider it in the context of what the words actually mean. I am just going to read a little bit of what Article 352 says. It is the updated version of Article 308, which I know has been an issue that scrutiny committees in your Lordships&#146; House and another place have raised before. Noble Lords referred to the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch. He is not the only one, but he is certainly the most assiduous person in this. I am sorry that he is not here, but that is his choice, as indeed it was the choice of noble Lords opposite to debate this amendment as this time of night. We have a whole day left and, at the moment, only one amendment down. We could certainly have discussed this much earlier in the day if noble Lords had wished to, but the choice was not mine.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0806108000052"></a>The article says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80"></a><a name="0806108000102"></a>&#147;If action by the Union should prove necessary, within the framework of the policies defined in the Treaties, to attain one of the objectives set out in the Treaties, and the Treaties have not provided the necessary powers, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, shall adopt the appropriate measures&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806108000078"></a>There are quite important caveats built into that: unanimity; the proposal from the Commission and consent of the Parliament, which is new; and making sure that it is concerned with what is provided within the treaties and not beyond. Noble Lords will know that that has been important from a UK point of view in, for example, providing financial assistance to third countries, including Lebanon and Georgia, where we were concerned to ensure that there was macroeconomic stabilisation. So there is a value to this article&#151;formerly Article 308, now Article 352&#151;in helping us to address issues that could not have been foreseen but are absolutely within the treaty, and in ensuring that the safeguards are completely clear.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="0806108000053"></a>As noble Lords have said, let us be clear as to what those are. I have described one as unanimity, which means that the UK&#151;and any other member state&#151;can say no. We have talked about the consent of the European Parliament, so the democratic institution in Europe will have the right to say yes or no. Of course, as the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, mentioned,  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_471"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 471</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>national Parliaments will be able to play what have become known as yellow or orange cards; they could be used in this context, to raise concerns with the Commission and for Parliaments to say that this is not a way forward that they find acceptable. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, made it clear that it is not a passerelle. It does not change the treaty, because it can only be used to give effect to a treaty objective: something that has already been determined. I have outlined what the procedure would be.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="0806108000054"></a>The Government&#146;s position is clear. We have listened with enormous care to the scrutiny committees. In our response to the Constitution Committee, we have also made it clear that every explanatory memorandum submitted to the committees for proposals with what was Article 308 as the sole legal basis has contained an explanation of the justification of the use of that article. We will continue in exactly the same vein under Article 352.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="0806108000055"></a>There is a welcome clarification in what has been described under Article 352. The procedure that will be used and the consents that will be needed are clearer. As I have already indicated, we of course have a veto on it. I therefore hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="0806108000056"></a><a name="80609-0016.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80609-0016.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0806108000125"></a>Lord Howell of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness, and quite accept that if my postal systems are not all that marvellous and things come through slowly it is nothing to do with her; it is my fault. However, my noble friend Lord Hunt, who has been intimately involved in the handling of the Bill throughout, has still not received his copy either. Maybe, therefore, something more than just my own postal system is at fault. I am sure that she would be ready to check with her office as to what, exactly, happened in the case of myself and my noble friend. If I sometimes get a feeling that we are having to fight with wooden rifles and pitchforks against the government juggernaut, I will try to dismiss them and use the modern weaponry of debate and opposition.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="0806108000057"></a>The noble Baroness has given some reassurances, but they do not meet the general unease that runs through many of our queries about the distribution of powers. Power is a reality; it empowers those who can use it, who need to use it with humility, respect and care. Wherever it is being tossed around, acquired, redistributed, taken or given, we must be on our guard. Our parliamentary system has not been too bad at that over its lifetime and through its evolution.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="0806108000058"></a>I was not saying that this provision was a passerelle. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, was quite right if he thought I was comparing it to a passerelle, but I was adding it to the general bundle of propositions and provisions in the treaty and the Bill which seem to  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_472"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column 472</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>open doors rather than close them. Far from supporting the Prime Minister&#146;s view that there will be no more change or institutional reorganisation in the European Union, they imply that there is going to be a lot more and that were are going to be watching and, I hope, debating and having some control and final parliamentary say over a whole series of movements of power upwards and maybe, as the noble Baroness was suggesting, downwards as well. That will be the day.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="0806108000059"></a>We have not heard much about this recently but it used to be the dream of many modern reformers in the European Union that the acquis should be unravelled and revived, and that the acquis powers that have accumulated over two, three or four decades and belong to a different era should now be transferred back to the nation state. That would be the position of the real liberal moderniser in Europe today. About that we have heard nothing and certainly the treaty does nothing towards that end. It talks about subsidiarity. We hope that is going to work better than in the past but that is very different from what I am saying. We do not need in the modern age such a centralisation of powers and initiatives. We can live with more disparity. We heard the cries of the lawyers earlier that we had to have a harmony of legal authority in the ECJ and what chaos there would be without one supreme legal authority throughout the Union, obviously extending its powers now with the collapse of Pillar 3 into a single pillar. But wherever we can, and even against the instinct of the lawyers and other centralisers, we want to be looking the other way towards decentralisation and variety within the overall scope of the club that is the European Union which, contrary to constant speeches from over my right shoulder, we support and always have supported and believe is an immensely important part of the armoury and membership of this country in its pursuit of its international objectives.</p>

<a name="80609-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="0806108000060"></a>This debate is part of a broader scene which confirms that this Bill extends competences. The list is there. It extends the QMV areas to between 51 and 61&#151;I forget the names. It extends the powers of the European Parliament, which badly needs to reform itself, if we read it aright. I would say, in coming to the end of our debates, it has been a bad day for parliaments and this Parliament and a good day for Executive power. I hope those who have done that task will reflect on what they have achieved. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08060912000008"></a>Clause 1 [<I>Amount to be specified as upper earnings limit: Great Britain</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="08060912000009"></a><a name="80609-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80609-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08060912000145"></a>Baroness Noakes</b> moved Amendment No. 1:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060912000130"></a> Clause 1, page 1, line 4, leave out &#147;&#147;which&#148; to the end&#148; and insert &#147;&#147;those of&#148; to the end and insert &#147;the upper earnings limit from 2010&#151;11 shall be made in accordance with section 5A below&#148;&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000010"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 in this group, which concerns the value of the upper earnings limit.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000011"></a>This is not a long Bill and the list of amendments is necessarily short. I had also sought to table amendments dealing with the value of the primary threshold, but these were ruled inadmissible on the basis that they did not fall within the Long Title, which refers only to the upper earnings limit. Despite that, when speaking to these amendments, I shall also address the primary threshold, as it raises issues identical to those of the upper earnings limit.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000012"></a>The Bill has been presented by the Government as simplification but we are not fooled. It is just another way for the Government to raise money to shore up the poor and deteriorating government finances. It raises some &#163;2 billion a year, which is not an inconsiderable sum, and that is why the Government are particularly keen on it. The Minister will be pleased to know that I shall not spend all afternoon rehearsing that argument. Instead, for the purpose of this group of amendments and the next, I shall enter the Government&#146;s world and pretend that the Bill is all about harmonisation.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000013"></a>I remind the Committee that this harmonisational simplification involves harmonising the national insurance and tax thresholds so that, in general terms, below a certain level a person pays neither tax nor national insurance and above a certain level he pays the higher rate but only the 1 per cent rate of national insurance. This nice theory has the taxpayer paying basic rate income tax and the normal national insurance contributions on the same tranche of income. If that were the position in the current fiscal year&#151;and before the U-turn on the 10p rate, which I shall address in particular in the next debate&#151;the theory runs that someone earning less than &#163;5,435 would pay no tax or national insurance, for income levels between &#163;5,435 and &#163;41,435 an individual would pay basic rate tax at 20 per cent and national insurance at 11 per cent, and above that he would pay higher rate tax of 40 per cent and national insurance of 1 per cent.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC112"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column GC112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000014"></a>With regard to the lower limits, the personal allowance for income tax and the primary threshold for national insurance have been aligned since, I believe, 2001, but the upper earnings limit has always been below the higher rate threshold. It is now being raised in two stages. In the current fiscal year it is being raised by 75 per cent over inflation but it needs to be raised further next year to catch up with the higher rate threshold. The Government have also announced that, having harmonised and simplified the two rates, they want to add another &#163;800 on to the two together, as in that way the amount of national insurance that can be grabbed is maximised.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000015"></a>That would have been a problem in the context of the current requirements of Section 5 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 because of the restriction in that Act on raising the upper earnings limit to between 6.5 and 7.5 times the primary threshold. We accept that that is a problem in achieving that harmonisation, but the Government&#146;s response in the Bill is to remove any restriction whatever on where the upper earnings limit can be set. That is what Clause 1(1)(b) does. A consequence of bringing together the upper earnings limit and the higher rate threshold at the proposed new level is that the Government have removed any restraints on the point at which the UEL can be set. All that the Government offer in return for that extraordinary power is the affirmative procedure when setting the UEL. The Minister will be aware from many discussions on the subject that we do not regard the affirmative procedure as affording much protection against the misuse of power. It is better than the negative procedure, but only marginally so.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000016"></a>Under the guise of achieving harmonisation in tax and national insurance, the Government have achieved an even greater prize&#151;no restriction of any substance on the amount at which they can set the UEL and therefore collect national insurance at 11 per cent. It used to be the settled policy of the Labour Party that the upper earnings limit would be abolished so that the top rate would be payable on earnings without limit. The Labour Party abandoned that&#151;along with the now noble Lord, Lord Kinnock&#151;after 1992 to get elected, but there is nothing to say that that policy might not re-emerge; there will be no statutory protection against it.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000017"></a>I said earlier that I would enter into the Government&#146;s world of harmonisation, and that is precisely what this group of amendments seeks to do. I accept that the Government want to harmonise the upper limits and that current law puts an obstacle in their way. My amendments fully allow the harmonisation at the higher level that the then Chancellor announced in the 2007 Budget but, it having been aligned at the higher level in 2010, my amendments would take effect from 2010-11 onwards and mirror the indexation of the rates and thresholds that apply for income tax purposes. That mechanism is known as the Rooker-Wise amendment after the now noble Lord, Lord Rooker, who achieved it when he was in another place. It applies the RPI to uplift tax limits and allowances annually. The wording of my amendment is lifted directly from the Income Tax Act 2007, which as part of the Tax Law Rewrite Project simplified the wording of Rooker-Wise.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC113"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column GC113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000018"></a>Amendment No. 2&#151;the substantive amendment in the group&#151;provides that the UEL will rise by not more than RPI. In that, it mirrors what Sections 21 and 57 of the Income Tax Act 2007 do in relation to the basic rate limit and the personal allowance, which together make the point at which the higher rate of tax takes over. If the Government mean what they say about harmonisation&#151;I am trying hard to take them at their word&#151;the amendment achieves what they want to do. At the same time, my amendment provides reassurance to the body of national insurance payers that the limit cannot be hiked for the kind of tax-raising reasons that, in truth, lie behind the Bill. If the Government decide that they want to raise the UEL by an amount above inflation in future, they will have to come to Parliament using primary legislation. If necessary, they would have to introduce a one-clause Bill increasing the limit. Having done that, indexation could kick in again at whatever higher level was taken in primary legislation.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000019"></a>We do not think that that will cause the Government any trouble at all. The rates of tax and national insurance are announced in the Pre-Budget Report, and if there were to be another major reassessment of levels, which could well happen from time to time, the Government would have a minimum legislative window of four months, assuming a very late Pre-Budget Report, to effect national insurance changes. We recognise that the different structure of national insurance compared with income tax requires the rates to be in existence before the beginning of the tax year, but there would be plenty of time for that.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000020"></a>The Government have argued that no statutory provision is necessary because none has been protecting the amount of the primary threshold. Before the primary threshold was introduced, there was a requirement to link the lower earnings limit to the amount of the state pension. When the Government moved away from that and introduced into law a primary threshold which was supposed to move in line with the personal allowance, they failed to reflect the Rooker-Wise automatic indexation of the personal allowance. At that time, they should have put in some protection to ensure that it was raised in line with the personal allowance at least annually and kept with it. I was not in your Lordships' House when the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act was considered&#151;nor, I think, was the Minister&#151;and I have not summoned up the energy to research whether the matter was debated at that time. It is a great pity that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, has decided not to be in her place today because I have no doubt that she would have remembered whether it was. However, it is not currently in the law.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000021"></a>If the Bill goes through, the Government could abandon harmonisation at the lower and upper end at will. That is why, in addition to tabling this group of amendments, I tried to do virtually the same in relation to the primary threshold&#151;that is, to move it in line with inflation&#151;but that was struck down from the list of amendments last week.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000022"></a>I do not buy the argument that because nothing protects the value of the lower limit there should be no protection at the upper limit. The ability of big government to raise by regulation the upper limit to whatever they

<p><a name="08060912000023"></a>My amendments would have equal force for Northern Ireland. The fact that I have not amended Clause 2 is not a sign of lack of regard for the national insurance payers of the Province. The points remain the same, but I confess that I have not researched the niceties of the governing legislation nor sought to produce a detailed amendment. If the Minister gives me encouragement for the essence of my amendments, I am sure that we could achieve a similar result for Clause 2 in time for Report.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000024"></a>I hope that the Government will see that the powers that they are taking with this Bill are too great for the simple task of harmonisation at the levels on which the former Chancellor decided. In that light, I hope that he will see that true harmonisation would mirror the Income Tax Act and thus ensure through indexation that harmonisation would endure. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08060912000025"></a><a name="80609-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80609-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08060912000146"></a>Lord Newby:</b> There are a number of anomalies and ironies about this issue and the fact that we are discussing it. It is anomalous that this House spends time scrutinising national insurance as though it were not a tax, and it is ironic that the purpose of the amendments is to increase the power of the Commons and your Lordships' House against the Government on a matter of taxation. Your Lordships' House has not played any substantive role in taxation for the best part of a century, and it is a delight to be able to do so in relation to these amendments.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000026"></a>The changes which have brought forward both the Bill and the amendments have two clear advantages from the Government&#146;s point of view. First, they simplify the tax system. It is a minor advantage in practice, given that national insurance and income tax are to all intents and purposes collected separately, but for individuals and companies attempting to understand the system it effects a measure of simplification, and to that extent it is to be welcomed. As the noble Baroness said, it also brings in significant additional revenue. In present circumstances, that is clearly a major advantage to the Government and, on any objective test, is a far more significant benefit than any theoretical or actual benefit of simplification. From these Benches we have no objection either to the simplification or to the Government getting additional revenue in this way, but we have considerable sympathy with the arguments about the extent to which this Bill will give unacceptable freedom to government to change the threshold without adequate parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000027"></a>As the noble Baroness said, we have had many discussions about the virtues or not of affirmative-resolution debates, but the truth is that they virtually deny Parliament the opportunity to overturn and, certainly, to amend any provision that the Government put forward. Therefore, this Bill undoubtedly adds significantly to the power of government to change national insurance and the limit, and therefore government income revenues, by a significant amount without adequate parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000028"></a>The amendment has a double advantage. First, in the Government&#146;s terms, it maintains the simplification. How unfortunate it would be if, having aligned the  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC115"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column GC115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>two thresholds, for one reason or another the Government allowed them easily to slip out of alignment. The Bill makes it easier for that to happen. Secondly, and more importantly, the amendment means that the Government cannot have another significant raid on higher earners&#146; income via the national insurance route without a proper parliamentary debate. I am not saying that there are no circumstances in which we would advocate that such a raid might be necessary.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000029"></a>I fear that given the way that the public finances may be going and the constraints that the Government will be under, due to their high levels of borrowing, they may be looking for additional sources of revenue in the future. Frankly, that is not the point. The point is that it should not be possible to bring to bear a significant additional source of government revenue without proper parliamentary scrutiny. That will be the consequence unless this amendment or something very like it is put in the Bill. Therefore, we are minded to support this group of amendments.</p>

I also am grateful to both noble Lords because they clearly do not want to spend lots of time going back over the arguments about simplification and a tax-raising opportunity. However, I would place on the record, as I did at Second Reading, that it is absolutely unfair to pick out this component of a compendium of measures and say that it is all about raising tax, when the package of measures had a cost to the Exchequer of the order of &#163;2.5 billion. We can spend a lot of time going over all that.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000033"></a>Before I deal with the specifics of the amendment, I should put something else on the record about the 13 May announcement. As noble Lords are aware, the Chancellor announced on that date that the personal allowance for all basic-rate taxpayers under 65 would be raised by &#163;600 in the current tax year, 2008-09. That means that around 22 million basic-rate taxpayers will benefit from the change and the number of households that lose from the Budget 2007 reforms will be reduced from 5.3 million to 1.1 million. The remaining losses will be at least halved. Making this announcement now means that people will see the money in their take-home pay from September. As those paying tax at 40 per cent are unaffected by the Budget 2007 reforms, the point at which people pay higher-rate tax will be reduced, leaving taxpayers who pay at the 40 per cent marginal rate unaffected by the increase in

The thresholds and rates of national insurance for 2008-09 were not affected by the Chancellor&#146;s announcement.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000034"></a>The Government will set out plans for future years in the 2008 Pre-Budget Report in the autumn. Our aim is to continue the same level of support for those on lower incomes. We have looked at the case for the alignment of tax and national insurance on an annual basis and found that the savings for employers, individuals and the Government were smaller than would have been expected, with large one-off transitional costs and significant numbers of low-income losers. On that basis the Government have concluded that, on balance, the benefits of this annual alignment do not outweigh the costs. However, we remain committed in principle to bringing the income tax and the national insurance contribution systems closer together to improve fairness and coherence, reduce administrative burdens and make them easier to understand. I appreciate the support, particularly of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, for that endeavour. There has already been progress in aligning tax and NICs in a simplified structure of employers&#146; NICs that replaces multiple rates with a single rate and abolishes the entry fee.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000035"></a>With just two main rates of income tax and two rates of national insurance in this tax year, the UK&#146;s personal tax system is already one of the simplest personal tax structures of any developed country. However, the Government are continuing to look at the scope for further alignment of tax and national insurance contributions, taking into account the changes made on 13 May, in future Pre-Budget and Budget Reports. The Bill removes the restriction that exists on changing the level of the upper earnings limit in order to implement the future alignment of the UEL with the higher rate threshold for income tax. This restriction, as we have heard, currently limits the maximum amount to which the UEL can be raised for any tax year to 7.5 times the primary threshold. These changes still provide the flexibility to align the UEL with the level at which higher rate tax becomes payable in future years, without the need for further primary legislation.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000036"></a>As indicated, the amendments are prompted by a concern that the Bill would remove parliamentary control on the setting of the upper earnings limit by abolishing the current restriction that limits the raising of this limit to 7.5 times the primary threshold. The proposed amendment inserts proposed new Section 5A into the Social Security Contributions Act 1992. The objective appears to be to introduce a restriction on rises in the UEL to RPI, but only with effect from 2010-11. They also provide for a new rounding rule, which may have unforeseen consequences.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000037"></a>The proposed new section, as I have said, is intended to be effective for 2010-11. This risks misalignment due to the rounding rules it contains. The UEL is a weekly limit, and the personal allowance and basic rate limits from which it would be derived if it were to align&#151;which would be calculated by dividing the aggregate of the two by 52 and rounding to the nearest pound&#151;are annual. This could lead to misalignment on occasions as rounding up of the weekly figure could result in a different figure than rounding an annual figure divided by 52, and would therefore  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC117"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column GC117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>require further primary legislation to correct. If you assume that it could be out by as much as an extra pound each week, that would cost something like &#163;15 million to &#163;20 million a year.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000038"></a>As the noble Baroness explained, the intention and the structure of these amendments were to replicate for NICs the Rooker-Wise system that exists for income tax. There is a particular difficulty with this in respect of the NIC system. For income tax there exists the vehicle of the annual Finance Bill in cases where the Chancellor decides to make changes to the personal allowance, for example, either below or above RPI. No such facility for primary legislation exists for national insurance. I do not accept the point that it is simple for the Government to bring forward a one-line Bill on a routine basis just as we do with a Finance Bill. It does not work that way. Programming Bills into the system is often not that easy, particularly with the competing priorities that always confront Governments. I therefore urge the noble Baroness to consider whether that would be a good use of valuable parliamentary time. I think not, but perhaps the noble Baroness has something else in mind when it comes to dealing with the inevitable requirement for annual primary legislation for NICs and whether to bring NICs into the annual Finance Bill cycle.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000039"></a>The Government remain committed to continuing to simplify tax and NICs processes where practical and beneficial to do so for future years, including aligning the upper earnings limit with the level at which higher rate tax becomes payable. The changes in this Bill will still allow the alignment announced in Budget 2007 to be delivered in the future. I hope that the noble Baroness will accept the practical difficulties associated with this amendment.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000040"></a>Amendment No. 3 would add proposed new Section 5A to the lists of limits and thresholds to be set by affirmative procedures. We have substantial reservations about that, not least because the Bill as drafted already proposes that regulations setting the level of the upper earnings limit should be subject to the affirmative procedure. If one were to read Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 together, the intended effect appears to be that the UEL would be limited to increases by RPI, and the regulations setting the UEL calculated by reference to RPI would be subject to affirmative procedure. That would be a completely new requirement. Why have that second mechanism if you have the first one? We believe that it is a wholly unnecessary restriction and would amount to a huge increase in parliamentary oversight. I am not convinced that there is any need for that, particularly as Amendment No. 2 would be likely to result in annual primary legislation for NICs because of the misalignment through the proposed mechanisms. I note what the noble Baroness said about not extending this amendment to Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000041"></a>To try to summarise things, I return to the difficulty of aligning what is effectively a weekly system with an annual system. Unless you generate that alignment by looking at the annual allowances first, you get real difficulty. You cannot build it up from the bottom in the way that this amendment suggests. In the past, the personal allowance was aligned with the primary  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>threshold. The Rooker-Wise amendment requires the personal allowance to be rated by inflation and rounded to the nearest &#163;10. The basic rate limit is RPI-plus rounded to the nearest &#163;100. If you took that approach, divided it by 52, and then rounded the mechanism into alignment, that is what has happened with the primary threshold. If you do it the way suggested by the noble Baroness, you would inevitably get a misalignment and there would inevitably be a requirement for an annual programme Bill to deal with national insurance contributions.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000042"></a>To add to that point about an annual programme Bill to deal with national insurance contributions, if, once there is alignment, the Government wanted to increase the personal allowance or the basic rate limit by more than the rate of inflation, that would also generate a programme Bill. Restricting it in this way as a practical matter is deeply unwise. Considering where we are, I am sure that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment, but I hope that she will reflect on the difficulties of having a weekly system on the one hand and an annual system on the other.</p>

Like him, I rejoice that this is not a tax for the purposes of today's debate. Although deciding whether national insurance is a tax is an interesting topic that we can debate from time to time, for the purposes of the proceedings of your Lordships' House, we are happy that it is not a tax, because it allows us to debate the issue and use our skills on the topic.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000046"></a>The burden of the Minister&#146;s argument is that the amendment does not do the trick because it does not produce an acceptable result without further tinkering and intervention and would result in a Bill every year. I am not convinced that that is correct and that this cannot be dealt with by tinkering with either the rounding in this Bill or, potentially, the rounding in the Income Tax Act to keep alignment. I have not done the detailed modelling but I cannot believe that it is beyond the wit of a rounding clause to get it to that point. I do not accept that for the sake of a few tens of millions of pounds, there is an insuperable objection to putting a restriction on the Government&#146;s unlimited power to raise national insurance by increasing the upper limit. The Minister has not addressed the point that the current limitation imposes a clear limit and that the Bill takes that limit away and puts nothing in its place.</p>

The Bill does put something in its place&#151;the affirmative resolution procedure. It is clear that we cannot do it in an arbitrary fashion.

But the affirmative resolution procedure is not an answer to that. It is already done in that way and changes to the limit are usually nodded through on a Thursday afternoon.

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000049"></a>I am not impressed by the arguments that the structure of the two systems is out of line. I concede that there could be circumstances when the amount would need to be raised by a higher or completely different amount that was not catered for by the indexation if the Government of the day chose to restructure the tax and national insurance systems. That is when I envisage a need for primary legislation and, for all the Minister&#146;s talk about programming, I cannot see that a one-clause Bill would be difficult in that context.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000057"></a>The noble Baroness said: Broadly on the same theme, in moving Amendment No. 5 I am introducing the possibility of a new clause to go after Clause 1. In the previous group of amendments I sought to get the annual uprating of the UEL to align with the uprating of the higher rate tax threshold. That was the scheme that the former Chancellor promised in 2007; the current Chancellor confirmed it in his Pre-Budget Report last October and, again, in his Budget in March.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000058"></a>At that stage, it occurred to me that the Government might one day want to take the UEL on a different path of their own to raise billions of extra tax under the guise of national insurance. It also occurred to me that we ought to keep the tax and national insurance limits in step on a statutory basis, which is the substance of the last group of amendments. But it did not occur to me when we prepared for Second Reading, or even when we started to prepare for this Committee, that two weeks after our Second Reading the Chancellor would be panicked into abandoning all previous pledges about rates and allowances when faced with an electoral defeat in the by-election in Crewe. I simply did not have enough imagination to see that the Government would go in that direction.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000059"></a>The spectacle of the Government&#146;s second attempt, as it turned out, at a U-turn to get themselves out of the 10p-rate hole made me realise that harmonisation and simplification of tax and national insurance was much more fragile than I had imagined it could possibly be. We know that in the week before the Crewe by-election the Chancellor announced, as the Minister explained, that the personal allowance would go up by &#163;600 and the basic rate limit would come down by &#163;600. That has the effect of the primary threshold being &#163;600 less than the personal allowance. I remind the Minister of what he said at Second Reading&#151;that,</p>
<ul><a name="08060912000136"></a>&#147;the arrangements in respect of the primary threshold have worked perfectly well since it was introduced and we have stuck by the commitment to maintain that alignment&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 30/4/08; col. 314.]</ul>
<p><a name="08060912000127"></a>At a stroke the Chancellor has put that into the realms of fantasy. It is clearly perfectly possible for the Government to break the alignment whenever it suits them.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000060"></a>The second effect is that the higher rate threshold and the UEL are now &#163;600 closer together. If nothing else happened, that would mean that the Government could proceed with their further simplification and raising of the limits without the need to repeal the 6.5 to 7.5 times limit that is in existence in the current legislation, so there would be no necessity for this bit of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000061"></a>What happens next seems to be a bit of a mystery. The Chancellor said&#151;and the Minister has repeated it again today&#151;that these changes are for one year only. He said this again when he appeared before the Treasury Select Committee in another place last week. What he did not say is what he intends to do instead. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out, if he tries to reverse the changes&#151;if they genuinely were made for one year only and he tried to put the situation back where it was&#151;he would have to deal with 13 million households, not 5.3 million.</p>

<p><a name="08060912000062"></a>The Government have got themselves in a mess. The panicky changes that the Chancellor announced for this year create even bigger problems for next year. The low end of the primary threshold and the personal allowance are out of kilter for the first time since the primary threshold was introduced. The top limits are a bit closer together, but for how long? One question for the Minister today is what the Government intend to do about the harmonisation and simplification of the tax and national insurance limits next year and beyond. Is it now abandoned? Some people are telling us that they have heard that within the Treasury harmonisation is de facto abandoned because it is too difficult to put back in place having separated it, given the current fiscal position. However, it cannot be right that a Bill that has been justified on the basis of simplification and harmonisation can go through your Lordships&#146; House at the precise time that that noble aim has been thrown out of the window.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000063"></a>Amendment No. 5 reflects the political reality that the Finance Bill gives the Government of the day carte blanche, if they have a majority in another place, to put tax and national insurance out of alignment, temporarily or permanently, whenever it suits them. Because the two are separated by different legislative and structural frameworks and until that is changed, it will be necessary to set national insurance rates ahead of the year. It is always difficult to change them during the year&#151;I completely accept that. That is not true of income tax, because the Government can change their mind at virtually any time during the year. Because of the availability of the PAYE mechanism, the vast majority of tax will be paid in the right place by the right people.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000064"></a>It is intended to state in Amendment No. 5 that when the UEL and the higher rate threshold go out of alignment, the Treasury should lay a report setting out what it intends to do about it; that is, it should come clean about how long any divergence is expected to last. We currently have no idea what the Government will do in respect of their 10p U-turn. As the Minister is aware, the amendment is deficient. It refers to the basic rate limit; it should refer to the higher rate threshold, which is not defined in legislation. My amendment should have said that if the basic rate limit plus the personal allowance is set below the UEL, a report should be laid. As I mentioned to the Minister before the Grand Committee started, I discovered that omission at the weekend when preparing my detailed notes for today. I informed the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, today about that. I apologise to the Grand Committee for any confusion, but I hope that we can debate the idea behind the amendment, even though it is not perfect, because what I was trying to do was pretty plain.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000065"></a>I should also say, for completeness, that the amendment ought to refer to the bottom end&#151;to the primary threshold and the personal allowance alignment. I failed to draft that into the amendment, but if I had done so, I am sure that the authorities that struck out my previous set of amendments would have done the same for that part of this amendment. I will leave that issue open for the time being.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000066"></a>Parliament is entitled to some explanation when tax and national insurance, which are claimed to be harmonised, are split further apart. As I have noted, the Chancellor has given no indication of what he intends to do. That is regrettable and I hope that the Minister can clear up some of that today, which would be helpful. Going forward, my amendment, or a better version of it, would be essential if there were no other amendment to the Bill to cover the situation that has arisen this year and to provide proper parliamentary scrutiny of that decision. I hope that the Minister can agree with the principles behind the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08060912000067"></a><a name="80609-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80609-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08060912000154"></a>Lord Newby:</b> I have some sympathy with what the noble Baroness is seeking to achieve. Although in many ways the amendment is a counsel of perfection, she underestimates the ability of the Treasury and Treasury Ministers to produce a piece of paper which might technically satisfy the requirements of the amendment, but would not necessarily shed any great light on it. The first of the two areas for which explanation is required relates to explaining why the paths have diverged. I have noticed that Ministers, particularly in another place, have started using the word &#147;right&#148; to justify any change that they wish to implement. The phrase, &#147;We are doing this because it is right&#148;, is now the day-to-day lexicon of justification in another place. &#147;Right&#148; is a completely subjective description and gets you absolutely nowhere, but has the advantage that it can be used with great conviction. It is used by Ministers, but it is just a covering for what Ministers wish to do.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000068"></a>As far as setting out the expected future paths of the two limits is concerned, one could imagine that there would be a broad statement of principle around which so many caveats about why it might not in reality come to pass would be hung that, again, it might not necessarily be worth the paper it was written on. While there is a lot to be recommended in the general principle that the Treasury should come forward to Parliament to explain in simple and credible language what it was doing, as this is far from the practice in so many other areas, any attempt to achieve the aims of that principle in this narrow area would almost certainly be doomed to failure.</p>

To conceive that the Treasury would obfuscate in any way a full report, if that were what it were required to produce at the end of the day, is so outrageous that I cannot say more.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000070"></a>I shall deal next with the specific challenge that came from the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, about the Government&#146;s commitment on alignment. I want to make it clear that the Government remain committed in principle to aligning the income tax personal allowance with the national insurance primary threshold, bringing our income tax and national insurance systems closer together to improve fairness and coherence, reduce administrative burdens and make them easier to understand. I reiterate that the Chancellor said on

Similarly, the Government remain committed to aligning the UEL with the level at which higher rate tax becomes payable in future years. That commitment is not in any way diminished.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000071"></a>I turn to the amendment, a proposed new clause requiring a report to be published and laid before Parliament for the tax years 2010-11 onwards, in circumstances where the basic rate limit is set below the UEL. There are considerable practical difficulties with the proposal. The noble Baroness indicated that she realised that there was a flaw in the amendment&#146;s intent&#151;that it should have said that if the basic rate limit plus the personal allowance were set below the UEL, a report should be laid. However, I shall deal with the amendment as drafted for the record.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000072"></a>The amendment has two technical flaws. First, it is proposed that the UEL be aligned with the basic rate limit&#151;an annual limit, whereas the UEL is a weekly limit. That means that, assuming a normal RPI increase in the basic rate limit year on year, it could never drop below the UEL. Secondly, using weekly equivalents&#151;which appears to be the intention behind the amendment&#151;the UEL, when aligned with the corresponding upper tax threshold, will represent a weekly equivalent of the aggregate of the basic rate limit and the personal allowance. That point has been recognised, I think. Even allowing for a weekly equivalent of the basic rate limit, it will always by itself be lower than the UEL, meaning that the report suggested would be needed every year. I do not think that that was the amendment&#146;s intent.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000073"></a>I come to what the noble Baroness suggested was the real purpose behind the amendment. She explained that it should have said that if the basic rate limit plus the personal allowance were set below the UEL, a report should be laid. I intend to explain why that is unnecessary. There is no de minimis limit on the misalignment under her proposals. Consequently, there may always be misalignment as a direct result of the rounding rules, which we discussed earlier, for the UEL, the personal allowance and the basic rate limit. That would lead to a report every year. If the Chancellor decides to change either or both of the personal allowance and the basic rate limit by other than RPI, that has to be included in the Finance Bill, and the reasons will be given in either the Budget speech or documents or in the finance debate on the appropriate measure, or all three. Also, as national insurance contributions and income tax thresholds will be announced at the Pre-Budget Report and under the Bill the regulations setting the UEL will be subject to affirmative procedure, there is ample opportunity for scrutiny in both Houses. Those opportunities preclude the need for a separate report, as envisaged by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000074"></a>Also, the amendment would apply to Great Britain only, as no corresponding amendment is proposed to be made to Clause 2.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000075"></a>I do not see that the change proposed in the Bill should give anyone cause for concern in terms of parliamentary scrutiny. The House always extremely

When it has concerns, it routinely draws them to the House&#146;s attention.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000076"></a>The amendments taken together or separately to link the UEL to the RPI or the higher rate of tax are unworkable, as I have explained. With the proposals for new affirmative procedures, that amounts to a huge and unnecessary increase in parliamentary oversight. I hope that the noble Baroness will accordingly withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08060912000077"></a><a name="80609-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80609-gc0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08060912000156"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> Before I respond, can the Minister explain his comments about the Delegated Powers Committee? The amendment does not have any orders related to it but he said that the Delegated Powers Committee would have referred to it.</p>

I agree that this is a relatively weak amendment because it allows the Treasury to table the kind of meaningless content that we see from time to time&#151;for example, in relation to Written Answers&#151;and which has become an art form in certain departments. Indeed, it would give the Treasury another opportunity to assert that it was right, although I suspect it could not assert that it is a long-term decision because such decisions rarely are. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, made me realise that this is not the right amendment; the earlier amendments are the right ones because they put the proper parliamentary process in place regarding changes.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000080"></a>The amendment does not deal with the issue of the Government separately pushing the personal allowance out of alignment. The Minister said that it would be in the Pre-Budget Report and in the Budget and there would be lots of opportunity to discuss it. However, what happened in the week before Crewe was neither in the Pre-Budget Report nor the Budget; it was conjured up at the last minute to buy the Government out of the huge trouble they were in and foresaw for the following week.</p>

But the Minister will recognise that it is a quite extraordinary departure from the ordinary course of events for the Government, having stated one policy to bring everything together&#151;which was affirmed in the Budget, followed by Pre-Budget Report, followed by Budget&#151;to state a few weeks later, &#147;Oh dear, the politics look at little difficult so we will make an entirely political decision, which we will then assert is right and probably in the long-term interests of the country, and then produce it without necessarily any changes&#148;.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000085"></a>I fully accept that my amendment merely gives the Treasury the aggravation of a process to deal with and, therefore, does not give any substantive control; the only control exists in the Finance Bill in another place. Even if we get in place proper control on the amount of the upper earnings limit, the Bill will allow the Government to smash harmonisation and alignment at will, which is what they have done. The point of the amendment is that the Government should be put to the extra trouble of bringing forward a paper.</p>

<p><a name="08060912000089"></a>The Minister has pointed out the issue of weekly versus annual, which I accept. Getting around it is not insuperable in drafting terms. I also accept the no de minimis limit; that is much the same point and is also easy to get around, as is Northern Ireland. The technical objections to the amendment can easily be got right between now and Report if we choose. The Minister is basically saying that the Government want to do what they want to do at any time with as little interference as possible, and in the mean time they wish to create as much power as possible under the Bill. We think the Bill goes too far, and we have to consider between now and Report how far we allow them to go with it. The Minister should not think that he has convinced me one jot with his arguments.

It is simply a tax-raising measure. The Treasury has had to dig pretty deep to raise this particular bit of revenue.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000095"></a>I shall remind the Committee of some of the history. In 2006 the Pensions Commission of the noble Lord, Lord Turner, produced its weighty final report, which set out a package of changes to pensions that the commission wanted implemented by 2010. Since then the Government have set about implementing the report by cherry-picking the things they liked and deferring or changing the things they did not like much.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000096"></a>The Government like to talk about &#147;consensus&#148; on this package of changes. To a degree there is a broad consensus about the changes that are being introduced, but the Minister will be aware from Second Reading of the Pensions Bill last week that the consensus is not complete and absolute. It does not extend to much of the detail because so much is still inchoate. We have warned that consensus may not survive the detail, or indeed the lack of it, around the Bill. Consensus is vital to a project like long-term pension reform. If the whole package is not robust now&#151;and it is not particularly robust&#151;it is unlikely to inspire the sort of confidence that is needed for successful implementation. The kind of cherry-picking that the Bill indulges in simply goes in the balance against consensus. The Government are playing a dangerous game with these reforms.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000097"></a>The first thing that the Government did was virtually abandon the Pensions Commission&#146;s 2010 timing of the reforms. The national pensions savings scheme, now called personal accounts, will not be ready until 2012 at the earliest. The uprating of pensions in line with earnings will not be introduced until 2012 at the earliest, and possibly as late as 2015. The Treasury has inserted its own deadly caveat of &#147;affordability&#148; around the introduction of the earnings linkage. Since the Pensions Commission&#146;s report and the Government&#146;s White Paper, economic circumstances have, by common consent, deteriorated. It is a fair bet that affordability in 2012 will be even harder to establish than it was when the Government issued their White Paper.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000098"></a>In the context of the Pensions Bill, the Liberal Democrats have signalled that they wish to see the earnings link established in 2010, which was the original proposal from the Pensions Commission. I am not sure where the money is going to come from, in the context of the current fiscal position. From our perspective, we need some certainty about timing. We will be pressing that in relation to the Pensions Bill and, depending on what the Minister says today, possibly in relation to this Bill too. The Bill picks one bit of the Pensions Commission&#146;s recommendations about the flat-rating of the state second pension. That flat-rating is not entirely to our taste because it means that those who pay more into the National Insurance Fund get nothing back for it. However, we accepted it as part of the total package of reforms. The Pensions Commission said that S2P should be flat-rated by 2030 but that was predicated on starting flat-rating in 2010.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000099"></a>The Government did not buy into 2010 for starting the package, and in particular the earnings link, but they said in their 2006 White Paper that,</p>
<ul><a name="08060912000137"></a>&#147;we will ... reform the State Second Pension so that it becomes a simple, flat-rate weekly top-up to the basic State Pension. Accruals will start gradually to become flat rate at the same time as we start to uprate the basic State Pension by earnings&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060912000128"></a>Therefore, the flat-rating was going to start in 2012 at the earliest and possibly as late as 2015. Having slipped the start date, the Government nevertheless estimated that flat-rating would be completed by,</p>
<ul><a name="08060912000138"></a>&#147;around 2030 or shortly afterwards&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060912000129"></a>By keeping the 2030 date, the Government inevitably implied that the line for achieving the flat-rating would be steeper than suggested by the Pensions Commission, but it was not a magical date because it was qualified by the words &#147;or shortly afterwards&#148;. However, the date of 2030 now appears to have achieved a sort of mythical status.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000100"></a>The Bill allows the flat-rating to be started on a date even earlier than that posited by the Pensions Commission. It is now to start in 2009, so the curve will be even steeper if it is achieved by 2030. In practice, this means that the Treasury will screw more money out of employers, as contracted-out rebates in the early years will be reduced to the tune of around &#163;450 million each year.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000101"></a>The Government have a prepared story for this about increasing the upper earnings limit, which is what the Bill is about, but we are not fooled by that. Just because there will be a higher upper earnings limit so that more people will contribute at higher NI rates, that does not mean that they should have their extra NI contributions confiscated immediately by an S2P flat-lining reduction. For us that is not logical, although I can see that it plays to the redistributive instincts of some in the Labour Party. However, that is not what it is about; it is just a convenient way to grab some money for the Treasury. It is a Treasury stealth tax aimed at squeezing employers and pension funds, which do not vote.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000102"></a>Having said that, we have accepted the flat-rating of S2P and, indeed, we would accept the acceleration of the flat-rating, but the Government have to come clean on the rest of the Pensions Commission package and, indeed, on their own White Paper package. The most important thing for pensioners is the question of when the Government are going to use earnings to uprate pensions, but the Government are saying absolutely nothing about that.</p>

<p><a name="08060912000103"></a>The Government continue to cherry-pick the things that raise money but will not provide any certainty about when they will start giving some money to pensioners through the enhanced uprating. Therefore, when replying, the Minister need not recite his version of why flat-rating is the right thing to do in 2009&#151;we think that it is a fiction. The important thing is that, as the Government have chosen to accelerate this one bit of the package of pensions reform&#151;the bit that suits them&#151;they are now duty-bound to give undertakings about the rest of the reforms. It is that small but significant point that I wish to raise in this debate on clause stand part. I hope that the Minister can give us

I look forward to his response.</p>

I can understand from a political point of view why the noble Baroness would wish to project it in that way, but it bears no relation to the facts.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000105"></a>On the point that she pressed about restoring the link between pensions and earnings, there is a clear legal certainty around that. We made it clear in the legislation last year that our intention is that the uprating of the basic state pension will be relinked to average earnings from 2012, or, in any event, at the latest by the end of the Parliament, subject to affordability and the fiscal position. That is a clear commitment that it will happen by the end of the next Parliament if not from 2012.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000106"></a>This is probably not the occasion to go over again all the issues around pensioner poverty and the support that this Government have provided to pensioners, but we are spending something like &#163;12 billion more each year than we would have done had we simply brought forward the policies of the noble Baroness&#146;s previous Government. When pressed on matters of relinking the basic state pension to earnings, we might just remind ourselves who broke that link in the first place.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000107"></a>Dealing more specifically with the substance of the amendment, Clause 3 brings forward the introduction of the upper accrual point as the cap on earnings factors in the state second pension from 6 April 2009. This means that the upper accrual point will become the new upper threshold for the calculation of both state second pension and contracted-out rebates. It has been introduced early to ensure that the Government&#146;s personal tax package announced in the Budget 2007, and the reforms to the state pension introduced in that, can be delivered as planned. We are making sure that we end up where we expected to be.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000108"></a>I am sure that the Committee would agree that the state second pension is poorly understood and that of those who are aware of it, few have any idea of how their entitlement builds up. In the current tax year, everyone who pays into the state second pension or is credited into the system is assumed to earn at least &#163;13,500 whether they do or not, in effect providing a flat rate amount of benefit. In addition, earnings over &#163;13,500 and up to &#163;40,040 attract an earnings-related component. The Pension Commission, as we have heard, recommended that the Government should focus resources on providing a more generous flat rate state pension and that the earnings-related component of state second pension should be withdrawn to make way for personal accounts. As the noble Baroness said, we had common cause on this at the end of our deliberations last year on the Pensions Act. Following the views of respondents to the White Paper on pension reform and to the Work and Pensions Select Committee, we also set about the task of radically simplifying the state second pension, and there is more to come in the Bill that we will consider shortly.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC129"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column GC129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000109"></a>The Pensions Act 2007 provides the mechanisms for both the withdrawal of earnings relation and simplifying the system. For a typical contributor earning above the lower earnings limit, earnings up to &#163;13,500 a year and state second pension credits will attract the new flat rate amount of &#163;1.60 a week for each qualifying year. The current earnings-related element built up on earnings over &#163;13,500 will be gradually withdrawn, so that, by 2030, only the flat rate element will be left. Different rules apply where a person is in contracted-out employment.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000110"></a>As I said, these measures were welcomed during the passage of the Pensions Act last year and will simplify a greatly complex benefit. The savings from the gradual erosion of earnings relation will be reinvested over time in the earnings uprating of the basic state pension. In the 2007 Pre-Budget Report, the Chancellor announced that to ensure that reforms necessary to simplify the state second pension take place as originally intended following the alignment of the upper earnings limit with the higher rate income tax threshold, the start date for flat-rating state second pension would be brought forward to April 2009. The original intention was that measures to simplify and standardise accruals of state second pension would be introduced from April 2012 at the earliest through the introduction of the upper accrual point, among other measures. However, the above inflation increases in the upper earnings limit announced in the Budget have a knock-on effect on the timetable for delivery of a flat rate state second pension as originally envisaged in the Pensions Act 2007. This is because the state second pension accrues on the proportion of earnings between the lower earnings limit and the upper earnings limit. Increasing the upper earnings limit by more than inflation means that high earners would potentially gain.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000111"></a>A further effect of the Budget 2007 changes is a slight increase in the overall cost of the contracted-out rebate, because it is payable on the same band of earnings on which the state second pension accrues. It was never our intention for the personal tax package to have these effects on the state second pension. To cancel those unintended consequences and get us back on track with the abolition of earnings relation for the state second pension, we have decided to bring forward to 6 April 2009 the introduction of the upper accrual point, which was the rational thing to do. The Pensions Policy Institute has reacted by stating:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060912000135"></a>&#147;While this may sound like a significant policy change, widely reported to save the Exchequer &#163;2 billion, it in fact refers to a technical change introduced to restore the flat-rating of S2P back towards the path originally envisaged in the Pensions Act 2007&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000112"></a>As I mentioned earlier, the Pensions Commission&#146;s proposals and the consequent measures put forward in the Pensions Act 2007 reinvest earnings-related state second pension in basic state pension. As a result of the total package of reform measures, people will be better off in the new system than in the current system. For instance, under the current arrangements, high earners will receive total state pension of around &#163;110 a week in 2050; under the reformed system, they will receive around &#163;160 a week of state pension in 2053, taking account of increases in state pension age. Higher earners will also receive a slightly higher state

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000113"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will accept that this is a technical adjustment to make sure that we are back on our intended track and that the package of measures that we discussed in the Pensions Bill last year was finely balanced and affordable. The changes in Budget 2007 upset that package so far as higher earners in S2P are concerned and this measure simply puts us back to where we should be.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000114"></a>I was asked whether 2030 was just an estimate rather than a target. It was always intended that S2P would eventually become flat-rated. The Pensions Commission in its second report set out as one option earnings-related accrual within S2P ceasing in around 2030. That is the best way forward as it accelerates progress of the state system towards a focus on flat-rate provision but maintains some element of earnings-related inflation in the system until personal accounts are well established and proven. Under provisions in the Pensions Act 2007, entitlement to S2P was built on a completely flat rate basis by around 2030.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000115"></a>I hope that I have dealt with each of the points that were raised. I am sure that the noble Baroness will come back to me if I have not done so.</p>

<p><a name="08060912000116"></a><a name="80609-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80609-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08060912000167"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I thank the Minister for that wholly predictable response. It brings home to me that what the Treasury regards as rational is another man&#146;s tax-raising, because we have to remember that that is what the Bill does. The Minister said that if the Government did not introduce this measure people earning more would gain. They do not gain: they are paying more national insurance as a result of the upper earnings limit going up. The Treasury lives in a funny world where it can see people paying more but gaining, because something happening beyond 2030 might provide them with a little more pension.</p>

<p><a name="08060912000117"></a><a name="80609-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80609-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08060912000168"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> If the noble Baroness will forgive me, it depends on how you do your allocations. I can see that she would like to make the juxtaposition that she just has but, as we discussed earlier, changes to national insurance contributions were part of a broader package of measures relating to changes to the basic rate of tax and the withdrawal of the 10p rate. If you look at that for higher earners, both originally under the 2007 Budget proposals and still, they are gainers from that compendium of measures. It was not intended that a further gain should accrue to them as a result of the interrelation with S2P.</p>

The other thing that the Minister said was that flat-lining the state second pension would help to pay for the earnings linking. Well, fine&#151;let us introduce it at the same time. But we are not doing that; we are raising money

That is the dishonesty at the heart of this particular measure.</p>

<a name="80609-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08060912000119"></a>The Minister said that the Pensions Commission had one version ending in 2030, which the Government then grabbed. But the Pensions Commission were going to start in 2010, not 2009. The Government said that they would do 2030 but that anything else that happened still had to end in 2030 and would start whenever the Treasury wanted. This is really about consensus on the Pensions Bill; it is not so much about this Bill. The Government are cherry-picking to raise taxes. We understand that they have to do that, because the fiscal position is so weak; but in doing so, by taking little bits here and there and not introducing them all together and still giving no indication of when the earnings linkage will be restored, I have to say to the Minister that the Government, through him, are endangering the consensus on the Pensions Bill. That is the burden of my remarks.</p>

A lot of work has gone into building a consensus. The Government are not trying to disturb this consensus; if anyone is trying to do that, it is the noble Baroness for the Opposition.</p>

In fact, it released that particular impact only when this Bill eventually came forward. So while I withdraw the remark about dishonesty, which may be too strong a word, I would use a word very close to that in not giving Parliament the full information about what the Treasury&#146;s intentions were when they first came across this point.</p>

<p><a name="08060912000122"></a>This is a stand-part debate in Grand Committee, so we go nowhere with it. The point that I want to leave on the record is that this is part of the Government not dealing properly with the issue of consensus. For us, this is an important issue.</p>

The meeting was chaired by Andrej Vizjak, Slovenian Minister of Economy, and Gregor Virant, Slovenian Minister of Public Administration.</p>

<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08060919000011"></a>The council held a debate on competitiveness and innovation in European industry, and adopted conclusions agreeing on the goal of making the EU a more dynamic and competitive, knowledge-based, safe and sustainable low-carbon economy, in order to achieve sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. The conclusions emphasise the importance of removing barriers to innovation and reducing the fragmentation of European venture capital markets, the potential contribution of pre-commercial procurement, and the need to implement measures to fight climate change and improve the competitiveness of the metals, forest-based and defence industries. I intervened to emphasise the importance of further work to reduce the regulatory burden on small firms, to improve access to venture capital in the EU, to achieve greater energy efficiency and achieve the transition to a low-carbon economy, and to develop skills levels in the EU.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08060919000012"></a>Following a presentation by the Commission on its second strategic review of the better regulation initiative, the council adopted conclusions calling for further action on impact assessment, the reduction of administrative burdens, and the simplification of EU legislation. I intervened in the debate to stress the need for a net target for burden reductions and for ambitious company law simplification proposals, including exclusions for the smallest companies.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08060919000014"></a>Under other business, the Commission gave brief progress reports on the draft toy safety directive, the Small Business Act for Europe initiative, cohesion policy strategies and programmes for 2007-13, transposition of the services directive and the draft regulation on CO2 emissions from cars. The presidency gave a brief report on the outcome of the Informal Competitiveness Council in April. Portugal made brief interventions about fees charged by the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market and the effect of rising oil prices on the EU economy.</p>

<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08060919000016"></a>The first substantive item on the agenda is a presidency progress report on the European Commission proposals on a review of regulatory framework for electronic communication networks and services (telecoms). The Slovenian presidency is expected to pose three (written) questions in the debate:</p>
whether the revised framework is able to incentivise investment in next generation access networks (NGN)&#151;the successor to broadband;the extent to which regulatory bodies should be independent, and whether more consistency in the approach that national regulatory authorities (NRAs) take would be of benefit; and, Ministers&#146; views on the best way to achieve a common vision on spectrum management in the EU.
<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08060919000017"></a>In addition, we envisage a discussion over lunch on the Commission&#146;s proposal for a pan-EU Telecoms Authority.</p>

<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08060919000018"></a>In line with the views of both committees, the Government have never been convinced of the case of a new pan-EU regulator. I noted with interest the output of the House of Commons debate on 18 March 2008 and the conclusions of the House of Lords debate on 14 March 2008 entitled the <I>Single Market: Wallflower of Dancing Partner.</I> You will be reassured to know that none of my opposite numbers in other member states, or indeed the views from the European Parliament, support the Commission&#146;s original proposals. Together with like-minded Ministers, I intend to use this discussion over lunch with Commissioner Reding to reiterate our views on the elements necessary for an independent advisory body to build upon existing arrangements and strengthen the application of the framework. My officials have been working closely with officials from the incoming French presidency in developing their alternative to the Commission&#146;s agency proposals on which the French Minister and I will look to galvanise member state support. Essentially  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS35"></a><b>9 Jun 2008 : Column WS35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the French proposals address our concerns, and look to shape the advisory body as a much smaller entity comprising the chairs of all 27 national regulatory authorities complemented by a small permanent secretariat appropriate only to undertake the revised remit. We shall also be clear that it must have a remit to act not only at the request of the Commission but also on its own initiative; that it its roles and functions must be clearly defined; and that it must be politically independent and operate in a fully transparent manner.</p>

<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08060919000019"></a>Focusing on the three questions we expect the Slovenian presidency to pose, I intend to take the opportunity in response to the first of these to make an intervention on the need for this framework to be technologically neutral, and provide NRAs the necessary power, including new powers of functional separation, to promote efficient infrastructure investment in those parts of the network which are replicable, and to ensure access on non-discriminatory terms to those elements which are likely to be enduring economic bottlenecks. What we do not want is an outcome which enables member states to unfairly favour incumbents&#146; deployment of fibre networks by excusing them of their obligations to ensure non-discriminatory access.</p>

<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08060919000020"></a>On the second question, I intend to take the opportunity to emphasise the importance the UK attaches to independent regulators separated from market participants and the day-to-day pressure of politics. However, I will also push for a higher level of ambition, so that rather than focusing on achieving consistency (whether that be consistently good or consistently bad) we should be focusing on developing a process that continually raises the bar in regulatory performance across the EU. During this intervention I will also reconfirm our commitment to work with other member states to find a satisfactory mechanism of constraining a Commission veto on national market remedies to target the laggards, without constraining regulatory innovation and causing un-necessary additional hurdles in those member states which are already applying the framework with considerable success.</p>

<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08060919000021"></a>In addressing the last of their questions, I intend to emphasise that while it is appropriate for member states to have sufficient flexibility to support clearly defined public policy purposes, we are strongly of the view that the market is best placed to manage spectrum. I share the views, which I expect to be expressed by several Ministers, that harmonisation can bring benefits through economies of scale and interoperability. However, I will make it clear that enforced (regulatory) harmonisation runs the risk of spectrum being underused if services do not develop as expected. For this reason I believe that market-led harmonisation, achieved through a technology and service neutral approach, is more appropriate as it can adapt to changing market conditions and avoid inefficient use of spectrum.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08060919000023"></a>Following the discussion on the framework review, there is the adoption of council conclusions on a common approach to the use of the spectrum released by digital switchover. The Commission published its communication in November, and this included a proposal for a move towards a common spectrum plan in the UHF band at EU level. While it is recognised that there are benefits to harmonisation, I intend to intervene to argue that enforced harmonisation inhibits the development of the market and that consumer-focused services are best allocated on a technology/service-neutral basis. I will welcome the council conclusions which through negotiation now reflect a non-mandatory approach to coordination between member states in the utilisation of the digital dividend.</p>

<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08060919000024"></a>This will be followed by the council conclusions on Europe&#146;s digital future i2010 mid-term review. These conclusions invite member states to increase their efforts in taking forward the dossiers that are covered by the strategy, thereby enabling information society and audiovisual media services to contribute to the Lisbon strategy. I will be supporting this, but there is not expected to be any substantive discussion.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08060919000025"></a>The next item is a Commission proposal for political agreement on the duration of the European Network and Information Security Agency. Currently ENISA&#146;s mandate expires in 2009 and an extension is required to ensure its continued existence. I intend to support this proposal to ensure that there is continuity in EU network information security until final decisions have been made concerning the establishment of the European Electronic Communications Market Authority. As such, the extension of the ENISA mandate will need to be time-bounded.</p>

<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08060919000031"></a>Over the next year, the Government are bringing in the biggest shake-up of the immigration system for over 40 years. Today I am laying new immigration rules which complete the roll-out of tier 1 of the points-based system, introducing provisions for highly skilled migrants, entrepreneurs, investors and recent graduates from UK universities. Worldwide we will also be introducing the entrepreneur, investor and post-study work categories. This meets the target I announced last year on time. Tier 1 replaces eight former immigration categories, in line with our commitment to simplifying the immigration system.</p>

<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08060919000032"></a>Tier 1 will let Britain recruit the skills, assets and ideas the UK needs to remain a global leader in the fields of finance, business, and technological innovation. In particular:</p>
 tier 1 (general) is for highly skilled migrants who wish to seek work or become self-employed in the UK. The entry criteria are rigorous: applicants without qualifications at first degree level or above and a track record of highly skilled employment will not gain entry. But migrants who successfully apply will be able to seek work without being tied to a particular employer for three years. At the end of that time they will be able to extend their stay if they can show they have been successful in a highly skilled capacity; tier 1 (post-study work) provides a bridge for international graduates from their studies to work in the UK. Eligible migrants may stay on after graduation to seek work for up to two years, after which they have to switch into either a skilled or highly skilled immigration category. We believe this to be one of the most attractive staying-on schemes in the world; it will boost our economy both by enabling these graduates to remain in the UK and by making studying in the UK a more attractive prospect; tier 1 (entrepreneur) will encourage migrants to bring their business skills and ideas to the UK. While applicants will not need to have a minimum

<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08060919000035"></a>I have today launched the Government Olympic Executive legacy action plan, <I>Before, During and After: Making the </I><I>M</I><I>ost of the London 2012 Games.</I></p>

<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08060919000036"></a>The document fulfils the commitment to publish a legacy action plan, following the publication of <I>Our Promise for 2012</I> in June 2007. The five promises are:</p>
to make the UK a world-leading sporting nation;to transform the heart of east London;to inspire a generation of young people;to make the Olympic Park a blueprint for sustainable living; and to demonstrate that the UK is a creative, inclusive and welcoming place to live in, to visit and for business.
<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08060919000037"></a>The plan outlines the ways in which the Government will deliver on these promises through new programmes and the unique added value of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games to existing programmes. As such there is no discrete legacy budget; rather we are creating Olympic value by drawing together programmes from across government.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08060919000038"></a>Under each promise the plan sets out between two and four headline ambitions and details the major programmes that will contribute towards achieving that aim.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08060919000039"></a>A robust and transparent governance system has also been put in place to drive progress, and this will be monitored alongside the delivery of PSA 22 (Deliver a successful Olympic Games and Paralympic Games with a sustainable legacy and get more children and young people taking part in high quality PE and sport)<I>.</I></p>

<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08060919000040"></a>This is the Government&#146;s first detailed Statement on legacy, and it is the first time that a host city has published such a document before their Olympiad has even begun. Further programmes will be created and existing programmes and ideas developed over the next four years and we will report on progress regularly.</p>

<a name="80609-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08060919000041"></a>I would like to commend this plan to the members of both Houses and thank them for their continued interest and support of the London 2012 Olympics.</p>

The UK is on course to fully deliver on its aid pledges to Afghanistan, and urges other donors to do the same. The figures outlined in the ACBAR report are not totally correct; none the less the general points about failure to deliver pledges and poor aid effectiveness are well made. Improving aid effectiveness is a central part of the UK development effort in Afghanistan. Effective development assistance is essential to support military gains and weaken the insurgency and narcotics trade, especially in the south.</p>

It provides small grants to assist the territories with the implementation of their environment charters and with environmental management more generally. The DfID component of OTEP has supported 36 projects in six less advantaged territories and 10 multi-territory projects. The programme has successfully supported ecotourism development, environmental education programmes, monitoring and management of protected areas and conservation programmes for endangered species. An independent review of this programme in 2006 praised its leadership in supporting sustainable development in the OTs, particularly in conserving their rich biodiversity. The programme as currently approved will continue to support environmental projects to 2010.</p>

An airlift into Gaza, which does not have a functioning airport, is not an option. Our focus should be on increasing the humanitarian and commercial items imported into Gaza and working towards the reopening of the crossings on a permanent basis.</p>

Most recently the quartet met in London on 2 May. They noted their deep concern over the humanitarian conditions in Gaza, called for continued humanitarian assistance to be provided to Gaza without obstruction, and for an end to all violence. The quartet was also represented at the ad hoc liaison committee meeting on 2 May where the UN presented an update on the current situation in Gaza.</p>

The World Health Organisation reports that sea water in several areas of the Gaza coastline is polluted. CMWU works closely with the United Nations Children's Fund to address the sewage situation and minimise risks to public health. Some drugs and essential medical items are in short supply in Gaza and up to 76 per cent of the population is partly dependent on food aid, most of which is provided by the UN.</p>

On 24 April, the EU issued a statement where it urged regular and unrestricted delivery of fuel supplies to Gaza, and condemned attacks by Palestinian militants. The UK and the international community provide substantial levels of humanitarian assistance.</p>

The priority is to reopen the crossings and we have urged all parties to find a solution for doing so. The Foreign Secretary and I raise this regularly with the Israeli Government and it was a key message at the quartet and ad hoc liaison committee meetings that the UK hosted in London earlier this month. We have also condemned attacks by Palestinian militants on the Gaza crossings, which only worsen the humanitarian situation.</p>
