<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Palmer </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they have any plans to increase the &#163;100 cold weather payment to pensioners living in Scotland.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Social Security   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  My Lords, there are two fuel-related payments for pensioners to provide help with fuel costs during winter. The first is the winter fuel payment, which provides a contribution of &#163;100 to eligible pensioner households each winter regardless of the weather conditions.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-01_para2"></a>The second is the cold weather payment, which provides an &#163;8.50 payment to pensioners and others receiving income support when the average temperature is recorded as, or is forecast to be, 0 degrees centigrade or below over seven consecutive days in the local area. That payment, unlike the first, reflects regional weather conditions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Palmer: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for her full and comprehensive reply. I believe that what the Government are doing is wonderful. However, should not the principle of the winter fuel payment be means tested?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the winter fuel payment goes to all pensioners: &#163;50 for pensioner couples and those on income-related benefit and &#163;100 for pensioner households. This is a recognition that, compared with others, pensioners spend a large part of their time at home and will have higher fuel costs. The <P>


<a name="column_714"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 714</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cold weather payment does what the noble Lord suggests. The payment is targeted on those in receipt of income support, JSA, state pensions and related income benefits and, therefore, ameliorates the problems of the poor. Therefore, there are two payments: one to all pensioners and the other to the vulnerable and poor.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as an old age pensioner living in Scotland--although appearances are misleading. Is my noble friend aware that my very good friend the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, who--before the polls open tomorrow--is one of the best attendees, is an expert on the cost of heating houses in Scotland? Is my noble friend also aware that, for example, the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, has 109 rooms in his wee cottage in the Borders of Scotland? The bottom line is that pensioners in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom will be very grateful for this help in meeting their winter fuel bills. Does my noble friend agree that it is the biggest contribution by a million miles by any government in the history of Parliament?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted that my noble friend draws attention to the fact that this year the Government are spending &#163;800 million extra to help pensioners meet their fuel bills. Like my noble friend, I very much value the contributions to this House of the noble Lord, Lord Palmer. However, whether the noble Lord would qualify for winter fuel payments on grounds of either poverty or age is not entirely clear to me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness referred to the problems of trying to determine temperatures within a local area. Can the Minister describe what is a local area? Will she also bear in mind that the local geography in Scotland militates towards temperature variations within a very small area? What account is taken of that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the word that I used was "regional". I can provide the noble Lord with charts if he wishes to have them. The figures are based on information from the Meteorological Office. For example, Kinloss, Loch Glascarnoch and so on will produce a 24-hour forecast, on the basis of which there will be an automatic delivery of cold weather payments through the Social Fund to those affected.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, if the Government have no such plans as are asked for in the Question, have they any alternative plans to lower the level of deaths from hypothermia in Scotland to that which is prevalent in Scandinavia?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, to some extent we meet the additional costs of heating in Scotland through the Social Fund payment. I believe that in 1997-98 the Social Fund cold weather payment was triggered eight times in Scotland, once in Wales <P>


<a name="column_715"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 715</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and not at all in England. Last year the payment was triggered 11 times in Scotland, not at all in Wales and twice in England. I believe that that illustrates the different temperatures in Scotland. The noble Earl is right that hypothermia is a problem for all pensioners. It is estimated that throughout the winter months perhaps another 30,000 people die over and above the number that might otherwise have been predicted. We believe that a large number of those deaths are attributable to weather conditions that affect pensioners. That is exactly why the Government are spending &#163;800 million to try to help pensioners protect themselves against hypothermia and related illnesses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, in the light of this generosity in Scotland, does my noble friend accept that there is a case for changing the Barnett formula?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the formula for cold weather payments, as with winter fuel payments, applies to the whole country even-handedly. However, as for cold weather Social Fund payments to those who are poor, that is triggered by weather conditions. Unless my noble friend argues that temperatures in Scotland are no different from those in England, I do not believe that he would have any desire to change the formula.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, in view of the situation last year when taxpayers' money was wasted on the television advertising of winter fuel payments which gave the impression that people would receive them in the post, whereas many had to collect them, cheques were out of date by the time they were collected, some people received double the amount that the Government intended, and others did not receive any payment until the weather became warmer, can the Minister give an assurance that this year the payments will be made on time?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, yes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, following on the question about hypothermia posed by my noble friend Lord Russell, does the Minister agree that, however desirable may be these winter fuel payments, the long-term solution to the problem, particularly for the elderly on low incomes, is to make sure that their homes are efficiently insulated and that they have effective heating arrangements?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, that is entirely right. These winter fuel payments will be paid by Christmas time to all pensioners. But it is correct that we need to invest particularly in older houses where insulation is poor and there are problems of dampness. That is why the Government's energy insulation scheme is to be extended. I believe that the Scottish Executive is making its scheme even more extensive that the English and Wales schemes precisely to meet the point raised by the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew14"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, the Office for National Statistics tells us that the average Scottish <P>


<a name="column_716"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 716</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>household pays &#163;14 per week for heating as opposed to the UK average of &#163;13. On that basis, in order to be effective, does the Minister agree that the winter payment to Scottish pensioners should be &#163;152 as opposed to &#163;100?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I should like to see the basis of the noble Earl's statistics. I am not sure whether they relate to all households or just pensioner households. My statistics are related to pensioner households and are rather different from the ones that he quoted. None the less, if people spend on average &#163;500 to &#163;550 a year on heating and lighting costs, which is the UK average, the &#163;100 payment across the board to all pensioners will be a welcome addition, as my noble friend Lord Ewing said, and something that has not been addressed by previous administrations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew16"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, is not the winter fuel payment for Scottish pensioners peculiarly a matter for Scotland? Is it not part of the functions of the devolved Scottish Parliament; and if not, why not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-01_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, confuses what I sought to separate in my Answer to the noble Lord, Lord Palmer. There are two basic cash payments. One is the winter fuel payment to all pensioners which for the most part is &#163;100 per household but in some cases is just &#163;50. The other is the cold weather payment that is triggered by cold weather conditions. Over the past two years that has disproportionately benefited Scotland, as one would expect. In addition, there are proposals by both the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Scottish Executive for home insulation grants, which in Scotland would be up to &#163;500 per household. That, too, is a matter for Scotland. However, basically social security is a UK matter and is not delegated. Therefore, winter fuel and cold weather payments are properly a matter for the UK Government.

<A NAME="91102-02_spopq0"></A><B> Viscount Waverley </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the United States' legal challenge to the European Union's preferential tariff regime for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) banana producers (Lome Convention) is compatible with United States subsidies to their agricultural exporters.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, the United States' claim that the European Union banana import regime is incompatible with world trade rules has been upheld by the World Trade Organisation. We closely follow <P>


<a name="column_717"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 717</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>US protection and support to its agricultural industry. If we consider any of this to be incompatible with WTO rules we press for action to be taken accordingly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   My Lords, I am assured in greater part. Will not the effects of these self-serving policies be continuing aid as a result of stifling trade so that farmers who rely on exports will turn to drug distribution, not least in the United States and United Kingdom markets?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, as to the conflict between aid and trade it should be remembered that the US is not the only complainant. Ecuador also challenged the EU regime and won. Other Latin American countries which are involved are also developing countries. The WTO rules are designed to promote international trade and encourage efficient production, which is to everyone's long-term benefit. However, we need to find ways to allow vulnerable countries to adjust and develop their economies. This is recognised by WTO members who have agreed a waiver to allow a preference for ACP countries.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-02_para0"></a>On diversification and the risk of drugs, it is worth pointing out that the main source of the present EU funding is called Stabex. From 2000 onwards the main source of funding of the islands and the remainder of the Caribbean will be the recently agreed special framework of assistance (SFA). It is expected that under the SFA each of the main banana growing Windward Islands will receive between &#163;4 million to &#163;6 million a year; and Jamaica will receive nearly &#163;3 million a year.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the noble Lord, Lord Carter, speaking on this serious and important subject. Will the Minister indicate the Government's policy towards these Caribbean islands which are completely dependent upon exports of bananas? As the noble Viscount, Lord Waverley, said, if they lose those exports, they will be likely to turn to drugs, to everyone's disadvantage. What positive plans have the Government to help those countries out of their dilemma, assuming that the agreements reached in the WTO hold?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, the European Commission is producing proposals this month--we understand within the next few days. Those proposals will have to take account of the WTO rules and the vulnerability of the Caribbean producers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-02_para1"></a>The UK Government wish to see a solution which does not risk further challenges to the WTO and which addresses the needs of the most vulnerable banana producers. Such a solution would need the agreement of all parties. We support the Commission in searching for a quota-based solution and a speedy end to the dispute. But even if the Commission produces proposals, it is then a matter for the interested parties in the European Union and other interested parties around the world to agree. The issue is extremely complex.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, in examining the proposals which will come forward from the European Union, <P>


<a name="column_718"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 718</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does the Minister accept that two clear principles should be followed by Her Majesty's Government? The first is that the European Union is still committed to the principles of its Lome commitment to those countries. The second is that the only long-term solution for those countries would be for the European Union to adopt a reference price deficiency payment system comparable with that currently obtained by European Union growers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, I have already said that it is for the Commission to produce proposals. We have made our position clear. It is clear that if there were a tariff system the tariff would have to be set at a level to support the Caribbean producers which would be too high to be accepted by other parties. The only other hope is a quota-based solution, which will have to be negotiated with the other European Union countries and America and the Latin American countries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Jopling: </B>   My Lords, while there will be broad agreement that banana growing in the Caribbean countries should not be allowed to be massively reduced, is the Minister aware that in the past the quality of bananas grown in the Caribbean has been poor (to put it politely); and that everything must be done to encourage and coerce the banana growers in the Caribbean for their own good to improve dramatically the quality of their product?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is correct. The UK Government are fully committed to the restructuring of the Caribbean banana industry so that it is more competitive and to reducing dependence on banana production. As I pointed out, under the new scheme the total that the main banana growing Windward Islands and Jamaica will receive in 2000 will be in the order of &#163;9 million a year.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that whatever compromise may come out of the European Union's discussions with the WTO, it is vital that the traditional access for Commonwealth ACP producers is maintained? Does the noble Lord accept that that will not be possible by a system of auctioning licences? Does he also accept that transitional arrangements have to cover a sufficient period to enable the countries concerned, in particular in the Commonwealth Caribbean, to adapt their economies and their industry? Otherwise they will face a social collapse of the kind to which noble Lords have referred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, the problem to which the noble Lord refers is recognised. Other members of the WTO have already agreed a waiver allowing a preference for ACP countries. I repeat: it is extremely complex to balance the arguments between the interests of the banana producers and the WTO rules which are designed for international trade.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that I wish to disagree in the nicest possible way <P>


<a name="column_719"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 719</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with my noble friend Lord Jopling? The quality of produce from the ACP countries is as good as any bananas produced in the world.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-02_para2"></a>Furthermore, in the Minister's original Answer he cited countries which are far bigger than the Caribbean islands and therefore have the chance to produce alternative crops. Countries such as Dominica simply cannot grow anything else except drugs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, I can only repeat what I have already said. We recognise the problem. There will have to be some attempt to help these countries to diversify. The aid for the main banana-growing Windward Islands and Jamaica for the year 2000 is &#163;9 million a year.

<P>
<UL>What steps they are taking to promote research into the environmental causes of cancer.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Medical Research Council recently launched a joint initiative with the Natural Environment Research Council on environment and health which clearly includes cancer research. The MRC also supports research through its "Health of the public" initiative. The Department of Health also funds research which includes investigating the association between cancer and exposure to radiation and chemicals in the environment. The department's expert committees advise on the carcinogenic risks associated with environmental factors and encourage further research in areas of concern.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew14"></A><B> Earl Baldwin of Bewdley: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his quite encouraging reply. I am not sure whether it represents an actual improvement on what I gleaned from a Written Answer to a Question of mine last May showing that government sponsored research into carcinogenic chemicals in the environment accounted for barely 2 per cent of the cancer research budget. Does the noble Lord agree that at a time of quite legitimate concern about, for example, pesticides such as lindane, toxic landfills, dietary fats and various types of hair dyes, not to mention the electronic smog in which we all live nowadays, an even greater emphasis on cancer prevention is overdue?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, it is true that our present estimates of the proportion of cancer research related to the environment are rather higher than the figures given to the noble Earl in May this year. I suspect that that is because we are better at attributing and ascribing research rather than that there is a secular increase, so to speak, in the amount <P>


<a name="column_720"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 720</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of this kind of research being undertaken. The noble Earl is right. The wide variety of environmental risks justifies very great emphasis on research into the environmental causes of cancer, but in order to do that we have to have put forward scientifically justified proposals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, on his versatility in adding health questions to his portfolio. In welcoming the appointment of Professor Mike Richards as national cancer care director, would the Minister care to give his reaction to the recent rather chilling comments of Professor Gordon McVie, director-general of the Cancer Research Campaign? He said that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the NHS cannot keep up with progress in cancer research".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

Should not Professor Richards also have the resources for, and the responsibility of, a co-ordinating role for cancer research to ensure that the NHS can cope?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am answering this Question because the research councils, including the Medical Research Council, are responsible to the Department of Trade and Industry rather than the Department of Health. It is true that Professor Richards will be concerned with cancer research although his immediate problems, as he described them on his appointment, are more to do with staffing. But improved cancer research, in particular relating to the environment, will not necessarily cause increased liabilities on the National Health Service. A good deal of effective research will cause savings to the National Health Service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that in some rural areas there are pockets of leukaemia? And how much research is being undertaken on farm fertilisers and pesticides?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, a great deal of research is being carried out on farm fertilisers and pesticides. However, most of that is concerned with the more immediate effects of peripheral nerve function rather than with cancer. I note what the noble Baroness says about leukaemia. I have no doubt that the authorities will pay attention to her remarks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, did I understand the Minister to say that the Medical Research Council is responsible to the Department of Trade and Industry and not to the Department of Health? If so, are the criteria for the funding of the council different from those controlling the funding of other more commercial organisations by the department?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, all the research councils, including the Medical Research Council and the Natural Environment Research Council, to which I referred, report to the Department of Trade and Industry and they all have comparable funding arrangements.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>charities which research drugs for the treatment of cancer, is the Minister aware that the many proven holistic methods of treating cancer would, if adopted, save the NHS a fortune?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Lord is suggesting that the Medical Research Council has set its face against the investigation of complementary medicine, I have to say to him that that is not the case. Perhaps I may give a recent example. Clinical trials on lower back pain have been set up to compare the effectiveness of traditional medicine, chiropractic and acupuncture. There is no presumption against complementary medicine in the research decisions of the Medical Research Council.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Baldwin of Bewdley: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that the priorities might change if there were more patients on research committees? Does he agree with the leading US breast cancer researcher who said, "If the world were run by women, we would work on prevention"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, of course, the more people, the more users, involved in decisions, the more likelihood of better priorities. That is one reason why the 10 Downing Street seminar of January this year made the Medical Research Council responsible for setting up a cancer research funders' group which will provide the co-ordination sought by the noble Earl.

Is he aware that, as a result of the high profile that the dome has enjoyed since it was conceived some years ago, expectations of the many people who will want to go to the experience <P>


<a name="column_722"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 722</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will be high? Are the Government confident that they will be fulfilled?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-03_para0"></a>Furthermore, does the Minister agree that continued doubts about the completion date of a fully functioning Jubilee Line extension, from Green Park to North Greenwich, must inevitably soon affect ticket sales?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, as regards what is inside the dome, I agree that people's expectations are high. From my involvement in what will be inside and around the dome, I believe that those expectations will satisfactorily be met.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-03_para1"></a>Secondly, the Jubilee Line extension already runs from central London--namely, from Waterloo--to North Greenwich. I am confident that it will be open, connecting Green Park to Waterloo, thereby connecting Stanmore in the west to Stratford in the east, well before 31st December 1999.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister tell the House what the estimated overspend on the Jubilee Line extension will be?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I do not know the precise figure. I agree that for years there has been a significant overspend; for years before this Government came into power.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew13"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, as the Minister said that the dome was running to budget, will he remind the House what the total budget was? In doing so, will he tell us what proportion of the budget will be met by taxpayers' funds and whether that proportion is higher than originally predicted?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the total figure spent on the dome, from building it to running it to the end of 2000, is &#163;758 million. Not one penny of that comes from taxpayers' money. The Millennium Commission has made a &#163;399 million grant from lottery funds and there has not been one penny of overspend in relation to that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Sharples: </B>   My Lords, when I and other noble Lords recently visited the dome, the ceiling was extremely dirty. Has that problem been solved?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the ceiling is being cleaned even as we speak.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that when people visit the dome they will be surprised to discover that the "Our Town Zone", which reflects local communities, is sponsored by that great homogenising giant, McDonalds?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the "Our Town Zone" is an opportunity for people from every town in this country to come to the dome for a day and tell the story of their town. With two exceptions, every local education authority or library board has <P>


<a name="column_723"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 723</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>subscribed to the idea. They have done so knowing full well that McDonalds has made a contribution to that. I believe that they focused more on people's opportunity to tell the story of where they live rather than on the fact that a commercial concern has been sufficiently enthusiastic about the dome to make a significant contribution to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Hankey: </B>   My Lords, while it is difficult to judge a design that is not complete, will the Minister take note of the criticism of members of the architectural profession who visited the dome only two weeks ago that the co-ordination of the interior design and the thematic pleasure to be achieved from the great variety of internal buildings puts at risk the total pleasure?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I regularly visit the dome, inside and out, and during the past nine months I have seen the inside coming together. I am not sure what is meant by the "thematic whatsit", but visiting now one has the sense of a complete whole coming together and it is both pleasing to look at and incredibly entertaining.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I was a little slow in picking up what the Minister said about the Jubilee Line. Did he say that it would be open to Greenwich or not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I said that it is already open to Greenwich from Stratford in the east and from Waterloo in the centre of London. I also confirmed that it would be open from Stanmore in the west.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, in case the Minister regards that with too much confidence, would he be interested to know that when my noble friend Lord Luke and I went, at his kind invitation, for which I thank him, to visit the exhibition last week, we thought that we should save time by coming back to the House by Underground, starting on the Jubilee Line, and had to wait 20 minutes because of a signal failure?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-03_spnew24"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, when one opens a new Underground line, as we have done, it is inevitable that there will be teething troubles. I am sure that they will be over before 31st December 1999.

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para0"></a>There have been considerable consultations and I am pleased that many of the letters from your Lordships to my noble friend Lord Bassam and myself have acknowledged the fact that we have listened with great care and introduced some helpful amendments to the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para1"></a>We have a long tradition of giving shelter to those fleeing persecution. We are determined to uphold that tradition. We need to bear in mind, however, that the immigration controls which we inherited are under growing pressure. The number of asylum applications has increased 10-fold over the past 10 years to over 46,000 applications in 1998. Seventy-one per cent of asylum decisions in 1998 were refusals. This year has seen even greater pressures. Over 51,000 applications were made between January and September--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether the noble and learned Lord would care to pause for a moment. We have to discuss the amendments before there are speeches on the Motion that the Bill do now pass. I wonder whether the House agrees that it would be a good idea to go through the amendments after which we may hear the noble and learned Lord unless the noble and learned Lord feels that it is necessary to speak at this stage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am perfectly happy to do that. I believe that the custom has been to have a short opening speech, to hear the amendments, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>and thereafter to have the closing speech. I am perfectly happy, indeed, rapturously pleased, to sit down at this stage, my theme, plainly, having already been accepted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I have been a Member of the House for a number of years--slightly longer than the noble and learned Lord--and my understanding was that it is usual to take the amendments first.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, it is quite true. The noble Lord has been in this House, to date, a good deal longer than I have.

<A NAME = "91102-04_para3"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para4"></a>Clause 4 [Accommodation for those temporarily admitted or released from detention]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Avebury </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 3, line 39, after ("the") insert ("voluntary").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, with your Lordships' permission, in moving the amendment I shall speak also to a number of other amendments as set out on the Marshalled List. We are considering Clause 4 and Schedule 13. I must begin by saying that we do not like Clause 4. That is why we have tabled an amendment which seeks to delete it. But we have tabled also a number of further amendments which deal with the detail, and the devil in the detail, to be found in Clause 13.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para6"></a>Clause 4 allows the Secretary of State to provide accommodation for persons granted temporary admission, released from detention or released on bail from detention. The new amendment to Schedule 13 tabled by the Government gives the Secretary of State power to impose any restrictions as to residence that he chooses to prescribe in regulations. There is absolutely no limit on what the Secretary of State can do. There is not even a requirement that the restrictions must be reasonable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para7"></a>One such restriction specifically foreseen in the government amendment to Schedule 13 is that the person concerned should be required to reside in accommodation provided under Clause 4, and the regulations may prohibit him
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"from being absent from that accommodation except in accordance with the restrictions imposed on him".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-04_para8"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para9"></a>What that means has been the subject of a number of conflicting reports. When my noble friend Lady Williams and I first raised the matter on Report, as recently as 18th October, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, had not the faintest idea as to how Ministers were going to use the dispersal powers in conjunction with temporary admission. He said off the cuff:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"People will be free to come and go, subject to any other conditions that are imposed".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-04_para10"></a><P>


<a name="column_726"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 726</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
A moment or two later he received a note from the box, and modified his initial reply by saying,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The note that I have says the idea is that those concerned will be required to reside overnight but will be free to come and go during the day".--[Official Report, 18/10/99; col. 753.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-04_para11"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para12"></a>I must ask the Minister who is to reply how it is that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, was left in the position of having to answer this question when certainly the guts of the press release must have been already available within the department at the time. It is unfair to have put the noble and learned Lord in that position. The press release about Oakington, issued three days later on 21st October, put the matter the other way round:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The applicant will be required to reside at Oakington";
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-04_para13"></a>
and,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in certain circumstances applicants would be able, with prior approval, to leave without escort for specific purposes and periods".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-04_para14"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para15"></a>The norm, then, is that an applicant must reside constantly in Oakington. He may go out to Tesco's, to the doctor's, or whatever, without an escort only with special permission from Mr Jack Straw. He then has to return within an hour or whatever the time specified in the restrictions. If he misses the curfew, he risks being transferred to prison or to a detention centre. I respectfully suggest that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, inadvertently misled the House when replying to questions on Report. I do not blame him. The habit of the department has been to produce a blizzard of amendments at the last minute before every stage of this Bill and it is impossible for Ministers, let alone Back Benchers, to know everything that is going on within the department.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para16"></a>According to the Guardian of 22nd October, every asylum applicant arriving at Dover without papers, or at Stansted, regardless of whether he has papers or not, is to be bundled off immediately to Oakington. I ask the Minister to confirm that, and to explain why those arrival points are being singled out for special treatment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para17"></a>The purpose of the new facility at Oakington, and presumably others which may be constructed in the future, is to facilitate prompt consideration of an asylum claim, as the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Cope, on 29th October. The imposition of other restrictions is now applied only by the government amendment to the schedule to persons sent to institutions such as Oakington. If that was the real intention, the location of the new centres should be convenient for access by the agencies advising asylum seekers, unless, of course, the intention is to reach a first decision without affording the applicant access to legal advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para18"></a>I do not believe that that is the case. I spoke to representatives at the Refugee Legal Centre just before entering the Chamber. I was told that the Home Office had asked its representatives to examine ways in which they could provide support facilities for people at Oakington. Their first reaction was that considerable resources would be required, that these were difficult <P>


<a name="column_727"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 727</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to estimate and that the number of firms capable of dealing with asylum cases in the Cambridge region was very small.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para19"></a>The Refugee Legal Centre faxed me a map showing the location of firms which, I understand, have applied for franchises. There are only two in the immediate neighbourhood of Cambridge. I should like the Minister to explain whether it is the intention that franchised firms, or the Refugee Legal Centre, will send representatives to Oakington, or whether, as another alternative which has been considered by the RLS--although it has not put forward any firm proposals--there will be a permanent RLS office located on the site of Oakington. That seems to me to be the better alternative, because the throughput will be extremely large. There will be a maximum of 400 residents in Oakington at any one time. The Minister has said that, on average, they will be there no longer than seven days. Therefore the rate of processing applications will be extremely intensive and will require a scale of resources which will certainly not be available to the franchised firms in the neighbourhood, even if it were possible for their few representatives to spend all their time on the site.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para20"></a>The press release says that applicants will remain at Oakington for,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"short periods of about seven days while their claims are being considered".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-04_para21"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para22"></a>We all know that the Home Office's perception of time is highly elastic. The second amendment to the schedule gives the Secretary of State power to make an applicant stay in Oakington for up to 10 days, giving a leeway of three days. That is meant to be for discussion purposes only. If the Minister says that under extreme circumstances it might be necessary for a person to be kept there for a couple of weeks then, of course, we could consider the argument. However, I suggest that it is quite unacceptable for there to be a totally open-ended power requiring an applicant to stay in one of those places indefinitely, particularly when one considers how the Home Office uses its existing powers of detention to keep people in prisons and detention centres for months, and in some cases for over a year.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-04_para23"></a>Finally--and I believe that my noble friend will amplify what I have to say on this point--Amendments Nos. 82 and 83 are intended to give effect to the very strong recommendations in the 27th Report of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation. The recommendations include that conditions such as are mentioned in Schedule 13 should be imposed only for prescribed purposes and only where they are reasonably necessary and for the single purpose which has been stated so far in order to avoid public order disturbances. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, I also ask a number of questions of the Government. It would be helpful if they could give us a full account of the reasons for deciding to establish a centre at Oakington. Perhaps they can tell us something about the arrangements which they hope to make there for various forms of surveillance and monitoring.
<P>


<a name="column_728"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 728</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para0"></a>I do not quarrel with the procedures of the House, but I rather regret that the noble and learned Lord was not able to set out in slightly more detail what he wanted to say at the beginning. As he will know, that is highly relevant to this particular new clause. New Clause 4 is a relatively late addition to the Bill. We know that, in the last month for which details were given, there has been a substantial increase in the number of people seeking asylum. We do not know whether Clause 4 is essentially a reaction to that and we are anxious to probe a little further the Government's intentions in that respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para1"></a>The central question which concerns us is that we are not sure whether the proposal for the camp at Oakington, which I believe is based at the old RAF base there, is intended to be part of a procedure concerning initial stages of holding people while their first hearing is conducted and is, therefore, a form of limited detention for a short period until the first hearing has been held. That is the purpose of our suggestion that 10 days would be a proper limit. Or is it to be part of the dispersal system? If it is to be part of that system, we are considerably concerned because the Home Office itself has said that dispersal should not take place except to areas which are ethnically mixed and where there is reasonable access to medical and legal services.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para2"></a>The adviser on immigration to the diocese of Ely, in whose area Oakington falls, wrote to the Chief Planning Officer at Cambridgeshire County Council on 23rd October and made the point directly that there is no significantly ethnically-mixed community at Oakington. Indeed, there is virtually no ethnic mix for miles of fields around. She also mentioned that she knows of only one person who knows anything at all about immigration law in the whole surrounding area, and that that person is an immigration adviser at the citizens advice bureau.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para3"></a>Therefore, some of the pledges on dispersal that were given at an earlier stage to the noble Duke, the Duke of Norfolk, among others, have not been able to be met in the case of Oakington. If it is a system of detention, albeit a limited one, then we are concerned on constitutional grounds. As far as we can see from Clause 4, the normal protections that occur in the case of detention--in other words, that there is a relatively close system of monitoring; that there is some structure of accountability, and so forth--are certainly not contained in Clause 4. I shall leave the issue of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation to my noble friend Lord Goodhart. But our legal advice is that this provision is almost certainly incompatible with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para4"></a>We are concerned about Oakington if the detention is to be very short term. I ask the Government to go back to the pledges made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer. On 18th October I asked him the direct question as to whether the accommodation would be secure. He replied at col. 753 of Hansard that it would not. When asked whether people would be able to move in and out without permission, he replied that they would be free to come and go. It was on the <P>


<a name="column_729"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 729</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>strength of that reply that we did not then raise issues with the Home Office on 21st October when the announcement was made by the Minister of State, Barbara Roche, about the setting up of Oakington. However, we are now profoundly concerned because that does not fit into the answers that were given in the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para5"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Avebury, I understand, to some extent at least, the pressures which the Home Office is under. I am not trying to make difficulties for it. However, like my noble friends on these Benches and, I believe, the House generally, I am concerned that in a situation where one detains or, to use the words of the Select Committee, a form of house arrest is introduced, there must be proper safeguards; there must be proper structures of complaint; and there must be proper inspection. At the moment, Clause 4 does not make such provision. I should be most grateful if the noble and learned Lord or the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, were to tell us a good deal more about this. I repeat that we are not trying to be obstructive, but we are deeply concerned about the precedent that it establishes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I speak with particular reference to the report of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation. That is in reference to the new powers described by the Select Committee as house arrest powers, contained in government Amendment No. 79.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para6"></a>Clause 168(1) states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Schedule 13 makes minor and consequential amendments".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-05_para7"></a>
The amendments which are to be inserted into Schedule 13 plainly are neither minor nor consequential. As has been pointed out, under these amendments regulations could be made which authorise de facto detention. As I said, I am particularly concerned that the house arrest provisions tell immigrants living in what I might call Clause 4 accommodation where and when they can come and go. If they are residing in Clause 4 accommodation, why is it necessary to impose a curfew or to tell immigrants that they must stay indoors at certain times of day? If they are not in detention then, prima facie, surely the immigrants should be free to come and go as they please, unless they are absent to such an extent that it gives cause to believe that they are not living in the accommodation. Anything else would be extremely unjustified under the European Convention on Human Rights, and I believe that it would be an arbitrary restriction on liberty.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para8"></a>That provision caused great concern to the Delegated Powers Committee. The Home Office submitted a memorandum to the committee dealing with the Report stage amendments. When we were dealing with what was in fact the original version of this amendment, rather than the slightly revised version which we now have, the only reason suggested in the memorandum for giving a power to tell people to stay indoors at certain times of the day was to avoid public order disturbances. Should anyone wish to see the memorandum, it is printed as an appendix to the Select Committee report.
<P>


<a name="column_730"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 730</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para9"></a>Disorder is more likely to be directed against the immigrants than instigated by them. They may of course be given warnings and advice as to where they should go and when they should stay in. But surely it is wrong to say that they must stay indoors because it is possible that, if they go out, illegal acts of violence may be committed against them. I appreciate that difficult situations have arisen, particularly in Dover and other Kent ports. However, restrictions of this kind are, frankly, giving way to mob rule.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para10"></a>The Delegated Powers Committee made a number of suggestions, one of which, I am glad to say, has been accepted by the Government. That states that these regulations should be made by the affirmative procedure. Of course, I welcome that. However, the Select Committee also suggested that further restrictions may be inserted into the Bill. One such restriction was that powers under the regulations should be exercisable only so far as reasonably necessary. That is echoed by Amendments Nos. 82 and 83 in the name of my noble friend Lord Avebury. Another suggestion is that house arrest powers should be restricted to cases where they are needed for prevention of public disorder.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para11"></a>It is true, of course, that the regulations can be challenged under the Human Rights Act, but, as the Select Committee said, it is unsatisfactory for asylum seekers to have to rely on a challenge under the Human Rights Act to contest a decision taken by immigration officers under the regulations. It would be much better if the power to make the regulations were restricted so that no regulations could be made that may infringe the Human Rights Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para12"></a>Speaking for myself, I believe that the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation did not go far enough. I believe that the house arrest powers should be removed from the Bill, as proposed by Amendment No. 80.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para13"></a>I should be extremely interested to hear from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, or the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, why the absolute minimum was done, as suggested by the Select Committee, and why further restrictions, not merely the requirement of affirmative resolutions, were not included in the amendments that are to be put into Schedule 13.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, in a previous discussion on this matter I pointed out that powers were being taken to enable these institutions to be little different from prisons. Although your Lordships were reassured at the time--as shown from quotations given--that that was not the idea at all, the press release, to which reference has been made, made it clear that that was extremely near to the idea.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para14"></a>It is interesting that the Bill never uses any particular word to describe such institutions. All sorts of words have been used: house arrest, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said just now; open prison; detention centre; holding centre; and internment centre. In Northern Ireland internment was described as "administrative detention", and that is not far away from what is happening in this clause.

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para15"></a>As a result, it is clear that these institutions, like the one near Cambridge that we have heard about--no doubt there will be others in due course--will be little different from detention centres, except that the safeguards which appear later in the Bill, applying to detention centres, broadly speaking do not apply to these kinds of centres, whatever they are called. That must be a worry to us all. The different stories that have been put out by the Home Office at different stages do not add to confidence in this matter. I hope that the noble and learned Lord in his reply will be able to tell us more about them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para16"></a>I shall not add to what has been said in that respect, except to draw attention to the fact that the Home Office memorandum to the Select Committee said, among other things, that such accommodation would incorporate interviewing facilities as well as facilities for legal advice. That could simply mean a room or set of rooms in which lawyers could talk to their clients. That would constitute facilities for legal advice. Legal advice is not freely available in the area of Cambridgeshire that we are talking about. Such legal advice would have to come from London, which would be expensive as well as extremely time-consuming and difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para17"></a>Matters will be made even more complicated if the amount of time that people spend in the institutions is short, as we hope it is. If they spend seven days in the institutions, the lawyer to whom they spoke on arrival in the south-east of England--in Dover or London or elsewhere--may not realise that they have gone to Cambridgeshire. The lawyer would have to go to Cambridgeshire to see them a second time, but after seven days they could be somewhere else altogether. The same lawyer may be able to attend to their case, but they could then be in some other part of the country. It does not seem to me that legal advice will be facilitated in the true sense of the word.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-05_para18"></a>Lastly, much of this is left to regulations. We are used to that idea, but one cannot avoid the thought that this is a late addition to the Bill. I believe that institutions of this type are a late thought by the Home Office. The real reason why it is done by regulation is because the Home Office has not thought through the matter. Some points that have come out in this short debate and earlier in discussions on this subject indicate that the Home Office has not thought carefully about what the centres are supposed to be and where they will be. The fact that it has not yet hit on a name for them reinforces that thought in my mind. No doubt the noble and learned Lord will be able to tell us all about them.

<P>
<A NAME="91102-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I rise to express my disquiet about the situation revealed by the Liberal Democrat Benches and by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich. I do not propose to detain the House for any length of time on this issue because I associate myself closely with the arguments that have been raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para0"></a>It is incumbent on my noble and learned friend, if he is to reply to the debate, or on my noble friend Lord Bassam, to take these arguments seriously. There is a real risk of a serious breach of human rights arising on this issue. I am concerned about the opportunities for judicial involvement or oversight in this area. Concerns have been expressed about the availability of legal support, whether through legal aid or privately--most likely it is to be legal aid. If that support is to be seriously jeopardised simply because there will not be the opportunity to provide it on a coherent basis, the situation becomes extremely serious.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para1"></a>Perhaps my noble and learned friend will say where the independent judicial oversight of detention is to be provided. Further, how does what is proposed accord with Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights? Those are serious matters. I declare an interest because for several years I was chairman of the Refugee Council. In those days I was involved, with my noble friend Lord Dubs who was executive director, in dealing with those issues on a day-to-day basis. I am deeply concerned. I hope that my noble and learned friend will be able to allay my concerns.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-06_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, these issues have been before Parliament previously. In the winter of 1627 to 1628 the King released a number of former MPs from detention, subject to restrictions which probed the distinction between dispersal and detention. I believe the object was to prevent their re-election to the other place. Of course, the effect was exactly the opposite. In both Houses the distinctions marking the line between dispersal and detention were very much those spoken of by my noble friend Lady Williams of Crosby and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. The legality of the view taken by the Houses was never tested in court because on that occasion the Government backed off. That is a precedent that I would be happy to see followed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, quite a number of serious questions have been raised. Perhaps the House will allow me to answer at greater length than normal at this stage because they are questions which have not been fully dealt with on earlier occasions.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para2"></a>I entirely understand what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has explained--that is to say, the object behind the proposal to amend or leave out Clause 4. In this group of amendments we need to bear in mind the proposals in Government Amendment No. 79. The <P>


<a name="column_733"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 733</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>purpose of that amendment is simply to enable the extension of the power to impose residence conditions on those granted temporary admission.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para3"></a>Perhaps I may look at the wider context. As the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, indicated, it is notoriously well known that there has been a substantial increase in the number of asylum applications. The average number of applications each month from July to September was nearly 7,000. That is about 60 per cent higher than in 1998. It is not appropriate to have a wide-ranging discussion on the reasons for that. But, plainly, no responsible government can simply shrug their shoulders and do nothing.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para4"></a>The secondary proposition I put forward is simply one of fact. There is no doubt at all that the majority of applicants--about two-thirds--will not qualify either for refugee status or exceptional leave to remain. A number of them will have made claims which are manifestly unfounded. It is not fair to those who have genuine claims, the taxpayer or the rest of the citizens of this country, that unfounded claims are able to clog up the system and exploit delays. I agree that, as noble Lords on the Benches opposite often say, the system is extremely time-consuming and does not actually deliver just outcomes, if that means an efficient and prompt decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para5"></a>I stress that the facility at Oakington is based on existing detention powers. I am responding particularly to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams. I confirm her impression that it is designed to deal with claims where it appears that a rapid decision can be made. The applicants will be required to stay at the centre for a short period of about seven days while their claim is decided. If their case cannot be decided that quickly, or if at the end of the period there has been a refusal and a decision not to return home immediately, then applicants will be granted temporary admission or, if necessary, moved to the conditions under which ordinary detention occurs.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para6"></a>However, I repeat--I hope I am not being tedious--that applicants will be required to stay at Oakington under existing immigration powers to detain. I believe there has been some misunderstanding here. The Oakington arrangements do not depend on the additional powers of temporary admission proposed in government Amendment No. 79. The wider powers contained in that amendment allow us to impose residence conditions on temporary admission. They will allow us to develop quite different reception arrangements, whether at Oakington or elsewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para7"></a>I turn to Clause 4. It does not contain any power to impose residence conditions on persons granted temporary admission. It is simply to provide a clear power for the Secretary of State to provide accommodation to persons granted temporary admission. Whether or not those who are granted that permission may be required to reside at such accommodation--and if so, subject to what conditions--is the point and purpose of government Amendment No. 79. If I have it right in my own mind, <P>


<a name="column_734"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 734</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the aim of Amendment No. 1 is to limit the Secretary of State's power to provide accommodation at which persons are prepared to reside voluntarily.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para8"></a>In a sense, of course, all temporary admission is voluntary. It is an alternative to being detained and it will remain so. If someone seeking admission is not prepared to abide by the proposed conditions of temporary admission, the alternatives are either to return to the country of origin or remain here in detention. But if one accepts conditions of temporary admission, it is not unreasonable to be required to abide by them. Breach of the conditions of temporary admission is now an offence under immigration law and it will continue to be so. That is why we believe the word "voluntary" is not appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for giving way. As regards the specific point of the length of time people may stay at Oakington before being granted leave to enter or moved into detention, and the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davies, before the Bill goes to another place will the Government consider putting a time limit in the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may come to that in due time. That was a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, in his amendment. I believe I paraphrase fairly by saying that he said that if seven days is too short a period, do the Government want to bring forward a period of about two weeks? Perhaps it is more convenient if I deal with that matter a little later. I am conscious of the fact that the House wants a full explanation of all the amendments in this group.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, was really suggesting that Clause 4 should be dropped from the Bill altogether. I repeat that that clause makes it plain that the Home Secretary may provide accommodation to persons given temporary admission. That is necessary because of Government Amendment No. 79. If we want that amendment, Clause 4 has to remain.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para10"></a>We discussed Amendment No. 79 briefly at Report stage. The amendment was withdrawn pending consideration by the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation. As noble Lords have indicated, there was substantial comment from the committee, and for that I am grateful. We have thought about that in framing the revised amendment. Its purpose is to extend the purposes for which residence conditions may be imposed when those seeking leave to enter or remain are given temporary admission or released from detention on temporary admission while the application is being considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para11"></a>There is already power in the Immigration Act 1971 to impose residence restrictions on those given temporary admission. Our advice is that, as currently framed, the restrictions should be those necessary to maintain contact and prevent absconding. We believe that those objectives are important, but they are too narrow. The large influx of asylum seekers to which I <P>


<a name="column_735"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 735</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>referred a moment ago suggests that we may need wider powers not only to maintain contact but also possibly to prevent potential public order problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para12"></a>It is a reasonably founded point that it is possibly harsh at first blush to think that one needs these powers to prevent public order problems. The sad truth is that there have been such problems in the past. We wish to be able to protect people by having these powers available. I do not believe that that is unreasonable. In particular we want to avoid pressure on local services. We want to be able to ensure full and rapid consideration of claims.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para13"></a>As I said earlier, it has to be borne in mind that two-thirds of the applications are likely to fail. I put this neutrally: there is every inducement to abscond by those who believe that their applications are likely to fail. I do not believe that any government discharges their duty if they do not contemplate that and take proportionate powers to deal with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-06_para14"></a>There are now two particular provisions--

<A NAME="91102-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for giving way. Can he explain how "effective powers to prevent absconding" can be anything that falls short of actual detention?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_time0"></A><H5>4 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, it is probably more helpful to the House for me to develop the themes as I have them in my mind. Of course, one does not have to have full detention in the sense of imprisonment to prevent people absconding. For instance--in giving this example I am going completely outside the scope of this Bill--home detention curfew is a device which stops people absconding. I am sure that most people would not call that detention in the sense that imprisonment is detention. One can be proportionate as long as one has flexible powers and as long as--I shall develop this in deference to my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis as well as to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart--one considers the overarch. Let us not forget that we imposed that upon ourselves as a government in bringing into effect the Human Rights Act as early as 2nd October next year. I shall say a few words about the ECHR in a moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para0"></a>The provisions we introduced after reflecting on the views of the Select Committee aim to prohibit residence in one or more specific areas. We have seen a substantial increase in the number of people seeking asylum in this country. There has been a growth in tension between the local population and the newcomers in certain areas. In a sense, that is hardly a cause for surprise. We must bear in mind that people like to live in settled communities. It is easy, if one does not live in a disrupted community, to urge fortitude and a philosophic approach on people less fortunate. We must strike a humane, civilised balance between the legitimate needs of those who come to our shores, whether or not they are likely to be found to be genuine applicants, and the legitimate requirements of people who live in various communities.
<P>


<a name="column_736"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 736</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para1"></a>As we all know in London and the south-east, some people in some parts of the United Kingdom have had to bear a disproportionate burden--I use that phrase deliberately. That helps no one. Indeed, it disturbs and disadvantages a large number of people. There is no one in this House who would do other than condemn racist, xenophobic propaganda. One way of dealing with that is to set our face firmly against it. Another important way of dealing with it is to establish considered dispersal to parts of the country better able to cope.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para2"></a>I hope that does not sound harsh. I believe it to be a civilised approach to a problem which is intractable. We sometimes get sudden influxes or over-concentrations of asylum seekers. Noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches have frequently pointed out the causes for that. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, has indicated quite rightly that if there is a disturbance, let us say, in middle or eastern Europe, one is likely to see a sudden influx of people fleeing those parts of the world; the same can be said of parts of Africa.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para3"></a>We are therefore planning dispersal arrangements under Part VI, with which we have already dealt. In the short term, some asylum seekers who may congregate in specific areas may still be on social security benefit. We want to have this power available. We do not envisage using the power on a routine basis, but only to relieve extreme pressures on specific areas in extreme circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para4"></a>I turn now to the second element of the amendment; it is not about the use of detention or the regime proposed at Oakington. The point of the amendment is to give greater flexibility in the use of temporary admission. We would then be able to develop reception facilities at which those given temporary admission were required to reside, but were free to come and go during the day if they wished. I return to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. That is an important sanction against absconding. It is not 24-hour detention; it is an intermediate stage which your Lordships--I say this respectfully--ought to welcome and not criticise.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para5"></a>We want to be able to ensure that applicants remain at the accommodation overnight--again, I say this without any doubt that it is a proper thing to say--and to be able to say to them, "We require you to be present at this designated accommodation at certain times because that is when your interviews will occur". There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, it is a sensible way to behave. One must apply proportionality in more than one way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, if the condition of temporary admission is that a person will attend an interview when required by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, and he is in breach of that condition, sanctions can be brought to bear against him. He could be detained. A person therefore has every incentive to comply with the request to attend an immigration interview without the power in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I disagree. Of course, he has an incentive to attend; but he also has <P>


<a name="column_737"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 737</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>an incentive to abscond. We are simply introducing perfectly measured provisions to deal with those circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, does not that have to be matched by the availability of access to those who would advise such persons if advice were sought? If the availability of access is extremely limited, that is a serious matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, not for the first time I entirely agree with what my noble friend says. We are intending to make suitable provision for legal advice to be available. I am dealing particularly with Oakington. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, was good enough to acknowledge that we are already discussing with the Refugee Council and others the nature of the provision to be made. But I must stress that we are talking about relatively short periods of time and we want to do our best to achieve this proportionate balance.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para6"></a>So, I repeat, residence is for a short time. We are trying to develop--I have no difficulty in putting this proposal forward--a wider menu of options which rely less on detention and which permit, in appropriate cases, the grant of temporary admission, albeit sometimes with restrictions. In that way we have more flexible powers to impose residence conditions on temporary admission which ought to be of practical help in terms of fairer, faster and firmer control. That is the point and purpose of the amendment and I do not apologise for taking a few moments to develop that theme.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para7"></a>We need to go forward by way of a power to make regulations. One of the aspects of our common failure--this is not a party political point; no government have been able to deal with this aspect satisfactorily--is that legislation has been too inflexible and has not been able to deal with changing events and changing pressures; we cannot respond quickly enough. We want to have a flexible system and these amendments contribute to that objective. However, under the Human Rights Act 1998, any regulations will have to comply with convention rights. They would authorise the imposition of additional descriptions of conditions only so far as that could be justified.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para8"></a>I want to spend a few moments on the Select Committee. The committee was quite rightly concerned that there should be some limitations on the scope of the power. We have tried to take that on board by the redrafting. The key point was to adopt the recommendation that the regulation should be made subject to the affirmative procedure. Parliament will have to be satisfied that, whenever the powers are to be used, they are proportionate and necessary to achieve the stated objective.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para9"></a>I promised to deal with ECHR compatibility. We have given further consideration to the earlier recommendation of the Select Committee in relation to the use of ECHR compatibility statements for secondary legislation. We thought about it quite carefully, not least because we had the benefit either of <P>


<a name="column_738"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 738</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contributions from your Lordships in the Chamber or informed discussions in correspondence and in meetings. Therefore, I am pleased to be able to tell the House that I give the undertaking that, when moving regulations which are subject to the affirmative procedure, Ministers will always inform the House whether they are satisfied that the instrument is compatible with convention rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para10"></a> I can say from my own personal experience that that is not something which is done lightly. Indeed, when one signs the certificate, one bears in mind the fact that there is quite a body of informed expertise in this House which is likely to challenge any such certificate if it is wrongly given. That is an extremely important discipline for all departments and all Ministers to be aware of--and I have given this undertaking in unambiguous terms. I do not think that even a lawyer could wriggle out of such an undertaking. I hope that your Lordships will recognise that, even if we do not deliver perfect satisfaction on every occasion, we have listened to the points raised and considered the recommendations of the Select Committee with very great care. Again, I have to say that I believe it was of benefit to all of us that we withdrew from the detailed investigation of some of these points on the proposal that was clearly agreed to by my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer. It was the better way to proceed and has given us all the opportunity for reflection.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para11"></a>I want to go further and adopt the same approach for secondary legislation, subject to the negative resolution procedure, if it amends primary legislation. That will apply to regulations made under all legislation, not just those made under this Bill. I think your Lordships will stand amazed at my moderation. This is a very important step forward. Perhaps I may spend a few moments on the Human Rights Act. When it was introduced, I believe we all thought that it was a landmark piece of legislation intended to be a curb on executive power, especially when it has a tendency to be arbitrary. This is an ample first, or early, demonstration of the continuing power of that great statute.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para12"></a>I turn now to Amendments Nos. 80 to 83, which are amendments to government Amendment No. 79. I have already tried to explain the drafting of the provision of our amendment and I believe I touched on the issues raised by Amendments Nos. 80 to 83. Amendment No. 80 seeks to take out the provision for regulations to prohibit a person being absent from accommodation, except in accordance with restrictions imposed on him. We must have the ability to impose restrictions, such as being present every night. I dealt with this matter in response to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and do not believe that requirement to be onerous. The person has to be present each night, or on particular days, for the purpose of interview. There would not be a significant purpose in requiring residence without that condition.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-07_para13"></a>I promised to return to Amendment No. 81 and do so now because this is the context in which the question was raised by a number of noble Lords, especially the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. The amendment states that a requirement to reside can be imposed only once <P>


<a name="column_739"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 739</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and for a maximum of 10 days. However, we know perfectly well that some people fail in the first application and then return to try again. In those circumstances, we ought to be able to require further residence at accommodation provided by the Secretary of State if that seems appropriate. It may well be reasonable to require residence for periods longer than 10 days, bearing in mind always the fact that we are talking about temporary admission.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord can extend the 10-day limit on any one occasion. If he has in mind the situation where a person has made an application which fails, has then gone back abroad and ultimately returned to put in a second application, surely the Secretary of State would want the power to put that person back into Oakington for a second time. Let us suppose, then, that we said that the detention should be for a maximum of 10 days on any one occasion.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo991102/text/91102-08.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, that could be done if the amendment were differently drafted. However, that is not the case and I am dealing with the amendment as presently drafted.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-08_para0"></a>As I said, we paid careful attention to the recommendations of the Select Committee. We wondered whether we could go further by including a reference to "reasonably necessary", along the lines set out in Amendment No. 82. However, we thought that that would not, in practice, limit the power any further; indeed, that is already achieved by the limitations on secondary legislation. I repeat: these regulations would have to be convention compliant.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-08_para1"></a>I shall conclude by dealing with a number of particular questions which were raised. Most of the pressure recently--certainly in the past months of this year--has been in the South East. Oakington is reasonably convenient in South East terms. If there had been other suitable premises available, we should of course have considered them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-08_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope, and other noble Lords, asked about safeguards. I believe that part of the safeguards lie in the affirmative resolution procedure and the certifying procedure, which I hope I did not refer to at too great a length.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-08_para3"></a>In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, I need to reaffirm the difference conceptually, as I see it, between imprisonment detention and the much lighter regime that we are now discussing. As I said earlier, breach of conditions will be an offence; indeed, that was a proposition put forward by one of your Lordships. There will be no security in Section 4 accommodation: there will be no guards or any power to use force to keep people there. I say again--I think, reasonably--that that is not detention in the sense that many of your Lordships have criticised in the past. I have in mind, for example, the conditions at Campsfield House.

<A NAME = "91102-08_para4"></a>As regards location, I can simply say that Oakington is the best option that has been identified. We have not consulted outside organisations about the choice of location. We have had general discussions about the setting up of such a facility. The RLC and the Refugee Council were involved in those discussions. So, in response to the particular question from the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, I can tell him that that is the nature of the consultation which took place. The answer is yes about the idea, but, as I understand it, not specifically about Oakington.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-08_para5"></a>I hope that I have been able to satisfy your Lordships. I recognise that I have take a little time to do so, but this is too important a topic and group of thoughts and amendments to skate over. I trust that I have been able to satisfy my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis, in particular as regards his concerns about convention compliance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that he has given a most coherent explanation of the purposes of, and the need for, these powers? I hope that the Home Office will be able to stick to the procedures that he has outlined in the use of those powers. Is the noble and learned Lord also aware that I am grateful to him for accepting the affirmative powers, as suggested earlier, and for outlining the human rights points? I am not quite sure that the name he gave to this facility of "Section 4 accommodation" has a very happy ring about, but no doubt it will do to be going on with.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his extremely generous approach. I can only repeat that I think we were wise to take note of the feeling of the House that some aspects might not have been sufficiently thought through and to decide that it was better to reserve our thoughts and considerations for Third Reading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister kindly deal with Amendment No. 83, which proposes to substitute the word "must" for "may"? I believe I am right in saying that that was the one amendment which the noble and learned Lord did not address directly in his response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, one is back to the usual answer that I know the noble Lord has found unsatisfactory on previous occasions. We believe that this formulation is a better one, rather than using the softer phraseology suggested by the word "may". We have had this debate on a number of previous occasions. I cannot give an answer that will be more satisfactory to the noble Lord than those I have given in the past.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may just put a question to the Minister. I am sorry that it comes towards the end of the debate. I believe that the noble and learned Lord accepts that there has been a considerable amount of confusion as regards the word "detention". However, now that he has explained <P>


<a name="column_741"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 741</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>precisely what it means, perhaps he can answer this question. The noble and learned Lord placed considerable emphasis on people absconding, yet he explained a very liberal regime--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, we are at the Third Reading stage of the Bill. The only noble Lord who should speak after the Minister is the mover of the amendment, unless short and factual questions arise. I would ask noble Lords not to make speeches.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-08_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, I put a factual question to the Minister. What rights exist within the provisions of the Bill to challenge what we call the "detention" of people at the Oakington centre?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-08_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the same rights as presently exist in the 1971 Immigration Act. But I stress that we are talking about two different situations. One of them concerns short-term accommodation for seven days or so. I do not think that it is illiberal to say that we want to provide a regime which is speedy, efficient and fair. To deliver our promise--which is a moral obligation to quite a large number of people: to those who are not genuine asylum seekers as well as to those who are and to people who live in this country and fund all of these systems--I say with great respect to the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, that it is not unreasonable to say that for a short period of time there will be some limitation on people's freedom of movement while we assess their claims. He and I may disagree fundamentally on that, but I doubt it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-08_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, when the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General said that there would be no force exercisable to prevent someone leaving one of the intermediate institutions, is that because if such an attempt were made by someone, the powers of detention could then be invoked to keep them there?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-08_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, as I said earlier--I am sorry to displease the noble Lord, Lord Cope, by using this awful shorthand again--Clause 4 accommodation does not comprise detention. It is a requirement to reside, subject to restrictions of the kind that I mentioned. However, if there is a breach of conditions, an offence is committed. I think that is a better way of dealing with the situation than having security or guards or making use of force to keep people there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-08_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that I can give only qualified thanks to the noble and learned Lord for what he said in reply to this group of amendments. First, I thank him for the assurances that he has given on the incorporation of a compatibility statement in secondary legislation, which I think is an important statement of government policy not just for this Bill but for all future legislation. However, it does not help us with these amendments. With respect, I believe that first the noble and learned Lord tried to pull the wool <P>


<a name="column_742"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 742</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>over our eyes by pretending that what we are discussing today are the dispersal provisions rather than the semi-detention provisions which we have in relation to Oakington.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-08_para6"></a>Everyone recognises that there is a problem in certain places in the south-east. We all know that the London boroughs have suffered a tremendous burden on their resources in trying to cope with large numbers of asylum applicants. However, I was under the impression--there have been several newspaper reports on this recently--that as regards the voluntary arrangements which have been made by the London boroughs and those which have been principally concerned with dealing with large numbers of asylum applicants, there has already been a dispersal to other areas of the country which is working successfully. However, nothing has been said about that. The Minister did not volunteer any information about the extent to which the London boroughs, for instance, have been able, through voluntary arrangements made through the LGA, to persuade other local authorities to take on a fair share of the burden. I believe that that is already well under way and that perhaps the powers in Clause 4 would not have been needed if we had gone down that voluntary route.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-08_para7"></a>However, that is an entirely separate issue from the question of whether or not you force people to reside in a place such as Oakington, and whether in doing so you label them--as I believe we are--as people whose claims are manifestly ill founded. The Minister did not quite go so far as to say that anyone who is put in Oakington is a bogus asylum seeker, but that is how they will be seen. If they are directed to that centre and their claims are disposed of within a week, obviously the implication is that they had to go there because there was no particular merit in their claim which could have justified their being allowed access to proper legal advice in a centre such as London.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-08_para8"></a>With respect, I did not think that the Minister gave a satisfactory answer to my questions about how such people were to be able to access legal advice. If I am correct--the Minister can correct me if I am wrong--the arrangements at Oakington will come into effect on 1st January 2000. The consultations with the RLC and, for all I know, other organisations, are still only at the first stages. As I said, the RLC has told me that the task of providing the resources for legal advice in Oakington will be formidable. I mentioned that it has sent me a map which shows that there are only two qualified centres of legal excellence within the Cambridgeshire area which could give the residents of Oakington proper advice. I do not believe that that system can come into operation by 1st January 2000 and that the people who will be sent to Oakington will therefore have proper access to legal advice in the first phase of the scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-08_para9"></a>Whatever the Minister may say, the European human rights convention states that people who are detained--I know that he said that what we are discussing is not detention--must have both scrutiny and review of their cases. I am not sure whether the European Court would take the view that the Minister has expounded; namely, that this is not detention. At <P>


<a name="column_743"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 743</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one point he said that Oakington used existing detention powers. How can it use existing detention powers if putting someone in Oakington is not detention? It sounds very like detention to me.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-08_para10"></a>In spite of the Minister's assurances that people will be free to come and go during the day--which is a repetition of what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, said on a previous occasion--the fact is that the powers that we are granting to the Secretary of State go way beyond that. They would allow the Secretary of State to provide that no one can stir hand or foot outside Oakington except if they have a special grant of permission from the Secretary of State to visit the doctor or to seek legal advice in Cambridge. We are giving a blank cheque to require that someone stay in this place which is miles from anywhere. I do not even know what the public transport provision is like and I am sure that the Minister could not tell us that. I have not the faintest idea how anyone gets from Oakington into Cambridge if it is necessary to do so for any purpose, whether legal, medical or so on.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-08_para11"></a>As my noble friend Lady Williams said, this is not compatible with what has been said about dispersal on previous occasions; namely, that asylum seekers who are sent away from London will be put in places where they can access services and where proper support facilities exist for people in their ethnic or linguistic groups. I know that we shall not win this argument at this stage. Between now and when Amendments Nos. 80 and 83 are put to your Lordships I shall consider whether to press them to a Division. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 1.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to speak again to this amendment which was originally tabled on Report and which concerns persons to be excluded from the United Kingdom under our international obligations. During the previous discussion of this amendment, the question was raised of whether the United Kingdom had ever been censured for admitting someone subject to a travel ban that was binding on the United Kingdom. I am pleased to confirm to the House that there is no record of any such occurrence.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para3"></a>During the previous discussion, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, also asked whether the application of the new clause should be extended to cover travel bans imposed by the Commonwealth. I have given this matter careful consideration. However, the Commonwealth does not take decisions which give rise to binding legal commitments. The Government do not believe, therefore, that it is necessary to include in the new clause a reference to the Commonwealth.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para4"></a>Having looked again at the amendment, we realise that it also requires a minor amendment to ensure that internationally-binding travel restrictions are framed in terms of defined categories of person rather than named individuals, which are also covered by the provisions of the new clause. For example, UN Security Council Resolution 1054, adopted in 1996, requires states to take measures to restrict the entry into their territory of members and officials of the Sudanese Government and members of the Sudanese armed forces. The amendment now takes account of this requirement.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para5"></a>As I explained on Report, the effect of Amendment No. 4 is to insert a new Section 8B into the 1971 Immigration Act. This will provide that certain people who are subject to an EU or UN travel ban have to be refused leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. In addition, where a person has leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, this leave will be cancelled upon his or her becoming an excluded <P>


<a name="column_745"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 745</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>person. Subsection (4) of the new clause defines an "excluded person" as a person named by or under a designated instrument, or of a category described in a designated instrument.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para6"></a>For the purposes of the clause, the Secretary of State may by order designate an instrument if it is a resolution of the UN Security Council or an instrument made by the Council of the European Union which requires or recommends that the United Kingdom does not or should not admit a person or category of person, however that requirement or recommendation is expressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para7"></a>At Report stage, great concern was also expressed about the implementation of travel bans and the great effort that needs to be made to ensure that only individuals who are the intended target of such bans are inconvenienced. I fully understand the concerns and take this opportunity to reassure the House that, in implementing travel bans, officials take great care to ensure that this result is achieved. With far from adequate information being available in respect of some persons, this is often difficult. However, we are determined to ensure that everything possible is done to minimise the possibility of errors. Equally, where there is a possibility that someone wanted in connection with, for example, war crimes might be apprehended, we believe that we should make every effort to ensure the full and proper implementation of our international commitments. I commend the amendment to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for writing to me after the previous debate. However, I still have some anxieties.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para8"></a>The provision regarding categories does not wholly alleviate the anxieties I expressed in relation to what happened over UN Security Council Resolution 1132. That plainly applied to travel restrictions on members of the Sierra Leone junta.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para9"></a>The power to impose the restrictions was delegated to a sanctions committee. The committee promulgated a list, which was an exact replica of suggestions made to it by the president of Sierra Leone, President Kabbah, and contained the names of many of his political opponents. When that list was enforced without the knowledge of those named on it--the list was never published--they were subject to travel restrictions in the United Kingdom. It could then have been said that they were part of the category of "named persons" because everybody thought that the persons on the list were members of the Sierra Leone junta despite the fact that many of them were not and the government subsequently agreed that they had been wrongly included in the list.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para10"></a>If we automatically impose travel bans, provided for in the UN resolution, the details of which may be delegated to a subsidiary body which may act at the behest of a government who are ill disposed towards some of its citizens, we are in danger of committing some injustices.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para11"></a>Even in the Sudanese example that the Minister gave in respect of UN Security Council Resolution 1054, is there not a list of members of the Sudanese <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Government to whom such restrictions apply? How do we know who the members of the Sudanese Government are? How do we know that, in a similar fashion, a list containing the names of individuals who have nothing to do with the NIF regime will not be supplied to immigration officers? I therefore believe that we need certain further safeguards before we allow this provision to take its place on the statute book.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, says. I thought that I had made clear in my response that we felt that we had taken significant cognisance of the points he made at an earlier stage. We believe that we have to approach this matter from the perspective of giving effect to our international obligations. If we are in that position, I believe that we must go along with other UN member states and that we are obliged to exclude. However, we shall take great care in negotiations to ensure that our obligations are appropriate. It is the question of appropriateness on which we must focus our attention.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para12"></a>With the caveats that we have put into place, with the assurance that we shall treat these matters with great care and with the assurance that we shall clearly monitor the situation and continue to keep it under very careful review in ensuring that the legislation is put in place, I invite your Lordships to support this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, can he reassure me about the point I raised at the last stage of this Bill; namely, that when lists are drawn up, they will be published in this country so that everybody may know what the position is?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord again raises a very important and valuable point. I can give an assurance that, whenever possible, we will do that. I am quite happy to give that undertaking to the House.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 6 and 7. We on these Benches persevere with this set of amendments because many lawyers and voluntary organisations in the area are pressing us so to do. I believe there is an important point of principle to be considered here. The principle is that Parliament should remove or diminish an existing right of appeal only in exceptional circumstances. We do not believe that there are exceptional circumstances warranting the provisions in this case.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para16"></a>When we debated comparable amendments on 18th October, I endeavoured to explain, at col. 763 of Hansard, the history of the right of overstayers to appeal. I do not propose to repeat that. We believe that the structure of the Bill is broadly sound, subject to the <P>


<a name="column_747"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 747</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>points we are discussing tonight. These ensure that, from the coming into force of the Bill, the new time-limited, one-stop appeal system will prevail and will achieve the Government's purposes.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para17"></a>However, the amendment refers to a group of finite individuals who are already here. There is no need for the reduction in their right to appeal under the existing law. That is why we suggest two particular amendments: one amendment to extend the appeal period to three years; and the other to give a right of appeal outside the three-year period where there is "reasonable excuse". That is the language that the Government utilise in Clause 73(3)(b) of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para18"></a>When this matter was last debated, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, responded to these concerns by saying that the Government and the officials concerned are getting to grips with the problems. We do not disagree that there are major problems; equally, we are quite sure that the Government and the officials are getting to grips with them. We support those efforts. But that does not address the fact that many individuals will be unjustly dealt with if this clause goes through.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para19"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said that there will not really be a problem because there will be considerable advertising of the new arrangements and the new regularisation period. He said that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we intend to use extensively the ethnic minority press. Given the level of interest in the Bill and these particular clauses, I have little doubt that much attention will be drawn to the matter in the press generally".--[Official Report, 18/10/99; col. 765.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-09_para20"></a>
That may be right; it may be wrong. But justice must be done in small as well as in large particulars. There is no doubt that many of those who will be unfairly dealt with by these provisions will not see the ethnic minority press. Many have been here for years and will no longer be taking ethnic minority papers, having moved to parts of the United Kingdom where such papers are not available. Advertising in the ethnic minority press is not an answer. That is why we ask the Government to extend the period for appeal and include a reasonable excuse provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para21"></a>Perhaps I may read a letter I received this morning from the chief executive of the Immigration Advisory Service on this very point. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Only recently, a Turkish family came to see me who had applied for an extension of their leave, had placed their affairs in the hands of someone claiming to be a solicitor, had paid &#163;3,000 on the assurance that their status would be regularised and had discovered that they were overstayers only when the pretended solicitor died--they have still not been able to reclaim their passports and other documents. They are typical"--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-09_para22"></a>
that is the word he uses--and this is the Government's own service--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"of many persons who come to us who have remained in this country leading economically and socially active lives in the belief that their affairs are in order or are being rendered so but for whom, under the Bill as drafted by the Government, will lose any right of appeal against removal--however long they have been in the UK. Redressing this wrong is not favouring queue-jumpers or illegal entrants but maintaining a route for justice for those who have entered legally but then overstayed, as has been preserved by both previous Governments".

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-09_para24"></a>There is an important principle here. The issue should not be dealt with by publicity because the information will not reach all the people concerned. The amendments would not give rise to additional cases because they deal with a finite group. They would not give rise to extra administration because the same number of appeals are in prospect either way--indeed, they might actually improve the situation and help officials by spreading appeals. They would involve no extra public expense; they would lead to a just, fair and proportionate response to the difficulty faced; and they would be a great improvement to the legislation. I beg to move.

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para0"></a>My main concern relates to a particular group of people for whom provision should be made with regard to appeals, particularly in cases where those concerned were not aware of their status in this country. For example, youngsters who came here with their parents and whose parents left the country would not know their legal status in this country. They would assume that they were here legally. They would only find out at a later date that they had been overstayers for many years. They would not have had any reason to believe that the publicity about a regularisation period applied to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para1"></a>I have been in correspondence with the Home Office about the case of Ben James. He came to this country at a very early age. Now, after about 17 or 18 years--during which time he has been contributing as a businessman in this country--he is subject to deportation because he overstayed here, not realising his status. The amendments suggested by my noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury would enable him to have a reasonable excuse. That fact should then be taken into account by the Secretary of State when considering the right of appeal.

<A NAME="91102-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the explanation of the amendments given by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury. Perhaps it will assist if I indicate what we have in mind for Clauses 8 and 9. The regularisation period in Clause 8 will end on a prescribed day or the day before Clause 62 comes into force, whichever is the later. Clause 9 comes into force the day after the regularisation period ends; that is to say, either the day after the prescribed day or when Clause 62 comes into force. We are aiming to bring Clause 62 into force when the Human Rights Act comes into force, so the earliest that Clause 9 can come into force is on the same day as the Human Rights Act. We have arrived at the conclusion the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, seeks, but by a different route. I hope that that is sufficient to satisfy the noble Lord on that aspect.

<A NAME = "91102-10_para3"></a>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-10_para5"></a>
The amendment would not produce any clarity. It simply is not workable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para6"></a>The greatest difficulty is that Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 together would allow the regularisation period to continue beyond the point at which the new administrative removal powers in Clause 9 come into force. So if someone was identified as an overstayer and removal directions were given, the person concerned would be able, quite legally, to make an application for leave to remain under Clause 8, and the whole process would grind to a halt. There would be no requirement to apply before a particular date. Indeed, it can be seen that there would be every incentive not to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para7"></a>Amendment No. 7 would extend the protection from removal under Clause 9 powers enjoyed by those who have applied under Clause 8, to include not only those who have applied but those who might have applied but had a reasonable excuse for not doing so. Even if the Secretary of State concluded that the person concerned did not have a reasonable excuse for failing to apply, the person will still not be able to be removed under Clause 9 because the amendment gives a further right of appeal to an adjudicator against the decision that he did not have a reasonable excuse.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para8"></a>I hope my explanation that commencement is to be coincident with the Human Rights Act will satisfy the noble Lord. We are back to our old friend, "endless unjustified delays." I understand the point behind his amendments but I am not able to accept them.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, on Report we on these Benches moved an amendment to leave out what is now Clause 10. We withdrew the amendment because we agreed to wait and see whether anything would emerge from the special council at Tampere to render the amendment obsolete. It soon became apparent that nothing relevant had materialised at Tampere. However, although we have returned to the battle, we are now moving a more limited amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para15"></a>On Report I explained at length the background to our concerns. I shall not do so again, but merely deal with our position in summary fashion. Article 1 of the Geneva Convention on Refugees, to which the United Kingdom and all other European Union states are parties, defines a refugee as,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any person who ... owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-10_para16"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para17"></a>There is unfortunately a difference of interpretation of this definition among the member states of the European Union. France and Germany say that the convention applies only if persecution is by the state itself or with the complicity of the state. United Kingdom law, as laid down in a landmark decision of the Court of Appeal in July, has said that it is sufficient if the persecution is by a non-state group and the state is unable to prevent it, although I recognise that that appeal decision is itself subject to appeal to the House of Lords. Thus, under the decision of the Court of Appeal, people can be refugees if, for example, they fear persecution by the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka or by Islamic militants in Algeria, and the governments of Sri Lanka or Algeria are unable to protect them from that persecution.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para18"></a>The difference of interpretation becomes important because, under the Dublin convention, if an asylum seeker enters the European Union through one country and claims asylum in another, the latter is entitled to return the claimant to the country of first entry to have his or her claim determined by that country under its own laws. In a claim based on non-state persecution, if claimants have entered through France or Germany and we return them to that country after they have applied for asylum here in the United Kingdom, they will be refused asylum, even though the United Kingdom would have allowed that claim. That seems to me to be plainly wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para19"></a>Under Section 2 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, the Home Secretary could remove a claimant to another country only if he could, among other things, certify that the government of that country would not send the claimant to another country otherwise than in accordance with the refugee convention. On judicial review the Court of Appeal said that the Home Secretary could not give such a certificate where he was proposing to send the claimant to France or Germany, and that claimant's claim was based on non-state persecution. That was because the restrictions on the interpretation of the refugee convention in France and Germany meant that those countries might return a refugee to his country of origin.
<P>


<a name="column_751"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 751</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para20"></a>Clause 10 would overcome this conclusion, which seemed so awkward for the Government. It does so by saying that a European member state,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is to be regarded as--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-10_para21"></a><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) a place from which a person will not be sent to another country otherwise than in accordance with the Refugee Convention".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-10_para22"></a>
So there is no discretion on the Home Secretary, no certificate for him to sign, and nothing upon which judicial review could bite. The courts are simply required to accept as true something which the Court of Appeal has already decided is not true. That seems to us to be a wholly improper form of legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para23"></a>If the Court of Appeal's interpretation of the refugee convention is right, this clause will involve potential future breaches of United Kingdom obligations under the refugee convention. It is true that the claimant will be able to apply to a court for a declaration under Clause 62 of the Bill, that his or her deportation would be in breach of his or her rights under the Human Rights Act. However, those rights are not as extensive as those outlined in the refugee convention. The Human Rights Act might well regard the threat of a return to the country of origin as a breach of a right to life under Article 3, if that return would create a serious risk to the claimant's life. It is much less likely to be a breach of the Human Rights Act if there is persecution short of the serious threat of death. The right of asylum itself is not a convention right under the Human Rights Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para24"></a>For that reason, if one looks back to the situation in the 1930s, one might say that the refugee convention, had it then been in force, would have given Jews the right of asylum in this country if they came from Germany. However, the Human Rights Act would not have done so until they reached a stage considerably later, when it became apparent that it was not only their careers and their property that were under threat, but their very lives.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para25"></a>In the debate on Report the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, said that France and Germany were highly advanced democracies with independent courts and distinguished advocates. So they are. He then went on to say that it was natural that different courts would reach different interpretations of the convention. That is also true. He therefore implied--I hope that the noble and learned Lord will not feel that I am being unfair to him--that differences of interpretation are not of crucial importance; that one interpretation is as valid as another; and that there is therefore no reason why we should not return claimants to France or Germany. He said that France and Germany, even when they refuse asylum in a non-state persecution case, can offer alternative forms of protection. That may well be true. However, if that is the case, the Home Secretary could, under the existing law, properly give a certificate in most, if not all, non-state persecution cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para26"></a>However, we cannot support this legislation because it removes any need at all for a certificate from the Home Secretary. The legislation will enable the Home <P>


<a name="column_752"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 752</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Secretary to act, as we see it, in breach of the refugee convention, as interpreted by our courts, without any form of redress.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-10_para27"></a>This amendment is limited in its effect. It simply excludes Clause 10 from operating where a member state interprets the refugee convention in a more limited way than we do. In that case, the Home Secretary would simply have to fall back on Clause 11, which is basically the old law restated. We believe that the amendment deserves support. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, I cannot argue the legal case as has my noble friend Lord Goodhart, and I shall not attempt to do so. However, I should like to bring to the attention of the noble and learned Lord developments that may very much affect the way in which Clause 10 operates. I fully appreciate the point made frequently by the Government Front Bench that other EU fellow states are indeed advanced democracies, as my noble friend has said.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-11_para0"></a>I shall not advance the legal arguments because my noble friend Lord Goodhart has done that most effectively. However, I have one concern in that we are well aware that at Tampere the first steps were taken towards what is likely to be a common asylum and immigration policy. We recognise that the Home Secretary has already indicated that he is prepared to move in that direction, in line with other EU member states. One of the characteristics of such a common policy, as set out in the Tampere summit statement, is that there would be common standards of treatment of refugees and asylum seekers under the refugee convention. That is the point at which my noble friend's distinction between the interpretation of the refugee convention by our own courts and those of other EU courts becomes of significant importance.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-11_para1"></a>I should like to adduce two examples which come very much to mind. First, we have seen a considerable extension of the use of paramilitaries, although responsibility for them is denied by the state under which they appear to operate. A recent example is the denial by the Indonesian Government of any responsibility whatever for what were known as the militias in East Timor. The noble and learned Lord will remember that on many occasions from the Front Bench opposite it was indicated by the Government before there was an intervention in East Timor that they had the difficulty of getting the Indonesian Government to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of the militia and for the fact that they appeared to have access to extremely modern arms.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-11_para2"></a>Paramilitaries have also been used in other states. They have been used in El Salvador, Guatemala and several others. In almost every case the government concerned have denied any responsibility for them. One has here a grey area which would certainly put anyone "refouled", for example, to East Timor a couple of months ago in very considerable danger. It is not plain that under Clause 10 that could not happen if they were returned to a country that does not recognise non-state persecution.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-11_para3"></a>The final issue I want to raise concerns the combination of the move towards a common asylum and immigration policy with the enlargement of the European Union. The enlargement of the European Union has among the first group of countries intending to join in the near future the Czech Republic and, in the second group, Romania. In both cases reports are coming out of the treatment of Roma which amounts to extreme persecution. In some cases it is recognised by the state and in other cases it is denied by the state but is conducted by local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-11_para4"></a>Indeed, I understand from a discussion I had only two days ago that the position of Roma in certain east European and central European states is becoming completely intolerable. They are being persecuted, driven out of the towns in which they live, told that they cannot have any work, told that they cannot send their children to school, and so on. Therefore, in considering a common asylum policy, it is important that the United Kingdom upholds the general principle that refugees should not be "refouled" to a country in which their lives and the lives of their families might be in danger or in which there would be very serious persecution.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-11_para5"></a>It may be that the noble and learned Lord or his colleague will be able to say a little more about that. It is one of the reasons why we have been quite tedious about this clause. We recognise that it could be a building block for a future European common asylum and immigration policy.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-11_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I should like to help to clarify the situation by giving an example of the concept of non-state persecution. It comes from our own territory. I say this without wishing to make the least criticism of the actions of Her Majesty's Government in this context. It concerns those two teenagers who were expelled from the town of Dungannon on the instructions of the IRA. Two masked men visited their parish priest and told him that for the teenagers' own safety they should leave Northern Ireland immediately. One might perhaps think that those words gave them a well founded fear of persecution. They were, by reason of such fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of the British Government, which I am sure would have been extended to them to the limits of the British Government's power in the town of Dungannon--that limit being a real one. Under the circumstances, they chose to leave. In most countries that should have given them a claim to refugee status under the UN convention. But had they made that claim in France or Germany, because France and Germany do not recognise the concept of non-state persecution, they would have been severely at risk of finding themselves shipped back, if not directly to Dungannon then at least to Belfast. In circumstances such as those, lives may very well be at risk.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-11_para6"></a>The point at issue has applied in the past, particularly clearly to Somalia. For a while Somalia has been an area where in effect there is no state. Departments of strategic studies, including the one in which my son was recently a student, used Somalia as a classic illustration <P>


<a name="column_754"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 754</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the state of war in which there was no state. Therefore, if one applies the French and German interpretation of the UN convention, no one from Somalia, however great the danger to his life, can possibly be a refugee. The effects of such a doctrine are clearly unfortunate. So there are practical matters at stake in whether we return refugees to France or Germany under the safe third-country rule.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-11_para7"></a>It is not the only point, either, where differences in the interpretation of the UN convention may create very serious risks to people returned to a safe third-country. The point about a safe third country is not whether it is a country with liberty, rule of law and democracy. We on these Benches would not for one moment wish to dispute what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, said about France and Germany in this context. The point about a safe third country is whether it is safe for that person.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-11_para8"></a>During the proceedings on the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 we heard of a case of someone who was to be returned to Belgium under the safe third-country rule but had been illegally present in Belgium because, as is common with refugees, he had achieved an illegal entry. Under Belgian practice he would therefore, for reasons directly contrary to the judgment of Lord Justice Simon Brown in the Adimi case, have been returned to Zaire, clearly at some risk to his life. In that case the Court of Appeal overrode the return to the safe third country with no criticism intended of the general safety of the third country.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-11_para9"></a>There is one further question on which I should like to hear the noble and learned Lord's opinion. I refer to the interpretation by the judges of international treaties to which this country is party. Those treaties clearly have a meaning. The judges clearly have to interpret it. The question I want to ask is whether, how far, or in what circumstances Parliament can direct the judges to interpret international agreements to mean things other than they appear to the judges to mean. This is a quite delicate area of relations between Parliament and the judiciary. I am delighted that we have the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General on the Front Bench to consider it because it is a question which is very proper to his post. I await his answer to this question with considerable curiosity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may give an example with regard to which I have been in correspondence with the Home Office. It concerns an Algerian who was resident in France but was convicted there of an offence of conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism--in a special court which the French have for dealing with that category of offences, criticism of which has been made by many distinguished British lawyers. This Algerian was convicted and sentenced to four years' imprisonment, at the end of which he was served with a notice of exclusion from France stating that he would commit a criminal offence if he set foot on French soil within the next 10 years. The Algerian got on a Eurostar train and arrived in Waterloo. We immediately put him in Belmarsh. He was there until I interceded on his behalf, pleading that he did not constitute a threat to the security of Great Britain and <P>


<a name="column_755"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 755</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that he was not likely to commit any offence if he was released. In due course he was granted temporary admission while the authorities decided what to do with him. Under the Dublin convention, ostensibly they could have sent him back to France, but if they had done that he would have been subject to severe penalties for infringing the exclusion order which had been served on him.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-11_para10"></a>The situation is not quite as clear cut as we find in the Bill. It is not always the correct thing to do to send people back to European countries simply because on the whole they have a similar attitude to ours on the process of asylum. There are particular circumstances--the question of Algerians in France is one of them--where such a very different view is taken of those people and of their right to asylum that it would not be correct or consonant with our view of human rights to send people back to those countries.

<P>
<A NAME="91102-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, this is Third Reading, and we have been over this ground. I am intrigued that on this occasion noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches are emphasising the differences between the United Kingdom and other EU states and are arguing in their amendment for a type of opt-out. It indicates the importance of our remaining in control of our own immigration policy. It also indicates the desirability of achieving agreement, as far as possible, between ourselves and other countries on the interpretation of treaties and immigration control generally. The debate has also shown that there will be plenty of opportunities for lawyers arising out of this legislation, although one of the Bill's purposes was supposed to be to speed up procedures and provide fewer opportunities for what the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General referred to earlier as "lawyers wriggling". On this occasion it provides opportunity for exactly that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that the amendment achieves the effect that the noble Lord desires. The amendment seeks to exclude from the provisions of Clause 10 any member state which "limits in any way" the definition of a refugee in Article 1A. Therefore, although some of the questions and examples are of deep interest, they do not go to the point of the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para0"></a>As I read the amendment, it would bite only where the member state deliberately acts in breach of the convention by not accepting any aspect of the definition in Article 1A. Would a member state with a "limited" view of Article 1A be excluded from Clause 10 even in those cases to which that "limited" view was not relevant? Therefore, simply on those drafting points, I am not able to accept the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para1"></a>However, we have a more fundamental disagreement. A number of references have been made to the recent decision of the Court of Appeal. I shall be sparing in my observations and simply respond to the points made. As we understand the judgment, it is clear that the Court of Appeal did not necessarily find that individual applicants would fail to receive in France <P>


<a name="column_756"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 756</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and Germany protection as required by the refugee convention. The court did not consider whether particular applicants might have had access to necessary protection. It was not a live issue, as my right honourable friend had agreed to consider the cases substantively. However, the court did accept that other forms of protection could satisfy the requirement in Article 33 of the convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para2"></a>My noble and learned friend Lord Falconer made comments regarding France and Germany, and I shall not repeat them. I merely point out that France, besides the 1951 convention, has territorial asylum, constitutional asylum and a specific prohibition on removal where that would be contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Germany has protective powers under both Section 53 and Section 54 of its Aliens Law. It seems to us that the amendment would allow any claimant to say that in his or her individual circumstances there was an argument on Article 1A. That takes matters back to the possibility of continuing and considerable delay and we believe that the provision would simply not be workable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para3"></a>Three particular questions were raised. First, the noble Earl, Lord Russell, raised the interrelationship between international treaty obligations, the courts and Parliament. The noble Earl will find a useful review and exposition of that in the case of Factortame, which was decided judicially by this House last week. It was held that claims might be sustainable against the United Kingdom Government, as a result of the introduction--I have to say, by the previous government--of various statutory regimes relating to what has been referred to in the popular prints as quota-hopping by Spanish fishermen. So there is an interesting exposition there. It is far more learned and lengthy than your Lordships are entitled to receive from me this evening.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para4"></a>The noble Earl also raised the question of Somalia. My understanding is that no European Union state returns anyone routinely to Somalia. It is my understanding that France and Germany do not do so at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para5"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the Czech Republic. She knows better than I that the conditions for joining the European Union are extremely stringent. They require various, quite heavy obligations on candidate members to demonstrate that the candidate state is equipped to apply the various relevant instruments appropriately.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para6"></a>I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Cope, that we discussed this matter at some length earlier. I shall therefore turn to the government amendments. On Report, I indicated during our discussion on Clause 13 that there would be some relatively minor consequential amendments. These are those amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para7"></a>Clauses 10 and 11 refer to Section 6 of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993. By the time the clauses are brought into force, Section 6 will have been replaced by Clause 13 of this Bill. Clause 13 will come into force on Royal Assent. Clauses 10 and 11 will be brought into force later. Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 <P>


<a name="column_757"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 757</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will therefore replace the references to Section 6 with appropriate references. Clause 13 applies with retrospective effect. It will be as if Clause 13 had always applied and Section 6 had never existed. The final amendment in the group is designed to tidy up those drafting amendments. When in due course we come to the amendments, I shall seek to move them.

<A NAME="91102-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the noble and learned Lord's reply. However, to reply in one sentence, I do not believe that it is proper to require, by statute, a court to assume as a fact something that may or may not be true. That is a wholly improper form of legislation. It appears to have been done, so far as we can see, merely as a device in order to obviate the possibility of a certificate from the Home Secretary being the subject of judicial review. That said, we do not believe it appropriate to press the matter to a Division. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "91102-12_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, noble Lords who were present during the discussion at Report stage will be aware that when someone is removed from the United Kingdom the costs of removal are borne either by the carrying company or by the Secretary of State depending on the particular circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para13"></a>Although it does not happen all that frequently, occasionally the necessity arises for removals to be escorted. That may be on medical grounds, where the person being removed has a medical condition which does not in itself prevent that person from travelling but which may require treatment during travel. More often, it will be because the person being removed has behaved in a disruptive manner, or has attempted or threatened violence either to himself or others.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para14"></a>Most carrying companies accept that escorts are part and parcel of the removal of particular individuals. Indeed, they have duties as to the safety of their other passengers and the crew. However, some argue that the power to give directions for someone's removal is limited to the individual concerned and either refuse point blank to provide for, and pay for, escorts or try to avoid having to pay after the event.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para15"></a>I believe that most people would accept that, where an escort is required, it is a necessary part of the cost of removing the person concerned. As I said, many carriers already accept that that is the case. The law is clear that in certain circumstances the removal costs are to be borne by the carrier who brought the person concerned to this country. Amendment No. 12 makes clear that, where an escort is needed in order to remove someone, the removal directions extend to cover that. The amendment puts the matter beyond doubt and will ensure a consistency of approach between carriers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para16"></a>The amendment also allows the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to the provision of escorts. The regulations will cover such matters as arranging for the return of the escorts to the United Kingdom and the circumstances in which, and the extent to which, the costs of the escort are payable by the carrier. They will be subject to the negative resolution procedure which the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation has concluded is appropriate in these circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para17"></a>In view of some of the concerns expressed when we debated this matter on Report, I should make it clear that the need for escorts is the exception rather than the rule. If a carrier believes that an escort is not necessary in a particular case, we shall be happy to discuss it and to explain our reasons. If the carrier continues to be aggrieved, he can, as my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General said, challenge the decision by way of judicial review. But there are important considerations of safety here: the safety of the person being removed, of other passengers, and possibly even of the aircraft itself. If our honest assessment was that a particular person required an escort, it would be worse than irresponsible, if not foolish, to fail to make provision for it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para18"></a>This amendment does not alter the present balance between those cases where the cost of removal falls on the carrier and those where the removal is at public <P>


<a name="column_759"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 759</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expense. We propose that a carrier should pay for an escort only where he is required to pay for the removal itself. However, at the risk of stating the obvious, where someone is to be removed, there are only two possible ways in which this can be paid for: either the carrier meets the removal costs or the taxpayer must foot the bill. We provide training to carriers about the documentary requirements, but ultimately there is a risk that a particular individual will be refused entry and the carrier will be required to remove him. That is a commercial risk and I do not accept that the taxpayer should be expected to underwrite it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para19"></a>Finally, in the debate on Report the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, asked what would be the legal position of an escort if the person removed were to be summarily executed on his arrival at the airport. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked whether the passenger manifest would allow someone who was being deported to be identified. Again at the risk of stating the obvious, if someone is to be hauled off and shot the moment he arrives in a particular country, we should not remove the individual to that country in the first place, with or without an escort. However, were it to happen, I do not see how the escort, or escorts, could be held in any way responsible.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para20"></a>The marking of passenger manifests is a matter for the carrying companies. I understand that in practice most companies denote enforced removals in some way, but not necessarily the reason for the removal. The carrier will not necessarily be aware of the reason. Although I acknowledge the risk which prompted the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, to raise this matter, the real point is that if someone would be in danger, we should not remove him or her in the first place.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-12_para21"></a>The designation "enforced removal" (or whatever term the company chooses to use) on the passenger manifest may result from a range of reasons and cover all the circumstances in which someone may be removed from this country. It will cover much more than political dissidents and opponents of the regime. If they would be genuinely at risk, such people should not be on the manifest in the first place because they should not be removed. I hope that this clarification is helpful to noble Lords who asked questions earlier. I beg to move.

<A NAME="91102-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury </B>   moved, as an amendment to Amendment No. 12, Amendment No. 13:

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Line 6, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) If the person to whom directions are given objects to the directions, the Secretary of State may, with the agreement of that person, appoint an arbitrator who shall review the directions and make recommendations and the directions shall be amended to give effect to these recommendations.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am glad to remind noble Lords that on the previous occasion when we debated this matter the noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams, said that all of the points that we then raised were reasonable. However, he did not deal with them in any detail because at that stage the clause was being withdrawn as one of those matters to be referred to the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and <P>


<a name="column_760"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 760</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Deregulation. We have since heard from British Airways in particular that it knows nothing about these provisions. One takes a dim view of that, given that the Government have introduced new rules relating to charges to be imposed on carriers. Presumably, if they did not tell British Airways none of the other airlines knew either. Perhaps the noble Lord will agree when he replies that it is a little off the mark to impose important new financial burdens on airlines without taking the trouble to inform them and give them the opportunity to raise any points that they see fit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_para1"></a>The noble Lord is probably aware that British Airways already pays for escorts on a per diem basis although, as he implied in moving his amendment, some other airlines have challenged those arrangements. That is probably why we need this fresh legislation. British Airways says, I believe reasonably, that it should not have to bear such costs where the passenger's documentation is in order but he is refused admission for some other reason which cannot have been within its knowledge. What is the response of the Government?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_para2"></a>The noble Lord said that only two parties could pay these costs: the airline or the Government. It is a matter of natural justice that the airline should not have to pay the costs when it has been through all the procedures suggested to it by the Government. The Minister said that the Government provided training on the requirements. One assumes, as inevitably must happen, that in particular cases the airline has followed all the recommendations of the Government but an individual with good documentation is nevertheless stopped at Heathrow and sent back. Why should the airline have to foot the bill?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_para3"></a>British Airways is anxious about the wording of the provisions for several reasons, some of which we debated on a previous occasion. If the reason for the clause is to plug loopholes which allow some carriers to evade the obligations which BA voluntarily assumes the airlines should be told, what are those loopholes? As we noted on the previous occasion, the phrase "one or more" in relation to the escorts means that in theory a direction can specify an unnecessarily large number of escorts, and no mechanism is provided to challenge that decision. We also need to know what is meant by,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such costs ... as may be prescribed",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-13_para4"></a>
given that the remuneration of escorts is already mentioned on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_para5"></a>We need to be assured that these powers are to be used sparingly and modestly. Yet I suggest to the Minister that it would be unnecessarily cumbersome if every time an airline objected, it had to seek judicial review. The Minister referred to listening to protests from airlines in particular cases, but I want to formalise that process. For that reason, my amendment provides for an arbitration procedure which is a simple mechanism to allow a carrier to appeal against a direction. If the arbitrator upholds the <P>


<a name="column_761"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 761</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>objection, that direction can be amended. I hope that the noble Lord agrees that this is a reasonable and modest amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-13_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Bathurst: </B>   My Lords, on a number of occasions the Minister referred, obviously, to airports and airlines, as did the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, when moving his amendment. Would Clause 12 and the amendments moved by the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, if accepted, cover the Channel tunnel and Eurostar?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Avebury. There is a need occasionally to be a little fairer in proposing legislation. In this particular case, the noble Lord spoke about the extent to which the Home Office was involved in the training of carriers with regard to the documentation of passengers brought to this country. I am well aware of this. As one who holds a British passport, at various posts abroad I must still undergo rigorous checks about the validity of my passport.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_para6"></a>However, putting that aside, if the airlines follow precisely the instructions and training given by the Home Office and the passenger destroys the documentation after landing in this country, we cannot hold the airlines responsible for such action. It is right and proper that in such cases the Home Office should look at other means of recovering the costs rather than asking the airlines to pay.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_para7"></a>What consultation on the clause has taken place with airlines and other forms of transport which bring people to this country?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_time0"></A><H5>5.30 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hacking: </B>   My Lords, I have no personal criticism of the Ministers on the Front Bench. However, little or no notice has been given of this new clause of the Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Cope, correctly cited, this amendment--my noble and learned friend withdrew it after discussion on Report--was tabled only on the Thursday before the Report stage of the Bill on the Monday.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_para8"></a>I have consulted two important members of the industry: first, the Board of Airline Representatives (UK)--BAR(UK)--represents a large number of the overseas carriers who bring millions of passengers to this country; and, secondly, British Airways. Both have told me that not only were there no consultations, they did not even know the clause had been tabled until they read Hansard the next day. It is, therefore, not surprising that the air carriers have some concerns.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, identified their concern on whether they are expected to pick up the costs of taking passengers back under escort to the country of origin when, for example, the airlines have not been at fault. Noble Lords will remember that under Clause 37 (as it now is) there is release from the provisions in this clause when passengers arrive without proper documents. Specifically, Clause 37(4) states that no charge is payable when the airline operator can show that the passenger in question <P>


<a name="column_762"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 762</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>produced the proper documentation at the place of embarkation. The question raised by the airline industry is that if that concession is given--I suggest, correctly given--under the provisions of Clause 37, can they also be given it under the provisions of the new Clause 12?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_para10"></a>The airline industry is also anxious to know what tests are to be applied as regards the number of escorts. One would think that two escorts would be sufficient with the passenger being handcuffed on both sides. After all, unless he is a very peculiar passenger, he will have only two arms. But there has been a suggestion that there may be need of medical escorts--a doctor, nurse and so forth--and the airline industry, which is having to pay for the escorting of that passenger to the country of origin, and then for the escorts to return here, wish to know what criteria are to be applied on the number of escorts.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_para11"></a>There is also the issue of costs. Subsection (3)(b) of the new clause states that the Secretary of State may introduce regulations requiring the airline to bear such costs in connection with the escort, in particular the remuneration of those who are carrying out the escort duties. Again, that is an area over which the airline industry is reasonably concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_para12"></a>Finally, on the adjudication of any dispute between an airline and the Secretary of State, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, introduced a sensible amendment. In the timetable to which we are working, it may not be possible for my noble friends on the Front Bench to accept that amendment as drafted. For example, it leaves open whether or not the arbitration is to be binding. If it were to be binding it may give some concern to my noble friends on the Front Bench. I ask, therefore, whether my noble friends can accept the spirit of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and agree that there should be some form of dispute resolution process.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-13_para13"></a>On Report my noble and learned friend Lord Williams referred to judicial review as a means of dispute resolution. But as my noble and learned friend and I know--from his days at the Bar, and from my days at the Bar and as a solicitor--the system of judicial review is hardly geared to deciding such issues as costs, the number of escorts and so on. Under our process of judicial review, the courts rightly will not intervene unless a manifestly wrong decision has been made. It takes a great deal of time to prepare the papers for judicial review. A single judge has to give leave. If the single judge does not give leave, one goes to open court. Even if one could get the case into the courts, having gained the requisite leave for it, the matter could take up to 12 months. That is ridiculous when dealing with an issue which could fall under the new Clause 12. Clearly, there should be a dispute resolution process which can work under a tight timetable. I suggest that it should be non-binding. An arbitrator could give a recommendation to the Secretary of State and he could then make a decision.

<P>
<A NAME="91102-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, it has become clear again, as it became clear in our earlier debates, that the way the Bill has been thrown together has made it difficult for British Airways and others to keep up with what is happening and to make valid points to your Lordships. It is not a satisfactory way to put together legislation with, in this case, considerable effects on airlines and other people. I almost said "cobbled" together but I thought that that might be unfair to shoemakers, whose art is important to me at the moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para0"></a>On a similar point, when we dealt with the facilities to be provided free to the immigration authorities at airports by airport authorities, the Government were urged to provide for arbitration. Instead, they decided to build in a system of independent advice to be given to the Secretary of State in case of dispute. I should have thought that that was quite a good way to deal with this question rather than the more formal arbitration suggested in the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para1"></a>I suspect that the answer to my noble friend Lord Bathurst is yes. I believe that these provisions apply to Eurostar and the Channel Tunnel and to all other carriers, not just the airlines although we have concentrated on them in this debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords who have asked questions and opened up the debate. It has been helpful and constructive.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, did not think that BA was consulted. I can confirm that, in absolute terms, that is the case although we announced at, I think, Second Reading that we would be introducing these provisions. BA is somewhat on the side of the angels in this issue. It meets the costs reasonably charged and asked for in these cases. Having heard what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and my noble friend Lord Hacking about consultation, it is clear that we ought to talk more with the aviation companies. I can undertake to do so in order that they are fully aware of the effect of the provisions we intend to introduce.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para3"></a>I can tell the noble Earl, Lord Bathurst, that the measures may well apply to Eurostar and the Channel tunnel. That enables us to extend the provisions to Eurostar and we may well wish to look at them in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para4"></a>It is important to keep a sense of proportion about what we are trying to achieve. I assure the House that we shall be proportionate and reasonable in the way in which we seek to introduce these measures.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para5"></a>I turn to some of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, in moving his amendment. He seeks to address in a slightly different way the issue of possible disputes about the need for an escort. At first, I thought that his amendment was being extremely generous to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State. First, the terms of the amendment are <P>


<a name="column_764"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 764</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discretionary, not mandatory. He may appoint an arbitrator, but he does not have to do so. Secondly, according to the noble Lord's amendment, the Secretary of State is a party to the disagreement, but can appoint the arbitrator. That is another generous move.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para6"></a>However, the terms of the amendment do not make it clear whether the carrier has to agree to a case being referred to an arbitrator in the first place or whether the carrier has a right of veto over the choice of arbitrator as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para7"></a>On closer inspection, perhaps the proposals are not so generous. First, the arbitrator's recommendations are binding only on the Secretary of State. He has to amend the recommendations if the arbitrator says so, but there is nothing that compels the carrier to accept them. It is even possible, although unlikely, that the initial directions would stipulate an escort of two people and the arbitrator could increase that to three or four. Presumably, the carrier would object even more strongly to that number of escorts, but the Secretary of State would be obliged to insist on that number even though he considered it excessive.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para8"></a>Secondly, and more importantly, the amendment would apply to an objection to any part of the directions and could apply to the fact that the person was being required to remove someone rather than the fact that the person would be escorted. There are no arbitration arrangements for the majority of removals and I see no reason to introduce such arrangements piecemeal, as would the noble Lord's amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para9"></a>Thirdly, the arbitration system could presumably be invoked to cover cases where the cost of the removal and escort were being met by the Secretary of State. Presumably, the Secretary of State would be required to meet the costs of arbitration and in some circumstances might find it cheaper to arrange for removal at public expense, even though in all fairness it would be reasonable to expect the carrier to meet the costs in that case. I assure your Lordships that it is not our intention to be unreasonable in the application of costs for escorts.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para10"></a>Finally, the carrier would still be able to apply for judicial review of the arbitrator's conclusions. I can understand why the noble Lord has tabled the amendment, but I have to say that in my view it is a detour, a diversion, rather than a solution to the problem. I hope that in the light of that explanation he will not seek to press the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, he mentioned that there had not been adequate consultation with the airlines and the carriers. Will the consultation take place before the matter is considered by the Commons when the Bill returns to them and, if an amendment is necessary, will the Government consider it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I could not possibly give an absolute confirmation that that would be the case. However, I am prepared to say that we shall discuss these matters as appropriate with British <P>


<a name="column_765"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 765</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Airways and other airlines and shall seek to take their views on board as far as we can. We are content with what we are proposing. We believe that it is reasonable in the circumstances. After all, airlines operate for commercial gain and carry passengers for that very purpose. They accept in general terms and in most cases that this is not an unreasonable charge on their commercial activities. I trust that your Lordships will accept that argument.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I am surprised to hear the Minister say that there are arbitration arrangements for the majority of removals. That was not the impression I gained from British Airways. The company expressed anxiety about parts of the new clause which appear to be open-ended. The number of escorts was an important point, but anxiety was expressed about the subsection referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Hacking, which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"requiring him to bear such costs in connection with the escort ... as may be prescribed".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-14_para11"></a>
That is totally open-ended.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para12"></a>We do not have the faintest idea what the Government have in mind and what kind of costs are involved. Will they include the escort's drink on board the aircraft? Will he stay in a five-star hotel in Tangier? What kind of costs might the Secretary of State prescribe in connection with subsection (3)(b)? What kinds of expenditure will count in calculating costs incurred in connection with escorts?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para13"></a>The open-ended nature of the provisions in the new clause worries the airlines and I seriously believe that there is a necessity for urgent consultation with British Airways and all the other carriers. I wish that the Minister had been able to give the House an assurance that if the consultations disclosed a serious gap, and the arbitration arrangements which he says already exist do not cover any of the provision of the subsection, the matter will be dealt with when the Bill returns to another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para14"></a>That is one of the disadvantages of such an issue being raised at the 59th minute of the 11th hour. There is no time for consultations to take place, for your Lordships to consider them, or even for Members of another place to take them into account. We must accept the Minister's assurances that in applying these powers, it is not the intention to be unreasonable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para15"></a>I hate to rely on such an assurance given across the Floor of the House because, as has been said on many previous occasions, although one may be certain that assurances given by the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, will be honoured, we are legislating for other circumstances and future governments who may not be quite so scrupulous.

<A NAME = "91102-14_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment refers to Clause 13, which is surprisingly entitled "Protection of claimants from removal or deportation", but which actually relates to the arrangements for the removal or deportation of people whose claim for asylum has failed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para20"></a>The point addressed by the amendment is small, but when we discussed it earlier there seemed to be some sympathy for it. A notice of removal or a deportation order should be able to be served at the same time as, but not before, the notice of the decision to refuse asylum.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-14_para21"></a>I acknowledge that often it will be desirable that the notice of the decision to refuse should be accompanied by the arrangements for the removal and the notice of removal or the deportation order. It is not right that those documents should be served on someone before he has been told that his asylum claim has been refused. That is the purpose of the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="91102-15_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Brentford: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the amendment and to make two points. I noticed that in a previous debate on this issue, the noble and learned Lord said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The directions will not be served until there is a decision on the claim".--[Official Report, 18/10/99; col. 785.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-15_para0"></a>
In the wording of Clause 13, on whom are the directions for his removal to be served? What concerns me is that, whether or not a decision on a claim has been made, if it were to be served on the individual before he had been notified of that decision, it would be emotionally a tough moment for him. I suggest that that would be wrong. Surely it must be right for the notice to be served on him at the same time as the directions? That would seem to me absolutely logical.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I must reply to that last observation because I believe that we are in general agreement. We discussed this matter on Report. The present Section 6 of the 1993 Act prevents what the noble Viscount believed was sensible--the simultaneous service by post of the asylum decision and removal directions. I entirely agree with what the noble Viscount said. That is a sensible and humane way of dealing with the notification, but at present under Section 6 the removal directions cannot be given until the applicant has been notified. He is notified only when he receives the letter. We want to be able to provide the removal directions at the same time as the letter. Most people would believe it sensible for both to arrive in one envelope, and that is what we want.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para1"></a>I understand that there was trouble in people's minds about whether or not something improper might happen in the sequence of decision and notification, or rather, notification and decision. I <P>


<a name="column_767"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 767</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>make it clear--as I believe that this is the purpose of the amendments tabled and of the noble Viscount's observations--that where someone has applied for asylum, a deportation order will not be signed, let alone served, unless and until we have concluded that the person concerned is not a refugee.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para2"></a>Similarly, where an illegal entrant has claimed asylum, removal directions will not be set until the application has been considered and we have decided that he should be removed. We will not set removal directions first and ask questions afterwards. It would be irrational, and I do not believe that such a system would survive the scrutiny of the courts. Therefore, what we want--and I believe that this is common to all three of us--is the sensible opportunity to provide both documents in one envelope, so that there is a degree of security from the public point of view and an absence of a feeling of unfairness from the point of view of the individual concerned. I hope that that assurance, which I have given in as clear terms as I possibly can, will satisfy both the noble Lord, Lord Cope, and the noble Viscount.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, in the light of that assurance I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para3"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-15_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich </B>   moved Amendment No. 16:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 12, line 13, after ("means") insert ("for the purposes of subsection (1)(e), the provision of support for asylum-seekers and their dependants under Part VI and for the purposes of subsections (1)(a) to (d) and (f)").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para6"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, the amendment should refer to new subsection (1)(e) and not (d) as printed on the Marshalled List, which relates to support providers under Section 93. I apologise to the House for the error in drafting, which I noticed only at the last minute.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para7"></a>The amendment concerns information given to the Secretary of State for immigration purposes by those providing support. The amendment would limit the effect of the new government amendment to this clause which could otherwise override or conflict with their contractual obligations.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para8"></a>Your Lordships will remember that I moved an amendment on Report warning of the possible consequences of the Bill for non-governmental organisations working with asylum seekers, who might be assumed, especially if they were Home Office funded or contracted, to be subject to the same legislation as the Home Office and government institutions. I still believe that there is a grave risk of compromising the work of those organisations.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para9"></a>The new amendment seeks to address the remaining concern of many voluntary agencies about the possible conflict of interest and breach of confidentiality which might arise for support providers under Sections 93 or 97. They argue that the new amendment is necessary following the new government amendment which <P>


<a name="column_768"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 768</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>inserts subsection (1)(e) into Clause 18. It is designed to avoid any clash between their charitable duties and their obligations, which are fully understood, under the rest of the clause. If that is not done, what guarantee of confidentiality could they give to their clients, and what relationship of trust would remain if they knew that they might, at any time, be required to disclose information on matters unrelated to their professional work? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B>  : My Lords, as a person connected with a good many voluntary organisations, I can well understand the point that my noble friend has just made about a potential conflict of duties. It is one which I hope that the Government will take most seriously.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, this amendment relates to the new subsection which we introduced into Clause 18 on Report. The intention of paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of the clause is to ensure that a contractor with whom we have made arrangements to provide support is able to pass on information which he might gain to the Secretary of State. That might be information about the circumstances of the asylum seeker and his need for support. It might cover such matters as whether the composition of the asylum seeker's household, and therefore his need for accommodation of a particular character, had changed. It might highlight other additional needs the asylum seeker had. It might also reveal that the asylum seeker was in fact engaged in employment when he was debarred from doing so. I believe that it is legitimate that the Secretary of State should have access to such information from a contractor.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para10"></a>We should see information passed under the provisions of this subsection as being primarily concerned with the support of asylum seekers, but we would not want to limit it entirely to that context. There will be circumstances, which we hope will be few and far between, where an asylum seeker engages in some sort of unlawful activity. I have already mentioned illegal working, but another example would be facilitating the entry of other persons who were here unlawfully.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para11"></a>It is legitimate that a contractor should be able to pass on such information to the Secretary of State. Contractors are not generally in the business of monitoring an asylum seeker's behaviour; for example, his continued involvement in political activities. There is no power under Clause 18 for contractors to pass such information to the Home Secretary or to any other agency. But we do need to ensure that immigration law is properly observed, and we consider it essential that contractors should assist us in that task.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para12"></a>We do not see this issue as primarily concerning the voluntary sector. It concerns private sector contractors and local authorities with which the Secretary of State contracts. As far as we can see, there would be no requirement for voluntary organisations to, as it were, "spy" on asylum seekers. What <P>


<a name="column_769"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 769</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information they provide to the Secretary of State will be a matter of contract concerning the management of accommodation and such matters. I therefore ask the noble Earl not to press this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-15_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   My Lords, I fully understand the intentions of the clause and the obligations which voluntary organisations have. Nevertheless, there is a risk of a conflict of interest and it remains a grey area. I wanted only to draw attention to it today. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para13"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-15_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B>   moved Amendment No. 17:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 19, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>SUPPLY OF INFORMATION BY SECRETARY OF STATE TO ASYLUM-SEEKERS</B></center><BR>
(" .--(1) The Secretary of State has a duty to ensure that information is provided to asylum-seekers detained under the Immigration Acts and whose cases have yet to be determined on the probable length of their detention.
<BR>
(2) The information in subsection (1) above may be given orally or otherwise, but shall not form the basis for any subsequent legal or other proceedings.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving the amendment I shall speak also to Amendment No. 59 in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Sandwich. I begin by reminding your Lordships that at 30th September this year, more than half of the 985 people detained under the Immigration Act were held in prisons and not in detention centres. I have that information from a government Written Answer in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para15"></a>At earlier stages of the Bill, much concern was expressed about the arbitrary nature of detention in cases which have yet to be decided and its uncertain length. The visitors to detention centres are unhappy about this and point out the damaging effect of the uncertainty on the mental health of detainees. I quoted from the only medical study on this subject which confirmed the ill effects.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para16"></a>The UNHCR's London office is also concerned. It points out that under the Bill,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no routine bail hearings are foreseen after the 36th day of detention, ignoring the fact that the longer detention lasts, the more pressing is the need for judicial scrutiny".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-15_para17"></a>
It states also that bail hearings held in prisons or detention centres will not be open to the public or in generally accessible public places, and therefore will not be perceived as impartial or independent. In my view, Her Majesty's Government would not be right to rely too heavily on bail hearings as an all-purpose remedy in cases of detention.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para18"></a>I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, for undertaking, at col. 1259 of the Official Report of 20th October, to consider the giving to detainees of indications of the likely length of their detention. However, it was disappointing when, in a letter dated 27th October which has been circulated to a number of noble Lords, the noble Lord wrote that such indications would be likely to arouse false expectations. However, he went on to state that detainees are informed monthly of the progress of their <P>


<a name="column_770"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 770</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cases. When the Minister replies, will he please say how this system works; who does the informing; and whether it is always done in a language understood by the detainee? Is the connection between progress of the case and continued detention properly explained?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para19"></a>If there is a system and if it is working well, that seems to make it fairly easy for the Government to accept my first amendment. It merely puts on the face of the Bill the substance, as I understand it, of the present system. I observe that it is also narrowly drawn because it refers only to asylum seekers whose cases have yet to be determined. Subsection (2) provides that information may be given either orally or in writing and shall not become the basis for subsequent proceedings.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para20"></a>The second amendment, Amendment No. 59, which stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Sandwich, is slightly wider in that it could cover all Immigration Act detainees. However, it is less demanding in that it requires the Secretary of State only to publish guidance about the maximum length of detention in individual cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para21"></a>Therefore, the Government have a choice set out before them as between the two amendments. This evening I should most like to hear an explanation of the present or proposed arrangements for informing detainees not only why they are being held, but also how long it is expected to continue. Detention may be a necessary evil, but its bad effects should be mitigated as much as possible. Uncertainty is certainly one of those bad effects. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-15_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I understand the motivation behind this amendment. However, with respect, I believe that in certain respects it is impractical. If the amendment had been to the effect that if, after a period of time--say, three months--the asylum seeker remained in custody, certain information should be given to him then, and perhaps periodically after that, I should have had much more sympathy with it. However, that may be difficult to do in the initial period, as seems borne out by experience. Perhaps I should have attempted to amend the amendment and I was derelict in my duty in that regard. I wish to make that point to the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para22"></a>Perhaps in any event it is a matter which can be dealt with informally. It is a matter of practice and procedure which does not have to be embodied in the Bill. When my noble friend replies to this debate, perhaps he will give some indication of the practice which I believe, as a matter of natural justice, should be followed in dealing with such a situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para23"></a>Such people are not detained as a result of having committed criminal offences. It is quite a different situation for them. However, when it comes to someone who is still waiting--and there are many instances of people waiting a long period of time for information about when their case will finally be dealt with--I believe that some provision ought to be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-15_para24"></a>I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, has done the House a service by raising this issue at this stage of the Bill. Perhaps it is a pity that when these matters <P>


<a name="column_771"></a>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-16_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, feels, for reasons he has eloquently given, that Amendment No. 17 would not meet the problems to which he has adverted, perhaps I may recommend that he looks at Amendment No. 59, also in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, as that amendment refers specifically to guidance on the length of detention.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para0"></a>I believe that all your Lordships are concerned about what may give the impression of an unlimited power to detain. Certainly, those of us who have met the remarkable members of the voluntary groups who try to visit detention centres are very much aware of the concern expressed by them about the mental effects on people of not knowing--or, indeed, of not having any idea--of the length of time for which they might be detained. At the heart of this group of amendments lies concern about detainees not being given regular information on how long their detention will continue despite the fact that, as the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, has said, they have committed no crime, have been charged with no offence and have been found guilty of no offence of any kind. I give way to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness. One appealing facet of Amendment No. 17 is subsection (2). As far as I can see, there is no provision on whether the guidance becomes justiciable in Amendment No. 59. I believe that that would be unfortunate because such cases sometimes become protracted and difficult. I should not wish to see the guidance become justiciable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-16_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, will address that issue. My impression was that it would not become a justiciable matter, but the noble Earl will no doubt say whether or not that is correct. I believe that the word "guidance" would not normally carry the implication of being justiciable, but I may be wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para1"></a>In this group of amendments, I should like to refer also to Amendment No. 60 which stands in my name. That amendment limits to 72 hours the period that a detainee can spend in prison. Again, in that regard, I advert to the fact that those who deal with detainees are particularly concerned about their being sent to prison. Obviously, many of our prisons have no adequate resources for dealing with detainees, especially those who may be going through a period of extreme nervous strain; who may in fact be the victims of torture; and so on. As many of our prisons are, in any case, over-crowded, they are the last places to which detainees should be sent.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para2"></a>Rather than suggest that there should be no admission to prison at all, we included a limit of 72 hours because we recognise that there may be <P>


<a name="column_772"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 772</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>immediate situations that cannot be dealt with by a detention centre. Certainly, it would be extremely encouraging if the Government could give us some indication that, wherever possible, they will avoid sending to prison an asylum seeker or refugee and that, where that is absolutely unavoidable, it will be made clear that it must be for the minimum possible time.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para3"></a>To save time perhaps I may also refer to Amendment No. 28, which is an amendment in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, to which he will no doubt speak. In the Committee and the Report stages of the Bill I was particularly concerned about the history of torture. I believe that the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, will remember that I tabled an amendment on this issue at an earlier stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para4"></a>The Government have been responsive on issues of torture. Indeed, I received a letter from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, on the subject. He said that the Government recognised that wherever possible those who had been victims of torture should not be detained. That is on the face of the letter.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para5"></a>However, when one looks at the material that has just been supplied to us, and at the section entitled,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Reasons for Detention and Bail Rights",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-16_para6"></a>
which was not available for the Committee stage, it is plain from the list of reasons given for detention and the list of factors on which the decision has been made that there is absolutely no reference whatsoever in the entire document to situations where as far as possible detention should be avoided.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para7"></a>Some noble Lords may have seen this document which indicates the reasons why people should remain in detention. There are examples such as likely to abscond; insufficient reliable information; release is not considered conducive to the public good, and so on. They are all reasons why someone should be detained. Then there is a list of the facts that have to be taken into account in deciding on detention, such as having previously absconded, or attempted to use deception, or failed to give satisfactory answers to an immigration officer's questions. They are all reasons why someone should be detained.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para8"></a>We believe that that should be balanced by reasons why, in certain cases, as far as possible detention should be avoided. That is why, throughout these proceedings, we have argued that a history of torture should be seen as a ground why someone should not be detained unless there are exceptional circumstances. We may add to those reasons one or two other reasons such as the existence of a serious medical condition or the existence of dependants outside the detention centre. We believe that the Home Office immigration officers should reach balanced decisions on whether or not to detain someone.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para9"></a>Perhaps I may put in brackets that I believe that this country has the highest proportion, by a substantial margin, of asylum seekers in detention of any country in the European Union. We want to avoid detention because it is expensive as well as extremely hard in <P>


<a name="column_773"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 773</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>terms of its psychological impact. Perhaps I may suggest to the Home Office that they add another section to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Reasons for Detention and Bail Rights".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-16_para10"></a>
I applaud them on the section on bail rights, which is excellent, but perhaps there could be a section that deals with reasons why, in certain instances, there should be only very exceptional reasons why such a person should be detained. Again I underline the incidence of a history of torture, as the noble Earl does in his amendment. I believe that is a humane argument and one that has the support of people on all sides of the House. I beg the Government to consider this matter, given that they have already given assurances to see whether that may be done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, although one sympathises with the motive of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, in moving the amendment, it seems to me that the Government cannot possibly answer the questions that he asked. Not long ago it was announced in the press that there were 100,000 cases of asylum seekers whose cases had not been dealt with. The facilities available until now for dealing with such cases have been so limited that the number has grown steadily over the past two years. As a result, the Government will not be able to tell for a while how those facilities can be improved and increased. Until there is an improvement in the system and the facilities have increased, it will be impossible for the Government to answer the question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, will he accept that while the backlog is still growing, the numbers detained on any particular day is under 1,000?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, yes, but we have to bear in mind also that there will be further applications from time to time. The Government cannot possibly anticipate how many applications there will be.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I point out to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, that one reason for the huge backlog is the failure of the Government's computer system, which the other day was mentioned, yet again, in the press. I telephoned Siemens to ask how they were getting on with the trials and I was told that it was none of my business. I explained to them that I was a Member of this Parliament and that I was to take part in the debate on the Immigration and Asylum Bill and they told me to "get lost" in an extremely contemptuous manner.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para11"></a>When a company that is employed by the public sector to implement a system that is supposed to improve the casework performance of the Home Office replies in that way one should have great anxiety about its performance. We know that the system was handed over for trials in June but we do not have the faintest idea how those trials are progressing or whether the roll-out will take place next spring as promised. Perhaps the noble Lord who is to reply <P>


<a name="column_774"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 774</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>could say something about the state of play on that computer system, which may help to alleviate the anxieties expressed also by the noble Lord, Lord Renton--justifiably so.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para12"></a>I want to speak to Amendments Nos. 26 and 27. In this group we have a rather heterogeneous collection of amendments. These two amendments ensure that the Secretary of State cannot deny an applicant a routine bail hearing by regulation. The amendments preserve the power to adjourn hearings, but remove the power to take away rights to a second hearing. They amend provisions added to the Bill by government amendments tabled on Report.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para13"></a>The subsections in question provide for the Secretary of State to make provision modifying the application of Clause 41 in cases where a routine bail hearing is adjourned to enable medical reports to be obtained or "for any other reason". It states that the regulations may in particular provide for there not to be a second routine bail hearing in such circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para14"></a>I take issue with the Government on that because we believe that there always should be a second bail hearing within 30 days. The reasons for that were demonstrated by the discussion we had on Report. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, suggested that an adjournment would last for only a minimum of 21 days. However, he also indicated that it would be possible to continue an adjournment from time to time to await medical reports. As the Bill stands, there is a real prospect of such detainees not having two hearings within 21 days and possibly having to wait for several months for a second consideration of their detention by a magistrate or an adjudicator. The prospect of cases in such circumstances having to be adjourned continually appears to disadvantage those identified by the Government in the White Paper as those whom they were especially reluctant to detain, such as those with evidence of torture or physical or mental illness.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, has written to the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. In that he said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we cannot give an undertaking that nobody who claims to have been the victim of torture will be detained. In all cases we must be satisfied that the person will comply with any conditions attached to the grant of temporary admission or release or bail. Where there are substantial grounds for believing that a person would not comply we must reserve the right to detain".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-16_para16"></a>
He continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"However, inevitably there will be circumstances, for example where the resumed first routine bail hearing is heard at the same time as the second hearing would be due to be heard. It is obvious that in these limited circumstances a second reference would be a waste of time and resources. It seems sensible for the regulations to make provision for this".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

That is precisely the point at issue. We say that there should always be the right to a second bail hearing and that if a medical report cannot be obtained within 21 days, that is an additional ground why a person should be released on temporary admission. We object fundamentally to the idea that a person claiming to be a victim of torture and who is nevertheless detained on <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-16_para18"></a>We urge the Government that they retain the second bail hearing or provide that in circumstances of this kind the applicant is invariably released. I hope that with these arguments the noble Lord will reconsider what he said to the medical foundation and make provision for an invariable second bail hearing.

<A NAME="91102-17_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has already given me a cue as regards my Amendment No. 28 which is concerned with written reasons. I hope not to repeat the arguments which she has already made or provoke the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Renton, who has great wisdom in these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-17_para0"></a>The issue of written reasons has caused great concern since it is so central to this Government's human rights policy. However, I believe that they have taken seriously what was said on Report and at previous stages of the Bill as regards the rights of detainees. They have tried to improve the Bill, notably with the presumption of liberty through the general right to be released.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-17_para1"></a>This amendment was tabled at Report stage. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, while sympathising with it, said that it was unnecessary. However, at that time we did not have the benefit of the new forms and procedures published by the Immigration Service and referred to by the Minister on the last occasion. That is why we have to look at the matter again. My amendment refers to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"making specific reference to the person who is the subject of the hearing".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-17_para2"></a>
The explanation on page one of the new instructions reads,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It makes our decisions on detention more open and should help us to identify when detention is appropriate and when it is not".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-17_para3"></a>
The instructions would appear to be exhaustive. In Annexe 6 there are lengthy guidance notes, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, has said. The actual form, IS 91R, is very simple. It is little more than a checklist or a list of tick boxes described earlier in the Bill. In other words, there is nowhere which allows for a specific reference to the individual, which is what this amendment is about.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-17_para4"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, at Report stage said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that detailed check-list will be tailored to individual circumstances and to relevant exceptions".--[Official Report, 20/10/99; col. 897.]

He said that he could see the argument about torture and would look at it again but without assurances.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-17_para6"></a>It is worth revisiting the White Paper at paragraph 12.4 on page 53. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government also recognises the need to exercise particular care in the consideration of physical and mental health when deciding to detain. Evidence of a history of torture should weigh strongly in favour of temporary admission or temporary release whilst an individual's asylum claim is being considered".

<FONT SIZE=3>
I have also seen the letter from the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, of 26th October. Paragraph 36 gives further reassurance although I believe that in that case the written reasons at the outset of the hearing are not giving the detainee any opportunity in advance.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-17_para8"></a>I have looked carefully at the form again and the medical and special needs section of the instructions. They appear to be more about risks to the public than defining the needs of individuals. Will the Minister accept that we have always argued consistently for full written reasons, particular to the individual, which seemed to be accepted on Report? Does he agree even at this stage that providing some space on the form for individual circumstances would not be asking a great deal? It will not require a great deal of intelligence to adapt the present form and include a new section for this important change. In speaking to my Amendment No. 28, I support my noble friend in Amendment No. 59 about guidance and guide times.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sheppard of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, I believe that it is good for voices from these Benches to support what the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, said about the form. I hope that the Minister may be able to give some assurance about the form being redesigned. It appears very bureaucratic with the inhuman ticking of little boxes. It concerns the removal of a person's freedom. The form does not indicate that any of the person's very significant circumstances have been heard. I hope that there may be a re-design of the form.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, I shall not detain the House for very long. I speak in support of my noble friends Lord Hylton and Lord Sandwich. In particular I would like to make some reference to Amendment No. 28 and the provision on the form for the details of a person's age, the background and whether there is some history of torture. I echo what the noble Lord, Lord Sheppard of Liverpool, said about the reasonableness of my noble friend's amendment. The concluding lines of the amendment state that the information should be provided,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as soon as is reasonably practicable after detention".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-17_para9"></a>
It is a moderate amendment, which is not making unfair demands on bureaucracy, administration or local government. It is something we should readily accept.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-17_para10"></a>It is worth recalling the kind of people we are dealing with. It is easy to become bogged down in discussions about bureaucracy or long waiting lists. The Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture has alerted many Members of your Lordships' House to some of the individual problems that detainees are already experiencing. Perhaps I may mention one or two of them. An Algerian is awaiting an initial decision. He has been waiting for over a year. He was detained for two years prior to that in Algeria in a desert camp where he was tortured. An Afghan has been awaiting a final decision for five months. No decision has been made in his case. He was used as a slave by the Taliban. He was tortured and his fingers were broken. Another Afghan has been awaiting a decision for over a year. He was detained and made to <P>


<a name="column_777"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 777</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do forced labour. He was tortured. He was aged 16 and imprisoned with 40 others in a container, which was then set alight. His sister and brother were burnt to death in front of him. He was badly burned and continues to suffer.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-17_para11"></a>Surely we can do better for people who have come from such horrendous situations in prisons or comparable circumstances. It is the mark of a civilised society how we treat such people. My noble friend's amendment provides for a much more civilised formula than has been offered in the Bill so far.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I agree that it is the mark of a civilised society that we treat properly and well people with the ghastly histories which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, outlined. At the same time I do not believe that it would be right for the Government to say that anyone who claims to have been tortured should be immune from detention. That would be going too far. It would inevitably mean that anyone who wished to avoid detention would produce a story of torture which might not be true. In the meantime they might avoid detention and abscond.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-17_para12"></a>I appreciate the reasons for Amendment No. 17. Like my noble friend Lord Renton, I believe that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the Government to even anticipate with any accuracy the length of detention at the beginning of that period or to place limits on it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-17_para13"></a>It was said that these individuals have committed no crime. Of course it is true that they have not been convicted; but some of them may have committed a crime. They are in a similar position to those who are remanded in custody. They are not proved to have committed a crime, but a court decides that, for various reasons, they should be detained until it is decided whether or not they have committed a crime.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord give way? Surely, there is a marked difference between the immigration detainee and the prisoner on remand who has been charged with a specific offence in this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, of course there is a difference. I do not say that they are in exactly the same position but they are in an analogous position; that is, it has to be decided what should happen to them. Part of what has to be decided is whether or not their claim is fraudulent. That is part of the decision that has to be made in some cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-17_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, rightly drew attention to the fact that proportionately very few in that situation are detained. I am not sure how the proportions compare and it will not be particularly helpful to draw a comparison between those on remand and detention of this kind. However, it is a small proportion. Sometimes, we must remember, the detainees themselves wish to spin out the discussions <P>


<a name="column_778"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 778</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the legal complications of their cases. That would make it even more difficult for the authorities to anticipate the length of detention that might result.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend's amendment merely asks that the "probable" length shall be vouchsafed. If the detainee chooses to spin it out, then it is his business but it has nothing to do with the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, with respect to the noble and learned Lord, it has a little to do with the amendment. At the same time, it is one indication of why it is extremely difficult for the authorities to anticipate the length of detention at the start. Therefore I am not sympathetic to Amendment No. 17.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-17_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Lord for giving way. I put forward a different proposition. My proposition was that perhaps after the first three months in detention some information should be provided. I do not suggest that it should be justiciable. But surely somebody facing the purgatory of detention should be given some information as to how long it is going to last.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I am sympathetic to that proposal. The way the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, puts it is more acceptable than the way it is expressed in the amendment, and more feasible. All these things are acceptable, but his proposal is more feasible than the way expressed in the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-18_para0"></a>However, I am sympathetic with Amendment No. 28 tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, in relation to written reasons. I shall not go into details because several other noble Lords have already done so. For what it is worth, I also agree with the Government in their Amendment No. 29.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said that this was a disparate group of amendments. But they have a common underpinning. When we discussed this matter on Report the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, raised the question in relation to likely length of detention. We said that we would look on that as favourably as we could and reflect on it. One of the problems was that identified by the noble Lord, Lord Renton; that is, that it is not a question capable of being answered. In any event, legitimate expectations would be raised. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, recognised that and sought to address it in the second part of Amendment No. 17. He said also that his amendment provided alternatives for the Government to consider.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-18_para1"></a>Perhaps I can deal with one or two specific questions first. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, dealt with the implementation programme. The testing of the system by IND staff began in October. It is being carried out on dummy cases for the time being. It will continue at least until the end of the year when there will be piloting on real cases and a progressive roll-out during <P>


<a name="column_779"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 779</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the year 2000. If there was any discourtesy to the noble Lord, I regret it. I do not believe he can accuse either my noble friend Lord Bassam or I of discourtesy. If he requires further information, he might receive a more informative response--he would certainly receive a more courteous response--if he were to write to us. I never trust the telephone and prefer always to conduct my business in correspondence where the opportunity for rudeness and ducking the issue does not offer itself as readily.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-18_para2"></a>I can go on to the question of giving information. A number of noble Lords raised this point and I recognise the anxieties. The current system is that we inform detainees monthly of the progress of their case. That is a proper first strand of the approach because, by means of the Bill--this should not be overlooked--the second strand is the supplementation by a statutory presumption in favour of bail and the system of routine bail hearings. I do not overlook the problems raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, my noble friends Lord Clinton-Davis and Lord Sheppard, the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, and the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-18_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, was pressing on the sort of information to be given. Would it be oral or in writing? Would it be informative? I have taken on board his points. The best thing I can do is to obtain a sample of actual notifications, where necessary blanking out private material such as names or particulars, and send some of them to noble Lords and provide the same sample to the Library. If there are then further troublesome questions, at least we shall know what sort of information is given out. It may be that it will be satisfactory to the House; it may be that we could do better. The best course is to be as open and candid as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-18_para4"></a>Amendment No. 26 would not work. Other parts of Clause 41 would require modification; in particular the duty in subsection (5) to make a second reference on a specified timetable. The second reference point is one that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, developed. One could have examples; for instance, first routine bail hearing held, say, on 13th day following detention; proper adjournment for 21 days for medical reports in the interests of those who have proper complaints that they have been tortured, either mentally or physically; the hearing would then resume on the 35th day. That is still one day within the limit. In those circumstances there seems little purpose in having a second reference and we simply want the flexibility not to have a second reference where it does not serve any useful purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-18_para5"></a>I want to spend a little time on Amendment No. 28. This was dealt with by my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer saying that when a person's age was in dispute there would be close contact between the immigration officer and the detainee as to the evidence available to substantiate the correct age. Information about physical or mental health or torture would be provided by the detainee or the representative of the detainee. Where concerns in relation to a person's <P>


<a name="column_780"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 780</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>physical or mental health form part of the decision to detain, that information will be included on the written reasons for detention form.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-18_para6"></a>Many of the points raised by the noble Lords I identified by name are properly raised. It is a great pity that the need to give this information was not included in the instructions to immigration officers requiring that written reasons for detention be given in each case. In response in particular to my noble friend Lord Sheppard, officials are due to review both the instructions and the written reasons for detention form early in the new year, and I hope that if possible the form will be amended to include any information known which supports a history of torture. On behalf of my noble friend Lord Bassam and myself, the thrust of what was said found immediate favour with us. We cannot bind ourselves to the content of the form, but the points seemed to both of us to be well made and we have the opportunity of reviewing the instructions and written reasons. I have to say that the immediate feeling of both of us is that the more information that can sensibly and helpfully be given, the better. I do not think that I can make our position plainer than that and I trust that it accords with your Lordships' views.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-18_para7"></a>I turn now to the question about Scotland, with which I shall deal quickly. This will be the first time in your Lordships' House that a question relating to Scotland has ever been dealt with quickly. Therefore, I hope that there are no Scottish Peers present in the Chamber. Amendment No. 29 requires the Lord Chancellor to obtain the consent of Scottish Ministers before he gives his approval to any regulations which would extend to the Sheriff Court or the Court of Session jurisdiction to hear applications for bail under Clause 50. That is a necessary consequence of the devolution machinery.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-18_para8"></a>Amendment No. 59 sets out the alternative which the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and others have put forward. I believe that we all share the same aim in this respect. We certainly want to have minimal use of detention. In some circumstances, there will be requirements for detention for a longer period than we would wish. I do not think that we can issue guidance on the maximum period for detention. I reiterate what the noble Lord, Lord Cope, said; namely, that it is the maximum that is set down, not the probable. I do not believe that this provision would be workable. We would still be back to legitimate expectation and people would try and make this justiciable. I am not sure that one can come to a sensible conclusion in every case.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-18_para9"></a>Amendment No. 60 would put a maximum of 72 hours on the time that a person could be detained before being moved into a detention centre. This simply is not practicable. On occasions, we have to use prisons and other short-term holding facilities. We do not want to use prison, but sometimes we shall simply have to do so. That could be for reasons of geography. There are some cases--quite few in number, but we must take them into account--where, for reasons of security or control, we must detain persons in prison. If those persons are violent, the public are entitled to look for protection. Similarly, if there have been <P>


<a name="column_781"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 781</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>abscondings in the past or attempted abscondings, such persons may need to be housed more securely than would be the case in a detention centre.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-18_para10"></a>Amendment No. 61 is consequential on Amendment No. 60. Detention in the circumstances anticipated in the amendment is normally for a few days, although it may have to be slightly longer. I do not believe that we ought to accept these amendments. I hope that I have satisfied your Lordships that we have not been unsympathetic as regards the deeper thrust of the amendments and that we have not been unresponsive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say something about the position of persons who may be liable to be sectioned under the mental health Acts? If someone who is in detention exhibits violent tendencies and is found to be mentally ill, which turns out to be the reason for his behaviour, would he not in any case be transferred to a psychiatric hospital? Therefore, in such a case, the person would not need to be detained in the manner that the Bill describes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, that is not always the case. There are, rightly, quite strict civil liberty circumscriptions around sectioning. Not everyone who has to be detained needs to be detained in the circumstances of incarceration in a psychiatric institution. Indeed, doctors do not care for it without plain evidence, and I think that they are right. What the noble Lord has said is a part, but not the whole, answer to the problem that I have identified.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken to my amendment and to the others in this group. I should like to express my gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, for what he said about information being given after three months' detention. I look forward to hearing from the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General further details about the kind of information that will, I hope, be supplied monthly to detainees regarding the progress of their cases and any likely length of continuing detention.

This should go a long way to relieve the concerns of the operators of these facilities, as negotiations regarding the provision of immigration facilities can be kept much more site specific and there will be much less generalisation. Thus any disputes should be more easily overcome and the offer of some independent scrutiny, as mentioned at an earlier stage of the Bill, will be made much more achievable. It is to be hoped that there will also be improvements in cost and practicality.

<A NAME = "91102-19_para10"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, in this group we also find Amendments Nos. 22, 62, 63, 66 and 67. Perhaps I may try to deal with them compendiously. Amendment No. 21 was tabled in response to the judgment in the case of Adimi and others which was handed down the day after the Committee stage of the Bill had been completed in this House. It was tabled for discussion but not moved on Report. We have taken the opportunity to consider the comments of the Select Committee and have made some drafting changes.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-19_para11"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that someone who comes within Article 31(1) of the United Nations convention of 1951 is properly protected and does not have a penalty imposed on him on account of his illegal entry or presence. As I told your Lordships on an earlier occasion, we have already put in place administrative procedures to identify at an early stage Article 31(1) issues. Ideally, therefore, in relevant cases the matter would never come to court. Sometimes these arrangements will fail. They will fail to identify someone who comes within Article 31(1) and this amendment is therefore a further safeguard. I told your Lordships on Report that subsection (1) draws on the terms of the article itself. There is one addition, which is the requirement for anyone claiming the protection provided by this subsection to have applied for asylum as soon as is reasonably practicable. I think that that is a fair addition.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-19_para12"></a>Subsection (2) limits the application of the defence created by subsection (1) where the refugee stopped in another country outside the United Kingdom. In such cases the defence applies only if the refugee shows that he could not reasonably have been expected to be given protection under the convention in that other country. This is--I recognise the force of what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said--a narrower definition than that which was adopted by the Divisional Court. I think that we are entitled to take our view, having considered the views of the court, and we have taken a different view.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-19_para13"></a>The purpose of the convention is to enable people to escape from persecution. There is no obligation to facilitate the passage of a refugee to a country of his or <P>


<a name="column_785"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 785</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>her choosing. This does not mean that every refugee who passes through a third country will be prosecuted; that does not happen at the moment and it will not happen in the future. I think that we are entitled to place a limit on what is called "forum shopping", deciding that one will accept an offer of safety in country B or C, but not in country A. As I said earlier on Report, the definition of "coming directly" was a generous one. There must come a time when an individual has stopped running away--that is the Article 31 situation--and has started travelling towards a preferred destination. We have tried to define this in subsection (2).
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-19_para14"></a>The offences for which the new defence will be available are listed in subsections (3) and (4). I believe that we have it right. There is quite a degree of conformity between this list and the offences listed in the amendment tabled by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark at Report. If the list needs to be added to, this can be done by order, subject to affirmative resolution, by virtue of government Amendment No. 62, if that commends itself to your Lordships. The Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation suggested that removing offences from the list, and therefore removing the defence, was a more serious matter and should be a matter for primary legislation. We are happy to accept that suggestion and, in consequence, opposition Amendment No. 22 which stands in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Cope of Berkeley and Lord Goodhart, and the noble Viscount, Lord Astor.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-19_para15"></a>I wish to deal briefly with those convicted of these offences in the past. I mentioned at Report that there is no central database which would enable us to identify those who have been convicted of one of the relevant offences who would not have been found guilty--and indeed probably would not even have been prosecuted--had a defence of the sort that we propose been available at the time. Subsections (8) and (9) permit anyone who has been convicted of a relevant offence in England, Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland to apply to the relevant criminal cases review commission on the grounds that he would have had a defence had it been in force at the time. Cases where Article 31 has already been raised are excluded because the matter has already been addressed. It is plainly desirable--I think that your Lordships are all of this view--for the process, in other words, the protection provided by the clause, to start as soon as possible. If accepted, this amendment would come into force on Royal Assent by means of Amendment No. 66. Amendments Nos. 63 and 67 simply replace consequential amendments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I support what my noble friend Lord Cope of Berkeley has said and I add briefly to that. We find in subsection (10) of the proposed new clause that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may by order"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-20_para1"></a>
do various things. In our legislation we occasionally allow that to happen, but mostly to deal with administrative matters. However, here it is suggested that criminal offences can be removed merely by order. That, I think, is unusual and unacceptable. Therefore I think that the amendment which my noble friend has moved, and which is supported by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is an important one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General for that concession. I am sure that the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee will be as well.

<P>
<A NAME="91102-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I think that this is a welcome amendment. But when the noble and learned Lord speaks further on it, will he say whether he expects that even a few prisoners now serving sentences will be released as a consequence?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I reply to that point immediately because the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, raised this question on a previous occasion. My answer remains the same; namely, that given the time sequence and the likely sentences to have been imposed--the noble Lord discussed this and explained it--it is unlikely that anyone is still serving a sentence of imprisonment. However, I mentioned--I repeat this--that if any particulars were brought either to the attention of the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, or to myself, we would look into them immediately. As far as I am aware, no such particulars have been brought to our attention.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-20_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, I revert for a moment to Amendment No. 21 and to what the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General said about stopping in a country. For the moment I do not want to pursue the matter of people stopping somewhere on their way to this country. Rather, I ask the following question. Do the administrative instructions, which I understand are given to the Crown Prosecution Service--we are grateful for the information that was provided by the Home Office on this matter--extend to people who are travelling through Heathrow with the purpose, for example, of going to a destination in Canada? There have been a number of cases of people who have been on their way to Canada to join other members of their family who have been prosecuted under the earlier procedures, the counterfeit Act and so on. Can the Minister tell us whether as a result of Clause 28 it is now unlikely that <P>


<a name="column_787"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 787</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>such people will be prosecuted but rather permitted to continue on their journey and be dealt with by the Canadian authorities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-20_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I think that the best course is for me to procure the guidelines to the Crown Prosecution Service, provide a copy to the noble Baroness, and, as always, lodge a copy in the Library.

<A NAME = "91102-20_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, under Clause 30 the Secretary of State must issue a code of practice to be followed by any person operating a system for preventing the carriage of clandestine entrants. The effect of Amendment No. 23 would be to make it mandatory for the Secretary of State to consult such persons as he considers appropriate before laying the code of practice before Parliament. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, raised this issue at Report stage and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, undertook at that time to table a government amendment covering this point.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-20_para6"></a>The Government are fully committed to consultation and dialogue with industry representatives in the development of the code of practice and Amendment No. 23 seeks to reflect this commitment. Amendment No. 24 makes it clear that any consultation that the Government have undertaken prior to the coming into force of the Act will count towards the Secretary of State's obligations to consult before issuing a code of practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-20_para7"></a>The Government have been in consultation for some time with the road haulage industry about the contents of the code of practice for road freight and we think it only right that the amendment to the Bill should provide for this consultation to be taken into account in respect of the Secretary of State's obligations.

<a name="column_788"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 788</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grouped with this amendment, or whether it is intended that it should be degrouped and dealt with at another stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-20_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I am quite happy for the noble Earl to speak to his amendment now, following which I will respond.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-20_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, we discussed Amendment No. 25 at an earlier stage. It puts in a defence for a carrier if that carrier can show that the entrant was subsequently admitted to this country and granted protection under the refugee convention or the Human Rights Act. This amendment not only gives some protection to carriers but also eradicates an anomaly that we feel is apparent in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-20_para8"></a>Perhaps I could at this stage ask the Minister about the code of practice. I understand that since Report stage not much progress has been made in regard to the consultations. I note that the Minister will be seeking expert advice. Can he confirm that there are two different codes for road and rail and that the advice will include those two different codes? It would be helpful if the Minister could at this stage say what progress has been made on the code of practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-20_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, I briefly address Amendment No. 25. As the Ministers will know, we have on a number of occasions reverted to the issue of what would happen if a clandestine entrant made himself known immediately as an asylum seeker or was proved later to be one. It has always seemed to us profoundly unfair that those who carry, without any intention of doing so, people who later turn out to be genuine asylum seekers should be treated on all-fours with those who deliberately bring in people intending to be in breach of our immigration laws and indeed intending to be illegal entrants. At present the Bill makes no such distinction between the two categories.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-20_para9"></a>Amendment No. 25 is very cautiously worded. It makes plain that the carrier would not receive any form of protection from penalties if he, either knowingly or unknowingly, brought in somebody who intended to come to this country without declaring himself to be an asylum seeker, or if that person was not subsequently granted asylum. It is, therefore, a very narrowly and cautiously drawn amendment. It makes clear that what is proposed will only hold in the case of somebody who is subsequently admitted to the United Kingdom, and that in that event, and only in that event, the fine which would otherwise be payable would retrospectively be returned.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-20_para10"></a>The amendment is designed very carefully within the context of the refugee convention or the Human Rights Act 1998. Very strict penalties would fall upon harbingers who brought in a clandestine entrant other than on the strongest possible grounds under the provisions. They would be penalised very heavily; they might even put their lorries or other forms of transport at risk.
<P>


<a name="column_789"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 789</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-20_para11"></a>In the circumstances, we believe that this is a modest request for a reasonable level of refund to those who would otherwise be penalised for bringing in somebody who turned out to be a genuine asylum seeker, genuinely accepted in this country. The amendment should commend itself to Ministers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-20_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, we have for some time considered Amendment No. 25. It seeks to introduce an additional defence against the civil penalty where the carrier can show that the clandestine entrant has been granted refugee status or protection under the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-20_para12"></a>As we have said on a number of occasions during our discussions on the civil penalty, the Government understand the genuine and sincere concerns which underlie such amendments as this. However, I believe that the amendment would damage the effectiveness of the civil penalty in combating the problem of clandestine illegal entry and would not benefit genuine asylum seekers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-20_para13"></a>This Government have a strong and honourable human rights record and remain fully committed to honouring their obligations under the 1951 convention as and when refugees reach the UK. However, there is no obligation on the United Kingdom, or on any other government, to facilitate the travel here of persons who propose to claim asylum under the 1951 convention or ECHR protection under Article 3.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-20_para14"></a>The civil penalty is intended to address the large and increasing problem of clandestine illegal entrants. Many of these clandestine entrants subsequently claim asylum and indeed travel here with that intention. However, only a very small proportion have their claims accepted. Other provisions in the Bill are intended to deter the increasing number of persons who are travelling to the United Kingdom with the intention of using a claim for asylum as a means of establishing themselves for economic betterment rather than genuinely fleeing persecution. At the moment, such persons increasingly use clandestine illegal entry.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-20_para15"></a>The Government do not believe that the deterrent effect of the civil penalty can be diluted in this way. Nor can we dilute the message to drivers, owners and operators of vehicles about the security measures they must take which the civil penalty is intended clearly and in a very straightforward way to encourage.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo991102/text/91102-21.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for interrupting the Minister. He has spoken of deterring those who may abuse the system who are not genuine asylum seekers. However, it also deters genuine asylum seekers. We are absolutely at one in relation to deterring those who would abuse the system. This amendment does nothing to weaken the deterrent in that sense. It only weakens the deterrent on genuine asylum seekers where they are carried. However, it is also extremely unfair on the lorry driver or the carrier concerned if he actually turns out to have carried a genuine asylum seeker.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I have listened with interest to what the noble Lord has said. <P>


<a name="column_790"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 790</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, I return to the point that we believe that this amendment would significantly weaken our defences. We cannot do anything that would give encouragement to clandestine entrants and to drivers or owners or operators of vehicles to lower the level of security measures which they must take and which the civil penalty is intended to encourage.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-21_para0"></a>In the context of the need to take those security measures and to make appropriate checks, the question of whether any concealed individual might or could make a successful asylum claim or a claim for protection under the ECHR is simply irrelevant. The checks are designed to ensure that no one is concealed; no one should be there. If the checks locate any concealed person, given that the person concealed will already be in a country of safety, they will have no need to travel to the UK to make a claim. We do not accept that there is an obligation to facilitate the travel here of persons who propose to claim asylum under the 1951 convention or protection under Article 3 of the ECHR.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-21_para1"></a>In relation to clandestine entrants, we do not accept that the ECHR would require us to refund penalties even if the clandestine entrant eventually obtains Article 3 protection. The fact that a person, once here, has a right not to be removed is irrelevant to the question of whether the person responsible took proper precautions to prevent their carrying clandestine entrants generally. If they are faced with a person who wishes the driver to take them concealed into the United Kingdom, they should refuse. There is no reason for anyone to come to the United Kingdom concealed, as opposed to coming openly. Moreover, in most cases, the clandestine entrant will attempt to enter the United Kingdom from other member states of the EU who have a strong commitment to considering claims for protection. Such states are likely to be responsible under the terms of the Dublin Convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-21_para2"></a>It is true that there is provision for carriers' liability charges to be refunded where an asylum application is successful. However, the circumstances are very different. There is a great degree of control over fare-paying passengers entering aircraft and ferries, so the scope for illicit travel is low.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-21_para3"></a>The purpose of the penalty is to ensure security and to ensure that clandestine entrants are properly regulated and checked before they have an opportunity to enter the United Kingdom. We believe that the amendment would encourage drivers to take risks by not bothering to make proper checks.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-21_para4"></a>I turn to the question raised by the noble Viscount, Viscount Astor, as to the level of consultation. We have consulted very carefully over the codes or practice. Indeed, we have had a good deal of discussion and consultation with the industries that are affected----the FTA, RHA, Eurolines, International Transport Union and the EWS for rail. I am happy to give a commitment that this is a continuing process. We wish to continue the helpful discussions and negotiations about the content of the draft code of practice.

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 791</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-21_para5"></a>I return to my earlier point. The civil penalty is aimed at a much less secure situation. It is designed to encourage checks by drivers to prevent generally the carriage of clandestine entrants. This is of paramount importance. The motives of individuals who may be concealed are irrelevant to our consideration of this part of the legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-21_para6"></a>I urge your Lordships to assist us in strengthening our position in terms of protecting against clandestines, and to reject the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, he mentioned that there had been a number of consultations with the firms involved. Can he give some indication of their reaction and the outcome of the consultation with the Home Office?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, it is always difficult to summarise and I should hate to get it wrong. There is an appreciation and an understanding of the scope of the problem. I accept fully that our proposals will not satisfy and meet the concerns of all of those with whom we have consulted. But in terms of drawing up a code of practice and making that code of practice effective--and making the legislation effective--there is an understanding. As I said, we are more than happy to continue those consultations so that we can better perfect the code of practice.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, on the last occasion that we considered this matter, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the court which made the deportation order will have taken into consideration the convicted person's circumstances before making the recommendation".--[Official Report, 18/10/99; col. 920.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-22_para5"></a>
That was the first of four reasons that he gave for rejecting the amendment, which I am moving again today. It provides for a right of appeal to an adjudicator in cases where a decision is made by the Home Secretary to make a deportation order following a recommendation of a criminal court.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para6"></a>With respect, a criminal court is not the forum in which to deal with immigration matters. Factors that need to be considered when arriving at a decision to deport may only be put before the court to the extent that they are covered by evidence given in connection with the offence on which the person is being tried. Those working in the criminal justice system are not familiar with immigration law. Most do not have any expertise in the field. Indeed, Part V of the Bill before us is predicated on the assumption that we need to identify solicitors who have the capacity to engage in immigration casework.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para7"></a>Unfortunately, not only criminal practitioners have little experience of immigration cases. That observation applies also to judges when passing sentences in the criminal courts. I refer noble Lords to Regina v. Rodney [1998] INLR 118 in the Court of Appeal when the court considered an appeal against the making of a recommendation. In that case, counsel for the Crown stated as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Mr. Van De Bijl, who has helped the court, from the Crown's point of view, says that in his experience judges frequently tack on a recommendation for deportation to a sentence of imprisonment without giving some reasons because it is a subsidiary matter".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-22_para8"></a>
It is a not a matter that receives proper consideration by the criminal court. It is often thought that, on completion of the sentence, the matter will fall to be determined by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para9"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, when stating his reasons for rejecting the amendment on Report, elided these matters. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"To have a Court of Appeal recommendation reviewed and possibly overturned by an adjudicator or even a tribunal would seem inappropriate".--[Official Report, 18/10/99; col. 920.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-22_para10"></a>
However, that is not the recommendation which would be overturned by the adjudicator. If Amendment No. 30 is accepted, the court will pass <P>


<a name="column_795"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 795</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sentence and if that sentence includes a recommendation for deportation, the person serves the sentence of imprisonment and then, at the end of the sentence, the Secretary of State shall consider whether to accept the recommendation for deportation. The reason why he does that only at the end of the sentence is of course because the circumstances may have changed. The person may have been in prison for two years. His family circumstances and the conditions in his country of origin may have changed, and therefore a decision on whether to deport is not the same as a decision on whether to recommend deportation. I believe that that point was overlooked by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, when replying on the last occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para11"></a>If we accept that it is right that there should always be an appeal against a recommendation to deport, then the amendment should be inserted into the Bill. It provides that when a person reaches the end of a prison sentence, the Secretary of State shall consider the new circumstances that then obtain. If he makes a decision to deport a person, that person has the same right to appeal against it as anyone else. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, when we started this process following the White Paper--it seems like a very long time ago--there was a proposal for a one-stop appeal. I thought that that was a good proposal. It seemed to be a good idea that all the matters in dispute should be taken into account in a single appeal, both to ensure that everything was considered in the round as opposed to individual pieces being taken in different tribunals at different times and because that would speed up the process. An important aim of the White Paper was to speed up the process. However, as we have gone through all the various details of the Bill, it seems to me that the one-stop appeal has frayed at the edges. I shall not say that it has disappeared altogether, but it is fraying. These amendments would help to boost the idea of a one-stop appeal with everything being considered at the same appeal. For that reason, I have some sympathy with the spirit that lies behind the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-22_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cope, for those words. I should like to revert to the amendments and ask the Government to explain to the House why they believe that their amendments assist us in achieving a one-stop appeal. We have always understood the Government's purpose in seeking a one-stop appeal to be the avoidance of the need for a series of separate appeals of the kind that has plagued them for several years and indeed plagued their predecessors. If there is to be a one-stop appeal--we have always supported that idea--that appeal, as the noble Lord, Lord Cope, pointed out, has to be able to consider all the circumstances. To limit it simply to looking at the technical correctness of a decision made by the <P>


<a name="column_796"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 796</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Secretary of State will not adequately address the question of the removal of the asylum seeker or his ability to stay in this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para12"></a>In the period between the first hearing and the process of appeal some circumstances may have changed. Perhaps I may give two obvious examples. In the case of two Commonwealth countries, Pakistan and Nigeria, over a short period one of those countries has moved from being a democracy to being a dictatorship and the other has moved from being a dictatorship to being a democracy. Therefore, the relevant considerations as to whether someone seeking asylum should be deported have changed totally in a short period. Those are the kinds of issues, as well as personal issues--someone getting married or having a child--that should be considered at the final process of appeal so that there cannot be further reversions to judicial review or other appeals, with the process thereby being extended as it has been so often in the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para13"></a>We should strongly support that, but only if the adjudicator is able to look at all the considerations that arise; for example, compassionate circumstances, the situation in the country to which the person concerned would otherwise be returned, and so on. We think that only if all the matters relevant to the question of whether the person should remain in the UK can be considered by that appeal can it be genuinely described as meeting the promise of the White Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para14"></a>The White Paper referred to the new appeal as "comprehensive". It said that there would be a single comprehensive right of appeal and that that should lead to finality. We find all of that very attractive. What we are troubled by is what the Government themselves seem to be doing in somewhat weakening the process of the one-stop appeal--trying to limit it, trying to constrain it and trying to limit what the adjudicator can actually consider. Therefore, we should like to know why the Government do not seem willing to support the point of view that we are expressing in these amendments--the three amendments in my name and the other amendments--which is that the one-stop appeal should have complete scope to deal with all considerations: both the past technical correctness of the Secretary of State's decision and the circumstances that affect the asylum seeker at the moment the appeal is being considered. If that happened, we believe that the ideal of a one-stop appeal could be met and the Government would avoid a great many of the problems which they have had to encounter in the past. We should like to inquire why the Government have not been able to embrace these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-22_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, whatever result this clutch of amendments, if passed, might bring about, a one-stop appeal is certainly not one of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para15"></a>I shall deal, first, with Amendment No. 30, which was moved by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. The government amendments are Amendments Nos. 31, 32, 33 and 34. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams of <P>


<a name="column_797"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 797</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Crosby, spoke to Amendments Nos. 35, 36, 37 and 71. I am speaking on the basis that no other noble Lord wishes to intervene.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para16"></a>Far from providing a one-stop appeal, the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, would do completely the opposite. The noble Lord's amendment would confer a further avenue of appeal on convicted persons who have been given notice of a decision to deport following the recommendation of a court. There is no such right in the 1971 legislation and I cannot find any good reason for introducing one. In the situation of which the noble Lord spoke, the sentencing court--this is not someone who has come here applying for asylum but someone with a criminal conviction--considers the circumstances and makes a recommendation for deportation. The Secretary of State then reconsiders the circumstances in full, providing his review. If his review is not fair, it can be overturned at judicial review. The convicted person--someone convicted of a crime--has a right of appeal against the sentence itself through the criminal justice system; that is, the Court of Appeal Criminal Division. Furthermore, no person who has a ground for making a human rights or asylum claim is disadvantaged because such a claim will, if refused, attract a separate right of appeal under the appropriate clause of the Bill. Whatever else the amendment does, I say again--I hope courteously--it does not produce a one-stop appeal.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para17"></a>Amendments Nos. 35 and 36, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, would enable immigration appellants to bypass the one-stop system by making fresh applications direct to an adjudicator. The purpose of Clauses 74(3) and 74(4) is to set out the distinction which exists in case law, but is not apparent from the 1971 legislation, between immigration appeals and asylum appeals. The point of an immigration appeal is to review the decision which has been taken. The evidence to be considered must relate to that specific decision. The adjudicator has no part in considering what amounts to a fresh application which has not been considered by the Secretary of State. In any event, the appellant will have had the opportunity to raise further matters for the Secretary of State's consideration when invited to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para18"></a>The Court of Appeal has ruled that asylum cases are different. For the purposes of this clause, we have included claims under Article 3 of the convention on human rights. The basis of an asylum appeal is that removal pursuant to the decision on the claim would be contrary to the 1951 convention, not that the Secretary of State's decision was wrong. In these cases, which look forward to an event in the future, it has been held that the adjudicator must consider all the evidence available to him. In asylum cases, the situation in the country of origin is generally the main element of the evidence. That situation may change between decision and appeal. The Home Office constantly monitors general situations in countries of origin and is therefore able to submit the latest information without delay.
<P>


<a name="column_798"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 798</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para19"></a> We have looked before at a variant of Amendment No. 71. Sub-paragraph (4A), taken with sub-paragraph (4B), would require an adjudicator to allow an appeal in the case of a published concession as if that concession was in the Immigration Rules. We have been considering the question of concessions for some time, as was explained earlier, and we have stated that we shall give adjudicators the power that the amendment proposes. But we plan to do that by reviewing, updating and rationalising the concessions and then incorporating them in the Immigration Rules. That has the benefit of empowering adjudicators to consider the matters now covered by concessions, and of empowering Parliament with some control over those concessions. After all, the point of the Immigration Rules is to set out,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the practice to be followed in the administration of the Immigration Acts regulating entry into and stay of persons in the United Kingdom".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-22_para20"></a>
Sub-paragraph (4C) would in effect make the adjudicator a first-instance decision-maker. We do not think that that can be right.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-22_para21"></a>I now turn to government Amendments Nos. 31 to 34. Amendments Nos. 31 to 33 are drafting improvements to Clause 70 and have no effect on the meaning. They transfer the phrase, "could reasonably", from the first line of Clause 70(2)(a) to the beginning of each of the two options that follow. Amendment No. 34 is a correction consequential upon a government amendment agreed by this House on Report: we combined two clauses into what is now Clause 74.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that he could see no good reason for including this amendment in the Bill. Why then did the Government see fit to include the provision in the first instance? I often think that governments include provisions in Bills for which there is no good reason, but this is the first time I have heard a plain admission from a Minister on the Floor of the House that they have actually done so. The Minister has argued that the provision was not in the 1971 Act. I seem to remember, when I first came to this House, speaking and voting against a great many of the provisions in the 1971 Act. That does not seem a very good argument either.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para0"></a>On Report, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, did not explain, when I asked him to do so, why the Government, who in their wisdom included this provision in the Bill in the first instance and kept it there throughout the discussions they had with the agencies, subsequently withdrew it. The reasons given by the noble and learned Lord were wholly spurious. He did not attempt to address my argument that the criminal system had no competence to deal with immigration matters, and that criminal lawyers and judges were wholly ignorant of the immigration system--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may respond. It is not right to suggest that sentencing judges are wholly ignorant of their powers. What they are doing is, I repeat, sentencing someone following a <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>criminal conviction. That is a different kind of exercise to the one we have been considering throughout most of the passage of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may refer the noble and learned Lord to the remarks of Lord Justice Simon Brown in the Adimi case. The noble Lord has heard these quotations many times and is probably familiar with the judgment. Lord Justice Simon Brown said that it was a "striking fact", acknowledged by the respondents, that,

If refugees can be so let down by the criminal justice system, what chance has anyone else who is liable to immigration control?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para3"></a>There is good reason for including the amendment in the Bill. Sentencing courts may well be able to consider the circumstances of the defendant at the time. But, as I explained in moving the amendment, we are talking about two different events. We are talking about what happens in the criminal court when a person is sentenced, and the position, possibly several years afterwards, when the Secretary of State comes to consider that recommendation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para4"></a>Many criminal practitioners are totally unaware of the fact that there is no appeal against the decision and that the Secretary of State almost automatically upholds the recommendations made by the criminal court. The last chance that a person has is to appeal against the sentence, which is by no means the same as appealing against a decision to deport when the circumstances may be wholly different. My noble friend Lady Williams of Crosby pointed to the situation in two countries where conditions changed overnight. That might well make a great deal of difference to a person from one of those countries who has been sentenced by a court of law. By the time the Secretary of State comes to examine the recommendation to deport, the government in a country of origin may have wholly changed. In one case cited it was for the better; and in the other it was for the worse.

The noble and learned Lord also recognised that circumstances could change. However, it remains unclear to me how, without amendments along the lines of mine, it would be possible for an adjudicator to consider issues that had arisen after the Secretary of State's first decision and before the decision to deport or return the immigrant to the country from which he came. I do not refer to ECHR cases or cases under the refugee convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para13"></a>It may be that the Home Office has the information that is needed. However, I am still not clear what happens if the compassionate factors that exist in cases where the White Paper promised that they would be taken into account can be taken into account unless, at the appeal, such matters can be part of the general consideration given to the case that has been made. Given the basis of the legislation, including the Minister's amendment, I do not understand how it would be possible to do that. That seems to me to force people into claiming asylum or claiming ECHR status when they have no entitlement to it because there seems to be no other way in which compassionate factors or changes in the country or origin can be fully taken into account. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord can reassure me. So far, he has not done so. I beg to move.

<A NAME="91102-23_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Northbourne </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what they consider to be the role of fathers in the family and in the rearing of children, whether they believe that role to be important, and what they are doing to support men in their role as fathers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the enormous response to this debate has caused a ridiculous situation in regard to the time available to speakers, for which I apologise, although I am not responsible. I hope that the Government will note the response and perhaps give time for a proper debate on this subject in the next Session, whether or not I am here to speak in it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para18"></a>It is a particular pleasure and delight to me that my noble kinsman, Lord Hood, is to make his maiden speech in the debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para19"></a>I rise to ask the Government a deceptively simple question: what is the role of fathers in our society today? Fifty years ago, that question would not have been worth asking. The role of a father was to protect and provide for his family, to love and cherish them, and to set a good example to his children. Some failed; some cheated; some died young--but for tens of thousands of years the responsibilities of fatherhood were clearly understood. Men developed strength and skill to fulfil them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para20"></a>The same is not true today. Advances in technology have created a situation in which fewer jobs rely on physical strength, endurance or courage. After 50 years of relative peace, the demand for protection has fallen away. There is less demand for "brawn" and more demand for "brain". That is good news for many of your Lordships, but bad news for young men who have no education or training.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para21"></a>Social attitudes have also changed. Today most women want a career or job and also to bring up a family. These changes, good in themselves, bring with them two problems: young men with no role in their families and families without fathers. Today we are creating an underclass of young men who are detached from the socialising obligations of the family, who believe that they are unfairly excluded from the opportunities of the consumer society and who see no role for themselves in the legitimate economy or family.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para22"></a>A recent report entitled Leading Lads by Adrienne Katz at Oxford highlights the problem. That is a study of the attitudes of 1,500 young men across the country. She divided these young men into the "can do" boys--approximately the top 25 per cent--a fairly large middle group and, at the bottom of the pile, a group of about 12 per cent whom she categorised as "no-can-do" boys. She reports that among the "no-can-do" boys are many who are,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"uncertain about their responsibilities and depressed about their future".

<a name="column_802"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 802</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Most of these "no-can-do" boys have grown up rejecting education and now have little or no training and no prospect of a decent job. They will father children and then will either be rejected by the mother as a useless or violent partner or drift off because they feel that they have no fulfilling role in their own families.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para24"></a>The seriousness of this situation should not be under-estimated. Here are some of the boys speaking. Jake aged 14 says:
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para27"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para28"></a>Many young men today do not behave responsibly because they do not see anything for which they need to be responsible.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para29"></a>The first problem is young men. The second problem is young families without fathers. We have created a society in which far more children than ever before are brought up in families without fathers. The percentage of children who grow up in lone parent households has trebled since 1968 from 6 per cent to 22 per cent.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para30"></a>Without in any way being judgmental or critical of lone mothers, who often do a tremendous job, let us look at some of the disadvantages from which they and their children suffer. Single parent families are poorer. Children who grow up in poverty in turn suffer multiple disadvantage. Sixty-five per cent of children in single parent families grow up in poverty compared with only 24 per cent of children in two-parent families. Children who live in lone parent families have a 79 per cent chance of being in the bottom 30 per cent of income distribution. Single parents have no one to share the work, responsibility and fun of bringing up a child; often they are lonely and stressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para31"></a>Children in single parent families enjoy less good health. Many studies show that for children of young lone mothers there is significantly greater likelihood of infant mortality, child ill health and risk of accidents.

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para34"></a>Many single parents do a heroic job. Some of their children achieve their full potential, but the odds are stacked against them. The Government are addressing the issue by encouraging lone mothers to get into work. I do not believe that that addresses the root of the problem. The root of the problem is a generation of young men, some of whom are uneducated, untrained, unemployable, unsocialised and unwanted. It is on that group that I want to focus in the few moments that remain to me.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para35"></a>I believe that there are steps that the Government can take. I believe that in this country there is a need for us to change our image of masculinity. Small boys need to learn in primary school that it is not "uncool" to learn and that school work is not only for girls. This means male role models in boys' lives: fathers, grandfathers, football heroes, teachers--men who show that they value school learning for men. It means more learning in the family and the engagement of fathers in schools; and it also means more suitably trained male teachers in primary schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para36"></a>In secondary schools and beyond we need to recognise that many young men need to build their self-confidence through pride in their physical strength, endurance, courage and loyalty. Those are characteristics that have evolved over countless generations by natural selection for a role that no longer exists. Sport, adventure training, sailing, mountaineering and other challenges should be made available to all young men who want them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para37"></a>One mother to whom I spoke recently about the role of young men said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The job for boys is to change the world".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-23_para38"></a>
We need opportunities for active citizenship. We also need millennium volunteers. Perhaps for those who cannot afford to volunteer we need a one-year residential training and service option with a basic wage--a programme centred on personal development and community service, not war. In return young men must learn the need for and the advantages and rewards of gentleness and kindness in the family, how to share responsibility for bringing a child into the world and its upbringing and how to help build a home for it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para39"></a>I argue that a young mother with a child is better off with a father helping her. Fathers are happy and more stable if they have a role to play. The Government should give just as much help to fathers, including prospective fathers, to get into work as they currently give to lone mothers. To do so will be a very good investment. Social security benefits to fatherless families today cost the taxpayer &#163;4 billion a year.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para40"></a>As we move into the 21st century has not the time come for us as a society to try to work out some shared values about our civic rights and responsibilities, in particular the rights and responsibilities of being a father? There are some things about which we cannot make laws but which are none the less critical to the welfare of children and to the common good. For example, what values about fatherhood will be taught in the new PSHE syllabus in schools? Will boys and girls receive clear messages about the needs of children, that fathers have a role in families, that children are likely to have a better chance if mothers and fathers bring them up together in a loving family, and that in an age of effective contraception there is no excuse for a man to bring a child into the world unless he has made the commitment to love and care for it for 18 years or more? A child is not a toy.

I also thank my noble kinsman Lord Northbourne for giving me this opportunity to make my maiden speech on such an important issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para43"></a>Good parenting is so fundamental to the progress of society throughout the generations that it is taken for granted. It is only when it is absent that one realises the time, effort and resources required to instil what good parenting should have provided. The role of the father is half the picture but one that may not acquire full focus until rather later than that of the mother when what might be described as the maternity phase is over. For a father, even in a stable family unit, the first phase may not be hugely rewarding, but he can justify his role by being able to provide. It is much more difficult for a young man who cannot play this role and whose family is likely to be as well off whether or not he is there.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para44"></a>If the family splits, or was never a proper family at all, the odds against the father playing any part in the child's upbringing mount considerably. As a lawyer specialising in divorce, I have seen how, even in middle-class or educated families, to be an assiduous but absent father requires huge stamina. There may be friction with the mother for any number of reasons. Periods of contact are often contrived and artificial. Sadly, a father who remains in contact is likely to pay more in child maintenance than the one who does not. And if the parents were never married in the first place, an application to the court for the grant of parental responsibility will often be required. For a father unaware of the importance of his role, the decision to walk away for good is an easy one. And so the cycle can be repeated.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para45"></a>I have for many years been a volunteer lawyer at the legal advice centre at Toynbee Hall. I have seen many young men with many different legal difficulties to whom the fact that they have fathered children appears entirely incidental to their existence. I believe it is significant that in all the time since the passing of the Children Act I have never once been asked to advise on how parental responsibility can be obtained if the mother is not consenting to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para46"></a>I am the father of four young children. My eldest son is going through the phase of realising that his father does not know and cannot do everything. I am finding this process rather more difficult than he is, but I consider it essential, if society is to progress, that our children are able to learn from us what we do know so that they may acquire for themselves what we do not.

<A NAME="91102-23_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, it falls on me on behalf of the whole House to congratulate the noble Viscount, Lord Hood, on his excellent maiden speech. He hails from a family with a significant naval history, and, as he mentioned, has a continuing career as a divorce lawyer. It is ironic that I probably cannot say that we look forward to hearing from him often--but I cannot foretell the results on Friday. Nevertheless, the House has benefited today from his experience and the noble Viscount can take heart from the fact that he took the opportunity that he was briefly allowed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para47"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is to be congratulated on bringing the vulnerable position of fathers to our attention. Young men are facing dilemmas as to their very purpose in being. Women are finding their place in the world and not before time. Unfortunately, this advance seems to be at the expense of young men. This is not a call for women to rein back, but rather a call for men to find a way forward into a more, I suspect, androgynous future.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para48"></a>The expectation of the supposedly macho job in the steel works, ship yard and coal mine is over. Families must redirect their aspirations for their sons from broadly engineering work into the available work, which in Scotland is likely to be in electronics or a service industry. Since 1994, women have dominated the Scottish labour market. Men certainly make up the majority of full-time workers, but some women are doing work for which, it seems, men will not get out of bed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para49"></a>Clearly, government cannot be held solely responsible for that. The family, both nuclear and extended, has a major role to play. Families need to sharpen up on how they encourage--or, often, discourage--their children about education and training. The take-up of higher education in Scotland is good, exceeding the UK average. Government need to strengthen "low level" training courses and schooling.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para50"></a>The boys of today must be encouraged to see learning and training as being manly, and not just for girls. Men must establish a new equilibrium with women. Until the parents are sorted, the children will not receive the lead they need.

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para51"></a>Secondly, I pay tribute to my husband who has always been such a special father to our children. He shares many of my father's attributes combined with an enormous amount of patience. Nothing is ever too much trouble for him.

<A NAME = "91102-23_para52"></a>Thirdly, I wish to speak, not surprisingly, about war widows. Their children have been suddenly deprived of the blessing of a father. Some of these ladies would like to remarry but are nervous of doing so because it would deprive them of the pension to which their husbands contributed during their lives. They would like to give their children a chance of a second father. My noble friend Lord Northbourne made this very point in our debate last week. Noble Lords felt so strongly on the issue that they sent the amendment back to the other place.

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para54"></a>I must declare an interest as I was involved in the preparation of the Government's consultative document, Supporting Families. That document recognised that family structures are today more complicated than a few decades ago. Any development of public policy on the role of fathers has to take account of those new realities, and this, I believe, the Government are doing.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para55"></a>The critical issues for many fathers--and indeed mothers--are better financial support for families through measures like the working families' tax credit, better services and support for parents, programmes like New Deal, which tackle unemployment, family-friendly employment practices that help parents achieve a better balance between home and work, parental leave in early years, and measures which strengthen adult relationships. Those larger measures help fathers fulfil their roles in modern society.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para56"></a>We know that the single most effective way of helping boys and young men is encouraging the involvement of their fathers. Boys who have no contact with their fathers are statistically more likely to be violent, get hurt, get into trouble and do less well at school. The research evidence on that is overwhelming. It means that we have to look critically at father-child contacts when adult relationships break down. We know that large numbers of non-resident fathers lose contact with their children within five years. That is why it has been so important for the Government to tackle the disaster of the Child Support Agency. Not only will this reduce parental conflict and bring more money into families through a simplified formula; it will also give incentives for non-resident fathers to stay in regular contact with their children. I believe that we need to go further by expanding contact centres where non-resident fathers may see their children.

He is, if I may say so, a good example of a hereditary Peer who has great knowledge of education and social work. He is an expert in this field, and it is right that he should draw attention to one of the most important and serious issues in social policy today: the role of fathers. He is right in what he said and I agree with everything he said today.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para58"></a>In the short time available, I should like to make two points. First, we live in a world in which men, curiously enough, are now downgraded. I have spent much of my life trying to help and support women into top jobs and other jobs. Now I feel that I should do the reverse and support men. Statistics show that boys do less well than girls in tests at age 11. They fall behind girls in the GCSE examinations. They barely hold their own at A-level. They are more likely to leave school without any qualifications and to be unemployed. Finally, they are far more likely to turn to crime and find themselves in court.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para59"></a>The issue should worry us all and the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is a real one. One of the prime causes is that there are families without fathers. The importance of the role of the father cannot be overestimated.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para60"></a>The second issue to which the Government should address themselves is what exactly they will include in the new curriculum changes on citizenship and personal, social and health education. Unless they address the importance of the role of the father; the required responsibility; the need for boys to have a role model; the importance of boys receiving a good education; and of boys accepting their responsibilities, we shall see nothing more than a continuation of the catalogue of disasters which is affecting boys.

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para61"></a>All fathers want to be good fathers, but what is meant by the phrase "a good father"? There are three elements. He has to be a good husband; he has to set a good example; and he has to be a good teacher. Tomorrow, my wife and I will have been married for 68 years. She was once asked whether she had ever thought of divorcing me and she replied, "No, but <P>


<a name="column_808"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>sometimes of murdering him!". I do not know whether that qualifies me as a good husband, but that is my record.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para62"></a>Perhaps we should take examples. My father died a war hero, leading his brigade into certain death at Gallipoli. I, in my youthful excitement, tried to follow his example. I joined the Army as a private before the war and very soon was invalided out with a nervous breakdown. That example did not quite work out.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para63"></a>My father's final words were delivered to someone called Fred Cripps, brother of Stafford Cripps who told me about it. My father said, "I wish you would stop ducking, Fred. The men don't like it. It doesn't do any good.". That at least has remained; I tried to avoid ducking.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para64"></a>As regards training, we have wonderful proof of what it can do. In my eyes, leaving out the Church, present company, my relatives and some of my closest friends, the Queen is the greatest woman alive. Do your Lordships know what her secret is? She said, "I have been well trained.". Her father trained her, so he was a great father.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-23_para65"></a>Those are a few points. When all is said and done, the good father is a loving father and every father here tries to live up to that standard.

<A NAME="91102-24_spnew0"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear, hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank my noble friend Lord Northbourne for initiating tonight's debate. As he said, the number of people who have applied to speak in the debate, and the brevity with which we have to make our remarks, illustrate the need for a longer debate at some future time.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para0"></a>It is a staggering reality that some 800,000 children in this country have no contact with their fathers. Anyone familiar with areas of urban deprivation will know that there can be whole streets and urban estates where father figures are absent. About one in four of our children experience their parents' divorce; one-third lose touch with one parent immediately after separation; and another third lose touch with one parent within five years.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para1"></a>Part of the cause of that has been the move towards easier divorce and the ideology that argues that lone parenthood is a desirable present and future state. Fertility treatments which seek to exclude men, other than as donors, further degrade fatherhood. I hope that we shall give that aspect longer-term consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para2"></a>Absent fathers have had a threefold effect on the state. Let us take, for instance, the debate on the green belt. It is not necessary to build more houses because <P>


<a name="column_809"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 809</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of an increase in the population; it is necessary because there are many more households following the massive increase in the number of broken families and the 43 per cent divorce rate. The effect on the Exchequer is that it now costs more to support broken families than it does to support even the unemployed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para3"></a>Let us examine the effect on the children. You can divorce your spouse, but you cannot divorce your children. Fatherhood and responsibility to one's children continues.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para4"></a>Being unable to perform their role as fathers also has an effect on men. In the United States, for example, single men are six times more likely to be imprisoned than married men. Marriage, stability and family life can work wonders for people in that situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para5"></a>Unless we make it abundantly clear that family stability is crucial for children and for society generally; unless we acknowledge that ideally a child should have both a mother and a father; and unless we reaffirm the importance of fathers in child-rearing, we risk a further long-term social collapse and civic disaggregation of society.

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para6"></a>The Asian culture attaches enormous importance to the role of fathers in the family and in the rearing of children. It is the father's responsibility to provide guidance, support and protection as well as giving love, care and affection to the family.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para7"></a>In Islam, the father is charged with shouldering all the financial obligations of the whole family. He is under a legal obligation with regard to the maintenance of his family. The Qur'an says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Men are maintainers of women with the bounties which God has bestowed more abundantly on some of them than on others and with what they may spend out of their possessions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-24_para8"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para9"></a>A father's responsibility begins long before the birth of the child. He has to provide psychological and moral support to his wife, showing more love and affection during her pregnancy. The Qur'an says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Wife and children are comfort of your eyes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-24_para10"></a>
The Prophet said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Of all that a father can give to his children the best is their good education and training".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-24_para11"></a>
However, there are also rights with responsibilities in Islam. While it is the duty of the father to provide, the children's responsibilities are to show kindness and respect and to speak with affection.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para12"></a>My experience of being a father is to provide money, take responsibility, deal with crises and act as a bank manager who does not receive repayments of loans. But the love and affection that I receive in return is unconditional and is probably the best experience of my life.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para13"></a>Sadly, there are many Muslim and Asian parents who have lost control within their own families. The gap between the first generation and the second is <P>


<a name="column_810"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 810</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>widening. There is mistrust and a lack of understanding, of tolerance and of the patience to understand each other. The gap in some cases has caused enormous problems in the community.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para14"></a>Perhaps I my conclude by saying that the vast majority of Asian parents are very responsible and provide excellent care, support and guidance, and particularly financial support to their families.

<P>
<A NAME="91102-24_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Brentford: </B>   My Lords, I warmly congratulate my noble friend Lord Hood and thank the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. I once watched a film of a middle-aged Peter Pan, I believe played by Robin Williams. Before the main actors fly off to Never-Never land, Peter Pan promises to spend time with his children over Christmas. But a business deal took priority and the children missed out on his time.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para15"></a>Perhaps "Dad has no time for me" is one of the most poignant complaints of our children today. If a father is reading a book at bedtime to his children and the telephone rings, do the children or the telephone receive priority? Fathers' relationships, particularly with boys, depend on spending time together, talking through their worries and interests, their sport and education.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para16"></a>The Government are responding commendably to the increasing concern in the country for fathers' involvement with their children, particularly sons. The right honourable Harriet Harman was right in saying to fathers, "Your children need not just your money. They need you." There is a large correlation, as already mentioned, between boys in trouble and the low involvement of their fathers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para17"></a>I warmly commend parenting courses, but plead with the people advertising them to be positive to fathers; for example, to say, "Please come as caring parents for the sake of your children." Parenting courses for fathers should be for men only and led by a man. If there is a hint in the advertisement that the course is for better parenting, or for problem parents, I suggest that men will run a mile. I look forward to hearing what the Government's plans are to encourage fathers, and particularly teenage fathers, to be involved long-term with their children.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para18"></a>In conclusion, I say to fathers, "If you want the best for your child, love the mother."

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para19"></a>The principle aim of the youth justice system is to prevent offending by children and young people. The influence of parents is a key determinant in achieving that aim. We know a good deal about the risk factors which can result in criminal behaviour. They include poverty, poor housing, drugs and alcohol misuse, peer pressure, truancy and exclusion from school. But they include also poor parenting, harsh and inconsistent discipline, and lack of parental supervision.
<P>


<a name="column_811"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 811</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para20"></a>A 1995 Home Office study revealed that 42 per cent of children who received low or medium levels of supervision offended, compared with only 20 per cent where the level of supervision was high. The same research showed that the quality of the relationship between parent and child was critical and that offenders were more likely to have a poor relationship with their father than with their mother. It has been shown also that children are protected against some of the risk factors to which I referred earlier if they are able to form strong affectionate bonds with their parents.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para21"></a>Helping fathers to develop good parenting skills is therefore an effective way of ensuring that the small problems in a child's development are identified and addressed, rather than growing into major difficulties for child, family and community. Within our force we are working with our youth offending teams to develop such initiatives, helping parents to increase their self-awareness and self-confidence and improving their capacity to support and nurture children.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para22"></a>We are discussing this issue at a time when there is renewed and welcome interest in mentoring and befriending schemes, where the mentor helps young people to achieve their potential through coaching, explaining, listening and guiding. Such schemes cannot diminish the importance of our role as fathers, but their aims are ones to which we too can honourably aspire.

<A NAME="91102-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sheppard of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, not for the first time, the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has done your Lordships' House a major service in introducing this debate. I shall try to pick up just one of the points he made, which relates to the title of the debate, namely, what the Government are doing to support men.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para23"></a>If young men are to accept the sort of responsibility about which we have been talking, they need to respect themselves and have self-confidence. All through this century, women have had to fight for their place and their self-respect. In wide areas that I know in Liverpool and London, generations of working class men have been able to hold their head high because they have been willing to sell their strength, their readiness to work in a gang, and their readiness and ability to support their family.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para24"></a>As other noble Lords have said, those types of jobs have gone away. In many big estates around Liverpool and in the borough of Knowsley, the figures, certainly until two years ago, showed that 45 per cent of all children were growing up in a home where no one was in work. The story was often one of a third generation unemployed. It is a huge mountain for a young man to climb to believe that he is needed and that he matters, to find that self-respect and to break out of the destructive circle of generations without work.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para25"></a>The Government have an important first priority in saying that the best way out of poverty is to find a full-time job. The New Deal is of the first possible <P>


<a name="column_812"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 812</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>importance. So far, so good; employment has gone well. We need to break down the statistics. I read the other day that the south east of England has perhaps only 1 per cent unemployment while areas such as Gateshead still have 9.8 per cent unemployment. The Government have done a great thing in naming poverty for what it is and establishing a social exclusion unit which has talked not only about the individually socially excluded, but of socially excluded communities. We need to focus on those, and to make sure over the years that bringing jobs to those communities does not depend solely on prosperity in the whole country, but that real jobs are brought into those communities through which young men can find self-respect.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-24_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords, so much of the destructive behaviour that I see among the socially excluded young people with whom I work becomes explicable when one knows the family situation from which it grows. Those who study child development tell us that good fathers are vital. Their relationship with the mother shows children how to be intimate themselves when they reach maturity. I could not agree more with the noble Viscount, Lord Brentford, that to do the best for your child, you must love your wife, or in accordance with the Koran's command, love and honour your wife.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para26"></a>Longitudinal studies of children from divorced parents show clearly a far higher incidence of divorce in the next generation. If we want to reduce rates of divorce and crime, drug abuse, rough sleeping, school truancy and academic failure, we must offer support to fathers, particularly those who were neglected or abused by their own parents. We cannot afford to continue having the highest divorce rate in Europe. We cannot afford to continue throwing money at the symptoms of family dysfunction rather than treating the cause.

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para27"></a>I must declare an interest. I am vice-chairman of the Lords and Commons Family and Child Protection Group, an all-party group made up of Members of both Houses, formed some years ago by parliamentarians worried by the repeated and vigorous attacks on the traditional family.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para28"></a>When the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill was introduced in 1990 by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the then Lord Chancellor, it was pointed out that the Bill could lead to the introduction of fatherless children. I remember well raising the issue in the early stages of the passage of the Bill and being told that that was certainly not the <P>


<a name="column_813"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 813</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>intention of the Bill. I replied that whether or not it was the intention of the Bill, it would certainly have that unfortunate effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para29"></a>The Heritage Foundation, based in Washington DC, produced a report in March 1995 entitled The Real Root Causes of Violent Crime: The Breakdown of Marriage, Family and the Community. The report concluded first, that, among other things, over the past 30 years, the rise in violent crime parallels the rise in families abandoned by fathers. Secondly, high crime neighbourhoods are characterised by high concentrations of families abandoned by fathers. Thirdly, the rate of violent teenage crime corresponds with the number of families abandoned by fathers. And, fourthly, the father's authority and involvement in raising his children are a great buffer against a life of crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para30"></a>Still across the Atlantic, the sociologist, David Papenhoe, writes that the decline of fatherhood is the major force behind the pressing problems of American society; namely, crime, teenage pregnancy, educational failure, drug abuse and the growing number of women and children in poverty.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para31"></a>Fatherless children are more likely to be abused by stepfathers or unrelated men in the family. That is why David Papenhoe says in Lost Fathers that in no society has the birth of children out of wedlock been the cultural norm: a concern for legitimacy is almost universal.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para32"></a>It was President Reagan who once affirmed that the family is the fundamental building block of society and that families without fathers are dysfunctional and contribute to the breakdown of law and order in this country.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-24_spnew8"></A><B> Lady Kinloss: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Northbourne is to be thanked for raising this important Question. In today's changing world the role of both parents in a family is changing, both here and across Europe. The Family Policy Studies Centre has examined the role of the world of work and family life. The father is often working longer hours and finding it difficult to balance work with his family's needs. Drawing on interviews and surveys within a group, the centre's study looks at families with different parental employment patterns to see whether there is a connection between work and the way in which fathers engage in everyday relationships with their family. The study shows the crucial importance still attaching to a father's role as provider by his partner and children, and identifies some of the problems fathers experience when they cannot meet that expectation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para33"></a>The National Children's Bureau has found that men's expectations of themselves as involved fathers are growing, especially when the mother is also working. The father is then taking greater responsibility for the children, often sharing the care of a sick child. At present there appears to be very little attempt to help fathers to reconcile work and family. Will the Minister say whether the Government are <P>


<a name="column_814"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 814</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>considering what help they can give to fathers to reconcile their work and the time spent with their families? Will he agree that one way would be to adopt father-friendly employment policies within a company which could benefit employers from the point of view of production and company loyalty?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para34"></a>Enabling fathers to have more satisfying relationships with their children helps to reduce their stress levels, improves their effectiveness at work and supports their relationship with their partner. That can lead to less employment disturbance and family disruption.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para35"></a>Will the Minister agree that the role of the father in a family is of equal importance to that of the mother? They can be equally good carers. In some cases that has proved to work when the father looks after the children while the mother works. That is very often the case when the father is unemployed.

<P>
<A NAME="91102-24_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, I know we are all grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, for initiating this debate. I add my congratulations to my noble kinsman Lord Hood on an excellent and, I may say, expert maiden speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para36"></a>This is time for essentials only. We have today an under-class--at times, one has to say, an under-gender. Several speakers have referred to this: the easy availability of sex, frequently the pressure of a successful career by the mother, and also the loose ties of marriage and partnership which young couples see all around them, frequently involving those whom they would otherwise naturally look to as role models. There is an all too easy temptation for men to walk away from it all, despite the best efforts of the Child Support Agency, prompting the frequently heard complaint from mothers that the men hold all the cards.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para37"></a>However, let us look at the other less depressing side. I hope that I am not in conflict statistically with the noble Lord, Lord Alton. A survey by the British Household Study Panel found that, despite the increased rate of family breakdown, more than eight fathers in 10 still live with all their biological children and seven in 10 do so with their first family. In many cases they are coping with all the difficulties to which I have referred or with the appalling discouragement and feelings of low esteem of unemployment--the feeling of guilt that they are unable to fulfil their responsibilities. I suggest that that is a peculiarly male concern, whether or not the mother is working and earning. Therefore, it is to those points that we need to address ourselves, just as much as to the errant and absentee fathers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para38"></a>I suggest that the media's portrayal of fathers as by and large feckless is not entirely accurate. A recent sample group survey showed that the interviewees wanted to be good fathers. But there is a great need for more support, particularly for the young fathers. It is an enormous challenge to the Government, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's remarks.

It has stimulated one of the most interesting debates in which I have had the pleasure of participating in the time that I have been in your Lordships' House. It has led to some wide-ranging comments. I am bound to say that, given that there are some 17 contributors to this debate, I could spend my entire time at the Dispatch Box answering all those points. I hope that your Lordships will forgive me if I do not manage to deal with all of them, or even the majority of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para39"></a>I should also like to pay tribute to the noble Viscount, Lord Hood, for his maiden speech, which was full of wisdom on the subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para40"></a>We in government see families as the building blocks of healthy communities. We also recognise that modern families take many forms and we work to support them, however they are made up. Last November we published the first ever government consultation document on family policy, Supporting Families.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para41"></a>Supporting Families emphasised the importance of the father's role in the family and in his children's upbringing. There can be many pressures on a man in his role as a father. He may not live with his children. He may feel torn, wanting to spend quality time with his children, yet working long hours to provide for them. We have been looking closely at the support available for fathers in the modern world and are helping them in a variety of ways. First among those is the dedicated support the Government are providing for families, and in particular for fathers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para42"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, will know, in the past year we have spent over &#163;1 million funding the work of organisations which provide support for families, including his own organisation. Over three years, &#163;7 million of grant funding is available for this purpose. Through this funding we are providing practical support on the ground for families, and creating models of good practice in family support which can then be disseminated around the country. We are supporting parents to be able to do a tough job to the best of their abilities. We have set up the National Family and Parenting Institute as an independent charity. In its first year it will map the parenting support available all over the country, right down to local level.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para43"></a>The Parenting Education and Support Forum, with which the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is associated, is doing valuable work to improve the standard of the parenting programmes available and is looking at accrediting them through a national training organisation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para44"></a>We are also giving &#163;1 million funding to Parentline Plus to expand its telephone helpline service for parents. That "listening ear" service will be available nationwide from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. It will provide information on a range of specific parenting problems, from bad behaviour to bullying.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para45"></a>We recognise that fathers are often less likely than mothers to access parenting support or this type of telephone helpline. Fathers may be put off seeking help and advice by stereotypes surrounding their role. They can feel hamstrung by feeling that as men they should not show weakness and should be able to provide for their families without asking for help.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para46"></a>To address these issues, we are funding Fathers Direct to work with Parentline Plus on the telephone helpline for parents. They will develop a marketing plan aimed at fathers to break down the barriers they feel prevent them accessing the helpline. They will then train the helpline's call takers to respond appropriately to fathers' needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para47"></a>That is just one example of the practical steps being taken to improve the support available for fathers. We are funding Fathers Direct to do more than just work on the telephone helpline. It will also provide information to fathers and highlight fathers' issues in public life. It is creating a website for fathers to provide information on fathers' groups and other resources. It will mount a media campaign to raise the profile of fatherhood. And it worked on the recently launched Bounty Guide to Fatherhood, the first practical guide of its kind for expectant fathers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para48"></a>Fathers Direct contributes to the Government's concerted effort to change the culture around parenting support. We want parents to view asking for help and support in their role as parents in a new light and to view it as a positive step, taken by a responsible parent for the good of the family, not as a sign of weakness or an admission of failure.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para49"></a>The Government alone cannot change that culture, but through the organisations that we fund we are making an important start. We fund several other projects which will make a real difference to the quality of support available for fathers, and their likelihood to take it up. In fact, 60 per cent of the family support grant funding this year was dedicated to projects which work to support fathers. I shall give you details of just a few of those projects.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para50"></a>NEWPIN has worked successfully with parents for years, and is now developing and disseminating support services for fathers. YMCA is being funded to disseminate an intriguing programme called "Dads and Lads" which uses sport to bring fathers and sons together. Dads take their sons to football training on a Saturday and, while there, engage in a parenting support programme based around sport.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para51"></a>The Thomas Coram Foundation is approaching fatherhood from another vital angle. It is working with young black men and men of ethnic minority, tackling their concerns about fatherhood and masculinity. Those young men have been in local authority care and may have suffered from the lack of an involved father figure in their lives.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para52"></a>That brings me to another important issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne: the current underachievement of some young men. There are, of course, many factors that contribute to that trend, and the Government are tackling the issue on several fronts. An important one is the role of the father, and <P>


<a name="column_817"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 817</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>indeed the whole family, in the lives of young men. By helping fathers we shall also benefit their children, particularly boys and young men, who benefit greatly from the involvement of a father figure in their lives.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para53"></a>The Leading Lads report, to which the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, referred, highlights how important it is for young men's self-esteem, their attitude to school and a range of other factors to have a highly involved male in their lives. That man need not be their biological father, but any older male who has a supportive, constructive and engaged relationship with the young man. The report says, and I quote,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Can-do people appeared in every type of family ... although there are more No-can-do boys living without their fathers than Can-do boys, family structure proved less important than the way people parent".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-24_para54"></a>
It is our hope that the family support measures that I have outlined will make a big difference in this area.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para55"></a>Another way of providing young men with such a highly involved male is through mentoring. That is already being trialled by the Youth Justice Board. I pay tribute to the work of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, in that respect. The Youth Justice Board is spending &#163;6.6 million on mentoring schemes which intervene in the lives of 10 to 17-year olds to prevent offending. Mentoring has proved extremely successful in improving the life chances of young men in the USA, especially those from lone-parent families.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para56"></a>Recent research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on Work and young men finds that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The nature of young men's underachievement is complex, and possibly less severe than some people may have feared".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-24_para57"></a>
I believe that the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, put his finger on the point. It continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Nevertheless, some men during the mid-1990s did experience problems securing paid employment."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-24_para58"></a>
The study found that young men who lived with their parents or family were less likely to be unemployed long term, and concluded that providing support to families is an effective tool in improving the employment prospects of young men.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para59"></a>The education maintenance allowances which are being piloted will give financial help to the families of 16 to 17-year olds who are improving their long-term prospects by staying in education or training past the age of 16. Many noble Lords made reference to the value and importance of education. We recognise that. As we all know, having a job or solid training is the best insurance against the sort of social exclusion that faces some young men. On this front, as the noble Lord, Lord Sheppard, said, the New Deal for Young People has helped over 84,000 young people into sustained employment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para60"></a>We believe that the holistic, multi-faceted approach to tackling the difficult issues that face young men will prove effective. In the same way, the steps that we have taken to support fathers go much wider than the specific, targeted measures I have mentioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para61"></a>Finance is a matter close to all our hearts, whether fathers or not. However, money worries can be a particular pressure on fathers. The new working families tax credit will make a real, appreciable and <P>


<a name="column_818"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 818</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>marked difference here, by guaranteeing families with one person in work a minimum income of &#163;200 per week.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para62"></a>Perhaps the next most pressing problem for those fathers in work is finding enough time to spend at home with their families. How many of us here this evening would rather be at home with our children as they enjoy their spare time or work on their homework? But we have to strike a balance between work and home. The Government are consulting widely with businesses on making family-friendly employment a reality. That does not mean putting a burden on business or being prescriptive about how employees manage their work and home commitments. We are collecting evidence of good practice and we are researching the best ways of implementing family-friendly working practices.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para63"></a>Already we have made a major advance in improving the work/home balance for parents. From 15th December this year, parents will be entitled to 13 weeks parental leave to be taken over the first five years of their child's life. For the first time fathers will be entitled to time off to care for their children. That includes non-resident fathers. That is a major step forward in recognising and lessening the conflicting pressures on fathers. The leave will be unpaid, but we have made sure that it will be made accessible to those on low incomes. Lone parents and couples who are in receipt of benefits such as the working families tax credit will be eligible for income support while they take parental leave. That is a real and progressive move forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para64"></a>For non-resident fathers, maintaining a good relationship with their children can be especially difficult. Time off work under the new entitlement to parental leave will help. We are working to reduce tensions which arise out of the payment of maintenance by non-resident fathers. The reform of the child support system announced this summer will make the system of maintenance payment both fairer and simpler.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para65"></a>We plan to introduce the new child support system as soon as possible, but we must ensure that it works effectively. We shall not repeat the mistakes of the current scheme. We need to introduce new legislation and a new IT system and we must be sure that those delivering the new scheme are well prepared. It will mean a radical change of culture and working practices in the Child Support Agency.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para66"></a>Nevertheless, there are radical improvements that we shall have to make to pave the way for reform. The CSA has already increased the number of staff who work on the client helpline and the number of hours the telephone service is available. By the end of the year the CSA will have significantly increased the number of locally-based staff who will be able to carry out face to face interviews and visit parents at home when appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para67"></a>The reform of the CSA encourages non-resident fathers to share the care of their children with the parents who have residential care. The present system does not do enough to recognise fathers' caring responsibilities.

<A NAME = "91102-24_para68"></a>We believe that all these measures taken together will make a real difference to the quality of fathers' lives and help them in their vitally important role within the family.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-24_para69"></a>Once again, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, for initiating this debate and for the work that his organisation carries out on and for families. As your Lordships can see from the initiatives that I have outlined, we in the Government are concerned with what we can do to support both families and fathers. Our economic and social policies address issues in all areas of fathers' lives and we shall continue to look at what we can do to help more. This debate has been most helpful and useful in informing that important work.

<A NAME = "91102-25_para2"></a>Proceedings after Third Reading resumed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-25_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell </B>   moved Amendment No. 38:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 91, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>REQUIREMENT TO STATE NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBER: PARTNERS OF ASYLUM-SEEKERS</B></center><BR>
(" . The Verification Project under section 19 of the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997 shall not be applied to the partners of asylum-seekers.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para3"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, this amendment deals with a rather complex piece of interaction between immigration, asylum and social security law. On advice from the DSS, I tabled this amendment on both this and the Welfare Reform Bill. I am not certain--and it is not certain--to which Bill it applies in the first instance. What we are all certain of is that it creates a need for dialogue.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para4"></a>I shall explain a little of the background to this matter. Section 19 of the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act is concerned with establishing the correct identities of benefit claimants. That Act requires that claimants should be prepared to produce their national insurance number. I confess, to my own shame as much as that of anyone else, that when we passed that Act we did not think about the effect on the partners of those required to produce national insurance numbers. Under the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, a requirement for identification is binding on the partner of the claimant as well as on the claimant. Where there is a marriage premium, a partner's premium or a child premium, the identity must necessarily be established.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para5"></a>That creates a problem when there are asylum seekers in this country waiting for some length of time for their claim to be heard. As others do, they tend to <P>


<a name="column_820"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 820</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>marry and on occasion they have families. We are not arguing about the asylum seeker as regards this amendment--he is taken out of the social security network--but the British-born partner of an asylum seeker resident in this country. I cannot see any reason why, when any of these Acts was passed, anyone in Parliament should have imagined that such a person would be disentitled to social security because he or she had married an asylum seeker. It makes the status infectious in some kind of way.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para6"></a>But what happens when he attempts to make a claim, for example, for housing benefit? He is required to produce his national insurance number, which he can do and does. He is also required to produce his partner's national insurance number, which very often the partner does not possess and is not in a position to obtain. So, like the asylum seeker, the partner of the asylum seeker is disentitled to ordinary benefits. That is happening regularly in various housing benefit offices around London and the south east. I am aware of a considerable number of cases. When we passed the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act, I do not believe that any of us intended that to happen, but it is what has happened.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para7"></a>I think it a good idea to do something to tidy up this matter. I am not quite certain what is the best thing to do. I am asking the Minister to put his head together with the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, and see whether between them they can work out a solution acceptable to all parties and compatible with the intention of Parliament. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl has been very economical in setting out the background to this matter. I believe that the same amendment was discussed at Third Reading of the Welfare Reform Bill. As the noble Earl has indicated, this amendment seeks to exempt all partners of asylum seekers from the requirement put on benefit claimants and their partners to provide sufficient information to allow their national insurance number to be traced or one allocated to them. If I have understood the noble Earl's amendment correctly, it is not limited to the exemption of partners who may be citizens of this country and is not referable at all to the country of origin.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para8"></a>The requirement was introduced under Section 19 of the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997. Benefit claimants have either to produce or to apply for a national insurance number. The aim of Section 19 obviously was to verify identity and to ensure that benefit went only to those entitled to it and those who could establish that they were the person they said they were.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para9"></a>I do not see that that is a harsh or unconscionable requirement on someone who is the partner of an asylum seeker. The asylum seeker himself or herself will have to apply. The noble Earl is troubled about the effect on the partner. I am sure that it is my obtuseness, but I cannot see any injustice or harshness in requiring the partner to do the same.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para10"></a>However, he has put the matter very moderately. I believe that essentially his invitation is to raise the question and invite the Home Office to liaise with my noble friend Lady Hollis to see whether or not there is some resolution to a problem which he has identified. On behalf of my Home Office colleagues I am perfectly happy to say that they will raise these questions with her. I do not believe that I can go further than that this evening. Indeed, I am not sure that the noble Earl expected me to do so. I shall not trespass on the patience of the House by simply repeating the full explanation which my noble friend Lady Hollis gave in answer to the noble Earl a few days ago.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-25_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for that reply. Perhaps I may briefly explain where I do see an injustice. It is not in the requirement to produce a national insurance number, but in the consequent disentitlement of somebody otherwise fully entitled to social security for not producing something which he is in no position to produce. It is the infectious use of disentitlement extending to those whom the asylum seeker may marry. That seems to me to be contrary to what I imagine was the intention of Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para11"></a>The noble and learned Lord is quite right. I did not expect him to go any further tonight. I accept his point about the drafting of my amendment. It never was my intention to press it to a Division. I did not have--and I may never have--the necessary knowledge to work out how the amendment should have been drafted to produce the desired effect. If they wish to do something about this matter, I am sure that the combined resources of the two departments will be able to find a satisfactory wording. If I have induced a serious consideration of this matter, I have achieved all that I wanted. I thank the noble and learned Lord formally and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="column_822"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 822</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para15"></a>The government amendments stem from the undertaking we gave at Report to hold back a set of provisions which we felt the Select Committee should examine. The regulation-making powers are all contained in the new schedule introduced by Amendment No. 72 which would replace Clause 96. We held back the remaining amendments, as was indicated at the time, because they contained references to the new schedule and could not be inserted until that schedule had been approved. Many are consequential drafting changes.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para16"></a>I explained on Report that the new regulation-making powers to be contained in the new schedule had a specific nature; that is, to amplify the powers to make regulations regarding the resources to be taken into account in determining whether or not an applicant is destitute or with resources at his disposal. They also make provision for a period of notice when an asylum seeker is required to leave the accommodation made available to him under Part VI.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para17"></a>The committee raised a question in relation to the scope of the powers conferred by paragraph 2(2). That is the import of Amendment No. 73. That power does no more than enhance powers already contained in the schedule which have been found acceptable in discussions both in this House and in another place. These are contained in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 2 of the schedule.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para18"></a>The power to which the committee has drawn attention is subsidiary to the principal power. The intention is that the new power will enable us to treat a person with assets of more than a given amount as not being destitute, except in exceptional circumstances. We could achieve the same end result by using the principal power, but the subsidiary power provides additional clarity which allows us to set out in legislation the exact threshold at which we would not regard someone as being destitute. The underlying concern is that an asylum seeker with several hundred pounds in his pocket at the time he approaches the Asylum Support Directorate for assistance should not be treated as destitute until he has used at least some of those resources and thus put himself below the threshold for destitution.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para19"></a>I should make it clear that we do not propose to use this power to exclude broad categories of genuinely destitute asylum seekers from access to the new support arrangements. I hope on that basis that the House will find the new power acceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para20"></a>Amendment No. 39 paves the way for the schedule. Amendment No. 42 deletes Clause 96 which is substituted by the new schedule.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para21"></a>Amendments Nos. 47 and 48 relate to Clause 116; Amendments Nos. 51 to 54 relate to Clause 119 and Amendment No. 55 relates to Clause 120. They all have a substantive effect. In each case, the effect of the amendment is to limit the extent to which the clauses on which they impact can exclude asylum seekers from access to various social services and health services assistance. At present, certain provisions in those clauses exclude a person who is subject to the restrictions under Clause 144--that is, someone who is <P>


<a name="column_823"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 823</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>subject to immigration control--from all access to the welfare services mentioned. We recognise that it is too broad an exclusion--a point made on a number of occasions by several noble Lords. Now, by virtue of the amendments, the restriction on access to those services would apply only where the asylum seeker's recourse to those provisions would be on the ground of destitution, and for no other reason. Thus, if an asylum seeker needs assistance under, say, the Social Work (Scotland) Act or the Mental Health (Scotland) Act by reason of his physical or mental condition, he will be granted access to those services.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para22"></a>The only effect of the amended clauses, therefore, is to prevent welfare legislation being used solely as a means of supporting destitute asylum seekers in preference to their having recourse to the arrangements under Part VI. The amendments mirror the provisions already contained in Clause 115 which the House has already accepted. I therefore commend them on that basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para23"></a>Amendments Nos. 64 and 65 are consequential, providing that the new support arrangements will commence when the first regulations have effect, which we intend to be 1st April 2000.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para24"></a>Amendment No. 84 extends to Scotland the free school meals provisions already in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para25"></a>I am obliged to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, for raising in her Amendment No. 41 the issue of asylum seekers who remain in the support system for more than six months. We are fully alive to the need for the speedy resolution of asylum applications, for the reasons I set out earlier this evening. We are taking a range of steps to speed up the process and clear the backlog.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para26"></a>As your Lordships are aware, we are not enormously entranced by the provisions in Clause 92, which was introduced on Report. But that is an argument that we have deployed substantially here and it may not find universal favour in the House of Commons.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para27"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, raised the question of those persons who have not had a final decision, through no fault of their own, within six months. I am able to reiterate that we have decided to introduce a discretionary payment to asylum seekers who stay in the support system through no fault of their own for more than six months. I can give a little more detail which I hope is acceptable. We believe that this payment, which would help to meet the cost of replacing essential items that had worn out, should be &#163;50 each for an asylum seeker and his or her dependants. It would be available as a "cash back" voucher, convertible into money, and would be in addition to the normal weekly support that will be made available to asylum seekers. If there is a small number of cases--I recognise that there may be--where a person remains in the support system for more than 12 months, a further payment will be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-25_para28"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness for raising that matter. I hope that my response now negates the necessity for her to press Amendment No. 41. I repeat <P>


<a name="column_824"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 824</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>my genuine thanks to her for raising the question and I hope that she is pleased that I have been able to give a more particularised response. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-26_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, first, as we indicated at the time, we were grateful for the Government's review of the exclusion from certain National Health Service services under, at that time, Amendment No. 118. We are grateful that the Government looked at that again and decided not to maintain that exclusion in the case of asylum seekers and those who come under the European Convention on Human Rights. I suspect that my noble friend Lord Goodhart will cover the issue of the definition of "destitution" on Amendment No. 73, so I shall not waste the time of the House by talking about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-26_para0"></a>In relation to Amendment No. 41, the noble and learned Lord has taken the step of ensuring that I do not waste my eloquence on desert air. I realise that the Government have taken a considerable step towards improving the situation that worried us; namely, that the original support system recognised that this provision would not make money available for the replacement of essential, durable goods. I cannot guarantee that there will not still be an effort to try to bring in a more generous support system, but I am most grateful for what the Government have done in this respect. Indeed, it goes at least some way towards meeting the point that I raised about the position of asylum seekers who remain here for some length of time.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-26_para1"></a>Sadly, for reasons that the noble and learned Lord outlined earlier in the debate, it may well be the case that people have to wait six months or more. The promises given by the Home Secretary, in all good faith back in June, cannot be completely held to because the kind of targets then given were, of course, dependent upon a continuing flow of asylum seekers at roughly the rate current at that time. I realise that that may well create problems. Nevertheless, I express my gratitude to the noble and learned Lord for everything except depriving me of the chance to give an eloquent speech.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, as my amendment forms part of this group, I think it might be convenient for the House if I were to speak now. The effect of Amendment No. 73 would be to leave out Paragraph 2(2) of the proposed new schedule to the Bill which is to be added by way of Amendment No. 72. That sub-paragraph states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The regulations may provide that in such circumstances (if any) as may be prescribed, a person is not to be treated as destitute for the purposes of section 93".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-26_para2"></a>
Clause 93 contains a definition of the word "destitution", which I need not go into. However, the point that worries me--one which also worried the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee--was that there cannot be any meaning to sub-paragraph (2), except that it will enable the Secretary of State under these regulations to treat as not being destitute someone who is in fact destitute. Otherwise, there would be no purpose behind the provision. If a person <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>is destitute, there is no need for a provision that says that he should be treated as such. Equally, if the person is not destitute, there is no need for a paragraph stating that he is to be treated as not being destitute.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-26_para3"></a>Therefore, one wonders what the provision is intended to achieve. The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General suggested that this might be necessary to cover, for example, the asylum seeker who comes to this country with several hundred pounds in his pocket. However, such a sum of money would surely represent assets which are available to him for the purposes of support within the meaning of sub-paragraph (1) of the new schedule. One might want to amend that subparagraph so that it would refer to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"assets of a prescribed kind and value",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-26_para4"></a>
and that would be easy enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-26_para5"></a>All the circumstances that come to mind in which one would need regulations that would exclude this sort of problem are easily covered by sub-paragraph (1). While I hear what the noble and learned Lord says about this, I remain very concerned because he cannot commit any future government as to what regulations they may choose to make. The fact is that sub-paragraph (2) could be used to treat a person who is destitute as not being destitute. That is something which I believe should not appear in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-26_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may add a little more to the debate on Amendment No. 72. Many of these proposals run fairly clearly along the lines of recognised social security law. Therefore, one is entitled to draw attention to some of the recognised social security problems on which I believe the Home Office will need to do a certain amount of thinking. Perhaps I may take one obvious example. Under Paragraph 2 of the new schedule, the department is proposing to lay down in regulations the limits of income or of assets which would entitle it to treat a person as not being destitute.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-26_para6"></a>The first question that occurs to me is: will these limits be regularly uprated for inflation? If they are not, we shall very soon have a problem. However, if they are to be regularly uprated, I would prefer--though I am sure the Home Office would not--to have them included in the regular provisions for mandatory consideration of uprating. Because capital limits in ordinary social security law were left out of that provision, they very often do not get uprated. Indeed, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, has admitted in this Chamber quite frequently, some of them have not been uprated since 1988. So there could be something here which might create a lot of further hardship in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-26_para7"></a>I am also concerned about whether the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"might reasonably be expected to have",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-26_para8"></a>
or,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"might reasonably be expected to be",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-26_para9"></a>
are appropriately placed here. Those, again, are regular words in social security law. They are designed to deal with the sort of person who is a company director with an apparently moderately prosperous company, but once the accounts have been audited by <P>


<a name="column_826"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 826</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>someone with whom he has a long-standing business relationship, there suddenly turns out not to be any money to pay maintenance to his ex-wife under the CSA. In that case one understands the meaning of the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"might reasonably be expected to have".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-26_para10"></a>
But of course, in the case of an asylum seeker whose case has not yet been adjudicated upon, whether one might reasonably expect him to have income from the country he has left might have something to do with prejudging whether his claim is genuine.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-26_para11"></a>The noble and learned Lord said something--I have been trying all day to track it down, but I have not succeeded. I was just about to ask him about it when the Lord Chairman made an appearance--reassuring about the application of Paragraph 2(1)(b) to personal effects, sentimental jewellery, wife's wedding ring, things of this sort. For some people who are perhaps the only survivors of their families things of this sort may have a sentimental value, and indeed far more than that. They may have a value to their collective memory and collective sense of their own identity. It would, I think, be peculiarly important that such things should not be taken into account in any assessment of what people are to be assessed as being worth when support is being considered. I thought when I heard the noble and learned Lord use the relevant words on Report that they were probably sufficient on this point and I am sorry to have to come back to the matter. But because I was not able to track them down and the amendment, of course, by his generosity was not moved, I would like a little further clarification on this.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-26_para12"></a>The other point on Amendment No. 72 that I want to take up concerns the proposed new paragraph 8, which states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The regulations may make provision for the suspension or discontinuance of support",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-26_para13"></a>
because of,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the cessation of residence in accommodation provided under section 93".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-26_para14"></a>
This is an area where I can see miscarriages of justice taking place quite easily. It is sadly true that a number of people from ethnic minorities suffer a quite considerable degree of harassment in their residence. There was a recent case in Lancaster of someone who it seems had been assaulted in his house several hundred times but the local police authorities had not taken any action. I do not think that such cases are common but they happen. When an asylum seeker says that he has left his accommodation because he was constantly subjected to racial harassment there, this statement is ex parte. If the local police in that place are--shall we say?--somewhat less zealous in this matter than some other police forces might have been, there will be no way of verifying that ex parte statement. Therefore it could well end up being disbelieved when it was in fact totally true. I would like to know whether there is a good cause provision here and whether the good cause provision will be used, with some investigation into the possibility of getting independent evidence, because otherwise there could be serious trouble.

<A NAME = "91102-26_para15"></a>Also, of course, other good causes can include the state of the accommodation. If, for example, you have an asthmatic child and the accommodation is damp, you may well want to leave that accommodation without being in any way nefarious, or wishing to evade the system. I hope that the measure will not be applied rigorously and I hope that it will be applied sensitively. I would be grateful for any comments that the noble and learned Lord can make on that point.

<A NAME="91102-26_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, on a rather different point, I ask the noble and learned Lord about Amendment No. 84, which, as he mentioned in his preliminary remarks, relates to Scotland. This amendment alters the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and I understand that it extends the provision of school meals in Scotland in order to comply with the requirements in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-26_para16"></a>Education is of course devolved to Scotland. I am aware--the noble and learned Lord will remember well from his involvement at the time--that Section 28(7) of the Scotland Act allows this Westminster Parliament to legislate for anything in Scotland, whether it is devolved or not. This is a devolved matter. I wonder how the Government have handled this. Have they consulted the Scottish executive on the point to see whether it agrees to school meals being extended in this way? Has the Scots Parliament considered it? Does it realise that it is happening? This may increase to a small extent the expenditure on school meals that will be required. I wonder whether the Government have perhaps agreed a concordat with the Scots Parliament for dealing with the matter. This kind of thing will obviously arise quite often. I gave the noble and learned Lord notice of the question, and I should be grateful if he could tell me how this has been handled.

<A NAME="91102-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sheppard of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, this cluster of amendments relates to support for asylum seekers. I looked particularly at Amendment No. 39, which bites on Clause 93. That gives the Secretary of State power to make further provisions. One of the major provisions relates to accommodation. Noble Lords raised this matter at an earlier stage. Some of the new arrangements are now coming about. I would like to read part of a letter, copied to me, from the chairmen of several voluntary agencies in Merseyside which are dealing with the most acute cases. It is a letter to the Home Secretary, written on 26th October:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We were dismayed to hear on 25th October circumstances under which the Government intends to send several hundred asylum seekers to Liverpool very shortly under the new legislation. It is not the fact that these people are coming to our city which caused the dismay--indeed, I am sure we will do everything possible to ensure that they are assimilated as smoothly as possible--but rather the fact that the City Council and its carefully selected group of statutory and voluntary agencies will not have sole responsibility for housing and supporting them. We have had saddening experience of the effects of placing asylum seekers in privately negotiated accommodation and we would refer you to the refugee arrivals project for confirmation of the worst example of this in Liverpool itself. We believe it would be <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_828"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 828</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>extremely unwise to pursue this policy and would beg you to reconsider it, even at this late stage. Unless the local authority has control as well as responsibility for these unfortunate people, they run the very real risk of becoming victims of greed among some private landlords and of local racist attitudes, as many of those already here have sadly discovered. A properly established, funded and monitored operation by the City Council, which is already well advanced in its planning and has the benefit of recent experience gained through hosting Kosovar refugees in our city, could prevent many of the inevitable problems by providing community support and other facilities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-27_para0"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91102-27_para1"></a>I should be most grateful if my noble and learned friend the Minister could spell out how the Government expect local authorities and others to make provision for accommodation. Arising also from this cluster of amendments, could he spell out in a little more detail how voluntary bodies would know whether they qualify for the "hard cases" money that the Government have spoken about? In what way it will be made available to voluntary bodies?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, my question follows on from those of the noble Lord. Has the Minister taken note of the serious shortfall in the money available to local authorities for housing asylum seekers? The magazine Housing Today says that the Government's framework is on the brink of financial disaster and that local authorities would lose out by &#163;100 million unless more Home Office cash is forthcoming. This article, which appears in the current issue of Housing Today, is entitled:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Councils warn of &#163;100 million shortfall as numbers rise".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-27_para2"></a>
I know that the Association of London Government and the Local Government Association have taken this matter up with the Home Office. The Home Office has said merely that it is all the more important that this legislation gets on to the statute book. When it does, the number of asylum seekers will fall from the current level--which is expected to be 70,000 during 1999--to an estimated 42,000 next year.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-27_para3"></a>That is all very well, but what happens to the additional burden which, according to this report, is being imposed on local authorities in the meanwhile? Where is the additional &#163;100 million--if that figure is correct--to come from? Can the Minister verify that figure? Will any more cash be forthcoming from the Government for the local authorities which are facing this colossal burden?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Sheppard, and the noble Earl, Lord Russell, in particular, emphasised the difficulties which the Home Office and its Immigration and Nationality Directorate will have in implementing the whole of the support system. It is very complicated; it is being set up from scratch; and it will have all the kinds of ramifications which have caused great complications for many years--both on the social security side and on the immigration side--all of which must be dealt with at once all over the country. It is a formidable administrative task. I hope very sincerely that the Home Office is alive to the scale of the task and that it is addressing itself very carefully to it.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-27_para4"></a>I rise merely to add a word or two on Amendment No. 73, on which my name appears. I cannot add much to what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said in speaking to the amendment, except to draw attention to the wording of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation, which said that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The House may wish to consider removing or limiting this wide power"--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-27_para5"></a>
that is, the power to treat someone who is otherwise destitute as not being destitute--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if the Government do not provide a persuasive justification for it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-27_para6"></a>
No one is more able to provide persuasive justifications for almost anything than the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General. He has not done so yet, but I am sure that he is about to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, for giving me prior notice of the point that she raised. Perhaps I may deal with the distinct Scottish question first. My understanding is that the request for this provision came from the Scottish Office. We understand that it undertook the necessary consultations. The noble Baroness is right, education is a devolved matter; but immigration and asylum are reserved. The amendment parallels the provision in paragraph 116 of Schedule 13 in relation to the provision of free school meals in England and Wales under the Education Act 1996. There will not necessarily be any further expenditure in Scotland. At present, children of asylum seekers get free school meals because their parents are on income support. So the expenditure, by and large, is being incurred already.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-27_para7"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, inquired about good cause. I am able to confirm that the provisions of paragraph 8(1) would be applied only if someone left accommodation without good cause. He specifically asked about asthmatic children. If accommodation is inadequate by reason of dampness, as he suggested, for those with particular health problems--whether children or the asylum seeker--the scheme allows for personal circumstances to be taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-27_para8"></a>The noble Earl further asked me for examples in practice of the phrase, "reasonably to be expected". In some circumstances I revert to his original point. A partner of an asylum seeker is entitled to claim social security--perhaps because he or she is British--and he or she would be reasonably expected to claim that benefit and not to rely on asylum seeker's support.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-27_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is quite right, sub-paragraph (2) is a subsidiary part of sub-paragraph (1) and we intend to use the power in the way that he indicated.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-27_para10"></a>In the context of the Bill, we are not regarding destitution as an absolute condition. We would want to treat as destitute someone with less than &#163;200; we would not want to treat as destitute someone with a higher amount.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-27_para11"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, asked about the uprating of limits for inflation. We intend to hold an annual review so that we can make our own assessment, separate from other systems. The noble Earl also asked about sentimental jewellery. My understanding is that sentimental jewellery will not be taken into account when assessing destitution.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-27_para12"></a>My noble friend Lord Sheppard of Liverpool asked about responsibility. He gave an example of an asylum seeker placed in Liverpool by another authority. In Schedule 8 the interim arrangements provisions provide for case responsibility to be transferred so that an asylum seeker placed in Liverpool by another authority could be transferred to Liverpool City Council by agreement. My noble friend Lord Sheppard also asked about private landlords. Any accommodation to be used by asylum seekers will need to meet proper standards to be set out in regulations. We will also, of course, be establishing with the voluntary sector one-stop shops to provide advice and support.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-27_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked about the financial provision. Local authorities will be paid per asylum seeker family. If numbers rise, they will get a special increased grant. Other general expenditure by local authorities such as schooling and social services will be reflected in the standard spending assessment of the local government financial settlement in the normal way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether the local authorities may nevertheless have a cash flow problem because the number of asylum seekers this year has been rising extremely rapidly. I presume that the assessment will not take place until the spring of 2000. In the meantime, all the money will have been spent by local authorities and they will have to wait until the middle of 2000 to retrieve any of it under the standard spending assessment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has raised a perfectly reasonable point. The figure of &#163;100 million was not one that I had put my mind to earlier. However, I am not complaining. The noble Lord probably himself had the figure quite recently as a matter of information. If it is convenient, either I or, more likely, my noble friend will write to the noble Lord and, as always, a copy of the letter will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-27_para14"></a>My noble friend Lord Sheppard also asked about integration. I am happy to be able to tell noble Lords that today the Home Secretary published a consultation paper setting out our plans for the integration of refugees following successful asylum decisions. Many noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, from the Cross Benches, have raised the question of how we should look to the longer term life of refugees who have been granted appropriate status in this country. Are they constantly to live in actual or notional ghettos, or are they to be integrated into the mainstream of our lives? I hope that <P>


<a name="column_831"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 831</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>when your Lordships have seen the consultation paper, it will prove itself to be a useful first step in addressing such longer term problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-27_para15"></a>My noble friend Lord Sheppard also asked about the hard cases grant. Again, we will be issuing guidelines to the voluntary sector on how to administer that grant.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-27_para16"></a>I believe that I have dealt with all the distinct questions put to me. If I have not, I shall read the account and I shall be happy to write to noble Lords. I may not have dealt with matters to the perfect satisfaction of all my interlocutors, but those are the replies I am able to provide.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-28_spnew0"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Southwark </B>   moved Amendment No. 40:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 64, line 24, leave out subsection (12).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para0"></a>The right reverend Prelate said: My Lords, it was good to learn of the extra resources that the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General announced will be made available towards the end of the support scheme. Amendments Nos. 40 and 78 refer to the other end of the support scheme and have the effect of removing from the Bill Schedule 8 which provides for interim arrangements from the passage of the Bill until the main support scheme takes effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para1"></a>Because your Lordships' House supported Amendment No. 118 tabled on Report, which made Clause 92 part of the Bill, interim arrangements have already been provided by giving asylum seekers access to the full benefits system. Strictly speaking, therefore, Schedule 8 is redundant and should be removed. I realise, however, that your Lordships need to consider every eventuality and speculating, unlikely though it might be, that Clause 92 could be amended or even removed in the other place, it could be argued that other interim arrangements need to be in place. Perhaps, but not the interim arrangements spelt out in Schedule 8--for surely a mistake has been made.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para2"></a>The interim arrangements in Schedule 8 are designed to mirror the eventual support package, as the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General made clear at Report stage. The interim arrangements will be managed by the local authorities but within the parameters and boundaries as specified by the Government along the lines of the eventual support package. It has been made clear, not least by the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General in Committee, that these support arrangements are designed only to last for a few months. Yet the interim arrangements are precisely similar and so the time asylum seekers are on interim arrangements has to be added to the time they might be on the support arrangements. We are getting into years, not months.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para3"></a>It could be argued--I am sure that it will be--that anything, even the proposed interim arrangements, would be better than the present system. The interim arrangements are not better for one important group--families with children. At present, families with children who seek asylum at a port of entry <P>


<a name="column_832"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 832</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>qualify for virtually the total sum of benefits available for a citizen of the UK. If they do not seek asylum at the port of entry but later, the local social services department provides support under Section 17 of the Children Act and in most cases cash support is given to the level of income support. In all cases children at present fall under the full protection of the Children Act. Under the proposed interim arrangements in Schedule 8, all this falls away.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para4"></a>In Committee the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General gave this assurance:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I repeat what I said earlier this evening: we have listened carefully to the concerns about children. I said quite plainly earlier tonight that we have now indicated that children under the age of 18 will have a support level set at a level equivalent to income support personal allowances".--[Official Report, 21/7/99; col. 1122.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-28_para5"></a>
What is proposed provides support perhaps equivalent to income support but it is provided mostly in vouchers and not cash and the protection of the Children Act is removed under the interim arrangements. The families are certainly worse off than at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para6"></a>I must confess to feeling a little let down by the proposed arrangements. I thought that the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General--again at the Committee stage--had indicated something a little different. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I repeat what my right honourable friend Jack Straw said on Report in the other place. He confirmed that asylum seeker families with minor children would not be taken into the new support system at 1st April 2000 unless he was satisfied that the target of two months for a decision time in those cases could be achieved".--[Official Report, 21/7/99; col. 1097.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-28_para7"></a>
Strictly by the letter, the Government are honouring that pledge. Families are not being brought into the support system yet. But under the interim arrangements they are being brought into a mirror image of the support scheme. It is as though the letter of the pledge is being honoured but not the spirit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para8"></a>Indeed, on Report in the other place the Home Secretary went a little further than the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General has suggested. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I also give the subsidiary but very important undertaking that, if we cannot achieve those targets for families with children, and if I am not satisfied that they can be achieved, we will not introduce those applications into the new support arrangements in April 2000. The existing arrangements will continue until we are so satisfied".--[Official Report, Commons, 16/6/99; col. 475.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-28_para9"></a>
Perhaps I may repeat that last sentence:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The existing arrangements will continue until we are so satisfied".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91102-28_para10"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para11"></a>But the existing arrangements are not continuing. Schedule 8 introduces another set of arrangements which I believe disadvantage children. Has the Home Secretary changed his mind? Have I missed a subtle political interpretation of what seems to be a clear promise regarding keeping families under the existing arrangements until time targets are met? Or has a mistake been made? I prefer to think the latter. For that reason, I believe that the proposed interim <P>


<a name="column_833"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 833</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>arrangements should be removed so that families can continue to have the full support that they need. Accordingly, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I rise to express concern about Amendments Nos. 40 and 78. We know that the Government have inherited a chaotic system of support for asylum seekers. We also heard earlier today from my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General of the surge in new asylum seekers coming into this country. The present rate is about 7,000 a month. The Home Secretary has already entered into discussions with local authorities in an attempt to reduce the pressure on authorities in London and the south east. Those arrangements are taking place largely on a basis of voluntary negotiation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para12"></a>I suggest that Schedule 8 enables the Home Secretary to put on a firmer statutory basis many of the accommodation changes involving dispersal that have already been discussed in this House. My concern is that, if we vote to remove Schedule 8, we shall hold back the whole policy of dispersal from London and the south east. The effect of that would be to put continuing pressure on the London boroughs and on Kent County Council.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para13"></a>As I understand it, the effect of the amendment would be to introduce a set of arrangements whereby the interests of asylum seekers would not be best served; nor would the interests of hard-pressed local authorities and their home populations in London and the south east. Another concern is whether we should end up spending more money from the public purse on keeping asylum seekers in very high-cost accommodation areas in London and the south east when there is perfectly satisfactory, lower-cost accommodation elsewhere. The amendment would also make it more difficult to settle asylum seekers in areas where there are already communities from the countries from which they come.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para14"></a>I hope that we shall not enter into another set of changes that we have not thought through--as happened in regard to Amendment No. 118 which was passed by this House last week. It turned out that the price tag for that amendment was about &#163;500 million. We need some assurances from the Government as to the cost of this change. We also need to know whether it would, as I suspect, hold back the application and implementation of the policy of dispersal.

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para15"></a>In the light of what has just been said, I understand that the Local Government Association suggests that the interim arrangements would be difficult to introduce and that it would prefer to go straight to the April 2000 new system without going through the interim arrangements on the way. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord can say something about that. As my <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>noble friend said earlier, local authorities believe that, as matters stand, they are short of the money that they need to operate the interim system.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para16"></a>I believe that what drove noble Lords to support Amendment No. 118, which was accepted by this House, was their view that it would be helpful to hold the Home Office to the then six-month target effectively to guarantee that families with children would move from one system to another; that is, that until their cases were dealt with they would be able to continue under the existing support arrangements. Since the pledge quoted by the right reverend Prelate was given by the Home Secretary in the other place, we are no longer certain about the position of families as distinct from other asylum seekers. The noble and learned Lord may be able to shed some light on that. On the face of it, the interim arrangements look less good than the existing support system. That concerns many of us. We understood that the Home Secretary was prepared to treat families rather differently from other asylum seekers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-28_para17"></a>We do not want to make difficulties for the Government. We are grateful for the steps that they have taken. However, it would be of immense help if the noble and learned Lord could refer back to the words of the Home Secretary in the other place in June of this year. What is the exact position with regard to children during the interim period? Can he assure the right reverend Prelate and other noble Lords that provision under the interim support arrangements will be as good as under the existing system? If not, can he confirm that families will not be brought within those arrangements and that other asylum seekers may be?

I rise only to refute the suggestion made in passing by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that the cost of Amendment No. 118 (which was made to Clause 92 at Report stage) might be of a very large order. That estimate depends on wild guesses and highly dubious assumptions. I do not accept it for a moment.

<A NAME="91102-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, that is not my experience of my noble friend Lord Warner. He is a man of enormous experience and expertise in these areas. I have never known him make wild assertions. I believe that the figure he gave is correct. Amendment No. 118 was carried against the advice that we sought to give. Without trespassing on ground that I should not enter into, my belief is that that amendment will be overturned in another place. I believe that it was a mistake to press that amendment and to carry it. I repeat: my noble friend Lord Warner has enormous and lengthy experience of dealing with the problems of young people and families. I believe that what he said is correct.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para0"></a>Amendment No. 40, which was moved by the right reverend Prelate, gives me the opportunity to explain the reason for Schedule 8 to the Bill. It is concerned <P>


<a name="column_835"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 835</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>solely with the way in which local authorities should give support to asylum seekers in the period prior to the main new support arrangements set out in Part VI. At the moment, local authorities in England and Wales have to support asylum seekers under social services legislation: the National Assistance Act 1948 and the Children and Young Persons Act 1969. Those statutes were never intended for that purpose. Schedule 8 provides a sounder legal basis for the provision of support to asylum seekers. Critically, it allows for a degree of dispersal of asylum seekers from hard-pressed local authorities in London and the south east to other parts of the country where there is less pressure on local authorities from asylum seekers. To an extent, the interim arrangements pave the way for the main new asylum support arrangements, but in most respects they allow local authorities to continue to support asylum seekers in the same way as they do now.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para1"></a>The schedule is a set of regulation-making powers and provides a framework. We put out the consultation paper in August and are currently drafting the regulations in the lights of responses we have had. It is fundamental to our thinking that we have relieved the pressure of over-concentration. I have not heard from any of your Lordships at any stage of our debates on the Bill that anyone disputes the fact of that mischief.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para2"></a>Some local authorities are having to cope with very high numbers of asylum seekers. This is taking up a huge amount of accommodation in the capital and surrounding areas. It is making it very difficult indeed for local authorities to discharge their statutory duties towards local homeless families under the homelessness legislation. It is idle, I say, to concentrate on one feature of a local authority's responsibilities and duties and to forget that they have other responsibilities and duties which they are finding it hard to charge. The Government and the Local Government Association are clear that there needs to be a dispersal mechanism to share responsibility. The LGA, to which I pay credit, is currently establishing new arrangements for the transfer of asylum seekers between hard pressed authorities and others who have spare accommodation capacity in different parts of the country. The interim arrangements provide the vehicle to bring that about.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para3"></a>I cannot emphasise this too strongly. We want to see dispersal achieved by agreement. The schedule contains powers that would allow the Home Secretary to set a maximum on the number of new asylum seekers that a hard-pressed local authority is required to accept. We hope that in practice it will not be necessary to deploy those powers. As I said a moment ago, we hope for voluntary agreements.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para4"></a>The schedule contains powers that would allow us to set limits on the number of asylum seekers who may be placed in a particular area by any or all local authorities. We have to bear in mind the small local authorities such as Thanet and Dover. The number of <P>


<a name="column_836"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 836</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>asylum seekers placed in bed and breakfast accommodation by other authorities is simply not sustainable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para5"></a>We hope not to make use of the power. We hope for a co-ordinated voluntary basis of response. We want to give guidance to local authorities and hope to be able to commend the new dispersal arrangements which are being drawn up by the Local Government Association.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-29_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, if the Minister will allow me to intervene, perhaps I may ask a straightforward question. We fully understand the need for dispersal. Many of the powers of dispersal occur under Schedule 13. Can the noble and learned Lord say why the powers in Schedule 8 are necessary as well as those in Schedule 13?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I shall come to Schedule 13 in a moment. The asylum seekers affected by the interim provisions in Schedule 8 are those asylum seekers already accommodated under the 1948 Act and the Children Act 1989. Those asylum seekers will be deemed to be transferred on to support under the interim arrangements within the auspices of the local authority currently supporting them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para6"></a>The interim arrangements will apply also in respect of all new applications for support by people seeking asylum before 1st April 2000. These are people who have applied for asylum in country, not at the port of entry, and those asylum seekers who apply for asylum at port of entry and therefore were initially entitled to social security but are staying in this country pending an appeal against initial refusal of asylum. Local authorities will carry on with the responsibility for such cases after April 2000 but on a declining basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para7"></a>The interim arrangements will continue to be led by local authorities who have already substantial experience of accommodation and support. I do not believe that there is any reason to conclude that they will result in asylum seekers receiving any less favourable treatment than they do at present. Indeed, with phased dispersal to areas better able to support them, we believe that asylum seekers will benefit from these arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para8"></a>The government amendments are of a technical nature. As drafted, Schedule 8 would allow regulations to place a ceiling on the number of asylum seekers that a local authority is required to accommodate so that it could refer those in excess of that ceiling to any other local authority. I repeat that we are looking for agreement rather than compulsion.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para9"></a>At the same time as we bring the provisions of Schedule 8 into effect by regulation, we shall also bring into effect Clause 115, which removes asylum seekers' access to assistance under the 1948 Act. Clause 115 relies in part on a definition of persons subject to immigration control contained in Clause 114. But Clause 114 will not be brought into substantive effect until the main support arrangements come on stream in April 2000.
<P>


<a name="column_837"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 837</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para10"></a>We therefore, at Report, made a supplementary provision in the transition in paragraph 4 of Schedule 14 to allow that definition to have effect, even though Clause 114 is not in full effect. The amendments to Schedule 14 within this group would similarly apply the definition in Clause 114 to the other restrictions on access to social welfare which we find in Clauses 116, 119 and 120. We do not believe at present that that interim provision needs to apply in Scotland or Northern Ireland simply because the pressure from asylum seekers in those areas is much less severe.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para11"></a>Paragraph 9 of Schedule 14 provides for a phased move from the interim arrangements and from social services support. Amendments Nos. 90 and 91 extend these provisions so that they apply equally to all support that may be provided under English and Welsh legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para12"></a>After 1st April 2000, the prime responsibility for the support of asylum seekers goes to the Secretary of State; local authorities will have a residual duty to support certain persons who sought asylum before that date. But we also hope to see them actively, positively and willingly involved as contractors providing accommodation for the Home Secretary's scheme. Amendment No. 69 is intended to support this approach by commencing the provisions that allow local authorities to prepare contracts from the date of Royal Assent.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para13"></a>Particular matters were raised and I hope to deal with them all. I shall deal with Schedule 13 as I am giving my answer. Schedule 13 deals with dispersal powers under the homelessness legislation; that is, port applicant asylum seekers who become homeless. On the other hand, Schedule 8 relates to dispersal powers relative to in-country applicants.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para14"></a>It was suggested that the interim arrangements would be less good for families. No, the interim arrangements allow local authorities to continue to support families on broadly the same basis as now. They will not be worse; they will probably be better than the existing arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para15"></a>I mentioned the tribute which we need to pay to the local government associations. They are actively co-operating in establishing the interim arrangements. Officials were discussing this at a seminar with a local government association only today. In response to the questions asked by my noble friend Lord Sheppard, I repeat that the interim arrangements are a continuation of the existing arrangements of support by local authorities. They are not a trailer for the new Home Office arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para16"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark suggested that the interim arrangements are a mirror of the main scheme. In fact, they continue current local authority support; for instance, by way of Section 17 of the Children Act, which is not being done away with, but they allow for dispersal. I believe that we have an obligation to the London and south east authorities to which I referred earlier.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para17"></a>The right reverend Prelate was troubled that the Children Act "falls away", as I believe he said. It does not. The protection of the Children Act remains for <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>social services' needs, other than destitution needs. The basic support needs will be met under the interim arrangements, but on the same basis as they are currently applied.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para18"></a>I mentioned earlier that interim arrangements do not cover port of entry cases but in-country cases in the way I suggested. Looking at what is being provide by Schedule 8 and coming to the determinative feature of the Bill as it now stands, everyone recognises that the present system is a shambles. If we do not make a determined start, we can have debates about this at 10-yearly anniversaries in the future. We are not putting people into destitution; it is not right to say that we are.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para19"></a>We are providing cash and voucher facilities, with furnished accommodation and utility charges fully found. That is not unreasonable for the limited period to which Jack Straw has referred time and time again. Family cases will not be introduced until we can meet the two to six months targets.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para20"></a>Some of the attacks on the Bill are based on a misunderstanding. I respectfully commend again the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Warner. We are determined to reform a system which serves no one well at present.

<A NAME="91102-29_spnew3"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Southwark: </B>   My Lords, if anything, I am more confused than I was 10 minutes ago. The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General made clear on Report that the proposed interim arrangements were meant to be a preparation for the main support scheme rather than a continuation of the present arrangements. I am rather confused by what he has said this evening.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para21"></a>Ministering in London, I fully understand the need for dispersal. But, again, I am disappointed that the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General did not, to my satisfaction at least, respond to the request of the noble Baroness to indicate exactly how the position of children under the interim arrangements would correspond with the clear assurance of the Home Secretary that the present arrangements will continue until the Government's time limits are met.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para22"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General said that it is idle to concentrate on one aspect of a local authority's responsibility and ignore others. However, where that one aspect concerns the welfare of children and the possibility of children becoming destitute, I for one make no apology for focusing upon that aspect, even though the removal of the interim arrangements may have other difficult consequences.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-29_para23"></a>I am still not sure that what seems to be a clear undertaking for family support by the Home Secretary has in fact been honoured in the Bill. Perhaps that will be discussed further in the other place where the promises were made. That being so, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 73, line 5, after ("neglects") insert (", without reasonable excuse,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91102-30_para2"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, this is a simple amendment. It concerns two clauses, Clauses 106 and 107, which appear in the part of the Bill headed "Support for Asylum Seekers".
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-30_para3"></a>Clauses 106 and 107 create two criminal offences. The crime in Clause 106, stated shortly, is refusing to provide information which the defendant is under an obligation to provide. The crime in Clause 107, stated shortly, is the crime of refusing to provide maintenance for an asylum seeker which the defendant is under an obligation to provide.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-30_para4"></a>However, there is written into Clause 106, which relates to information, a defence, which is "without reasonable excuse." Therefore the defendant is not guilty of the crime of refusing to provide information which he is otherwise bound to provide if he can show that he has a reasonable excuse. However, there is no such defence written into Clause 107. Therefore, a defendant remains guilty of the offence of refusing to provide maintenance even if he has a reasonable excuse. Why is "reasonable excuse" a defence in the case of one clause and not in the case of the other?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-30_para5"></a>Let us take the scenario that the defendant has a small business; perhaps he runs a village shop. That is quite a likely scenario because many people who come from abroad take up business as shopkeepers. Let us suppose that he is under an obligation to pay a weekly sum for the maintenance of an asylum seeker; that there is a period when his business falls off; also that he makes enough money to support himself and his wife and children but not enough to pay also for the maintenance of the asylum seeker, despite his best efforts, unless of course he sells the business--his livelihood--and uses the proceeds of sale for as long as they last. In those circumstances, he declines--your Lordships may feel that he declines reasonably--to continue to pay the maintenance which he can no longer afford. Nevertheless, he has absolutely no defence if he is prosecuted because "reasonable excuse", although a defence to the Clause 106 crime, is not a defence to the Clause 107 crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-30_para6"></a>That anomaly was touched on briefly by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, in slightly different terms in Committee. The only answer given by the Government was that,

<FONT SIZE=3>
Why is that not made clear in the Bill as it is with regard to information which is reasonably refused? Why is "reasonable excuse" spelt out in Clause 106 but not in Clause 107, where we are told that it is intended to apply?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-30_para9"></a>I did not return to this point on Report because I took the view that it was really a drafting amendment and the Companion advises that the convenient point to raise a drafting amendment is at Third Reading. I know that drafting amendments are not particularly encouraged, but this amendment reflects exactly the Government's stated intention, as expressed in Committee. In my respectful submission, that intention should be written into the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-30_para10"></a>Of course, I appreciate that the obligation to provide information under Clause 106 is imposed by law while the obligation to pay maintenance under Clause 107 results from an undertaking given voluntarily. However, that difference means only that it may be more difficult to prove that the refusal to pay is reasonable. The fact remains that if there is a reasonable excuse for non-payment, that should be a defence under Clause 107 just as much as it is a defence in the case of a refusal to provide information. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, not for the first time, the noble and learned Lord has caught me with a conundrum. I have to throw myself on the mercy of the court. I had assumed that the answer to the question of the noble and learned Lord on this amendment was that there may be a comparison between Clause 107 of this Bill with Section 105 of the Social Security Administration Act, which similarly lacks the "without reasonable excuse" proviso.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-30_para11"></a>However, the noble and learned Lord has been astute. With great deference to him, he makes an important point. He has not co-related Clause 107 of this Bill with Section 105 of the Social Security Administration Act provision, but he asks a question to which I have no answer that convinces me and, therefore, will convince him on the difference between Clause 107 of the Bill and Clause 106 of the Bill. It is possible that an answer will occur to me as I speak a little longer.

<A NAME = "91102-30_para12"></a>What would be the position of a sponsor who took an asylum seeker into his home and provided him with food and accommodation according to the guarantees that he had given, but later found that that asylum seeker was molesting his wife and children? Would the sponsor not have reasonable grounds for throwing him out of his home--I would have thought that he would have--and to cease to support him? As I understand the wording of the Bill, it would be illegal for him to do so. Therefore, his wife and children would continue to be in danger, which, I am sure the <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-30_para13"></a>The only answer that I offer--it is not marvellously convincing to me--is that Clause 107 mirrors Section 105 of the Social Security Administration Act. Plainly that does not attend to the point raised by the noble and learned Lord, which is different and distinct.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-30_para14"></a>I wonder whether the noble and learned Lord would allow me a little time to consider this matter. I am not prepared to put forward any explanation that I do not believe is worthy of consideration, certainly not by the noble and learned Lord. I ought to think about this further.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-30_para15"></a>In policy terms--this does not deal with the Clause 106 point at all--there would be no prosecution under any of the circumstances that have been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman. This is not intended to attack someone with criminal liability who does not have some blameworthiness. I do not believe that that is entirely satisfactory. In fact, I regard it as vestigially satisfactory. Perhaps I ought to give this matter further consideration.

<A NAME="91102-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may suggest to the Attorney-General that if he wants to keep open his options for a little while in order to consider the matter, he could allow this amendment to pass this evening as the noble and learned Lord has the option of trying to influence his colleagues in another place to remove it if it turns out that on further consideration it is not necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-30_para16"></a>I thought it was a good amendment to make and one that may stick. The only way that I can see to keep the matter open at this stage of the Third Reading is to pass the amendment, even if the noble and learned Lord wants to reserve his position as to the attitude he recommends to colleagues in another place at a later stage.

If someone enters into an agreement in all good faith that they will maintain an asylum seeker and bear the cost and responsibility for him, but find that they are made redundant and do not have the means to support the asylum seeker, that sounds like a reasonable excuse.

<A NAME = "91102-31_para0"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para1"></a>Clause 114 [Exclusion from benefits]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Swinfen </B>   moved Amendment No. 44:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 76, line 32, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) Paragraphs (a), (b), (d) and (g) of subsection (1) above do not apply to a person seeking asylum in the United Kingdom or a spouse or dependant of such a person.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is designed to ensure that asylum seekers retain the right to disability benefits. The most humane and efficient way of supporting asylum seekers is by using the mainstream benefits system. That approach has been rejected by the Government in favour of creating an entirely separate system of support for asylum seekers which appears to be a recipe for social exclusion.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para3"></a>However, I do not believe that disability benefits can be simply removed along with all the others without giving the matter separate attention. Disability benefits are only payable to those living with the qualifying level of disability as attested to by doctors. Thus we are here talking of a limited class to which access is strictly controlled. They are not benefits anyone can access. I have seen no figures setting out the number of asylum seekers who receive such benefits, but I am aware that it is small.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para4"></a>The Government's rationale for removing access to benefits is that cash benefits are an attraction. That rationale cannot and should not be applied to disability benefits. They cannot, because a person only qualifies for disability benefits when they have a disability. I do not believe that it can be argued that <P>


<a name="column_843"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 843</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>anyone would choose so to qualify. They should not, because that would suggest that we in this country want to provide a special deterrent for disabled people.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para5"></a>This amendment was discussed at Committee stage with Amendment No. 118. When replying the noble and learned Lord referred to paragraph 3(b) of the new schedule that had just been introduced into the Bill. It was not moved at Report stage. It was then Amendment No. 124.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para6"></a>I wish to know how the Government see the proposals of paragraph 3(b) working and whether they would work as well as the disability benefits. How will the asylum seekers be assessed? Will it be on the same basis as for those who already receive benefits? Can the Government give me any kind of undertaking or guarantee about those who come to this country with a recently-acquired disability which, although looked after properly from the medical point of view, is not looked after properly in terms of accommodation and the way in which they are allowed to live, and their disability gets worse? That may well put them in a position where they are not as able to earn their living as well as they might either in this country or elsewhere. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I warmly support the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, in his amendment. I underline what he said in relation to the necessity of getting away from the idea that paying disability benefit will encourage people to come to this country. The number of people who come here suffering from a disability must be extremely small; but many of them, as we discussed, are those who have suffered in their country of origin from severe ill-treatment and torture. They may indeed be clients of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, an organisation which we so much admire.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para7"></a>If the Secretary of State provides equivalent support to disability benefit under paragraph 3(b), as the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, suggests he might according to the assurances given in Committee, that needs to be clearly underlined today. I would not object to such an undertaking if the Minister could say that the levels of support which are to be provided are no less advantageous to somebody suffering from a disability than is the normal disability benefit. However, as the arrangements are in place and everybody knows how they work, it will be better to leave that system in place and allow people to claim disability benefit notwithstanding the fact that all other kinds of support come under Part VI of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para8"></a>I hope that the Minister finds his way clear to accepting this excellent amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, which will reassure many people who are particularly concerned about those asylum seekers who come from overseas suffering from ailments or severe disabilities which arose because of their treatment in their country of origin.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-31_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I support the plea made by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. In a sense, the burden of proof of establishing that the subsection <P>


<a name="column_844"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 844</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should not apply rests with the Government. I have not participated in debates on this point previously, but the plea on the grounds of common humanity, eloquently voiced by the noble Lords, Lord Swinfen and Lord Avebury, raises an important question mark. That being so, I shall listen with interest to my noble and learned friend. However, the Government must establish in this instance that the assertion made in the Bill is right, rather than the burden of proof resting on those who take a contrary view prima facie.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-31_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, the Minister may recall that in Committee I moved an amendment to reinstate the position of disabled people. I am happy this evening to support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, and supported by the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Clinton-Davis. I agree wholeheartedly with the arguments that they advanced and therefore do not need to reiterate them. However, perhaps I may ask two questions of the Minister concerning the position of disabled people as reflected by other provisions of this legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para9"></a>The first returns to a question I raised at Report stage concerning accommodation. The Minister will recall his response that people will be made one offer which they will have to accept. However, will those offers take into account questions such as mobility, so that people with such problems will not simply be placed in high-rise blocks of flats or in hard-to-let properties without access and, therefore, doubly disadvantaged?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para10"></a>Further, can the noble and learned Lord comment on the question of mobility? For example, if, with a voucher system, all that is to be made available to people will be &#163;10 a week, I am sure he will agree that it will be extraordinarily difficult for disabled people with mobility problems to get around on such a limited sum of money. Can he say whether those questions will also be taken into account when looking at the wherewithal for survival that disabled people will have at their disposal?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-31_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, having not been present in the Chamber at the beginning of the debate on this amendment--and I apologise to the House--I shall not risk repeating what has already been said. I shall merely say that I have supported this amendment before and I will do so again tonight.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-31_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn:  </B>  My Lords, the aim of Amendment No. 44 is to seek to restore entitlement to attendance allowance, severe disablement allowance, disability living allowance and disabled persons' tax credit to all asylum seekers, their families and dependants. However, this would not be the effect of the amendment as all those benefits were withdrawn from disabled people by our predecessor in government. No disabled asylum seeker has had access to any of those benefits since that time. Therefore, the amendment is trying to re-introduce an entitlement which does not currently exist.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para11"></a>Before I turn to other matters, I must point out that there is a further problem here; namely, that anyone who was affected by Clause 114 and excluded from the <P>


<a name="column_845"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 845</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>benefits would only have to claim asylum to be entitled to all the excluded benefits again, even after an asylum claim had been dismissed. As long as there was an immediate re-application, the person in question would still, in the words of the noble Lord's amendment, be "a person seeking asylum". Plainly, on the phrasing of the amendment, there are those two defects. I can only repeat that the amendment would not restore benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para12"></a>I shall now deal with the more important matters touched on by the noble Lords, Lord Swinfen and Lord Alton and by my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis. As the noble Lord said, we had a fairly substantial discussion on Report and I shall not weary the House by repeating it at length. We have recognised that those who suffer physical challenge may have special needs. That is why we have expressly taken power in the new schedule which, by virtue of Amendment No. 72, is to replace Clause 93, to make provisions in regulations as to the circumstances in which support may be expected at levels other than what will be provided as a general rule.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para13"></a>What we want to do--and I hope this is an assurance of the sort that my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis was looking for--is to ensure that appropriate support can be offered to asylum seekers with these particular needs and, of course, to their families. We will be addressing the needs of disabled asylum seekers through the Part VI support arrangements. We can do so in a number of ways; indeed, some of these particular questions were raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para14"></a>It is open to the scheme to provide additional levels of financial support in particular cases--I turn to the accommodation point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool--to provide specialised accommodation; to provide ongoing additional support (for example, commissioning supported housing from a specialised housing provider where this is appropriate); or--and I return here to the conversations that the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and I have had over a period of time--to help the individual gain access to specialised services, such as those offered by the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. I believe we have already acknowledged the need to provide access to such services in appropriate cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para15"></a>Further, asylum seekers with disabilities will be able to look to local authorities for assistance through the appropriate social services legislation. We are looking to separate out the delivery of support for asylum seekers, whose needs generally, I have to say, are of a short-term character, from the mainstream benefit system that caters more for those with long-term needs. For this group, as for the great majority of asylum seekers who lack special needs, we intend to ensure a parallel but separate pattern of provision appropriate to need.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-31_para16"></a>It is intended to take account of all the circumstances, including the support needed and the resources available, in assessing what a disabled person requires. Therefore I have to say that I do not think that the aim of Amendment No. 44 is capable of <P>


<a name="column_846"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 846</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>being achieved in this way but I hope that the reassurances and the undertakings I have given prove satisfactory to noble Lords who have spoken on the matter.

<A NAME="91102-31_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for that response which sounds most encouraging. It is quite likely that I shall not be here for much longer to bully him but I am sure that if in the future it is found that disabled asylum seekers are not being properly looked after, there will be others not only in this House, but in the other place as well, who will certainly "chase his tail" to make certain that he or some other Minister comes up to scratch. As the noble and learned Lord knows, there are a number of people endeavouring to make certain that people with all kinds of disabilities are properly catered for. That will not go away. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is grouped with Amendment No. 85 which deals with the consequential effect in relation to the Police Act 1996. On Report I had the support on this or a similar amendment of the former Home Secretary, the noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley, and also of the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, who was at one time the permanent secretary at the Home Office. At every stage during the passage of this Bill I have pleaded the need to establish an appeals machinery to deal with complaints about immigration officers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para8"></a>On Report I withdrew an amendment which would have brought this service within the scope of the race relations legislation. In fact the definition of direct and indirect discrimination would have been to an extent in conflict with the administration of immigration policies because it discriminates on the grounds of nationality and national origin.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para9"></a>One may ask why we need a statutory provision. Following the Macpherson Report on the death of Stephen Lawrence, the Home Secretary accepted that certain government actions were outside the scope of, or excluded from, the provisions of the race relations legislation. For example, if you are discriminated against in the provision of services or as regards <P>


<a name="column_849"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 849</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employment or housing provision, you can approach an industrial tribunal or the county court to seek redress. However, if one is discriminated against in the provision of services either at the hands of a police officer or an immigration officer, you do not have any recourse whatever as the Law Lords have interpreted that the services provided by immigration officers and police officers do not comprise service to an individual but service to the Crown. Therefore it is vitally important that some ways and means are devised to ensure that police and immigration officers are accountable for their actions.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para10"></a>Police and immigration officers are more or less given the same powers as are stipulated clearly on the face of the Bill. The Secretary of State has accepted that there is this anomaly within the race relations legislation and it needs to be rectified. Whether we have that or not, at some stage there is bound to be some amendment to the race relations legislation which will bring immigration officers within the scope of the Race Relations Act. I look forward with great interest to the forthcoming Queen's Speech to see whether or not such a provision has been included.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para11"></a>I shall explain why I feel so passionate about the need to have some kind of machinery such as I have mentioned. In the 1980s, the Commission for Racial Equality, where I worked, investigated the administration of the Immigration Service. As part of that investigation, in which I was involved, we were privileged to be able to visit British posts abroad and examine the files of entry clearance officers. Those officers are responsible for interviewing people before they come to this country. They can determine whether or not entry should be granted. In a number of files, we found comments which were racist, which were anti-immigrant and which were to an extent very damaging. If that had happened in this day and age, some of those people would have been sacked.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para12"></a>The situation has, of course, changed over the past 20 years. However, there is still a public perception that the Immigration Service fairly frequently treats people unfairly. It is right and proper, therefore, that there should be some statutory machinery by which we can examine such complaints. The situation has certainly improved over a period of time. There is no way in which we can monitor the decision-making process of the Immigration Service to determine whether it is a sound process. I do not know of a single entry clearance officer or an immigration officer being dismissed or disciplined because of some of the actions that he may have taken which may not have been professional.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para13"></a>By comparison, at least 20,000 complaints against police officers are being investigated on a regular basis by the Police Complaints Authority. At least 10 per cent of such complaints are substantiated. Indeed, they are substantiated on the basis of a high standard of proof-- beyond reasonable doubt. The standard is now being lowered to that of the balance of probabilities. On that basis, we may find that as many as 30 per cent of complaints against police officers are substantiated.
<P>


<a name="column_850"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 850</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para14"></a>I mention that because immigration officers now have similar powers to those of the police. By the admission of the Minister at Report stage, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act now applies equally to immigration officers. The powers of arrest, body searching and fingerprinting are some of the measures now available to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para15"></a>Where do we go from here? I believe that we cannot exclude immigration officers from the provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. They perform the same task as the police. Therefore, it is right that there should be some independent machinery, similar to that of the Police Complaints Authority, which can in reality conduct investigations.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para16"></a>Let me give a practical example. Most of your Lordships are aware of the instance that I cited some time ago of a black woman named Joy Gardner. Police officers, together with immigration officers, went to her house for the purpose of arresting and deporting her. They bound and gagged her, as a result of which she died. As I understand it, the two police officers were at that time investigated by the Police Complaints Authority and faced criminal charges; the immigration officers did not. In that respect, what is the difference between police officers and immigration officers? They were present at the same time. There is no point in saying, "We have the immigration audit body which will examine such complaints". If, for example, an immigration officer indicates that a case similar to that of Joy Gardner has been investigated by the Immigration Service, what is needed is an independent body that can effectively look at whether or not the powers have been abused.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para17"></a>I do not want to repeat the argument that I put forward about the immigration audit committee, on which the Government seems to place so much emphasis. However, perhaps I may make some very basic points about it which the Minister did not dispute on the last occasion that I spoke about it. The audit body does not investigate individual complaints. It simply supervises and calls for the files to find out whether or not a proper investigation has been carried out. It does not consider whether or not an investigation was undertaken. It has no power to discipline. If it wishes to discipline, the matter has to be referred back to the Immigration Service, which has its own internal procedure to determine what will happen to a particular individual who has abused his or her power. If the machinery is so internal, who can have any confidence that people outside will ever know the final outcome of the procedure?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para18"></a>It is a little known body. I would bet that if one went out on to the street and asked the first 50 people one met if they knew anything about the immigration audit body, none of them would have a clue what one was talking about.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para19"></a>There is a need for openness in the system and a need for an independent investigation when complaints of this nature emerge. My amendment meets all those points. It seeks to protect immigration officers as much as it seeks to deal with those who are in breach of the disciplinary code. The three people appointed as <P>


<a name="column_851"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 851</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>audit members could easily be incorporated within the existing structure of the PCA and the service could still continue to investigate. One would be giving it an independent element to determine within the balance of probability whether there has been a breach of the disciplinary code. If there has been a breach, at least an independent body will be able to say to the Immigration Service what kind of disciplinary action should be taken.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para20"></a>The immigration audit body that was referred to on Report does not necessarily deal with the actions of the entry-clearance officers who operate at British posts abroad. We are talking now about immigration officers here--but who is responsible for the actions of the entry-clearance officers abroad? I mentioned what we found some years ago when we investigated some of the files. A substantial part of the control mechanism does not take place in this country; it takes place abroad. The visa system stops people from coming to this country. How are people to complain if they feel that they have been treated unfairly by the operation and administration of the immigration control procedures?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-32_para21"></a>We cannot have confidence in internal machinery. We need to develop machinery in which the public have confidence. At the same time, we are talking about a need for fairness, dignity and justice in the way we deal with people of different colours who are trying to come to this country, legitimately in many cases. That is the least we can expect from setting up a body such as the Police Complaints Authority, with members qualified in immigration matters, which can determine whether the service operates fairly, justly and with dignity. If we reject the amendment we will deny ourselves the right to talk about justice and fairness as far as concerns our procedures. I beg to move.

<A NAME="91102-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I have great sympathy with the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, especially in relation to aberrant activity on the part of immigration officers abroad. However, I am not convinced that the machinery he has chosen to deal with the problem is either adequate or right. To graft on to the police complaints procedure something of this nature is misguided. I understand that it was necessary to do this within the compass of the debate, but in terms of acceptance of the amendment it would be a misjudgment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para0"></a>Perhaps I may ask my noble friend who is to reply to the debate what action can be taken in the circumstances described by the noble Lord in his opening speech. If aberrant behaviour is indulged in--and I am convinced it is--what swift remedy applies? One does not want to see situations that drag on and become purposeless because of the long passage of time.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para1"></a>It is important to establish some form of independent body to deal with such matters promptly and with understanding, staffed by people with experience of immigration and asylum issues, as has been called for. Furthermore, it is important for the <P>


<a name="column_852"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 852</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reputation of this country. From my own experience--admittedly it was some time ago when I was in practice and dealing with immigration matters--I know that when offensive conduct does occur it is essential for it to be dealt with. It is damaging to the country if a festering sore is allowed to develop because of a few--it is right to say only a few--aberrant immigration officials.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para2"></a>I urge the noble Lord to recognise that this is a very different problem from that which underlay the setting up of the Police Complaints Authority. That form of machinery would be wrong, but the noble Lord's arguments are compelling.

<P>
<A NAME="91102-33_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, a number of years ago, two of my undergraduate contemporaries married each other. They went to live in Hong Kong, where they had a son. I remember asking them whether they were afraid that when they wanted to come back to England, their son might have trouble with British immigration control. They replied very simply, "No, he's white." If they said that, and I could not tell them that they were unjustified to think that way, what might one think if one's own relatives daily had experience of the kind of action envisaged here?
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para3"></a>I cannot stress enough how important it is that all concerned with the enforcement of the law--that includes immigration and entry clearance officers to a far greater extent than ever before--retain the confidence of the whole community in which they enforce the law. If officers of the law come to be seen as the agents of one part of the community and not of the whole, it is the beginning of a slippery slope leading to the situation described in the Patten Report. I do not ever want to see mainland Britain descend all the way down that slope. The amendment of my noble friend will erect an avalanche break on that slope, and it will erect the break in a place where it will be extremely valuable and is much needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para4"></a>If the Minister listened carefully to my noble friend's statistics, he will have heard that very far from all complaints are justified. There will be circumstances when even in the short term the Government may be very glad to have such an amendment on the statute book.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend may recall that in the 1970s I was an active caseworker on behalf of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. That was when Ministers had far greater areas of discretion which they could exercise in relation to immigration matters. I must have dealt with literally thousands of cases in those years. When people complained of racism or offensive behaviour by immigration officers, at the time the only thing that one could do was to take up the matter with the Minister concerned. Presumably that is still the case. One would write, and no doubt others in the JCWI were equally assiduous in taking up cases with Ministers. I can honestly say that in all the years I worked on those cases, not one single allegation was ever confirmed. Not one immigration officer was <P>


<a name="column_853"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 853</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disciplined, dismissed or suffered any penalty in respect of the allegations made by the clients with whom we dealt. If the Minister cares to ask the JCWI, he will find that my words are true of the whole of its experience.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, with respect, I think that the noble Lord is perhaps guilty of some slight exaggeration. I cannot point to the cases now, because it is such a long time since I was in the House of Commons, but I can distinctly recall instances where it was said that the matter would be pursued vis-a-vis the officer who was alleged to have committed the offensive conduct. Perhaps the noble Lord is reflecting a position on the basis of his own experience, but it is not one which I recall entirely myself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure whether I was unlucky or whether I am accurately remembering what happened at the time. But I certainly do not recall ever winning such a case. Obviously, many allegations of this kind are not made in good faith. The person has lost his application to come to the United Kingdom and feels aggrieved. He may feel that it was because of racism on the part of someone in the Immigration Service. If one said that 95 per cent of the cases were attributable to those reasons, there would still be a nasty residue of 5 per cent that one felt were due to the characteristics of the immigration officers concerned. But there was no way of getting to the bottom of the matter. Once the Minister in charge of immigration at the Home Office, or at the Foreign Office as the case may be--my noble friend said that the point applies to entry certificate officers in overseas posts--had said that the matter had been thoroughly investigated and he had found no truth in the allegation, as a Member of this House or of another place one had come to the end of the process. There was nowhere else to appeal and there was no independent procedure or mechanism by which one could get at the files, as one can in the case of the prisons ombudsman.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para5"></a>If someone in prison has a complaint against prison officers, he can go to an official who has power to question all the people who know something about the case. He can look at the papers and reach a conclusion. My noble friend is asking for a similar procedure that will apply to immigration officers. I hope that when people in the immigration and nationality department read this debate they will not say that your Lordships are trying to get at them. I hope they will understand that what we are seeking is merely a procedure which applies to many other parts of the public service.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para6"></a>Perhaps I may take the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, back to our Report stage debate on 20th October when I pointed out that if the Home Office were to accept designation under Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act it would be possible to examine discrimination by immigration officers in the Province. Under Section 75, if the Home Office is one of the designated public bodies it has to carry out an assessment of its own compliance with the equality provisions of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. That would apply not only to discrimination in relation to race but it extends even <P>


<a name="column_854"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 854</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>into gender and sexual orientation. It could well be that if later on the Home Office became subject to this procedure in Northern Ireland we would have a mechanism for testing its fairness and compliance with the equality provisions that we should like to see it observe. However, in the rest of the United Kingdom there would still be no mechanism.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para7"></a>Even if the Minister cannot accept my noble friend's amendment as it stands I hope he will be able to tell the House that the Government will introduce a procedure or mechanism which enables complaints to be heard by an independent authority so that people can at least be satisfied that when they think there is racism or there has been offensive behaviour they can obtain some remedy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-33_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton </B>  : My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia is to be congratulated on his persistence and determination, and perhaps also on his lateral thinking on this issue. He has skilfully returned to a subject that he raised in Committee and on Report. I know that he feels strongly about it. I, too, share his desire that immigration officers should be clearly accountable for their actions when exercising their powers. An effective complaints system is vital to maintaining public confidence in the way they operate. Noble Lords on both sides of the House have made that point in a compelling way. The Government would not be seeking to introduce new powers unless we were entirely satisfied that such oversight existed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para8"></a>However, I cannot agree that establishing a statutory system or requiring the Police Complaints Authority to investigate complaints against immigration officers would be right. Noble Lords may possibly need to be reminded that the Police Complaints Authority does not investigate complaints; it merely supervises. The Complaints Audit Committee does the same, but with one critical difference. The Complaints Audit Committee, whose application is within the Immigration Service, provides much closer supervision by examining each and every case in detail and on its merits.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para9"></a>My concern--and it is one that we have long held--is that we need to have a sense of proportion in relation to the complaints process. That is an important factor. More importantly, I should be fearful that, in the light of experience, the noble Lord's proposal would work against the best interests of those whom he deems to be in need of assistance under the terms of his proposal.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para10"></a>As I advised the House at Report stage, an independently and objectively monitored system for overseeing complaints against the Immigration Service is already in place. Listening to some of the comments in this debate, it might almost be imagined that we have no system for the investigation of complaints.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para11"></a>We need a system that serves the complainant first and foremost--and we believe that we have such a system; one under which quick action to eradicate malpractice is possible; which is flexible enough to respond to different types of complaint; and which delivers conclusive results. The system that is currently <P>


<a name="column_855"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 855</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in place works. It is not failing. In over 30 per cent of cases, complaints are upheld--compared with, on the admission of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, a figure for the Police Complaints Authority of just 10 per cent of complaints upheld. Those who have been found guilty of an offence have been warned, or otherwise disciplined. I am advised that many have been dismissed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para12"></a>We do not jump around, celebrate, wave our hands and advertise those facts widely in public. We quietly get on with the business of investigating such complaints properly and prosecuting them through our internal complaints process. Silence as a means of frustrating investigators has not been an issue. We have been able to apologise or compensate through ex gratia payments where complaints have been upheld quickly--in a matter of weeks, not months or years, as might happen with a more cumbersome statutory system.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para13"></a>The immigration complaints system is independent. It is not aligned to that of the police. It has been in place since 1994 and is tried and tested. Each year it improves a little more, spreads its wings a little further, and public confidence in it is clearly growing. We do not want to lose that. That is why we are giving the Complaint Audit Committee an enhanced role in monitoring complaints arising out of the exercise of new powers contained in Part VII of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, has proposed that the Police Complaints Authority should be required to investigate all complaints against immigration officers exercising their powers under the immigration Acts. Again, I respectfully point out that the Police Act, to which the new clause set out in Amendment No. 58 refers, does not extend the power to investigate complaints to the PCA. The role of the PCA is, as I said, merely to supervise the investigation of certain categories of complaint and to review disciplinary proceedings arising out of substantiated complaints. The PCA is not resourced to investigate complaints; nor is it legally empowered to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-33_para15"></a>I respectfully draw the attention of noble Lords to the fact that 90 per cent of complaints against the Immigration Service--there were only 370 in 1998--relate to issues of service quality which can be sorted out quickly without the need for legislative sledgehammers. The types of person the noble Lord envisages sitting as "immigration members" of the authority already carry out this function as members of the Immigration Complaints Audit Committee. They are appointed by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary as respected members of the community with experience in race relations, community relations and immigration law. It is worth repeating that members of the committee have unfettered access to every single complaint investigation and are free to make critical comment on the quality of the investigation and its conclusions. They have access to Ministers and produce an annual report for the Secretary of State which is placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

<A NAME = "91102-33_para16"></a>Any complaint which alleges criminal activity by a member of the Immigration Service will be investigated independently, and quite properly, by the police. Immigration officers will be legally accountable in the exercise of their powers. Powers of entry, search and seizure are limited by the provisions contained in the Bill. They will be required to have regard to the relevant provisions of the PACE codes of practice when exercising these new powers. The codes not only govern the exercise of statutory powers but also serve to regulate the manner in which officers conduct their duties. Immigration officers will be no different. If they breach operational guidelines, they will be accountable and properly disciplined. They have been in the past and will continue to be. We believe that the enhanced procedures are capable of handling the type of complaint that may arise out of the exercise of the new powers contained in this Bill. Nevertheless, we have not closed the door to further changes and improvements once we have had the opportunity to examine the impact of the new powers through the limited introduction that we propose.

<A NAME="91102-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for giving way. Do these procedures apply equally to immigration officers who serve abroad? How can delay be minimised in relation to complaints that arise abroad?

<P>
<A NAME="91102-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, the powers introduced by Part VII will not be used by entry clearance officers who work abroad. I am not sure whether that completely answers my noble friend; if not, I shall return to it later or provide a written response. We shall continue to keep the procedures under review. If they require further strengthening, we shall do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-34_para0"></a>During Report stage in this House, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, stated that the powers of immigration officers were not the same as those of police officers. She suggested that there should be a separate complaints authority staffed in a different way from the PCA by people with some understanding of different countries and their cultures. She rightly said that none of that was met by a proposal simply to extend the scope of the Police Complaints Authority. Only the powers to be given to immigration officers under Part VII of this Bill are similar to police powers. They are also similar to powers held by others in the enforcement field, notably HM Customs.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-34_para1"></a>However, immigration officers are not police officers, and there is no intention that they should become so. Their modus operandi is, and will continue to be, different. Although the coercive elements of the powers are there, it is anticipated that they will be rarely used. I agree with the noble Baroness that a separate complaints system for the Immigration Service is right for the very reasons she expressed, but I believe that it is already in place and is operating well.
<P>


<a name="column_857"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 857</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-34_para2"></a>It is in everyone's interest, not least that of immigration officers themselves, that these powers are underpinned with proper levels of accountability and control. The codes of practice, together with the safeguards written into the legislation, the enhanced complaints procedures and the comprehensive training programme that the officers who exercise the new powers will be required to undertake, provide a level of accountability that is both workable and proportionate. It protects those whom the new powers must be used against while providing the Immigration Service with a clear and explicit framework within which to operate. I suggest that the new clause set out in Amendment No. 58 is seriously misleading, damaging and counter-productive. It is not required to ensure its objective, and we believe that to introduce it would be a profound mistake. Therefore, I cannot invite noble Lords to support the amendment or the consequential amendment to the Police Act 1996 provided by Amendment No. 85.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-34_para3"></a>I understand and sympathise with the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, about the need to eliminate and tackle racism within any of our services. We all acknowledge and understand that point. The Macpherson Report has pointed us powerfully in that direction. In the Home Office, we fully understand and appreciate it. We will not, and cannot, tolerate racism in any of our services. We do not believe that the objective underlying the amendment will best serve those upon whom it is designed to have an impact. I respectfully suggest that the noble Lord withdraws the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="91102-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I have an answer for the noble Lord relating to entry clearance officers abroad. I have an example. If the noble Lord will bear with me, I am more than happy to cite an example of how the Immigration Service works quickly and effectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-34_para4"></a>An Indian family sought to embark at Delhi. They were resident in the United Kingdom. At Delhi airport, the airline official refused to allow them to board as the stamp in the person's passport was unclear. The family was required to stay an extra night at Delhi airport until approval from the UK for their readmission was given. The head of the family understandably complained. The Immigration Service upheld his complaint and paid him &#163;300 for the additional expense and inconvenience incurred.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-34_para5"></a>Approval for the payment was given by the head of the complaints unit under delegated powers. It was all sorted out within four weeks of the complaint. Under the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, the Police Complaints Authority would have to investigate such a complaint. I wonder how long that would take.
<P>


<a name="column_858"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 858</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-34_para6"></a>I trust that that example gives some feel for how the system currently works and how it might work in the future if the amendment were to be approved by this House today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-34_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, can he say a few words about the acceptance or otherwise by the Home Office of designation under Section 75 of the Northern Ireland legislation of 1998? I asked the noble Lord that question on Report. He said that no decision had yet been made. However, bearing in mind that the section comes into operation on 1st January 2000, time is getting very short for assessment by the Home Office of its compliance with the equality provisions under that section of the Northern Ireland Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord returns to a familiar theme. We are giving active consideration to the case for formal designation of Home Office functions and hope to make a statement shortly. It may be that formal designation is not the best way forward, but we are looking at the issue. We would want to establish effective arrangements to promote full equality in Northern Ireland in the spirit of that legislation. I trust that that answers the noble Lord's point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-34_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for the explanation he has given. He and I come from the same stable in Brighton. However, I want to tell him that I was a councillor well before his time. He was simply a student and I hope that he will bow to my experience on matters about which I know much more than he does.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-34_para7"></a>This is the point I seek to make. I have a British passport. I am sure a number of my colleagues will vouch for this. Every time I come through the Immigration Service in this country my wife, who is Scottish, walks in front of me but my passport is taken out of my hand and occasionally held up to the light to make sure the photograph resembles me. I feel so undignified. I feel as though I am being picked on for no other reason than that the colour of my skin is different. The same applies to hundreds of Jamaican people. They wish to come to this country for a holiday or for Christmas but are locked up for about three or four days at Gatwick airport.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-34_para8"></a>The example that the noble Lord has given is not about an individual immigration officer in Delhi but about the Immigration Service which failed to provide proper care for that family. There is much weakness in the Minister's argument. Perhaps I may give an example. I cited 20,000 cases. I worked at the Police Complaints Authority so I know what it is all about. The Minister referred to 30 per cent of the complaints, but he did not give the numbers. The number which the immigration audit body investigated was fewer than 300. Millions of passengers pass through this country and there are only 300 complaints as against 20,000 complaints against police officers. That gives one an <P>


<a name="column_859"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 859</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>idea that in terms of numbers the argument cannot be justified.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-34_para9"></a>I have worked at the Police Complaints Authority and therefore I hope that the Minister will bow to my experience. That authority does not necessarily investigate, but it supervises. Not only does it supervise investigations; in serious cases it can direct what should happen in an investigation and then recommend the appropriate action. I am not disputing why the Immigration Service should not examine cases, but I am saying that there ought to be an external body which has experience because the same powers are being given to police and immigration officers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-34_para10"></a>Is the immigration audit body experienced in trying to examine the police-type power within the Immigration Service? It is not, yet the Government are relying so much on that. I do not want to say more. I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he has not shut the door. And he will not shut the door because I shall be shouting and harassing him at every opportunity until such time as we have statutory legislation which is more accountable and open and which cares about people's dignity and respect. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<BR>
(2) For the purposes of calculating whether the maximum period of detention has been reached, each and every period for which a detained person has been held in a detention centre or prison, whether or not the detention has been continuous, shall be taken into account.").

<A NAME = "91102-34_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, when we discussed the amendment earlier tonight, the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General was kind enough to say that the Government shared its aims.

<P>

<A NAME = "91102-34_para13"></a>However, will the administrative instructions given to immigration officers be continuously reviewed with a view to tightening them up as regards detention?

It would be less than gracious if I did not say in that context that Ministers, in particular the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, and the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General, who is not at present in his place, and indeed the Home <P>


<a name="column_865"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 865</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Secretary, have shown a great willingness to listen, a great deal of patience and a great deal of consideration in a situation where all of us know that we are facing an extremely difficult problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-36_para9"></a>We have faced not only the problem of handling a great many people who wish to come to this country as asylum seekers, but also the real difficulties arising from information technology. That is not the Government's fault; the problems predate their time, and have not been made any easier as a result of the technology having to be introduced in a difficult situation. We understand that and we sympathise. Every time I look at my own personal computer swallowing my immortal words when I cannot do anything to stop it, I think of the Home Office and my heart bleeds just a little.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-36_para10"></a>I pay tribute also to the noble Lord, Lord Cope, and his colleague, the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, and very much also to the Cross-Benchers, the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, the noble Lords, Lord Hylton and Lord Alton, and others, for their contributions to these debates.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-36_para11"></a>I conclude with two points. I am sure that noble Lords on other Benches, not least on the Benches of the right reverend Prelate and his colleagues, the Bishops' Benches, and the noble Lord, Lord Sheppard--with whom I still dimly associate that particular outstanding role--share with us the sense that we have two matters greatly in mind. The first is the noble, outstanding tradition in this country over many decades of accepting voices of dissent and voices fighting for liberty and freedom. The mind goes back as far as people like Kossuth and Garibaldi. It is a great tradition which most of us would not wish to see brought to an end.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-36_para12"></a>In this Bill there are many powers which affect directly not only the liberties of people who seek to come to this country but also our own liberties. There are precedents which could be disturbing if not brought under control. Therefore, we have had in mind not only the liberties of asylum seekers but also those of our own countrymen and women in the moves that we have made on the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-36_para13"></a>Again, I thank Ministers for their patience and I thank other colleagues who have been kind enough to sit through and take part in those very long sessions. We are grateful to all those involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-36_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I join in the thanks expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, to the Minister and noble Lords on all sides of the House who have taken part in these long debates.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-36_para14"></a>This Bill leaves the House in a form very different from that in which it arrived. Most of the changes made in the course of our debates are improvements. We continue to share the general intentions of the Government that immigration decisions should be fairer, faster and firmer. But I am not confident that the new machinery established by this Bill will work smoothly.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-36_para15"></a>It has been quite apparent to us that the legislation was put together under great pressure, and the number of government amendments testify to that. There were <P>


<a name="column_866"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 866</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>another 50 or so government amendments today. Whenever we have asked questions about the machinery, which will have to be the most elaborate and sensitive machinery UK-wide, the answers have not been very satisfactory.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-36_para16"></a>New arrangements, new legislation and new systems in government usually slow things down, at least at the start. I am not hopeful that this Bill will be an exception to that rule. The Home Secretary inherited a difficult situation and made it worse. This Bill fills me with foreboding. Nevertheless, I believe that it should pass.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-37_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I associate myself with the thanks which have already been expressed, in particular to Ministers for the courtesy which they have shown.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para0"></a>However, I wish to draw attention to a substantive point which arises from a letter to The Times on 28th October from Professor Goodwin-Gill, professor of international refugee law at the University of Oxford. He made important points about the procedure for handling asylum applications and, secondly, about the size of the backlog. It seems that the Immigration and Nationality Directorate has hardly changed its methods over the past 25 years, since a time when applications were far fewer and the backlog was tiny by today's standards. Asylum seekers are still interviewed and their cases are then considered largely on paper. It is difficult to assess credibility on paper and the applicant often has no opportunity to clear up inconsistencies or to remove doubts until the case reaches appeal. The success rate at appeal shows that time and resources are being wasted.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para1"></a>On Second Reading I asked for better quality decisions and I now urge the Government to improve the system to achieve that end. Improvements should allow for advice and representation at the earliest possible stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para2"></a>Not long ago, the backlog of asylum cases stood at 78,000. It may now have risen to 90,000. Whatever the precise figure, it is surely something of a national disgrace, particularly after 2&#189; years of a new and reforming Government. What should be done? I suggest that the oldest asylum applications should be examined and that one or two years' worth of them should be given full refugee status or exceptional leave to remain, unless they have criminal records, charges outstanding against them or can be shown to be security risks.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para3"></a>The next block of applications up to say 1st January 1999 should then be examined. If those cases conform with the three principles that I explained at Second Reading, those people should immediately be admitted, subject to the safeguards I have just mentioned. I remind your Lordships that the three principles are: family reunion with close relatives already here, a good knowledge of English, and the support of an existing ethnic, religious or linguistic community. Cases not having any of those three kinds of support would remain to be dealt with in the usual way.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para4"></a>Without radical measures of the kind I have outlined, I cannot see that the vast backlog will be reduced within any reasonable length of time. To take a determined but <P>


<a name="column_867"></a>

<B>2 Nov 1999 : Column 867</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>principled approach of this nature would save vast amounts of official time, many appeals and much expense. It would open the way for introducing better procedures for the future. Professor Goodwin-Gill said that the Bill was irrelevant to the real needs that we face. I agree and I ask the Government to produce better policies than we have had so far in this Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I consider this an important Bill, one of the most important that the Government have introduced since they came to power. I want to congratulate the Attorney-General and the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, for the way in which they have piloted the Bill. The subject is confusing and we have dealt with it in far too detailed a way. One realises the pressures that the Government have had to face.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para5"></a>Over many generations we in our country have prided ourselves on the welcome we have given to people who have come from countries where they have been oppressed. However, in recent years the numbers of immigrants--especially asylum seekers but also others--have grown so much that the problems have increased due to the sheer weight of numbers. I have collected a number of relevant statistics, but I shall spare your Lordships as they are all ascertainable. However, I mention that in the past 12 months the number of immigrants, including refugees, has increased by more than 80,000. That is the size of a big town. In addition, even if we have no further immigration, we are told that in the next quarter of a century we have to build another million houses. We are told that in the south of England we shall need the equivalent of five cities the size of Southampton and that they will take up much more of our green and pleasant land.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para6"></a>Our first duty as parliamentarians is to the people who are already here, the native people and those whom we have welcomed and who have now become thoroughly absorbed. They nearly all live in crowded areas. It will not help them if we allow the pressure to increase by too free an admission of people from abroad. For that reason the Government deserve full support for introducing the Bill and in enforcing it. Enforcement will be difficult because the number of asylum seekers, genuine and bogus, whose cases have not yet been decided is now, we are told, 100,000. I trust that the Government will be strong-minded about this matter when increasing the facilities for hearing the cases. That must be done. I am sure that the manpower can be found. The alternative is to relax control, to allow unjustified asylum seekers to remain, and to add to our social problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para7"></a>The Bill is vitally important and I wish the Government well in enforcing it.

We have just been told by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, that perhaps as many as 100,000 cases are still outstanding. The Government have said that the target should be to speed things up radically. But the average waiting time at the moment is about 20 months. That is about 10 times the Government target.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para8"></a>For me there is a real sense of deja vu. I listened to the end of the debate in another place four years ago when I served on the standing committee that looked at the previous asylum Bill. I realise, and I regret, that many of the remedies offered by the previous administration are now contained in this legislation as well. The real challenge is to reduce that backlog, which will only be done by providing resources and personnel. We have made a huge error by putting resources into creating things such as the voucher system which, I suspect, we shall have to revisit again in another two or three years with yet another asylum and immigration Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para9"></a>That said, it would be churlish not to pay tribute to those who have given so much of their time and have been patient and generous in dealing with the many points raised during the progress of this Bill. I am personally grateful to Ministers such as the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, and the noble and learned Lord the Attorney General for the very patient way in which they have deal with the issues raised by my noble friend on the Cross-Benches and myself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91102-37_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hacking: </B>   My Lords, during the passage of this Bill through the House I have concentrated on a small but, I believe, important area; namely, the relationship between the Immigration Service and the port operators. The sadness, as this Bill has gathered pace through your Lordships' House, is that the consultation process has, alas, been neglected.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para10"></a>However, during the latter stages after returning from the Summer Recess, my noble friend has been of considerable assistance. He has assisted us, for example, in understanding the basic service that port operators wish to know about and which is offered by the Immigration Service.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para11"></a> I had the opportunity to see the document only after Report stage. It was distributed on 15th October and did not reach me by the Report stage on 18th October. I have now had the opportunity to read it. I ask my noble friend to ask his officials to revisit the document. It is written in rather complex language and sets off on entirely the wrong foot. Paragraph 2 reads,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The level at which the 'Basic Service' will be provided will be subject to an overarching qualification based upon an analysis by the Immigration Service of the risk to the integrity of the immigration control generated by passenger movement at a port".

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para13"></a>The first reaction to that rather long and verbose statement is, phew! But much more basic is the fact that it is not focusing on what the basic service is. It is essential that the Immigration Service itself should operate efficiently so that it can scrutinise, as is necessary, those who are seeking entry into our country. At the same time it should operate in such a way that all arrivals into the United Kingdom, whether UK or European Union citizens, are processed efficiently and fairly with reasonable promptness. That is entirely absent from the statement I read. I should therefore be grateful if my noble friend could visit this. I notice that at the beginning of the document it is described as a draft document representing the views of officials and that it has not been cleared by Ministers. Perhaps it could now have the eye of my noble friend and his colleagues.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-37_para14"></a>My noble friend kindly wrote to me on the other point I raised and I shall just briefly identify it again; I take the hint about briefness. I suggested that there should be an efficient dispute resolution process. My noble friend said that the matter was still under consideration. It can be efficiently set up in a way that is satisfactory to the Secretary of State and the airport operators and I hope that attention will be focused on that. Again, this is an area where, alas, there has been a lack of consultation. With that, I wish the Bill a happy journey.

<A NAME="91102-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I had not intended to say much at this stage, but your Lordships have tempted me; I feel driven and compelled to make a long, interesting and perhaps incisive speech!
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-38_para0"></a>Perhaps I may make one or two points. My noble friend Lord Hacking raised two issues; they are both under consideration. I am happy to continue the dialogue and correspondence with him to try to resolve those matters in a way which we both find satisfactory.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-38_para1"></a>I should like to follow the gracious way in which the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, so kindly and generously thanked Ministers and other Members of your Lordships' House for the way they conducted themselves throughout the passage of this Bill. As most noble Lords are aware, I came rather late to this Bill. I am still learning and the learning curve is steep, but I am enjoying the experience. This has been one of those experiences which has been more pressing and demanding than many of the others I have had to confront in the short time that I have been privileged to be at the Dispatch Box.

<A NAME = "91102-38_para2"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness for the courteous way in which she and her colleagues on the opposition Benches--I include in that noble Lords on the Conservative Benches--conducted themselves throughout the different stages of this Bill. We focused on the practical. We have been hard-headed. As Ministers, we tried to answer as precisely as we could the questions and difficult and wicked issues raised from all quarters of the House. I trust that we have done that in the best traditions of your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-38_para3"></a>Matters of substance were raised when I moved that the Bill do now pass. I can say, particularly to the noble Lords, Lord Alton and Lord Hylton, in relation to the way we see this legislation working, that we inherited, as a government, something of a mess. That is widely accepted and acknowledged. We all know that we need to improve upon the quality of the service. We all accept that resources are an issue. It is for that reason that the Government seek to put in place legislation which is effective, firm and fair, and which will deliver a faster, better and more efficient service. We are committed to that. We have put in place measures which will release an additional &#163;120 million to the IND. We have put in place measures which will speed up the decision-making processes--everyone welcomed that--and we recently recruited 300 additional staff and plan to recruit 250 more.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-38_para4"></a>That is a fair indication of our commitment as a government to getting the immigration, nationality and asylum services on a firm, effective and efficient footing. We believe that this legislation will lead us in that general direction. We have put the resources in place to do it. We look forward to enjoying support from all quarters in making the new system work much better than that which went before. It is in no one's interest that we have a system that does not work; one that is ineffective, full of delay, chaos and inefficiency. Our staff have worked tirelessly to improve the situation and for that we must all be grateful.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102-38_para5"></a>My final thanks go to the officials who supported us throughout that process.

My honourable friend the Minister of State for the Home Department (Ms Roche) has today issued a consultation paper which sets out our proposals to help achieve these aims through partnerships between central and local government, the voluntary sector, local communities, including ethnic minority and refugee community organisations and the refugee communities themselves.

The current police requirement is based on a central Police National Computer register with feeders from and pointers to local police systems. This approach will make maximum use of the information currently available and will avoid the need for expensive re-keying of data. As a next step a detailed impact assessment will be carried out.

In line with the targets set in the SDR, it is committed to achieving that improvement and a number of initiatives are under way.
<P>

<A NAME = "91102w02_para2"></a>In recognition of the increasingly expeditionary nature of our tasks, the operational welfare package has been improved and the Service Families Task Force is addressing a variety of issues which create domestic difficulties for our personnel. The Army's Human Resources Strategy includes a six-month review of the effectiveness of present Army retention policies. This work, which is being conducted by external consultants, will listen to a wide range of opinions and make recommendations for improvements in the Army's personnel management policies.
