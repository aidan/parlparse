Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and
Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My Lords,
since 2002, there has been a drop of 85 per cent in the number of
families with children placed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation by
local housing authorities. In 2004, an order came into force which
prevents the use of such accommodation under the homelessness
legislation, unless there is no other accommodation available. Even
where that is the case, the family must be provided with more suitable
accommodation after six weeks at the
most.</p><p><a name="06110149000012"></a><b><a name="61101-0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06110149000940"></a>Lord
Northbourne:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
that encouraging Answer. I am sure she will agree that, for a young
couple trying to create a home for their new child, or a single mother,
bed-and-breakfast accommodation is a total disaster. I ask the
Government to do something that they rather like. Will they set
themselves a target to ensure that, within an agreed period, there is
no more bed-and-breakfast accommodation&#151;or perhaps one
month&#146;s temporary accommodation only&#151;for any family with
young
children?</p><p><a name="06110149000013"></a><b><a name="61101-0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06110149000941"></a>Baroness
Andrews:</b> My Lords, under the homelessness
legislation at the moment roughly only 100 families with children are
left in bed-and-breakfast accommodation for more than six weeks. Of
course, that is 100 too many. Although some of them are there by
negotiated choice, we would very much like it not used in that sense. I
can tell the noble Lord&#151;he will like it&#151;that our effort
has moved very much to the prevention of homelessness. For children,
who bear the brunt of homelessness, that must be better. We have put
&#163;200 million into prevention strategies that range from helping
families with mediation, for example, to helping them with rent
deposits to manage their debt, so that they can keep children in the
family home as far as
possible.</p><p><a name="06110149000014"></a><b><a name="61101-0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="06110149000942"></a>Lord

Scott of Needham Market:</b> My Lords, is the noble
Baroness aware of the evidence given by Shelter to the Select Committee
in another place that government emphasis on assisting home purchase
has been to the detriment of social housing for people in overcrowded

vulnerable members of society, home purchase is not the right option

Andrews:</b> My Lords, in housing policy, one wants
to meet aspiration as well as need. We are encouraging those people who
want to own their own home as much as possible through the key worker
living schemes and so on, but we have not neglected social housing. We
have provided 75,000 new social rented homes between 2005-06 and
2007-08. That is a major increase of 50 per cent and constitutes 10,000
extra social homes a year. Of course, we will be pressing the
Chancellor hard during the Comprehensive Spending

Hanham:</b> My Lords, is the Minister aware of the
considerable number of priority categories that have to be taken into
account by housing authorities in fulfilling their statutory obligation
not to house the homeless in bed-and-breakfast accommodation? Does she
think that satisfying those requirements militates against local
authorities&#146; ability to place families together in permanent
accommodation at the earliest stage of
homelessness?</p><p><a name="06110149000019"></a><b><a name="61101-0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="06110149000947"></a>Baroness
Andrews:</b> My Lords, again, one strives for a
balance. Within the categories for priority needs are extremely
vulnerable people: a person aged 16 or 17; a person under 21 who was,
but is no longer, looked after; a person aged 21 or more who is
vulnerable as the result of being looked after; a person who is
vulnerable as having been a member of Her Majesty's forces. Those are
categories of vulnerability and local authorities are to be
congratulated on how they try to meet those needs alongside their other
housing
responsibilities.</p><p><a name="06110149000020"></a><b><a name="61101-0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="06110149000948"></a>Baroness

success in some areas. For example, rough sleeping is down by 73 per
cent. I have already given the figures for bed and breakfast, but we
have 130,000 children in temporary accommodation, which is far too many

compared with this time last year, and we have a target to reduce it to
50,000&#151;to halve it. We are trying hard through our investment to
ensure that local authorities have a choice of options in which to
place those families for settled

of circumstances for BME families that puts them in a cycle of
deprivation. We have created a fund of &#163;3 million to identify
good practice and support for ethnic minorities. That builds on a guide
that we published for development in 2005. We are producing information
through videos, for example. I refer my noble friend to the Tower
Hamlets youth homelessness prevention project, which is an interesting
example, addressing young people with their families and approaching
the prevention of homelessness in a holistic

shows variable take-up in many areas, but it is an invaluable project.
With the additional money going into children's centres and a growing
expertise in the field, we are beginning to be more effective in
reaching the very hard to reach. I am sure that housing authorities
want to play their part in that as
well.</p><p><a name="06110149000026"></a><b><a name="61101-0001.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="06110149000954"></a>Lord

is disproportionate and unmerited? We were so caring of a small group

that we brought in legislation that would relieve them of a burden. Do
the Government not have the same desire for equity for this small group

McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I am aware that
these matters were debated extensively when the civil partnerships
legislation went through the House; I was around for part of the
proceedings, but not for the earlier part. We need to see this in
context. We need to understand that 94 per cent of estates pay no
inheritance tax whatever; that the inheritance tax threshold exceeds
the value of the vast majority of homes; that not all estates include a
house; and that very few comprise a house and no other assets. Most
beneficiaries already have their own house and generally sell any house
that they may inherit. The inheritance tax due on a house may be paid
in instalments over 10 years, provided that the house is not sold. That
offers a raft of opportunities to avoid the circumstances that the
noble Baroness is

Baroness, Lady Wilcox, is drawing a comparison between parents and
their children in relationships, or siblings in relationships, and
their liability for inheritance tax. But if the Chancellor of the
Exchequer were to consider with Christmas benevolence changing the tax
regime, would the much closer analogy not be between married couples

McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord makes
an interesting point but one that illustrates, once we get into this,
the number of combinations that are possible and the difficulties in
changing tax legislation so that it is precise and does not create a
situation where inheritance tax in effect no longer applies at all. The
legal status of any relationship is a constitutional matter. If it were
decided that any other relationship should be afforded the same legal
status as that of married couples or those in civil partnerships, Her
Majesty&#146;s Treasury would have to consider the appropriate tax
treatment.</p><p><a name="06110149000039"></a><b><a name="61101-0001.htm_spnew27"></a><a name="06110149000967"></a>Baroness

whether there is any truth in the statement made by a member of his

unmarried couples with children the same benefits as married couples
with children&#151;in other words, they would fall within the ambit
of not having to pay inheritance tax, whereas people in long-term
relationships as close-blood relatives looking after their parents
would not? If that is not discrimination, I ask the Minister what
is.</p><p><a name="06110149000040"></a><b><a name="61101-0001.htm_spnew28"></a><a name="06110149000968"></a>Lord

proposals on the specifics stated by the noble Baroness, but, if there
are constitutional proposals to change the legal status of individuals,
it may be that the tax legislation should follow. However, we are not
yet in that position.</p><p><a name="06110149000041"></a><b><a name="61101-0001.htm_spnew29"></a><a name="06110149000969"></a>Lord

deciding which relatives would be included, what period of cohabitation
would have to be taken into account, and what would happen to
half-brothers and half-sisters. Until you could be precise about such

the current take from inheritance tax&#151;about &#163;3.6

McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, it depends over
which period you look at house prices. Between 1986 and 2005, for
example, the inheritance tax threshold increased by more than the rise
in average house prices. If you start to look at specific assets and
take them out, rather than to up-rate the threshold&#151;the
Chancellor has indicated an exemption threshold increase to
&#163;325,000 in 2009-10&#151;you begin to distort the market. In
particular, people would hang on to private residences when they would
otherwise wish to trade down because they were a tax-privileged asset.

Since, unhappily, too many new immigrants are poorly paid by their

further on how the United States Department of Defense is engaging in

regarded as the main architect of pretty much all US activity on the

the House. We have excellent relations with the Pentagon at all levels.
At the highest level, the Secretary of State has regular discussions
with his opposite number; he met him most recently on 28 September at
the NATO Defence Ministers summit, at which they discussed a number of
issues. I think that it is clear that the United Kingdom has influenced
and continues to influence US policy on Iraq. For example, we have had
an effect on the conditions for transition in Iraq, which were drawn up
by the joint committee, on the strategy for the multinational division
in the south-east of the country, and on the negotiations on the
renewal of UN Security Council resolutions. We focus on outcomes, and
we can see the way in which the first of the provinces have achieved
transition in Iraq as evidence&#151;given that those were areas under
the leadership of the United Kingdom&#151;of our clear influence on
the US
Administration.</p><p><a name="06110149000070"></a><b><a name="61101-0002.htm_spnew56"></a><a name="06110149000998"></a>Lord

much influence we are having on the United States. However, does the

Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I beg to move that
the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 1 to which the Commons
have disagreed. I hope we can dispose of this amendment relatively
swiftly. When we last debated the issue of police force mergers on
Report, I indicated that, while the Government were no longer pursuing
the amalgamation of forces, it was necessary to retain the powers in
the Police Act 1996 for the Home Secretary to initiate
mergers, so that they were available as a backstop. When the matter was
debated in the other place on 24 October the shadow Minister for Police
Reform, Nick Herbert, sought five assurances on this issue. My
honourable friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community
Safety, Mr Tony McNulty, was happy to give a broad yes on all five
points.</p><p><a name="06110149000094"></a>For the record and for
the benefit of this House, I am ready to repeat those assurances.
First, I say again, enforced amalgamations will be a last resort, for
now we are looking at other means to narrow the protective services
gap. Secondly, of course a proper case for any future amalgamations
must be made. Indeed, the 1996 Act requires the Home Secretary to set
out his case for any merger. Thirdly, we accept that any proposals for
mergers must be subject to full public consultation and that this
should not be confined to the statutory four-month consultation period
required by the Police Act. Fourthly, on the question of parliamentary
scrutiny, merger orders initiated by the Home Secretary are subject to
the affirmative procedure under the Act, so a measure of scrutiny is
already built in. However, we are ready to consider additional
opportunities to debate any merger proposals. Finally, if we in the
Home Office have learnt anything from the previous experience, it is
that the financial implications, including the issue of precept
equalisation, must be fully resolved before any merger proposals are
finalised. I hope that in the light of these assurances the House will
now feel able to agree not to insist on this
amendment.</p><p><a name="06110149000095"></a>Moved, That the House
do not insist on its Amendment No. 1 to which the Commons have

Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, the Minister has
explained why she feels it appropriate for this House not to insist
upon its original amendment. My amendment would have ensured that the
Secretary of State could not lay a statutory instrument containing an
order regarding the alteration or merging of police areas unless that
course was requested by the police authorities that would be affected
by any changes. The other proviso was that the Secretary of State
believed it was right and in the interests of the efficiency and
effectiveness of policing. We objected to the Government&#146;s plans
to press ahead with forced mergers. When we argued the merits of our
case in Committee, the House agreed with us by a margin of 198 votes to
130, so I should put on the record, however briefly, the reasons why we
appear to be backing off from that strong position.</p><p><a name="06110149000097"></a>During the summer the Government
signalled that enforced mergers were going deeper and deeper into the
long grass. We remained concerned that they

attention had perhaps been drawn to other, more objectionable policies.
On Report I tabled an amendment on the importance of a cost benefit
analysis to ask the Minister to put on the record an assurance about
the Government&#146;s plans with regard to forced police
mergers.</p><p><a name="06110149000098"></a>The Minister set out
her assurances in detail on 9 October at cols. 61-62. We then
had the opportunity to consider her words very carefully. We believe
that the words she uttered before the House then, together with the
assurances put clearly on the record by her honourable friend Mr
McNulty in another place, provide sufficient reassurances for this
House to rely upon. That is why we have not tabled an amendment today
to object to the Government&#146;s Motion, which overturns the
decision of the House made in June. We remain convinced that mergers
should proceed at some future date if, and only if, they are with the
consent of all the police authorities concerned in that merger or
alteration, and if the Government have demonstrated persuasively that
the key principles set out by the Minister are met. In the interests of
time I will not repeat those principles
today.</p><p><a name="06110149000099"></a>With regard to the
financial implications referred to by the Minister, it is right that I
put on record my own concern about the announcement made by the Home
Office on Monday&#151;that it would pay police forces just &#163;4
million to reimburse them for the money they were forced to spend on
the abandoned police mergers programme, when the real costs incurred
were &#163;6.5 million. My own police force in Surrey is one of those
that is, as a consequence, unfairly treated, because of the capping of
payments to a maximum of &#163;100,000 per force. Surrey had to incur
expenditure of &#163;649,311. As Bob Jones, chairman of the
Association of Police Authorities, pointed out, the failure to
reimburse all the money was not just regrettable; the money police
authorities spent was money that would otherwise have been spent on
improving local policing for local communities.</p><p><a name="06110149000100"></a>We rely on the
assurances given by the Minister and by Mr McNulty. We therefore
believe that if the Government were to bring forward proposals for
forced mergers at some future date, this House would be justified in
relying upon those assurances and in taking a view on whether it should
take the somewhat unusual step of objecting to a statutory instrument
being made. In the mean time, for the reasons I have set out today, I
do not object to the Government&#146;s Motion.</p><h5><a name="06110149000579"></a>3.45

measure had been an extremely costly way of achieving very

great expense&#151;the relevant sum was more than
&#163;250,000&#151;as did my local force, North Yorkshire. We
should remember that the figure of nearly &#163;4 million set out in
the Statement reflects only the limited range of eligible costs
directly attributable to restructuring and is only a fraction of the
total sums involved in the very extensive and detailed work that was
undertaken by forces and authorities. This represents a lot of time,
effort and money, which has been diverted at the expense of real
policing. Since that time some excellent collaborative policing has
taken place. A very good example of that was demonstrated earlier this
month. I refer the Minister to a Thames Valley press release issued on
10 October, which
states:</p><ul><a name="06110149000298"></a>&#147;Officers from
across the south of England have arrested 14 people aged between their
mid-20s and mid-50s in a series of raids this morning in connection
with a series of crimes valued at over &#163;30
million.</ul><ul><a name="06110149000299"></a>The arrests, which
took place in Oxfordshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, are a
significant development for Operation Haul, which was set up in October
2005 jointly by Thames Valley Police, West Mercia Constabulary,
Warwickshire Police, Wiltshire Police and Gloucestershire Police to
target an organised crime network believed responsible for 23 serious
offences throughout the five force areas. Thames Valley Police
Assistant Chief Constable Francis Habgood, Operation Haul commander on
behalf of the five forces, said, &#145;The crimes being investigated
by Operation Haul include some of the highest profile&#151;and
highest value&#151;burglaries this country has ever
seen&#146;&#148;.</ul><a name="06110149000285"></a>That is
an excellent operation and shows exactly what police forces can do, and
what we said they could do when the Government put forward their ill
judged proposals on
mergers.<p><a name="06110149000103"></a>The five assurances
to which the noble Baroness referred, and to which the Minister again
referred, which were asked for in the other place and given by the
Minister for Policing, are important. I wholeheartedly support them.
For me the one that resonates is the need to ensure that adequate
consultation takes place. This consultation needs to listen to what is
being said by both the public and the experts. Merely paying lip
service to consultation, having predetermined the outcome, is
completely counterproductive, as I hope the Government have learnt.
Local identity matters to local people. They feel a bond with, and take
a pride in, their local police force which is based on this identity.
That is not to say that local identity is all that should be
considered, but minimising its value and ignoring alternatives which
might accommodate it is asking for trouble. The other assurances are
equally important. Clearly, any future proposals must take account of
what is allowable under financial rules in relation to precepting. They
must involve making a meticulously and preferably independently
evaluated and costed case. It must be a last resort that no other
approach will solve, otherwise the public will never be convinced that
some other way of doing things is not more important than their local
allegiance.</p>

<p><a name="06110149000104"></a>Finally, it must be
subject to detailed parliamentary scrutiny. It is, after all, a key

mergers. It is vital to ensure that there is adequate opportunity for a
robust debate to explore whether mergers might, at some point in
future, be sensible, and to address the other key criteria set out by
the noble Baroness. Half-baked proposals that do not meet those
criteria will not pass the test. With the promise of a gimlet-eyed
watching brief, I am reasonably content to leave matters regarding
mergers in the Government&#146;s hands for the

<p><a name="06110149000107"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My
Lords, I beg to move Motion B standing in the name of my noble friend
Lady Scotland. The Motion is that this House do not insist on its
Amendment No. 5 and do agree with Amendments Nos. 5A to 5H in lieu
thereof.</p>



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_256"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 256</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110149000108"></a>When we debated this
matter previously, I explained to the House why we are seeking to
broaden the scope of conditional cautions by adding a punitive
objective to the objectives of reparation and rehabilitation currently
allowed by the legislation. Conditional cautions have been operating in
a number of areas and have been successful. The usefulness of the
scheme has, however, been limited largely to those offenders who have
personal problems linked to offending and to deal with offences where
there is an individual victim who has suffered quantifiable loss. It
has not been possible, for example, to provide for indirect reparation
by way of unpaid work.</p><p><a name="06110149000109"></a>There
are a number of safeguards in the legislation to ensure that it will
operate within a proper framework. There are measures to protect the
rights of the offender, including the opportunity of free legal advice,
the requirement of an admission of guilt by the offender, and the
acceptance of the conditional caution in writing. I emphasise again
that a conditional caution can be considered only in cases where there
is sufficient evidence to prosecute. At all times, an offender can
choose to reject the offer of a conditional caution and instead go to
court. In the event of non-compliance with a conditional caution, the
offender can be prosecuted for the original offence; there is no
separate penalty for failing to comply with the conditions although
they were accepted before. The offender always has a choice. We believe
that, as the Joint Committee on Human Rights found in 2003, those
safeguards will continue to ensure that a person&#146;s consent to a
conditional caution is not coerced.</p><p><a name="06110149000110"></a>However, during previous debates on this
matter, it was clear that concerns remained about the level of
discretion that would be available to prosecutors, particularly with
respect to the financial penalties. We have listened carefully to the
concerns and we have brought forward amendments to address this
point.</p><p><a name="06110149000111"></a>The amendments proposed
for insertion into Clause 15 would effect a number of changes dealing
with financial penalties. First, Amendment No. 5E proposes reducing the
maximum amount of any financial penalty that can be required from
&#163;500 to &#163;250. That figure may be more commensurate with
the level of minor offending that we are seeking to encompass in the
remit of the scheme. If in the future any changes are needed, they will
be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, except for changes
arising solely from changes to the value of money.</p><p><a name="06110149000112"></a>Secondly, new subsection (1) of Section
23A of the 2003 Act, which would be inserted by Amendment No. 5D, would
have the effect of requiring that financial penalties could be used
only in respect of a set of offences specified in secondary
legislation, subject to the negative procedure. Noble Lords may think
this is a significant issue, because concerns have been expressed about
what offences would come within the ambit of the financial penalties
for conditional cautions, and this means that they would be prescribed
in secondary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06110149000113"></a>Thirdly, new
subsections (2) and (3) inserted by Amendment No. 5D would require that
secondary legislation would specify in relation to each offence 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_257"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 257</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the maximum penalty for that offence or group of offences. We plan to do
this by grouping offences into bands according to the seriousness of
the offence and attaching to each a proposed maximum penalty. The
prosecutor would not be able to require a financial penalty that was
above the maximum amount for the offence in question. So that already
narrows the area of prosecutorial discretion to maxima that had been
set in a statutory instrument subject to negative resolution
procedure.</p><p><a name="06110149000114"></a>We
propose also that the secondary legislation provides that the
prosecutor has some discretion to reduce the amount of the specified
penalty for the offence committed to take account of the
offender&#146;s means and the overall proportionality of the
conditions. I mention that because in Committee the noble Baroness,
Lady Anelay, pressed on me the importance of taking account of the
means of the offender and of the overall proportionality of the
conditions. I agreed with the noble Baroness that if an offender was
subject to a condition&#151;perhaps a reparative or rehabilitative
condition&#151;it was right to take that into account in determining
what, if any, financial penalty was proposed.</p><p><a name="06110149000115"></a>Our proposal is to provide for an ability
to reduce the specified penalty proposed as a conditional caution to
take account of those features. I hope noble Lords will agree that that
is a proper way to strike the balance between the proper concerns that
have been expressed by the noble Baroness and the concerns expressed in
the previous debate.</p><p><a name="06110149000116"></a>Finally,
Amendment No. 5G makes subject to the affirmative resolution procedure
any proposed changes to the maximum hours, which are set at 20 in the
Bill. That would also apply in respect of any proposed changes to the
fraction that can be required in relation to the maximum penalty for
which an individual would be liable on summary conviction for the
offence in question. The same safeguard as that being offered regarding
the penalty is being offered in relation to the number of
hours&#151;that they cannot be increased without an affirmative
resolution, except in respect of changes in the value of money as
regards the financial penalty. I hope that noble Lords will agree that
the amendment directly addresses the concerns that have been
expressed.</p><p><a name="06110149000117"></a>We believe that the
clause is a sensible and considered addition to the conditional caution
scheme and provides the opportunity to deal fairly with offenders who
are willing to admit their guilt and allows for a swift and
proportionate response with adequate safeguards.</p><p><a name="06110149000118"></a>Moved, That this House do not insist on
its Amendment No. 5 to which the Commons have disagreed, but do propose
Amendments Nos. 5B to 5H in lieu thereof.&#151;(<I>Lord
Goldsmith</I>.)</p><p><a name="06110149000119"></a><b><a name="61101-0003.htm_spnew79"></a><a name="06110149001023"></a>Lord
Lloyd of Berwick:</b> My Lords, at Third Reading I
pointed out that the clause as proposed was contrary to a basic
principle of our constitution in that it is not for the police or the
prosecution to have any hand in sentencing an offender. That is a
question for the courts. When I asked the noble and learned Lord the
Attorney-General how the argument that he was advancing regarding the
clearing of graffiti would 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_258"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 258</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>apply in the case of a fine, he said that he would not shy away from
that difficulty. But it remains a difficulty and I believe that the way
that the noble and learned Lord dealt with it was unsatisfactory. The
fact is that a fine is a fine, a fine is a punishment and a punishment
is totally inconsistent with the idea of a conditional caution, as
originally envisaged in the 2003
Act.</p><p><a name="06110149000120"></a>I
also made a point that was made by many others, not least by the noble
Baroness, Lady Anelay, that this is a radical departure from principle,
which has been introduced without any consultation. All those I have
consulted&#151;we know the view of the Magistrates&#146;
Association&#151;are, I shall not say as horrified, but are certainly
as surprised as I am
horrified.</p><p><a name="06110149000121"></a>The amendments do not
answer my basic constitutional objection and I remain rootedly opposed
to this clause. But I acknowledge that the Government have tried hard
in these amendments to reduce the impact of the clause. The reduction
from &#163;500 to &#163;250 is welcome, as is the plan to specify
the offences to which the conditional caution will apply and to set
separate maxima for each offence. That certainly reduces the
discretion. There is still a level of discretion left to the
prosecuting authorities which, as I say, I find objectionable. If the
amendment were left as it is, I would still find it difficult to
accept.</p><h5><a name="06110149000580"></a>4
pm</h5><p><a name="06110149000122"></a>Since then the noble Baroness
has written to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, with a copy to
me&#151;which unfortunately I did not receive, but I have now seen a
copy&#151;in which she makes certain further suggestions. She says
that the intention is not to specify separate maxima for each of the
new offences which are to be specified, but to have a norm; in other
words, that will be the figure, unless that figure is reduced having
regard to the impecuniosity of the offender and one other
matter.</p><p><a name="06110149000123"></a>That
seems to put a different picture on the amendment; because it then
becomes much more like the ordinary penalty charge which we all
understand and to which no one has ever had an objection. I understand
that this will be a penalty of a certain amount unless the amount is
reduced because of the impecuniosity of the offender. That seems to me
to be much more reasonable and much more understandable. I still have
my rooted objection, but if in replying we could be given an
undertaking that that is what is intended&#151;a norm subject to a
reduction&#151;I, for one, might find it difficult to resist the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06110149000124"></a><b><a name="61101-0003.htm_spnew80"></a><a name="06110149001024"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, we remain concerned
that the Government are taking our judicial system down a route that
could lead to the widespread use of administrative punishment instead
of the impartial hearing that is given in a magistrates&#146; court.
Fair trial safeguards and the involvement of the independent court in
the delivery of punishment are in the wider public interest and in the
interest of the victims of crime. As the noble Baroness knows, I would
have preferred to have seen the full report on the operation of
conditional cautions, as introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2003,
before we pressed ahead with extending them to punishment.</p>

the Magistrates' Association and I have made sure that the noble and
learned Lord&#146;s office knew that. I know that the Magistrates'
Association shares our concern that these proposals breach the basic
principle that sentencing is a matter for the independent judiciary and
will still breach that principle despite the concessions offered
today.</p><p><a name="06110149000126"></a>Why am I not opposing the
government amendment and why have I not tabled a Motion? We have very
carefully considered the arguments set out on Report by the noble and
learned Lord the Attorney-General (at col. 130 of the <I>Official
Report</I> of 10 October) that the law currently prevents an offender
who has admitted criminal damage from being able to carry out
restorative work when the damage has already been dealt with and that
the law prevents him from being ordered to carry out other work in
lieu&#151;the indirect reparation to which the noble and learned Lord
referred in moving the government
Motion.</p><p><a name="06110149000127"></a>We have certainly
considered that and we see the practical arguments behind the
Government&#146;s reasons for wishing to press ahead on such a basis.
Today the Attorney-General has come forward with amendments that do
much to allay the concerns that I brought forward in Committee. I am
grateful to him. They should restrict the degree of discretion which
may be exercised by prosecutors in relation to imposing punitive
cautions that effectively impose a fine and, despite that, as the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, said, we seem to be shifting,
I hope&#151;by the nature of what may be happening&#151;from
regulations towards more of a fixed penalty.</p><p><a name="06110149000128"></a>I am certainly grateful to the noble and
learned Lord the Attorney-General for arranging meetings on these
matters yesterday. Although, of course, we had seen the published
government amendments that came out on Monday, when I met the noble and
learned Lord I was not aware of the letter that was winging its way to
me from the noble Baroness which gave further explanation. It was not
on my desk when I went to see the Attorney-General, but a quarter of an
hour later, when I got back, it was on my desk. I only hope that the
noble and learned Lord did not think I was looking somewhat vacant and
surprised when he made some of his proposals&#151;they certainly came
fresh to my mind. It means that today we do not have to object to the
Government&#146;s Motion.</p><p><a name="06110149000129"></a>It
was constructive to hear that the Government will prescribe, in
secondary legislation, the offences to which a financial penalty will
apply. That is in the printed amendments. However, as we were told in
the letter, the practical application is that only a limited range of
offences will be prescribed. That is important. They will be listed in
banded groups, giving a limited discretion to take the
offender&#146;s financial circumstances into account. I agree
entirely with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, about
the financial advantages of
that.</p><p><a name="06110149000130"></a>We shall, however, wish to
monitor closely the use of the punitive conditional caution. It should
not be an &#147;Open Sesame&#148; for widening administrative

that it is both necessary and appropriate. But, as a result of
today&#146;s amendments and the further clarification in the
Government&#146;s letter, we do not object to the
Motion.</p><p><a name="06110149000131"></a><b><a name="61101-0003.htm_spnew81"></a><a name="06110149001025"></a>Baroness
Linklater of Butterstone:</b> My Lords, I echo what
has been said by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and
the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. We have discussed this matter fully at
all stages of the Bill. An important point of principle is involved, as
well as significant practical considerations. The principle is that
conditional cautions are non-punitive, but that reparation and
rehabilitation lies at their heart. We heartily endorse this approach
as appropriate, effective and right in terms of requiring the offender
to address his offence appropriately by making reparation, which in
turn makes amends to the victim. It also makes possible the
rehabilitation of the offender by requiring attendance at, say, an
alcohol or addiction centre, which lies at the cause and the root of
the offence. Thus, the matter is properly and seriously addressed
without sucking someone unnecessarily into the criminal justice
system.</p><p><a name="06110149000132"></a>My regret is that the
hands of the Attorney-General appear to be tied by the limitations on
conditional cautions as currently designed. There is therefore an
inability to allow indirect reparation for damage or harm caused if it
is not possible, for whatever reason, for the offender to make good the
damage for which he was directly responsible. Making good other damage
to the community is not, apparently, allowable. I hope that this issue
can be addressed in future legislation because it is an absurd
limitation on the possible good that reparation of any kind can
do.</p><p><a name="06110149000133"></a>To extend
these conditions as proposed, however, is to open the door to
administrative justice, where a punitive element is now present; where
punishments are imposed by the police and Crown Prosecution Service,
which then become de facto investigators, prosecutors and judges. The
principle of sentencing and punishment being imposed by an entirely
independent tribunal&#151;the court&#151;is thus dispensed with. We
recognise that we are talking here about the lowest level of offending,
but, none the less, this all-important principle of our justice system
is being bypassed.</p><p><a name="06110149000134"></a>The
practical considerations involve the means by which low-level offending
can be managed speedily and efficiently, which both deals with the
offence and avoids a lengthy process of court proceedings given that
the offender has pleaded guilty to a minor offence. This we understand.
However, many people may accept a conditional caution, whatever the
conditions, because the idea of going to court is so alarming. In doing
so, the punitive element is introduced. So we stand on the cusp of
principle and practicality.</p><p><a name="06110149000135"></a>I
am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General for
seeing us yesterday, for the trouble he has taken to examine
these issues, for the efforts he has made to meet our arguments
and for the accommodations he is now proposing. I

noble and learned Lord has agreed to the limit on the possible fine,
which has been reduced to &#163;250, and that any changes to time or
limit on punitive conditions will be subject to affirmative resolution
procedure on maximum hours, and therefore subject to a vote in both
Houses of Parliament before any change is made. I understood him to say
at an earlier meeting that in time to come&#151;possibly in a
year&#151;he would report back on the outcomes of these changes and
on how they are working in the initial pilot areas. It is important to
have a chance to revisit these
arrangements.</p><p><a name="06110149000136"></a>However, given the
concessions, and having clearly stated my concerns on the small but
important way in which a principle of justice is being undermined, I
accept the Government&#146;s new
amendments.</p><p><a name="06110149000137"></a><b><a name="61101-0003.htm_spnew82"></a><a name="06110149001026"></a>Lord

courts are in control because a person can always go to the court and
ask it to determine. But I do not need to debate that any further. I am
glad that, with the adjustments that have been made, we have reached a
compromise. It still brings in a change&#151;I do not shy away from
that at all&#151;to the original conditional caution scheme, but we

not notice any vacant stare at all when I saw her yesterday. She seemed
to be entirely on top of everything. I shall bear that in mind at

accept the word &#147;norm&#148;, but I said precisely that. There
would be bands and the prosecutors would have the ability&#151;albeit
a limited discretion&#151;to reduce the amount, particularly to take
account of the need for overall proportionality and the
offender&#146;s means. I hope that that meets the point made by the

14.</p><p><a name="06110149000144"></a>The House will
recall that at Third Reading we withdrew the provisions to establish a
new criminal justice inspectorate and, in their place, applied to each
of the existing inspectorates the provisions in Part 4 for delegation
of functions, inspection programmes and frameworks,
&#147;gatekeeping&#148; in respect of inspections by other
inspectorates, co-operation, joint action and assistance for other
public authorities. That will provide the statutory underpinning for
the more efficient and effective joint working to which the
inspectorates are
committed.</p><p><a name="06110149000145"></a>As
I then emphasised, those amendments have not changed the existing
remits of the five inspectorates, nor have they in any way compromised
their independence. They simply provide ways in which the inspectorates
can exercise their current functions more co-operatively and
flexibly.</p><p><a name="06110149000146"></a>At
Third Reading, the House welcomed the amendments but expressed concern
that the paragraphs relating to inspection programmes and frameworks
would create too burdensome a duty on the chief inspectors to consult.
As I foreshadowed at that time, due to the speed at which the
amendments were prepared, technical adjustments would be forthcoming. I
assured the House that we were in dialogue with the five inspectorates
to refine the consultation process in an appropriate way.</p><p><a name="06110149000147"></a>Having had that very constructive
dialogue, we have added provisions to enable each chief inspector, by
agreement with the consultee, to waive the consultation requirement in
agreed cases or circumstances. So, for example, if an inspectorate on
the consultee list had no interest in seeing inspection programmes
relating to a particular area of business, that could be agreed on a
case-by-case or standing basis. This will enable the consultation
process to operate sensibly and without unnecessary bureaucracy, and
ensure that it includes all elements that need to take part, without
going too far.</p>

pm</h5><p><a name="06110149000148"></a>Concern has also been
expressed about the power of Ministers to specify the form that the
inspection programme and frameworks are to take. I reassure the House
that this is an administrative provision that relates only to the form
of the documents in question. This is necessary for consistency and
ease of planning. It could not be used to specify the content of the
programme or frameworks.</p><p><a name="06110149000149"></a>During our consultation
with the inspectorates, it became clear that a specific statutory
endorsement of joint working would be both welcome and desirable. We
have therefore provided that each chief inspector shall prepare a joint
inspection programme with the other four justice sector chief
inspectors in relation to matters on which they propose to exercise
their functions jointly. This gives statutory force to the agreement
made by chief inspectors to move towards enhanced joint working. I
should emphasise, for those who may be concerned that this means more
red tape, that the chief inspectors will be able to make use of a joint
secretariat in preparing joint programmes, and that we are hopeful that
the benefits that joint programmes will have in focusing inspections
and eliminating duplication will mean a simplified landscape, rather
than an increasingly bureaucratic
one.</p><p><a name="06110149000150"></a>In conclusion, we will keep
all these changes under review and expect to see early progress. As
part of this, we intend to keep under active review the option of
reintroducing merger legislation. Meanwhile, we are confident that,
with the reaffirmed support of the chief inspectors, we can now press
ahead with work already begun to achieve our policy aspiration of a
more joined-up inspection regime for the justice system by April
2008.</p><p><a name="06110149000151"></a>Moved, That this House do

has come before us in welcoming the changes that have been
made&#151;in particular, the commitment not to press ahead with,
while keeping under review, the merger of the inspectorates into
something that would have proved unworkable, at least for the
moment.</p><p><a name="06110149000153"></a>I am
particularly grateful for the Minister&#146;s reassurance that there
is no intention for the Secretary of State to interfere in the way in
which inspections are conducted. That was a matter of some concern
among the inspectorates to which I have spoken. However, I ask the
Minister for further reassurance on one point, which was raised by the
all-party Joint Committee on Human Rights and by me when this was
discussed on previous occasions&#151;regularity of
inspection.</p>

<p><a name="06110149000154"></a>Frequency
of inspection sets the pace and tone of the year for the inspectorate
and is the regulating factor for resources. As I mentioned to the
Minister, if 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_279"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 279</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there were more demands on the inspectorate for other
activities&#151;such as inspection of police cells, in the case of
the prisons inspectorate&#151;that could affect the resources and the
regularity. Therefore, will she guarantee that there is no intention to
reduce the current frequency of inspection, which is particularly
important at the moment, given that the prison system as a whole is
undergoing strains due to
overcrowding?</p><p><a name="06110149000155"></a><b><a name="61101-0006.htm_spnew87"></a><a name="06110149001031"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, I support all the
points made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. I agree that the
Government&#146;s Motion should be accepted today. When the Minister
tabled the raft of amendments at Third Reading in this House, that
effectively ended the Government&#146;s plans to put structural
changes to the prisons inspectorate into statute. However, we were
concerned that the late tabling of those amendments&#151;a matter of
minutes before tabling closed&#151;meant that noble Lords were unable
to scrutinise them and certainly unable to table amendments to them, as
manuscript amendments are, of course, not permitted at Third
Reading.</p><p><a name="06110149000156"></a>At
Third Reading, the Minister stated that refinements might be made in
another place. I was intrigued to find that the exact wording, at col.
803 in <I>Hansard</I>, was &#147;minor technical adjustments&#148;,
to which the noble Baroness has referred today. In any event, the
Government&#146;s changes tabled for today are certainly welcome.
They are more than technical adjustments; they make it possible for us
to remove any objection that we would otherwise have had
today.</p><p><a name="06110149000157"></a>The noble Baroness
referred to consultation. The Government&#146;s amendment on that is
hugely wordy and convoluted. Ours would have been better, but there we
are&#151;never mind, we will accept the Government&#146;s
roundabout way of doing it.</p><p><a name="06110149000158"></a>On
the Secretary of State&#146;s powers, the Government are trying to
assure us by saying, &#147;Never mind, this won&#146;t really mean
what it says&#148;, which is that the Secretary of State interferes.
We hope that this is an administrative matter and will not mean any
diminution of the Chief Inspector of Prisons&#146; authority. The
noble Baroness today said that the Government&#151;and of course they
would say this&#151;wish to retain the option of reintroducing the
merger programme at some future date, given the results of the
programme for working together, which we know that the inspectorates
wished to do in the first
place.</p><p><a name="06110149000159"></a>The noble Baroness will
not be surprised if I say that, if any such proposal is put forward,
experience of debates at Second Reading, in Committee, on Report and at
Third Reading will show that this House will rigorously examine the
Government's case before it will agree to the creation of the
mega-inspectorate that was first proposed. We have arrived at the right
conclusion by a very interesting route and I hope that we do not have
to revisit the issue for some considerable
time.</p><p><a name="06110149000160"></a><b><a name="61101-0006.htm_spnew88"></a><a name="06110149001032"></a>Lord

very much what the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and the noble Baroness,

amendments were necessary. Unfortunately, when they were moved in the
other place, they were lost. However, we are perfectly satisfied now
that the Minister has explained how the system will work. It seems that
the principals involved in the inspections are perfectly happy with the
arrangement, too. Obviously, it will be a different matter if these
mergers are to be considered on a future occasion. That will obviously
require the scrutiny of this House and, as experience has shown, it may
be a difficult exercise for the Minister to pursue. In the mean time,
we would certainly raise no further objection. The system should be
monitored adequately over a period of time to see how effectively it
works.</p><p><a name="06110149000161"></a><b><a name="61101-0006.htm_spnew89"></a><a name="06110149001033"></a>Lord
Elton:</b> My Lords, the monitoring period will be
very important. In view of the short time in which the revised measure
was brought forward and then extensively amended, we, too, will be
watching closely what goes on in that period.</p><p><a name="06110149000162"></a>I regret that I have
not been a party to the discussions in tabling the amendments, so I
apologise for any ignorance. I would like an assurance from the
Minister that the specific requirements for the publication of
programmes of inspections do not preclude the inspector making
unannounced inspections, which are crucial to the efficiency of the
system.</p><p><a name="06110149000163"></a>Secondly,
I am concerned by Amendment No. 10D, which gives the Secretary of State
power in conjunction with a great panoply of authority&#151;the Lord
Chancellor and the Attorney-General. I should like to know why they are
brought in as well when there is to be a direction for a joint
inspection, presumably by the inspectors subject to those Ministers. If
overused, that could undermine some of the liberty of action that we

be immensely helpful when there are numerous amendments to a very long
amendment if the lines could be numbered. We are asked to look to line
134. It took me quite some time to get there and I must admit that I
missed some of the things that the noble Baroness was saying. If that
could be addressed, I should be most
grateful.</p><p><a name="06110149000165"></a><b><a name="06110149001034"></a>The

Report, I thank the Government for having done what they have done.
That is the end of my congratulations. The way in which they did it was
a disgrace to this House and prevented the House from performing proper
scrutiny and the revising role at which it is so good. As my noble
friend Lord Elton said, we were prevented from discussing a number of
issues because we were not told of the Government&#146;s plans. I did
not find out about the amendments at Third Reading until after it had
taken place. I spoke very briefly to the noble Baroness that evening to
express my disgust at the way in which the House had been treated. I
have since rung her office and sent her two e-mails, but I have had no
reply at all. I hope that this is the only occasion when the noble
Baroness has not had her finger on the pulse in her usual way and that
we are never treated like this again.</p>

align myself with the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham,
and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. I thank my noble friend for
understanding the anxiety that we all felt when we spoke about the

speak on the last occasion, I, too, am very appreciative of the way in
which the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, which were
substantially supported in the House, have now in effect been
introduced to the Bill as it will be presented for Royal Assent.
However, there are provisions in these amendments for orders by the
Attorney-General. Will the noble Baroness inform me, either now or
later, about the mechanism by which those orders are to be
made?</p><p><a name="06110149000168"></a><b><a name="61101-0006.htm_spnew92"></a><a name="06110149001037"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, first, I thank all
those who have spoken. I give a particular apology to the noble Earl,
Lord Caithness. I assure him that no discourtesy was intended. He knows
that, to put it mildly, I have been under a little pressure time-wise
just recently, which has meant that it has not been possible to have
the meetings that noble Lords will know I am always very happy to have
whenever I am able
to.</p><p><a name="06110149000169"></a>The reason
why the amendments came back very quickly is that this House had
expressed a huge interest in the nature of the inspections. I thought
that this House deserved the courtesy of being the first to consider
these matters&#151;matters which I reasonably anticipated would give
this House a deal of satisfaction and pleasure. Of course, it was open
to me not to take that course, not to act with expedition and not to
give the House this opportunity, but to allow the other place to have
that privilege. If what we have done has done this House a disservice,
I humbly ask noble Lords for forgiveness, but I think that it reflects
the regard that I, and indeed the Government, have for this House. It
would be remiss of me not to remark in a modest and mild way that my
coming back to the House with these amendments seemed to give the House
a little pleasure in hearing what I had to
say.</p><p><a name="06110149000170"></a>I reassure the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, that the frequency and regularity of inspections will
be matters for the inspectorate to determine. Nothing has changed. I
reassure the noble Lord, Lord Elton, too, that unannounced visits will
be entirely at the discretion of the inspectorate.</p><h5><a name="06110149000582"></a>4.30

done by others rather than by me&#151;that our amendment is accurate.
I know that the noble Baroness always strives very hard to get the
essence of what she wants down on paper and I am always happy to
provide the means by which it can be delivered thereafter. We have been
able to deal with the proposals for merger

Elton, talked about joint inspections under Amendment No. 10D, and
asked about the power to direct joint inspection programmes from time
to time. The Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-General and the Home
Secretary are jointly responsible for the five inspectorates under
discussion. As such, they will need to agree priorities; otherwise the
inspectorates could be subject to competing demands. This will ensure
that there is no duplication between the inspectors, who report to
different Ministers. This is so that we can have clarity and
consistency, and, we hope, materially reduce the level of conflict that
may arise from time to time. I hope that I have satisfied the House on
inspections. I believe that I have answered all the questions asked by
the noble Lord, Lord Elton, except for the question about the
publication of programmes. These do not prevent unannounced
inspections.</p><p><a name="06110149000174"></a>Orders made by the

the treaty. It may assist the House if I remind noble Lords what was
said then. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland,
said:</p><ul><a name="06110149000566"></a>&#147;The treaty is
what today's debate is fundamentally about. The treaty needs to be
ratified by both parties to give it binding effect in international law
... The United States has done nothing about ratification, in
breach of the rules of international comity ... We believe the
time has come for your Lordships&#146; House to act. The United

Goodhart:</b> My Lords, I cannot speak for the other
noble Lords whom the noble Baroness has quoted but, since she referred
to me, I would like to make it absolutely clear that, while one of the
problems was the failure of the United States to ratify this Bill, I
stated throughout proceedings that I regarded the treaty itself as
fundamentally flawed and that its ratification was not my
objective.</p><p><a name="06110149000179"></a><b><a name="61101-0006.htm_spnew95"></a><a name="06110149001040"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, your Lordships will
see that I did not assert that the noble Lord did anything otherwise.
Indeed, I would go further and say that his dissent on the inclusion of
America in the Extradition Act remains resolute to the end; at no stage
did he weaken from that position.
</p><p><a name="06110149000180"></a>Armed, encouraged, given
backbone and strengthened by this House, I sallied forth on its behalf
to bring the news of its dissent to the Senate. This House knows me
well; our American cousins may have been less well prepared. But we
were able to marshal the arguments with the United States and explain
to it the depth of disquiet that its lack of assiduousness on this
matter had caused. I am therefore delighted to report that the
sentiments expressed in this House had considerable effect.</p><p><a name="06110149000181"></a>In passing these amendments on the last
occasion, the House was essentially seeking to be helpful&#151;to 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_284"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provide me with ammunition to assist me in Washington. I was well armed
and the amendments appear to have done the trick, because the Senate
has now given its consent and we must now, if I may respectfully
suggest it, do our part by honouring that bargain to enable us to
ratify the treaty. I thank all noble Lords who spoke so well in the
debate, because I was able to deploy each of those arguments with our
American colleagues to good
effect.</p><p><a name="06110149000182"></a>So where are we now? As
I say, the US Administration strongly supported the purposes of the new
treaty. The matter went through their process without objection or
dissent. It was unanimous. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart,
thought that there was not a chance that this could be done before
mid-term elections. Their programme was absolutely packed and,
therefore, it was deemed futile to make the attempt. The fact that they
did this demonstrates their total and wholehearted commitment to the
agreement into which they honourably entered and which we jointly
signed. This House fully understands why the United Kingdom and the
United States signed that treaty. The treaty in 2003 defines
extraditable offences by sentence threshold rather than by list.
Therefore, we are no longer constrained by time. There are individuals
who have committed very grave offences, but are incapable of being
extradited at the moment because the time limit disables us from so
doing.</p><p><a name="06110149000183"></a>Ratification
of this treaty will enable us to seek the return of some very serious
offenders who have committed sexual offences or are alleged to have
been involved in crimes where people have died by way of manslaughter,
and others. It also introduces temporary surrender, which would enable
us to extradite someone who is already serving a prison sentence. We
have been able to take advantage of temporary surrender in relation to
a European case: we have a serial rapist who is spending a very long
period in prison in our country. We are able to surrender that person
to another European jurisdiction because they have committed sexual
offences elsewhere in Europe. It is a very valuable tool.</p><p><a name="06110149000184"></a>The treaty also waives speciality
protection, which enables prosecution for offences other than
those for which extradition was sought. As I said earlier, it
lifts the limitation bar on extradition. Amendments Nos. 36 and 85
would prevent ratification of the treaty. The United States Senate has
given its consent to the treaty and has sent it to the President for
ratification. All that remains to be done is for your Lordships to lift
your insistence on the amendments to the Extradition Act. Then the
instruments of ratification can be exchanged and the treaty will
forthwith enter into force.</p><p><a name="06110149000185"></a>Two
issues have caused concern. The first is &#147;forum&#148;.
Amendments Nos. 81 and 84 would require judges to make decisions about
prosecution, which would be an entirely new and perhaps wrong procedure
in our law. Judges are independent of prosecution and defence. I think
that it was Lord Dilhorne who
said:</p><ul><a name="06110149000570"></a>&#147;A judge must keep
out of the arena. He should not have or appear to have any
responsibility for the institution of a prosecution&#148;.</ul>

which our criminal justice system rests. I am grateful for having been
reminded of that very important judgment by my noble and learned friend

have compared our laws with those of other countries, and I simply
remind your Lordships that the jurisprudence of England and Wales is
significantly different from that in other countries and from our
European colleagues. The forum amendments could result in a person
escaping justice altogether. No one, whatever the accusation they face,
will be or has been extradited from the United Kingdom to places with
which the Human Rights Act would find a level of incompatibility. The
expressed and implied protections of the Human Rights Act mean that
extradition which does not comply with those terms will be prevented. I
know that comments were made in the other place to the effect that: if
we were to return someone, would they be sent to Guantanamo Bay? I
assure all Members of the House that the arrangements we have with the
United States would not allow that to happen. We are strongly of the
view that questions about the most appropriate forum should be
considered on a case-by-case basis by independent prosecutors from the
relevant jurisdictions.</p><h5><a name="06110149000583"></a>4.45

Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, that is a most
helpful indication. As I have said, questions about the most
appropriate forum should be looked at on a case-by-case basis by
independent prosecutors from the relevant jurisdictions. I know that my
noble and learned friend the Attorney-General has been in discussions
with the United States Attorney-General, Alberto Gonzales. His
officials are considering draft guidance that would cover serious,
sensitive or complex 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_286"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 286</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>criminal cases where it is apparent to prosecutors that there are issues
of jurisdiction to be decided. Your Lordships will know that if at any
stage our prosecutors come to the view that there are charges which
should properly be prosecuted in this country, it is always and at all
stages open to us so to
do.</p><p><a name="06110149000192"></a>In
particular, consideration is being given to prosecutors applying the
following test: does it appear that there is a real possibility that a
prosecutor in the other country may have an interest in prosecuting the
case? Such a case would usually have significant links with the other
country. What is being considered is basically a three-step approach to
decisions on jurisdiction&#151;first, the early exchange of
information between the relevant jurisdictions; secondly, prosecutors
consulting on cases for the most appropriate jurisdiction and deciding
about that; and thirdly, where prosecutors have been unable to reach
agreement on jurisdiction, officers of the Attorney-General taking the
lead with the aim of resolving it. The United Kingdom is also
providing, as is always the case, detailed guidance to our prosecutors.
That is the role that my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General
has discharged, and one that his predecessors in title have discharged
before him. It is envisaged that talks with the United States will be
completed very soon. These are practical arrangements about how we work
in comity, on a day-to-day basis in a way that makes sense, with our
partners.</p><p><a name="06110149000193"></a>The evidential
requirement is another issue which has caused a deal of concern. There
probably never will be complete agreement between those who accept that
the evidential requirements between the United States and the United
Kingdom are now broadly comparable and those who do not. But there is
an acceptance that the previous standards were lopsided, even if there
is disagreement over the degree. The advice from the prosecutors in
both jurisdictions is that the new standards are not identical but are
now broadly comparable.</p><p><a name="06110149000194"></a>When I
was in the United States with the Attorney-General, I raised the issue
of how the system works. I was assured that the procedure goes
something like this. If a state wishes to make an application or an
order for extradition, it has to get a federal warrant. To do so, it
has to go before the grand jury and satisfy it that there is probable
cause. Only if probable cause is satisfied are the American authorities
then entitled to make the request to us for a warrant to be exercised
on their behalf. Therefore, under the American procedure, the American
authorities have to satisfy themselves that probable cause is
satisfied.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61101-0007.htm"/>


<p><a name="06110149000195"></a>Going the other way,
a request from us to them would have to satisfy the same standard of
probable cause. In the past when we made a request to them that prima
facie evidence should be produced, they declined to accept it from us
because they needed only to have established probable cause. That is
what their system demanded. In effect, we have a mirror both
ways&#151;probable cause out and probable cause back in. I also asked
another question: will the evidence that you produce to us be
significantly different from the evidence which you will ask us to
produce to you

F1.</p><p><a name="06110149000200"></a>In the many incursions that
this Government have made into individual liberties during their time
in office, the matters concerned with the bilateral treaty on
extradition with the United States is a special case, because that
agreement was negotiated in secret. The press knew nothing about it;
neither did Parliament. It appears from the proceedings in another
place that not even Mr John Denham, the Minister of State at the Home
Office at the time, knew anything about it. As a result, we were
presented with a fait accompli on 31 March 2003. The treaty, containing
many clauses that applied directly to the rights of individuals in this
country, was wholly unsupervised by our parliamentary system.</p><p><a name="06110149000201"></a>One might well ask what animated the
Government in engaging in such a negotiation. Were they simply supine
in the face of a country they wanted to please beyond anything else?
Did they deliberately decide to reduce the rights of British citizens
in relation to extradition? Or were the negotiators simply incompetent;
were they wholly unaware when accepting the American Fourth
Amendment&#151;the probable cause matter to which the Minister
referred&#151;that we also have constitutional protections in the
European Convention on Extradition, particularly Article 7.1?</p><p><a name="06110149000202"></a>Whatever the explanation, and I suspect
history will finally produce an analysis that gives us a more accurate
audit trail than I have today, I am absolutely convinced that, in
future, Parliament must have a role in the scrutiny of treaties before
they are signed. That is the big constitutional lesson that comes out
of this sorry story. I would like to see all treaties produced in front
of a committee while they are in draft, and the House should debate
them before they are signed. I very much hope that this is a matter the
House will take seriously in the coming months.</p><p><a name="06110149000203"></a>In opening, the Minister quoted certain
things from the speech I made in Committee on 11 July, at cols. 625-29
of the <I>Official Report</I>. Her quotations 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_288"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>demonstrate all the dangers of quoting out of context. I made it
absolutely clear at the beginning of my speech that I had two
objections to the treaty. One was the issue of ratification, to which
she referred. The other was the issue of reciprocity, or fairness, to
which she did not refer. I do not need to elaborate on this point
because the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has made it for me. He has said
in terms that what principally concerns him is the issue of
reciprocity; and I do not need to add anything to that observation. I
share exactly the same opinion.</p><p><a name="06110149000204"></a>The fundamentals that lie behind this
issue have already been well debated, and I do not intend to repeat in
terms what I said in Committee. I shall just refer to a number of
points the Minister made in opening. The first one concerns the
question of prosecutors and judges. She quoted a famous passage from
Lord Dilhorne about judges interfering in matters that are none of
their concern. Extradition matters, however, are very much
judges&#146; concern, as we learn from Article 7.1 of the European
Convention on Terrorism.</p><p><a name="06110149000205"></a>I ask
the House to forgive me for quoting this to your Lordships, but it is
germane. Our forum amendment says:</p><ul><a name="06110149000571"></a>&#147;If the conduct disclosed by the
request was committed partly in the United Kingdom, the judge shall not
order the extradition of the person unless it appears in the light of
all the circumstances that it would be in the interests of justice that
the person should be tried in the category 1 territory ... In
deciding whether extradition is in the interests of justice, the judge
shall take into account whether the competent United Kingdom
authorities have decided to refrain from prosecuting the person whose
surrender is sought for the conduct constituting the offence for which
extradition is
requested&#148;.</ul><h5><a name="06110149000584"></a>5
pm</h5><p><a name="06110149000206"></a>We have entered into a
binding obligation with our European partners which in terms gives the
judge, not the prosecutor, the power to decide whether or not somebody
should be extradited. I can think of nothing less desirable than giving
this power to the prosecutor. You can just imagine what might happen;
the prosecutors in the United Kingdom and the United States get
together over an issue and they do a deal over whether or not somebody
should be extradited. There is no judicial intervention or objective
analysis of the interests of the person whose freedom is in issue. The
whole proposition that these matters of extradition ought to be in the
hands of the prosecutor rather than the judge is quite alien to our
traditions; yet it is precisely what the treaty requires us to do. I
ask your Lordships to reject the argument upon which the noble Baroness
founded her contention&#151;that these matters are much better dealt
with by prosecutors.</p><p><a name="06110149000207"></a>There is
also a deeper unfairness here. What made the United Kingdom give way on
the Article 7.1 point? No other country has done so. Both France and
Denmark have bilateral treaties with the United States; but France
refuses to extradite any French citizen under any circumstances and, in
the case of Denmark, the forum provision applies. If the offence in
issue is partly committed in Ireland, it will be tried in Ireland
unless the interests of justice dictate otherwise. Why on earth did we
not have a similar 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_289"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 289</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provision in relation to the United States? That is why I cannot
understand what the negotiators thought that they were trying to
achieve. The noble Baroness has said how important it was to the United
States that the fourth amendment on probable cause should be protected.
The United States was not prepared to give way on that. Why were we
prepared to give way on Article 7.1? Perhaps the noble Baroness has
some explanation for that; but it seems to me
inexplicable.</p><p><a name="06110149000208"></a>Then there is the
question of the relationship between the Human Rights Act and the
extradition treaty&#151;a relationship dealt with in Section 87(1) of
the Extradition Act. Here I think that the Government deserve a little
more understanding because in the course of the debate on the then
Extradition Bill the Government made it quite clear that the Human
Rights Act applied. But in a recent Court of Appeal decision in
relation to the NatWest Three, the court decided that where there is a
conflict between the Human Rights Act and the American extradition
treaty, the extradition treaty trumps the Human Rights Act. So all the
protections of the Human Rights Act, which we assumed would be there
when the Extradition Bill was debated, seem to have evaporated. That is
also a matter of considerable
concern.</p><p><a name="06110149000209"></a>The noble Baroness
explained at great length to your Lordships why she believes that these
amendments are misplaced. I believe that they are essential to restore
what I consider to be a balanced arrangement with the United States.
This treaty is deeply unfair. I simply do not understand why citizens
in the United States should have one level of protection and we should
have another. I beg to move.

Goodhart:</b> My Lords, since your Lordships&#146;
House last debated this issue the Senate has, as the Minister pointed
out, consented to the ratification by the President of the 2003 treaty.
That treaty confers some benefits on the United Kingdom such as the
right of extradition to the United Kingdom even if the prosecution
would be time barred in the USA. That is something I have always
recognised. The ratification does not remove the main objections to the
treaty, which are, first, the unequal nature of the treaty and,
secondly, the fact that the treaty assists the aggressive use by the
United States of extra-territorial jurisdiction.</p><p><a name="06110149000212"></a>Amendment No. 36 cancels the designation
of the USA under the order made in December 2003 as a country to which
people can be extradited without establishing probable cause, or indeed
a prima facie case, under the Act. The Liberal Democrats&#151;and we
alone&#151;voted against the order in both Houses in December 2003 on
the ground of its inequality. Amendment No. 36 was rejected by the
House of Commons in the debate on 24 October. In that debate, the
Government relied yet again on the old chestnut that there is in fact
no real inequality. That is 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_290"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 290</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not so. The Minister has put less emphasis on that on this occasion than
she did on the earlier occasion, but she did repeat
it.</p><p><a name="06110149000213"></a>It is true
that, under Section 71 of the Extradition Act, the USA must provide
information that enables it to get a warrant for the arrest of the
defendant with a view to his or her extradition from the United
Kingdom. For obvious reasons, where an arrest warrant is being sought,
no notice is given to the defendant of the application for the warrant.
Information on which it is based is not shown to the defendant. There
is no hearing. The first the defendant knows of the application is when
he or she is arrested. Then an extradition hearing follows, but where
the country requesting the extradition has, like the United States,
been designated under Section 84(7), there can be no review at the
hearing of the adequacy of the evidence or information against the
defendant.</p><p><a name="06110149000214"></a>For extradition from
the USA to the United Kingdom, the position is quite different. The
United Kingdom has to show probable cause at the extradition hearing.
The existence of probable cause can be challenged by the defendant at
the hearing. The information relied on by the United Kingdom is
disclosed to the defendant and can be challenged. The defendant is able
to argue that the information is in fact insufficient to amount to
probable cause. That is entirely different from an application for an
arrest warrant on its own, carried out in the total absence and
ignorance of the defendant. That is spelled out in the treaty in
Article 8.3, which says
that,</p><ul><a name="06110149000573"></a>&#147;a request for
the extradition of a person who is sought for prosecution shall be
supported by ... for requests to the United States, such
information as would provide a reasonable basis to believe that the
person sought committed the offence for which the extradition is
sought&#148;.</ul><a name="06110149000290"></a>There is no
requirement for any corresponding information for extradition from the
United Kingdom to the United States. That on its own makes it clear
beyond doubt that there was a deliberate decision of those who drafted
the treaty that there was to be a significant difference in procedure
between extradition from the United States and extradition from the
United
Kingdom.<p><a name="06110149000215"></a><b><a name="61101-0007.htm_spnew103"></a><a name="06110149001048"></a>Lord
Lloyd of Berwick:</b> My Lords, I wonder whether the
noble Lord can help me. As he has pointed out, the imbalance is
contained in the treaty in Article 8.3. In what way would the proposed
amendment help to resolve that
imbalance?</p><p><a name="06110149000216"></a><b><a name="61101-0007.htm_spnew104"></a><a name="06110149001049"></a>Lord

of course make it impossible for Her Majesty&#146;s Government to
exchange instruments of ratification, which they obviously will do as
soon as this matter is disposed of. It would therefore force the
Government to a renegotiation of the treaty with the United States.
That is the objective that we seek. The same is equally true of the
legislation as to forum. That would also force a renegotiation of the
treaty. Given that the amendments in groups D and F have been spoken to
by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I assume that that is his position
also. He is nodding his head in concurrence.</p>



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_291"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 291</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110149000217"></a>There is a conflict between interest and
duty. It is in the interest of a state requesting extradition that
extradition proceedings should be swift and simple. It is the duty of
the state to which the request has been made to protect its citizens
and residents from unjustifiable requests for extradition. These must
be balanced. It may be legitimate for the United Kingdom to surrender a
degree of protection of its citizens and residents in order to obtain a
simpler extradition treaty with another country. It is not legitimate
for the United Kingdom to surrender protection for its citizens without
also getting a simpler procedure for extradition to the United Kingdom.
That is what has happened
here.</p><p><a name="06110149000218"></a>I shall briefly explain
why I have not insisted on our Amendment No. 85, which was originally
tabled in my name. First, it is not necessary. Its purpose is to ensure
that if Amendment No. 36 is passed, the Government could not bring in a
new order to the same effect. If Amendment No. 85 were not made, then
the Government could do that, but they might well meet insuperable
difficulties in obtaining the approval of your Lordships&#146; House
if it had insisted on the inclusion of Amendment No. 36. If that
amendment were passed, your Lordships would be justified in rejecting
any new order for that
purpose.</p><p><a name="06110149000219"></a>I have another reason
for not insisting on Amendment No. 85. My understanding is that it
would not have the support of the Conservatives and would therefore
have no chance of succeeding. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland, said that although he supported it, the amendment should be
modified so that it did not apply to the extradition of terrorists. We
would be unable to accept such a modification. Anyone suspected of
terrorism has the same right to a fair trial in this country and to
protection from improper extradition to a foreign country as someone
suspected of any other grave crime. Anyone extradited to the United
States will face hardship; but hardship faced by someone who is
unjustifiably extradited for terror-related crime is likely to be far
more severe than the hardship of someone who is unjustifiably
extradited for a white-collar
crime.</p><p><a name="06110149000220"></a>Amendments
Nos. 81 and 84 relate to the &#147;forum&#148; question and aim to
deal with the problem of the aggressive use of extradition requests by
the United States in cases where the US is not the most appropriate
forum. However, those amendments would have a much wider application.
Amendment No. 83 would apply to category 1 countries, which are mostly
in the European Union, and Amendment No. 84 would apply to category 2
countries, including the USA. That is not a problem in most cases. The
effect of the amendments is that if part of the alleged offence has
been committed in the United Kingdom, the judge conducting the
extradition hearing can extradite the defendant only if it is in the
interest of justice that that person should be tried in the requesting
state. That is perfectly compatible with article 4.7(a) of the
framework decision on the European arrest warrant, and there is a
similar provision in article 7.1 of the Council of Europe Convention on
Extradition, which covers extradition to many category 2
countries.</p>



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_292"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 292</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110149000221"></a>The problem lies with the 2003 treaty,
which has no provision to enable a United Kingdom court to refuse
extradition on grounds that that would be unjust. There are many
reasons why extradition could be unjust. They include not only the
basic fact of the residence of the defendant and the witnesses, but
also that the USA makes extradition claims where there is no real
connection with that country&#151;for example, where the only link is
the location of an internet service provider in the USA&#151;and the
use in the USA of draconian sentences, coupled with very large
discounts for guilty pleas to an extent that puts pressure on innocent
defendants to plead
guilty.</p><p><a name="06110149000222"></a>According to an article
sometime ago in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, no less than 97.5 per
cent of defendants accept plea bargains. There is also the use of
coerced evidence, including evidence from Guantanamo Bay, which would
not be admissible in the United Kingdom, and great difficulty in
obtaining bail. The grant to the NatWest Three may well have been a
one-off, prompted by the desire of the United States Government to
prevent rejection of the treaty in the United
Kingdom.</p><h5><a name="06110149000585"></a>5.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06110149000223"></a>The
Minister has referred to negotiations which will take place between
prosecutors. That is an inappropriate solution. Where the dispute is as
to forum, the court should decide and not the prosecutors. We therefore
strongly support Amendments Nos. 81 to 84. Amendments Nos. 83 and 84
are supported in a letter sent to Members of the House of Commons by
four organisations: Justice&#151;in which I declare an interest as a
vice-chairman&#151;Liberty, the CBI and the Institute of Directors.
Those organisations do not very often join in the same campaign, but
when they do, surely, they should be listened
to.</p><p><a name="06110149000224"></a>The adverse consequences
here would be some delay in extradition hearings because the process
might take longer and take more preparation. That is true, but I do not
believe that the delay would be significant. The main cause of delay
before the Extradition Act 2003 was the number of times that the Home
Secretary had to take decisions before anyone could be extradited, with
each decision being liable to judicial review. The delay caused by
these amendments would be slight by
comparison.</p><p><a name="06110149000225"></a>I conclude where the
noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, started. There is one plain lesson to be
learnt from the trouble we have had with this. It is absolutely wrong
for Parliament to have no role in the making of treaties apart from
enacting the domestic legislation needed to implement them. The
extradition treaty would have benefited from scrutiny before it became
immutable. I believe that, as in the United States and in many other
countries, treaties should not be ratified without parliamentary
approval. I accept that that may be for the somewhat longer term, as
part of a reassessment of the so-called Royal prerogative&#151;in
practice, the Prime Minister's prerogative&#151;which I believe is
plainly a constitutional necessity. However, I see no reason why we
should not immediately press for an undertaking from the Government
that, in future, treaties should not be ratified until a

and to consider them and been able to publish a report. Had that been
the case, the problems that have arisen here might have been dealt with
much earlier and at the stage when they would have been much more
easily
resolvable.</p><p><a name="06110149000226"></a><b><a name="61101-0007.htm_spnew105"></a><a name="06110149001050"></a>Lord
Bridges:</b> My Lords, in her introductory remarks,
the noble Baroness explained in general terms the new agreement that
has been reached with the United States on this matter. I listened
carefully, but I did not pick up from her remarks any precise
description of the nature of this document. It does not sound to me as
if it is a new treaty; I suppose it might be a document to be attached
to the treaty but presumably not ratified. My fear is that it is a
letter written by the United States to ourselves which explains in
general terms how they hope that the agreement might work out. In that
case, it has no legal force. The answer to that question will be very
relevant to the future of this whole
subject.</p><p><a name="06110149000227"></a><b><a name="61101-0007.htm_spnew106"></a><a name="06110149001051"></a>Lord
Anderson of Swansea:</b> My Lords, the House has had
the benefit of very weighty legal arguments, but those arguments on the
alleged imbalance in respect of the evidential burden and in respect of
the forum were largely the same as those adduced during the July
debates. It is as if nothing has happened since the July debates which,
as your Lordships will recall, largely turned on the context of the
three British businessmen who are called by their supporters the
&#147;NatWest Three&#148; and by those who do not support them the
&#147;Enron Three&#148;. In my judgment, something of significance
has happened since the July debate and the House should take note of
that.</p><p><a name="06110149000228"></a>The
debate in July, which turned on questions of fairness and reciprocity,
was proper and it strengthened my noble friend&#146;s hand in
Washington. The outcome seems to be better than many of us had assumed.
I refused to support the Government in the July debate and was highly
sceptical that my noble friend could persuade the US legislators to
change their position. I now confess that I was wrong and my noble
friend was far more persuasive than I had imagined. I had assumed that
we were in the hot atmosphere of the debates prior to the mid-term
elections and that legislators asking, &#147;How many votes do you
have?&#148; would be the decisive factor. Indeed, we know that the US
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations has, according to its
constitutional function, given its advice and consent, which is
important.</p><p><a name="06110149000229"></a>We also know that if
the amendments were carried, the treaty would fall. The treaty has
important consequences for our citizens&#151;in my judgment, far more
important than the concerns expressed about them. I therefore
congratulate my noble friend. Having gone to the US surrounded by the
scepticism of many of us, she persuaded her US counterparts on this
issue. She did not have to persuade the Executive because the US
Administration were already on side; it was the legislature that had to
be persuaded. We must concede that she has brought about a sea change
and should be
congratulated.</p><p><a name="06110149000230"></a>In
my judgment, it is therefore important for us to ratify the treaty. It
is certain that we would not be able 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_294"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to do so if the additional restrictions imposed by the amendments we
accepted by the House. The possibility of renegotiation, as put forward
by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is probably as realistic as the
renegotiation of the Treaty of Rome, which some people put equally
unpersuasively.</p><p><a name="06110149000231"></a>Finally,
I note that the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General is
discussing with his US counterpart, Mr Gonzales, protocols which would
affect the choice of forum. We know that the question has been live
since July and for some time previously. As the protocols are broadly
accepted&#151;we are told that the protocols will be agreed
shortly&#151;it is unfortunate that they have not been brought before
the House so that we could reach a judgment on them. That said, it is
clear that there has been a substantial change since July. It was
important that we had the debate then and were able to strengthen the
hands of my noble friend to convince our US friends of our legitimate
concerns. Therefore, in those changed circumstances, I am ready to
support my noble friend and congratulate her on what she did in the
US.</p><p><a name="06110149000232"></a><b><a name="61101-0007.htm_spnew107"></a><a name="06110149001052"></a>Lord
Monson:</b> My Lords, as we are being denied a
separate debate on Motions F and F1&#151;albeit by general
agreement&#151;perhaps I may, as a layman, point out that an eminent
Queen&#146;s Counsel in another place, who happens to be a
distinguished member of the Minister&#146;s party, agreed with her on
Lords Amendment No. 36&#151;the subject of Motions D and
D1&#151;but strongly disagreed with her on Lords Amendments Nos. 81
to 84 inclusive, the subjects of Motions F and F1. Many other
honourable Members on the Government Benches felt exactly the same way.
That is why the Government&#146;s majority on the second set of
amendments eight days ago was very much narrower. I mention that
because, although some noble Lords may feel that the Government have a
case over Motions D and D1 for the reasons set out just now by the
noble Lord, Lord Anderson of Swansea, they may take a very different
view over Motion F1, where I think the Government have absolutely no
case at
all.</p><p><a name="06110149000233"></a><b><a name="61101-0007.htm_spnew108"></a><a name="06110149001053"></a>Lord

virtually identical. In the earlier debates, I was extremely sceptical
and doubtful about whether my noble friend would achieve anything when
she went to the Senate. Indeed, I was even doubtful about what she
would say to members of the Senate that might induce them to change
their minds. I was wrong. My noble friend obviously did a superb job,
the result of which is that the Senate is now prepared to recommend, in
that they are advising consent, that the treaty be
ratified.</p>

<p><a name="06110149000234"></a>I want to make two
points: one is quasi-legal and the other more practical. As presently
drafted, the treaty is in the interests of the United Kingdom. We need
it. I have not heard a word from the other side about the circumstances
in which it benefits the United Kingdom, which it clearly does. It
gives us advantages in getting people back from the United States to
this country. I am rather in favour of that and I should have thought
that most Members of this 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_295"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 295</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>House would be, too. The problem that I had in the earlier discussions
was that we were in a position to ratify but the United States was not
moving in the direction of ratification. It has now moved
considerably&#151;and rather
surprisingly.</p><p><a name="06110149000235"></a>That brings me to
my second point, which concerns the practicalities. If we insist on
these amendments, then, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord
Goodhart&#151;this is his objective&#151;the treaty will have to be
renegotiated. After next Tuesday, there will be a different Senate. If
the treaty goes back to the Senate in the new form&#151;there are
bound to be some changes and there will be a new session of the
Senate&#151;there is no guarantee whatever that it will be accepted.
If it is not accepted, we shall be right back at square one, which,
frankly, is not a position that I would be prepared go back
to.</p><p><a name="06110149000236"></a>By and large, I accept what
my noble friend said. If there is a vote tonight, I shall support the
Government, whereas I am afraid I was not in a position to do that in
July.</p><p><a name="06110149000237"></a><b><a name="61101-0008.htm_spnew109"></a><a name="06110149001054"></a>Lord
Morgan:</b> My Lords, I am not a lawyer. I think that
I am the only person to speak who has no legal training, but, as they
say, law is too important a matter to be left to lawyers and this
matter has social, philosophical and economic aspects that involve us
all.</p><p><a name="06110149000238"></a>I supported the Government
in the initial vote. I think that the noble Baroness will confirm that
I was a lone voice&#151;perhaps a rather surprising one&#151;among
the Labour Peers in giving her my warm support. I am afraid that, when
I heard the speeches from the opposition Benches, I was much influenced
by the famous remark of Tom Paine in <I>The Rights of
Man</I>:</p><ul><a name="06110149000572"></a>&#147;He pities the
plumage, but forgets the dying
bird&#148;.</ul><a name="06110149000291"></a>We had a great
deal of legalistic plumage that was stroked and admired, but the point
is that there are new kinds of international and global crimes from
which we need legal and other
protection.<p><a name="06110149000239"></a>I make three
points. The first has already been made and I am delighted to be on the
same side as my noble friend and former pupil, Lord Anderson, who spoke
with great wisdom, as he always does, on the considerable improvements
that have been gained by the noble Baroness. Frankly, it would then
seem to be totally absurd to erect the much higher and, as my noble
friend Lord Richard said, totally impossible barrier of trying to
negotiate a new treaty. That is not a serious proposition in the real
world of politics, nor, I suspect, in the real world of the law,
although I sometimes wonder where that is
located.</p><p><a name="06110149000240"></a>However, there have
been improvements. Many of the apprehensions initially expressed seemed
to be ludicrous and have been disproved. It was said that these people
would not get bail, and they have. It was said that there would be
various objections in the courts and, in fact&#151;although the noble
Lord, Lord Kingsland, regretted it&#151;the courts have repeatedly
supported the Government&#146;s position. The noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland, did, however, make one valuable point, as he frequently
does, and I again

treaties. That is not centrally germane to this debate, but it is
crucial. I believe in a written constitution and that the role of
Parliament should absolutely be underlined in it. Be that as it may,
under the present circumstances we have had real progress. The Minister
deserves the support of these Benches.</p><h5><a name="06110149000586"></a>5.30

as I briefly indicated, we have different kinds of crime. Without
proper extradition arrangements agreed by countries, global
crime&#151;crimes committed in the context of international
capitalism&#151;will simply not be dealt with. We need practical
arrangements. The legal system must move on, just as international
crime moves on. The globalisation of the world economy affects the
globalisation of crime, and we must have robust arrangements. We cannot
wait for the Greek calends, or whenever, for a fundamental
renegotiation of these treaties.</p><p><a name="06110149000242"></a>Finally, there was a great deal of
patronising observation about the United States of
America&#151;although certainly not from the noble Lord, Lord
Goodhart&#151;and its legal system. It was said that the United
States did not have our guarantees. I think that my noble friend Lord
Anderson would agree with me that some of the observations were
unhistorical. The United States in many ways has a good record on
openness and swiftness of justice. As a historian, I know that the
American trusts dealt with the problems of financial concentration. The
giant Standard Oil of New Jersey was brought to book and dissolved as
early as 1913, I think. You can go back to legislation passed in the
aftermath of the Civil War&#151;the United States is well equipped to
deal with these matters. It is noticeable that the absolute capitalist
scandal of Enron was dealt with in the United States; I wonder whether
our authorities, which have an extraordinary record, would have been
able to do the same. Last time we were discussing the issue, people
suggested that these crimes should be discussed in the British system
because we would get a decision. I remember thinking at the time that
there was as much chance of the England football team winning on a
penalty shoot-out. Our record is pathetic, and I welcome the fact that
we have been given this new tool.</p><p><a name="06110149000243"></a>To talk about the United States as
somehow inferior to some of the other countries with which we have
legal arrangements is grotesque. Why should we say that we have total
confidence in the procedures of some of these countries in eastern
Europe, but that the United States&#151;and, even worse, the state of
Texas&#151;is somehow beyond the pale?</p><p><a name="06110149000244"></a>I congratulate the Government. I would
have congratulated the Minister before, had I the nerve to do so, but I
do so with renewed zest. We need a more robust international approach
to law. Incidentally, the suggestion was made that this would be
disastrous for our foreign policy as well. As one who is well known as
a great critic of the war in Iraq and the American stance there, I
believe that to gratuitously insult the Americans over the integrity of
their legal system and history, and to somehow pretend that they can

Government will be strongly supported.</p><p><a name="06110149000245"></a><b><a name="61101-0008.htm_spnew110"></a><a name="06110149001055"></a>Lord
Lloyd of Berwick:</b> My Lords, I shall be brief.
Listening to the debate, I have sometimes been uncertain whether we
were being asked to amend the treaty signed in 2003 or the extradition
designation order of that year. If there is an imbalance, that
imbalance is in the treaty so recently agreed. It might be as well to
have the wording in mind. Article 8.3, to which the noble Lord, Lord
Goodhart, has referred, states
that,</p><ul><a name="06110149000574"></a>&#147;for requests to
the United States, such information as would provide a reasonable basis
to believe that the person sought committed the offence for which
extradition is
requested&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06110149000292"></a>but
not the other way around. That is the treaty obligation into which we
entered and which the United States, as I understand it, has now
ratified. As I understand it, ratification brings that treaty into
force. If it does
not&#151;<p><a name="06110149000246"></a><b><a name="61101-0008.htm_spnew111"></a><a name="06110149001056"></a>Lord
Goodhart:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble and learned
Lord for giving way. It is not ratification that brings the provision
into force. It is not in force yet. The exchange of instruments of
ratification brings it into force. That has not yet been done and, as I
understand it, will not be done until this matter is disposed
of.</p><p><a name="06110149000247"></a><b><a name="61101-0008.htm_spnew112"></a><a name="06110149001057"></a>Lord
Lloyd of Berwick:</b> My Lords, that gets the noble
Lord no further, because I think that he was inclined to accept that
the 2003 treaty only repeated previous extradition treaties with the
United States going back to the middle of the 19th century. All have
had this imbalance&#151;if you call it an imbalance. They have had
this imbalance because of, as we all know, the provisions of the Fourth
Amendment of the United States constitution. That is the reason for it.
I say in passing that this problem arises not only with the United
States, but with other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand,
with which no difficulties seems to have arisen. Like the United
States, they require something more than mere information; they require
some evidence.</p><p><a name="06110149000248"></a>Extradition has
had a long history since the 1870 Act. Anybody who has had any
part in trying an extradition case will know that, as the years go by,
it becomes more and more difficult and more and more complicated. More
and more technical points are raised in order to prevent extradition.
The change set in in 1957 with the European convention, because it was
seen as absurd to create these unnecessary difficulties when one was
dealing with other countries in the European Union. Surely the same
must also apply, as was so eloquently put, to the United States. To
remove the United States from paragraph 3(2) of the designation order
would be a thoroughly retrogressive step as well as being, as I
understand it, contrary to our treaty obligation whenever that in due
course comes into
force.</p><p><a name="06110149000249"></a><b><a name="61101-0008.htm_spnew113"></a><a name="06110149001058"></a>Lord
Boyd of Duncansby:</b> My Lords, I hesitate to
intervene in this debate, partly because I have not done so before, but
also because many of the 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_298"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arguments have been so eloquently advanced already. However, I feel
compelled to do so because I am particularly concerned about the effect
of the amendments in relation to forum.</p><p><a name="06110149000250"></a>Those amendments impose an obligation on
a judge not to order the extradition of the person unless it appears in
the light of all the circumstances that it would be in the interest of
justice that the person should be tried in the category 1 state, which
is the state seeking the extradition. There is a similar amendment for
category 2 states. No guidance is given anywhere in the amendments
about how one judges the interests of justice. One can have a situation
where virtually all the evidence is in the United Kingdom, but the
devastating consequences of the crime are felt in another state. The
growth of internet crime and the free movement of peoples and goods can
all contribute to such an effect. Does one judge the interests of
justice by where the evidence is located or by where the effect of the
crime is felt?</p><p><a name="06110149000251"></a>From my recent
experience in prosecution, I have real difficulty with sub-paragraph
(2). It is here sought that, in deciding the issue of forum, the judge
is to take into account whether the competent United Kingdom
authorities have decided to refrain from prosecuting the person whose
surrender was sought for the conduct constituting the offence for which
extradition is requested.</p><p><a name="06110149000252"></a>I
accept that there is no obligation on the competent United Kingdom
authority to make such a decision, but there is clearly an
expectation&#151;and, I imagine, there would be an expectation by the
court&#151;that the competent prosecuting authority would advise the
court whether it had decided to refrain from prosecuting. I submit that
that imposes a huge burden on the prosecuting authorities and has the
effect of lengthening&#151;perhaps considerably&#151;extradition
proceedings. In my judgment, no competent prosecuting authority would
be prepared to give such an undertaking or make such a statement unless
it had itself examined all the evidence. In Scotland, that would
include precognition by the Crown authorities.</p><p><a name="06110149000253"></a>We have been talking at length about
white-collar crime, in which in some offences&#151;whether it be
fraud or money laundering&#151;considerable documentation will be
involved, much of it held by the requesting state. I fear that it could
be a considerable time before the prosecuting authority could advise
the court whether it was going to refrain from
prosecuting.</p><p><a name="06110149000254"></a>In
Scotland, at least, the decision to prosecute is taken on two bases.
The first is whether there is sufficient evidence to mount a
prosecution. What is &#147;sufficient&#148; is judged
according to the law in Scotland, which might be very different in the
requesting state. For example, in Scotland, we require corroboration of
all the essential elements of the offence. We also have strict rules
about the use of hearsay&#151;certainly stricter than the rules that
now apply in England and Wales. A case may very well meet the
evidential test in Scotland, but barely do so because of those tests.
There may not be the same difficulty in countries seeking
extradition.</p><p><a name="06110149000255"></a>The
second arm is the public interest. In Scotland, we require the
prosecutor to decide that it is in the 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_299"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>public interest to prosecute. It may be a moot point whether the public
interest is to be appropriated by the interests of
justice&#151;perhaps for this purpose they are one and the same. One
consideration that has historically been given weight, where there are
elements of an offence in another country, is whether it would be
appropriate for that offence to be prosecuted in another country.
Prosecutors in Scotland have always had regard to
that.</p><p><a name="06110149000256"></a>Let us suppose that the
Crown goes through the process of examining all the evidence and
determining whether there is sufficiency. The Crown may come to the
view that there is sufficient evidence to prosecute in Scotland, but it
may very well also come to the view that it would be more appropriate
for that offence to be prosecuted in the state seeking extradition.
Note the important point: it is not that a prosecution is not in the
public interest but that the interests of justice are better served by
a prosecution in the extraditing
state.</p><p><a name="06110149000257"></a>Having
gone through that process, the Crown in Scotland would presumably then
be required to advise the court that it had decided to refrain from
prosecuting. I ask the House to consider what happens if the request
for extradition is refused. The person who is being sought will remain
in this country. Presumably the question then arises whether that
individual is to be prosecuted in the United Kingdom&#151;certainly
in Scotland. It may be that extradition was refused not because of the
appropriateness of the forum but for some completely different reason.
Noble Lords should remember that the Crown may well have taken the view
that it would be in the public interest to prosecute but that
prosecution should be in another country. What happens then? Does the
case go back to the very authority that has already advised the court
that it would refrain from prosecuting?</p><p><a name="06110149000258"></a>Another difficulty in
Scotland&#151;I hesitate to mention it, but it is a real
one&#151;is that the Lord Advocate is barred from prosecuting once he
has made it publicly known that he will not prosecute, even if he took
the view that a prosecution was in the interests of justice. I submit
that the amendments on forum would put in place a mechanism that is
supposed to determine what is in the interests of justice but would, in
fact, defeat the interests of
justice.</p><p><a name="06110149000259"></a>Finally, I find the
proposition that we should renegotiate the treaty really rather
alarming. I have been involved in extradition both from and to the
United States and, as a recent prosecutor, I would be very alarmed if
we were to return to the system that pre-existed the Extradition Act.
For all those reasons, I support the
Motion.</p><h5><a name="06110149000588"></a>5.45

friend Lord Boyd explained very clearly why the amendments tabled by
the noble Lords opposite would cause huge difficulty for and damage to
this country and, indeed, to our ability to prosecute. I accept all the
comments made in support of the Motion, and I shall not repeat them,
except to say that crime has now become truly international. It is no
respecter of frontiers or borders, which is why we have striven in most
recent years to find ways in which we can work in comity to ensure that
those who commit offences internationally do not escape justice. I am
sure that noble Lords opposite do not propose that someone should avoid
the consequences of their actions simply because they can escape from
these shores, commit offences and come home again. The offences that we
seek to cover in this treaty are weighty indeed. It may assist the
House if I run through the sorts of cases involving extradition to the
United States in 2005-06 that we have covered in the treaty. They
include indecent assault, two cases of theft, nine cases involving
drugs, child abduction, grievous bodily harm, fraud, murder, child
pornography, forgery, rape and money laundering. Those are the
extraditions from the United States. The extraditions from the United
States to the United Kingdom in 2005-06 were for drugs offences,
burglary, child abduction, forgery, manslaughter, murder and deception.
We are talking not about minor offences, but about enabling our
countries to work together in unison to bring about justice for
victims.</p><p><a name="06110149000262"></a>I listened carefully to
the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Goodhart. I confess that I
wondered whether real consideration was being given to what we as a
country would lose if we passed these amendments and how our citizens
would be thereby ill-served.</p><p><a name="06110149000263"></a><b><a name="61101-0008.htm_spnew115"></a><a name="06110149001060"></a>Lord

estimate how many of these cases would have led to extradition under
the old regime? I would have thought it likely that most, if not all,
of them would have been extradited under the previous
rules.</p><p><a name="06110149000264"></a><b><a name="61101-0008.htm_spnew116"></a><a name="06110149001061"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, many of them will
be capable of being extradited but the noble Lord will
remember&#151;and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, was
absolutely right&#151;that it is a question of timing. I know the
House does not need to be reminded that it used to take us about 22
months to go through the process of extradition, when the United States
was returning people to us within five. Even with this new process we
are still taking about eight months to its five. We wish, where
appropriate, to be able to return people to them just as
quickly.</p><p><a name="06110149000265"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, raised the issue of Article 7. I listened
carefully to what he said and I am not sure whether he was conflating
its provisions with the Irish law. Noble Lords will know that the
United Kingdom chose not to incorporate this safeguard into the
legislation when it became a party to the ECE in 1991. No argument was
advanced to alter the position when the Extradition Act 2003 was
passed. There are full and proper safeguards in that Act, 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_301"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 301</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>including human rights safeguards. Furthermore, this provision could
result in a serious offender escaping justice anywhere. That cannot be
in the interests of the victims of crime.</p><p><a name="06110149000266"></a>This House perhaps did this country a
service in giving me that ammunition. I am grateful for all the
compliments that I have been paid&#151;none of them entirely
deserved. I was able to deploy the arguments that were advanced in this
House with full effect in the United States, and they were mortified
that this House felt that they were not totally committed to making
sure that we were extraditing people, one to another, in a way that was
sound and that would inure to the benefit of our people. That desire to
act in comity with us encouraged them and enabled them to move with
such speed and expedition, at a time of real difficulty, to give us a
clear answer that they were on our
side.</p><p><a name="06110149000267"></a>For us to go back now and
say, &#147;Notwithstanding the fact that you have moved mountains to
satisfy us, we are still not so satisfied&#148; would be a day which
would cause me&#151;a very rare occasion&#151;to feel that this
House had not done itself a service. I ask noble Lords to reject the
amendments in the names of the noble Lords opposite and to allow us
now, with due speed and expedition, to ratify this treaty, which will
inure to the benefit of all our
people.</p><p><a name="06110149000268"></a><b><a name="61101-0008.htm_spnew117"></a><a name="06110149001062"></a>Lord
Kingsland:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to all
noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. I want to spend one or two
minutes responding to some of the points that were raised. The noble
Lord, Lord Morgan, referred to the very high standard in the United
States of protection of individual rights. I entirely agree. The United
States, through its constitution and the jurisprudence of the Supreme
Court, has a record which is second to none in protecting individual
rights. My criticism was not of the standard of rights in the United
States. It was the fact that the Government, through this treaty, would
be prepared to accept a lower standard for citizens facing extradition
in this country than United States&#146; citizens would face when we
sought to extradite them from the United States. That was the point I
was seeking to make.</p><p><a name="06110149000269"></a>The noble
Lord also, quite rightly, drew the attention of your Lordships&#146;
House to the nature of modern crime and the difficulties that we face
in trying to defeat it. I also entirely accept that argument, which the
whole debate, for example, about control orders, which took place about
18 months ago, was about. However, just because there are new sorts of
crime, that does not mean we should surrender all the hard fought-for
liberties of the individual in this country. We should test them very
carefully against the new challenges to see whether they need to be
modified, not simply abjectly to surrender them because there is a new
crime that we do not
recognise.</p><p><a name="06110149000270"></a><b><a name="61101-0008.htm_spnew118"></a><a name="06110149001063"></a>Lord

principles of what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said very moderately
and reasonably. What worries me is not so much observing legal
safeguards, but

complicated, to erect higher barriers against solving it will make
matters
worse.</p><p><a name="06110149000271"></a><b><a name="61101-0008.htm_spnew119"></a><a name="06110149001064"></a>Lord
Kingsland:</b> My Lords, of course, I do not dissent
from that. I think that that is true. Nevertheless, one of the
difficulties about the fact that this treaty was never scrutinised by
the House is that we have had no chance to assess whether the degree of
sacrifice that we are being asked to make in terms of individual rights
is properly balanced by the new challenges that we face. It is
particularly difficult in the context of a bilateral treaty with the
United States, because United States criminal law, unlike any other
criminal law in the world, has this enormous extra-territorial
outreach. It can reach out to individuals in the United Kingdom who
have never even set foot in the United States and it can use these
provisions in the treaty to extradite
them.</p><p><a name="06110149000272"></a>In my submission, it is
above all with arrangements in the United States, because of the
extra-territoriality of the criminal law which is wholly unmatched by
our criminal law, that we need to look with particular care at the
provisions included in this treaty. But there is absolutely no sign
whatever&#151;</p><p><a name="06110149000273"></a><b><a name="61101-0008.htm_spnew120"></a><a name="06110149001065"></a>Baroness

Kingsland:</b> My Lords, of course not. I have made
it absolutely clear that we want the treaty; but it contains sacrifices
of individual rights which are too severe. If the Government had owned
up to the fact that these negotiations were going on in the early
months of 2003 and to what they were about, we might have had a
sensible debate and would not be in the position that we are today. But
not even the Minister of State in the House of Commons knew about it,
and we knew nothing about it. Because of that failure to disclose, we
find ourselves here tonight on the verge of a vote. So I do not accept
what lay behind the noble Baroness&#146;s
intervention.</p><p><a name="06110149000275"></a>The noble Lord,
Lord Richard, said that we need the treaty. I do not disagree with him.
The issue is what price we are paying for the

the treaty because he is concerned about the

wholly inappropriate word in this context. One of the reasons why
ratification is a side issue here is because for the past three years
we have been operating in this country as if the treaty were ratified,
so it makes absolutely no difference to us. For the past three years
the terms of this treaty, not those of the 1972 treaty, have been
respected, even though these terms have no binding effect in
international law.</p>

that in my speech by quoting from Article 7.1 of the European
Convention on Extradition. It is quite clear that the amendment we have
tabled is based on that. It is also a provision within the Irish treaty
with the United States. The Irish have entered into a treaty with the
United States and many aspects of that treaty are similar to our own;
but what the Irish have done is to provide the forum defence whereby if
a judge, not a prosecutor, thinks it is in the interests of justice for

Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I beg to move that
the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 71 to which the Commons
have disagreed and do agree with the Commons in their
Amendments Nos. 71A to 71K to the words so restored to the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06110160000005"></a>These
amendments concern the Secretary of State&#146;s powers to intervene
where serious and persistent police performance concerns have arisen.
We have listened to the concerns raised during previous stages of the
Bill and we have worked hard to accommodate them by tabling in the
other place a number of government amendments. We believe that these
address the concerns of your Lordships&#146; House while ensuring
that the powers remain fit for purpose. 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_307"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 307</b><br /> <br /></columnNum></p><p><a name="06110160000006"></a>It is in the light of experience
gained over the past four years in supporting forces to build up an
effective performance regime that we have developed these proposals to
update the Secretary of State&#146;s powers of intervention. The new
provisions in the Bill, as first introduced in this House, will modify
the reserve powers to intervene in an underperforming force or police
authority. As I have previously explained, we are not taking new
powers. The powers were originally introduced by the Police and
Magistrates&#146; Court Act 1994 and enable the Secretary of State to
direct a police authority to take measures to improve performance in a
police force where it has been shown to not be efficient or effective
or will cease to be efficient or effective. I stress this last point
because it is important that the House recognises that the power to
intervene when there is a danger that a force or authority will fail is
a long-standing one. We are not breaking new ground
here.</p><p><a name="06110160000007"></a>We firmly believe that the
Government should have reserve powers to intervene in those areas where
policing has fallen below an acceptable level and other non-statutory
resolutions to performance issues have proved insufficient. At present,
intervention can be triggered only by an adverse report from Her
Majesty&#146;s Inspector of Constabulary, and experience has shown
that there may well be other relevant sources of information. Examples
are the findings of a public inquiry&#151;the Bichard inquiry being a
case in point&#151;the police performance assessments and objective
performance data, as well as HMIC inspection findings. That is why the
Bill widens the sources of information which the Home Secretary can
consider in deciding whether to exercise his
powers.</p><p><a name="06110160000008"></a>Secondly, the Bill
streamlines the intervention process. In all but the most exceptional
cases, statutory intervention will be considered at a point when all
other means of collaboration and support have been attempted but
performance has failed to improve. Policing is a service delivered and
governed locally and it must be performed to a consistent and
acceptable standard in all our communities. The responsibility for
ensuring that such a service is provided rightly resides with the chief
constable and the police authority. None the less, there may be
occasions when it becomes clear that an area is receiving an
unacceptable standard of policing and the local force and authority
have been unable to take the necessary steps to address this.</p><p><a name="06110160000009"></a>In that respect, we recognise the strong
feeling expressed about the changes which would allow the Secretary of
State on some occasions to direct a chief constable on performance
matters and not to have to route this direction through the police
authority. The amendments agreed by the other place restore the
position under the Police Reform Act, which routes the intervention
power through the police authority on all occasions&#151;something
which I know will give the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, to name but
one, a considerable amount of satisfaction. The amendments recognise
that it is the police authority which is primarily charged with holding
the chief constable of a force to account.</p>



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_308"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110160000010"></a>The second main point of concern has
focused on what we feel is misrepresentation of the intent of these
powers, namely that the Secretary of State should use them on a whim or
for a trivial purpose. We have made it clear throughout that they are
intended to be used only when serious and persistent performance
concerns have arisen and other attempts to address these have failed.
These are powers of last resort and the revisions are intended to be
used only in cases in which the force or authority has had an
opportunity to make improvements and the decision to intervene is based
on sound evidence.</p><p><a name="06110160000011"></a>To provide
further reassurance on this point, we have introduced an amendment
which requires the Secretary of State to consult Her Majesty&#146;s
Inspectorate of Constabulary when he proposes to use these powers in
relation to a police force or police authority. Furthermore, the
Secretary of State will be under a duty to publish the
inspectorate&#146;s opinion on the evidence leading to that proposed
course of action. This will ensure that the inspectorate's
professional, independent advice is available to the Secretary of State
on whether the use of the powers is, in its opinion, the right course
of action. This provides confidence that the inspectorate&#146;s
opinion will be taken into account when deciding whether to invoke the
powers.</p><p><a name="06110160000012"></a>Our proposals are
intended to provide the Government with effective but proportionate
intervention powers of last resort. We have listened to some concerns
about how they might be interpreted or used and have responded
accordingly with some specific safeguards. On Report, the noble
Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, indicated that while her preference
was to remove these provisions entirely from the Bill she recognised
that it was sensible to have a plan B. I suggest to her that the
amendments made in the other place deliver her plan B and, in
particular, address her concern that it would&#151;in her
view&#151;be unconstitutional for the Home Secretary to be able to
give directions to a chief officer. Given the additional safeguards we
have introduced, I urge the House not to insist on its Amendment No.
71.</p><p><a name="06110160000013"></a>I have taken some time
dealing with this matter, because there are many issues on which noble
Lords want assurance. I hope that I have given all the assurances that
will enable noble Lords to allow this amendment to pass swiftly from
your Lordships' House.</p><p><a name="06110160000014"></a>Moved,
That the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 71 to which the
Commons have disagreed and do agree with the Commons in their
Amendments Nos. 71A to 71K to the words so restored to the
Bill.&#151;(<I>Baroness Scotland of
Asthal.</I>)</p><p><a name="06110160000015"></a><b><a name="61101-0009.htm_spnew127"></a><a name="06110160000473"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> My Lords, I give a cautious
welcome to these amendments, which were introduced in the other place.
They represent significant progress in addressing the concerns that I
raised in previous debates on this matter. I am certainly very pleased
that the Government have listened to the arguments about the balance of
powers within the tripartite relationship and, equally, the need to
balance central and local powers. The issues 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_309"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 309</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>formed much of the backdrop to the disquiet about the
Government&#146;s earlier proposals. However, as I say, my welcome is
cautious because I am not certain that the amendments address all the
problems that I have with these provisions. I hope that the Minister
can offer me a tad more assurance on the elements that still cause me a
little concern.</p><p><a name="06110160000016"></a>The amendments
remove the possibility that the Secretary of State could give
directions to a chief constable. Instead, all such directions must be
routed through the police authority, which is a very important and
welcome step in the right direction. I am also very gratified that HMIC
will be given a role in commenting not only on whether a police force
is fundamentally flawed before intervention takes place, but on whether
a police authority is failing as well. This, too, is an important
change, because it ensures that an independent view will be expressed
on whether intervention is warranted in both forces and authorities.
But I confess that I should have liked the amendments to be a little
stronger, as they do not, for instance, oblige the Secretary of State
to pay any attention to what the chief inspector says or, if he
disagrees with the chief inspector, to explain
why.</p><p><a name="06110160000017"></a>I understand the
Government&#146;s reasons for wanting to broaden the sources of
information that might inform a judgment about whether a force is
failing, but they have probably got more from these provisions than
just a wider spread of reference material. Under the old arrangements,
no intervention could be triggered unless an adverse report had been
received from HMIC. Now the chief inspector can express an opinion, but
that is not what determines whether intervention takes place. That is
done by the Secretary of
State.</p><p><a name="06110160000018"></a>The
amendments also specify that it is the Secretary of State, not HMIC,
who has a responsibility for publishing the opinion of the chief
inspector. I find that a little puzzling, as I should have thought it
was perfectly proper for the chief inspector to publish his own
opinion. In addition, it is clear that it is up to the Secretary of
State to decide how he will publish the chief inspector&#146;s
opinion, which gives the unfortunate impression of leaving room to be
less than transparent about how this might be done. I am sure that that
is not the intention but that the Government wish to maintain
flexibility in case genuinely sensitive material is involved. It
reinforces the appearance of minimising the role of HMIC in this
process. I simply make that observation. This role is important because
the independence and expertise of HMIC are key elements of providing
reassurance about the legitimate and effective use of intervention
powers.</p><p><a name="06110160000019"></a>How do the Government
believe these provisions will operate in practice, especially as there
might be disagreement between HMIC and the Home Secretary about what
&#147;failing&#148; means? Could the Minister also offer
reassurance on the other points that I have raised and explain why the
Secretary of State will publish the chief inspector&#146;s opinion?
If, as I hope, she is able to reassure me, I shall be satisfied with
that, but I put on record my continuing interest and assurance that I
shall be watching very carefully how these powers are
used.</p>

Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, I agree
wholeheartedly with the views put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady
Harris of Richmond. With the House wanting to move on as swiftly as
possible to Motion F, I will abandon the other remarks that I was going
to make, save for one technical question of which I gave the Government
advance notice. It is a minor matter, but we need an explanation on
it.</p><p><a name="06110160000021"></a>On Report, government
Amendment No. 45 was debated with a group on which we divided, which
affected the provision that we are reinstating. We did not object to
Amendment No. 45 per se, but it was removed from the Bill simply
because its text fell within Amendment No. 44, which removed lines 33
to 44 from the Bill. That sounds like double-Dutch&#151;not meaning
to be rude to the Dutch, of
course.</p><p><a name="06110160000022"></a>The text of Amendment
No. 45 included a reference to Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector for
Justice, Community Safety and Custody. I pointed out at col.
65 in the <I>Official Report</I> on Report that there was a reference
in the amendment to an organisation that we did not see come into
effect, but I said that we would not debate it because we could do so
at the next stage&#151;and we talked about the prisons inspectorate.
The Government have abandoned their plans to have the statutory Chief
Inspector for Justice, Community Safety and Custody, which is welcome,
but I want to be sure that the amendment that the Government put into
the Bill then has not crept back in again. It is simply a matter of
being sure that by agreeing to the Government&#146;s Motion today no
reference will creep back in to the conglomerate inspectorate. At what
stage was the reference excised from the
Bill?</p><p><a name="06110160000023"></a><b><a name="61101-0009.htm_spnew129"></a><a name="06110160000475"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble
Baronesses, Lady Anelay and Lady Harris. I shall deal first with the
point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, as I can do that
quickly. The reference was expunged when the Bill returned to the
Commons. She is right in that there was a timing issue, because we
dealt with that amendment before we dealt with the amendment on whether
the joint inspectorate would continue in being. As a result of the
amendments that we made at that time, when we came back to the next
stage of the Bill we did things very hurriedly. We have cleared it up,
and I assure the noble Baroness that no inaccurate reference
remains.</p><h5><a name="06110160000154"></a>6.30

<p><a name="06110160000024"></a>I turn to the point raised by
the noble Baroness, Lady Harris. I hope I can satisfy her. I do not
have a bad record in so doing, so I hope I do not get bowled out on
this one. Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Constabulary is the
principal source of professional advice to the Home Secretary on
policing matters. The Home Secretary is accountable to Parliament for
the provision of an efficient and effective police service in England
and Wales. That means that HMIC&#146;s reports are presented to the
Secretary of State so that he has an informed picture of the conditions
of the police service in England and Wales and any issues facing it. He
has the final responsibility, not HMIC. It follows, therefore, that the
Secretary of State should then have the duty to 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_311"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>publish those reports to ensure that Parliament and the public have a
full picture as well, and to inform the debate in both this House and
the other place.</p><p><a name="06110160000025"></a>The Police Act
1996 placed the Secretary of State under the duty to publish
HMIC&#146;s reports, and we do not see any reason why we should
depart from that custom when considering the intervention provisions in
the Bill. I assure the noble Baroness that the report would still be
published even if there were great disagreement or conflict over its
contents. For these intervention provisions, the government amendment
makes it quite clear that the Secretary of State is under a duty to
publish the HMIC report even if he disagrees with its contents. As a
result, the process for making any decision on possible intervention is
open and transparent. It also means that Parliament and the public have
a balanced picture of the situation in a force area where performance
has been a concern. If there were a conflict or a difference, as the
noble Baroness fears, we would all know what that was and the basis
upon which it was formed.</p><p><a name="06110160000026"></a>I
hope that fully satisfies the noble Baroness. I will add the caveat,
&#147;for now&#148;, as I understand that she will for ever be
vigilant; indeed, I would accept that she did not sleep without
thinking of police authorities and their powers, and how they could be
kept better in check and do their job
well.</p><p><a name="06110160000027"></a>On Question, Motion agreed

1:</p><ul><a name="06110160000137"></a>After Clause 8,
insert the following new clause-</ul><ul><a name="06110160000138"></a>&#147;CIRCUS ANIMALS</ul><ul><a name="06110160000139"></a>(1) For the purposes of a circus, a
person commits an offence if he uses or keeps an animal not of a kind
designated under subsection (2).</ul><ul><a name="06110160000140"></a>(2) For the purposes of subsection (1),
the Secretary of State may by regulations designate a kind of animal if
he is satisfied, on the basis of scientific evidence, that the welfare
needs of an animal of that kind are likely to be met if they are used
or kept for the purposes of a circus.</ul><ul><a name="06110160000141"></a>(3) A person does not commit an offence

section.</ul><ul><a name="06110160000142"></a>(4) After the period
specified in subsection (3), in the case of individual animals already

keeping or introducing of animals wholly or mainly for the purpose of
performing tricks or manoeuvres at more than one place during any
period of one year, and (b)
&#147;scientific evidence&#148; may include evidence of welfare
during performance, training, travelling and any other circumstances
pertaining to the
circus.&#148;<p><a name="06110160000039"></a>The
noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am sorry to bring this amendment back
at Third Reading. I am aware of the new procedures and I wish that I
did not have to bring it back. On Report, noble Lords expressed great
concern about this issue. The use of animals in circuses is a matter
about which people feel strongly. I withdrew the amendment then so that
the Government could make clear their intentions on the circus working
group&#146;s remit, as it will decide how the matter is to be
tackled. This is the last chance to raise this
issue.</p><p><a name="06110160000040"></a>I am afraid that, far
from clarifying the issue, the Government have done the opposite. The
remit of the circus working group was supposed to be based on a
commitment that the Minister, Ben Bradshaw, made to investigate
prohibiting the use of certain species in the circus. Since March, we
have been told that the circus working group will work on banning some
kinds of animals from working in circuses. Now, just as the Bill is
completing its passage, all that
changes.</p><p><a name="06110160000041"></a>Last week the noble
Lord, Lord Rooker, said
that,</p><ul><a name="06110160000150"></a>&#147;we have given a
commitment to ban the use of certain non-domesticated species in
travelling circuses&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/10/06;
col. 1002.]</ul><a name="06110160000097"></a>However,
between Report and Third Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, wrote to
Peers saying that, 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_316"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 316</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="06110160000151"></a>&#147;it is not correct to say that
the remit of the group is to examine which species should be banned
from
performing&#148;.</ul><a name="06110160000098"></a>Therefore,
the Government&#146;s intention with regard to the remit is no longer
clear.<p><a name="06110160000042"></a>Last week the Minister
told us clearly in response to my Amendment No. 7 that it was not
appropriate to make sweeping welfare generalisations on the basis of
domestication. It seems inconsistent, then, arbitrarily to exclude
domesticated circus animals from the consideration of the working
group.</p><p><a name="06110160000043"></a>The core of my amendment
is still to place the burden of proof on those who would show that the
welfare of different kinds of animals can be met in a circus
environment. If the Government&#146;s requirement for positive
prohibition went ahead, the group might conclude that lions, tigers and
pumas should be prohibited from use in a travelling circus. However,
that would still allow circuses to use other species of the cat family,
such as lynx, cheetahs and
jaguars.</p><p><a name="06110160000044"></a>The regulations would
not work well, because each species would have to be banned each time,
whereas my amendment proposes that species would be opted in as being
suitable. Therefore, I am saying to the Government that it is better to
presume against using any animals than to look at the species already
in use to see whether welfare standards can be met. All sides of the
House agreed on that point on Report, and I am grateful to noble Lords
who expressed that view then and continued to express it to me before
Third Reading today.</p><p><a name="06110160000045"></a>In
response to concerns expressed by the Bill team in discussions, I have
added a time delay of two years to the amendment to allow the working
group time to license the kinds of animals that can be kept and to give
an extra six months&#146; grace to re-home animals that would be
prohibited. My amendment also fills another lacuna, because it requires
the circus working group to look at evidence of welfare in training,
which the Government intend to leave to Performing Animals Welfare
Standards International and to the industry to self-regulate. It would
not be sensible for the circus working group to try to assess welfare
in circuses without looking at training.</p><p><a name="06110160000046"></a>I hope that the Minister will clarify the
remit of the working group, given the variations in the
Government&#146;s stance to date. I hope that he will add training to
the provision and that he will accept that a remit based on positive
proof and licensing is the best way to proceed. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06110160000047"></a><b><a name="61101-0010.htm_spnew133"></a><a name="06110160000480"></a>Lord
Kirkhill:</b> My Lords, I support the amendment, as I
indicated on previous occasions. The emphasis is correct in that there
should be an opt-in; that seems to me to be a straightforward way of
implementing this sort of regulation. Given that the second working
group no longer exists, the Minister might be able to reassure the
House about the remit on training. It will be industry-led, and the
industry has a vested interest. Animals will be exploited for
commercial purposes as they are in the greyhound racing
industry&#151;where anyway, as we have been saying recently,
self-regulation does not seem to work very well. I would be interested
if the Minister could confirm that the self-regulatory remit will
enable a

mainly, but not altogether, in the training of animals for circuses and
other performing acts that a good deal of cruelty takes
place.</p><p><a name="06110160000048"></a><b><a name="61101-0010.htm_spnew134"></a><a name="06110160000481"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I do not think that the noble
Baroness should have to apologise for bringing the matter back to the
House, because that is her prerogative under our rules of
self-regulation&#151;even though I probably have not yet been able to
satisfy her and that is why this issue is back. I am not sure whether I
will be able to satisfy her at this late stage. This issue has been
debated at every stage of this Bill before I went back to Defra. I
welcome the opportunity to clarify the Government&#146;s commitment
to act on wild animals in circuses.</p><p><a name="06110160000049"></a>The amendment would ban all performing
animals in circuses, unless a particular species was exempted under
regulations, with a two-year period following commencement of the
offence in which no offences would be committed. This is not a minor
amendment&#151;I do not think that the noble Baroness says that it
is&#151;it is a complete reversal of the burden of proof regarding
the use of circus animals. We have always proposed to ban certain
species of wild animals on the basis of scientific evidence. That is
the way we are trying to go forward. This amendment, however, seeks to
ban all animals, not just wild animals, and to allow
exemptions.</p><p><a name="06110160000050"></a>The Government have
made it clear that we are committed to banning certain non-domesticated
species currently used in circuses, with a regulation coming into force
in 2008. That commitment is crystal clear. It has been given many times
in debate, and it was given in a Written Statement to the other place
on 8 March 2006 by the Minister, Ben Bradshaw. Adding an amendment to
the Bill to confirm a commitment that has already been given is not
necessary.</p><p><a name="06110160000051"></a>The
Government&#146;s commitment to ban certain non-domesticated species
will be based on scientific evidence. Following a commitment that I
gave in Grand Committee, the circus working group is up and running,
and it is sourcing available, relevant evidence on welfare standards of
non-domesticated species. We are already delivering on our commitment.
The noble Baroness wants to go beyond a ban on wild animal acts and to
commit us to a ban on all species of animal, subject to exemptions.
Some may argue that this is a minor amendment, but it is not, as I have
said. There is no evidence&#151;I have not seen any and I do not
think that the Minister in the other place has either&#151;of a
welfare problem for domesticated species in circuses, and our intention
is not to ban them. The time limit for producing scientific evidence
for every possible type of animal that is currently involved in
circuses, which would then be used to assess whether they are exempted
from a ban, is two years. That is probably nowhere near long enough in
any event.</p><p><a name="06110160000052"></a>The amendment could
have unfortunate and unforeseen consequences. It defines circus animals
and their use in performance in a way that is totally different from
our understanding of what a traditional travelling circus is. It could
be interpreted&#151;and others will interpret the legislation 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_318"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>if we are not precise&#151;as meaning displays at events such as
Crufts or the Horse of the Year Show. As we read the amendment, someone
who trains their horse to do dressage would be required to show that
there is an exemption from the ban for dressage displays. Such an
exemption could be made only on the basis of scientific evidence. Where
there is no scientific evidence in place, no exemption could be made.
That will be the point, and people will go to court and argue that
case.</p><p><a name="06110160000053"></a>The amendment envisages
some sort of government panel to consider scientific evidence and
exempt all animal species both where there was evidence available and
where there was no evidence of a welfare problem. The time and
consideration necessary would be much greater than the noble Baroness
anticipates. We could be left with a law that would put a sudden stop
to a lot of entertainment that most of the public would regard as
innocent and which in no way compromises the welfare of an animal. The
impact on the welfare and future for animals already in circuses has
not been considered. A six-month grace period for existing animals in
circuses that are deemed to be unsuitable following scientific research
is certainly not adequate, and the likely implications for the welfare
of those animals have to be
considered.</p><p><a name="06110160000054"></a>The resource
implications of carrying out the research that would be necessary must
also be considered. I have spelt out, as have previous Ministers, that
our resources are finite. We do not have the resources to do everything
all at once. We have had to make priorities. The Government have
changed our priorities for implementing the secondary legislation and
codes under this Bill to take account of the views that have been
expressed in Parliament. Commitments have been given to introduce codes
or legislation on greyhounds, circuses and game birds earlier than was
originally planned.</p><p><a name="06110160000055"></a>The
amendment would require a huge amount of resource to be focused on a
narrow issue. I will plead resources. There is no argument. Everyone
knows that my department has considerable budgetary problems at
present. We are at &#163;200 million this year, and we hope that
within a few weeks we will announce the consequences for the following
year, 2007-08. We are under severe budgetary pressure, and we are
looking for savings. If we were to go back and say that we needed to
use some of that for this, frankly, we would not get approval in the
department from the team of Ministers. The amendment would require huge
resources to be focused on an important but narrow issue on which we
have already given a commitment. We are not dismissing this matter out
of hand and we have given commitments on circus animals. But we cannot
interfere with other commitments that we have given or the timetables
that we have planned. I would rightly be hauled back here week after
week at Questions about commitments that we would have given and failed
on, such as those that I have mentioned on greyhounds and game
birds.</p>

1.</p><p><a name="06110160000076"></a>On 15 December 2005, the
Secretary of State announced that the current &#147;netting
off&#148; funding arrangement for safety cameras operating within the
national safety camera programme is to cease at the end of March 2007.
From April 2007, all fines from speeding offences will go to the
Treasury in the same way as any other fine, so there will no longer be
a surplus of fine revenue. This means that the provisions in this
clause will no longer be appropriate and, as such, the clause will not
be needed.</p><p><a name="06110160000077"></a>Under new funding
arrangements, local authorities will receive additional money for road
safety through the local transport plan process&#151;some &#163;440
million over four years. The money will be available for funding safety
cameras, but equally it will be available for funding any other form of
road safety initiative. So, the Government will deliver the level
playing field on funding that may be one of the purposes of
Clause 2.</p><p><a name="06110160000078"></a>This new arrangement
will mean that safety cameras and other road safety measures will be
funded in exactly the same way. Also, it will integrate safety cameras
into the wider road safety delivery process and give local authorities
and road safety partners greater flexibility to implement whichever
locally agreed mix of road safety measures will make the greatest
contribution to reducing road casualties in their area.</p>



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_321"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 321</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110160000079"></a>Furthermore, the revised
funding arrangements that the Government are introducing from 1 April
2007 have two clear and important advantages as compared with the
provisions of Clause 2. First, Clause 2 could give an incentive to
local authorities to seek to increase the amount of fine revenue
generated by safety cameras, because that would increase the surplus
funding which Clause 2 would make available for other local transport
purposes&#151;whereas, under the funding arrangements being
introduced by the Government, there would be no possibility of such a
perverse
incentive.</p><p><a name="06110160000080"></a>Secondly,
the arrangements being introduced by the Government will give to local
authorities and their local partners much greater stability and
certainty about the amount of funding available. If local authorities
had to rely on surplus fine income from safety cameras, that could be
unstable and uncertain, because the objective of the camera programme,
which we all share, is to improve compliance with speed limits, which
will reduce the level of fines over time and hence also reduce the
level of any surplus&#151;and very possibly lead to a deficit, where
the costs of operating cameras are greater than the income from fines
generated from camera
detections.</p><p><a name="06110160000081"></a>I must ask the noble
Lord, Lord Hanningfield, whether it is really his intention that local
authorities which succeed in improving compliance with speed limits,
thereby reducing the income from speed cameras, should be penalised by
receiving less money for other transport purposes. Is it his intention
that local authorities which succeed in driving up the level of fine
income from cameras by whatever means should be rewarded by receiving
more funding for other transport purposes? Those would be the effects
of Clause 2.</p><p><a name="06110160000082"></a>In the
Government&#146;s view, the clause would create perverse and
dangerous incentives. As it is, some motorists suspect that the safety
camera scheme is a revenue-generating device. That is a widespread
misapprehension among motorists and others. There is currently no
justice in that suspicion, but if Clause 2 were enacted, there would be
real grounds for it. That would be damaging, because it is important
that the Government&#146;s road safety policies should command the
respect of the great majority of road users, including
motorists.</p><p><a name="06110160000083"></a>Finally, I must
advise the noble Lord that Clause 2 is technically defective in at
least three respects. First, it refers
to,</p><ul><a name="06110160000152"></a>&#147;income from the
enforcement of offences under subsection (2)&#148;,
</ul><a name="06110160000099"></a>which is an inaccurate
phrase of uncertain ambit and could well extend to income from offences
detected by police officers as well as offences detected by cameras.
Secondly, it refers to a &#147;relevant national authority&#148;,
which is a strange and undefined notion; by contrast, Section 38 of the
Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001 confers powers on the Secretary of State.
Thirdly, there are other undefined terms such as &#147;safety camera
scheme&#148;, &#147;relevant local transport authority&#148; and
&#147;local transport facilities&#148;. The noble Lord may think I
am nitpicking&#151;he does&#151;but this legislation is at a very
late stage and our obligation is to ensure that it is as accurate as
possible.
<p><a name="06110160000084"></a>The crucial point is
that Clause 2 is now no longer necessary. Given the changes which the
Government

perverse incentives. The clause is seriously defective. I hope the
noble Lord, having pursued these issues with his customary assiduity,
will on this occasion feel that he can safely withdraw his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06110160000085"></a>Moved, That the House

Hanningfield</b> moved, as an amendment to the Motion
that this House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 1,
leave out &#147;agree&#148; and insert
&#147;disagree&#148;.</p><p><a name="06110160000087"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall be as brief as possible. It is
interesting to note that it is exactly one year ago this month that we
first discussed this amendment in your Lordships' House. I declare an
interest as leader of Essex County Council, as this amendment is
relevant to local
government.</p><p><a name="06110160000088"></a>Noble
Lords will recall that this new clause is designed to enhance local
road safety measures by permitting the hypothecation of surplus income
from safety camera enforcement for expenditure by relevant local
transport authorities on road safety measures. In short, it is intended
to provide a source of funding that will enable local expertise to be
translated into local road safety initiatives in a manner that is both
responsive to and commensurate with the character of local
problems.</p><p><a name="06110160000089"></a>The
figures are quite striking. In 2000-01, there were only seven camera
partnerships which took just over &#163;10 million in fines and spent
just under &#163;9 million, leaving a balance of a little
over &#163;1 million, which went into the consolidated
fund&#151;better known perhaps as the Chancellor&#146;s black hole,
which the Minister has just mentioned. That balance was 13 per cent of
the funds in 2001. What is fascinating is that there has been a
spectacular increase in income and in the number of partnerships. There
were about 35 partnerships in 2003-04 with receipts of &#163;112
million and an expenditure of &#163;92 million, leaving &#163;20
million going to the Chancellor. Not only have receipts increased
approximately tenfold, but the balance going to the Chancellor as a
percentage of total receipts has increased from 13 per cent to 18 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06110160000090"></a>Ten years ago around
200,000 speeding fines were issued. That figure has now rocketed to 2
million. At the same time, the number of traffic policemen has fallen
from 9,000 in 1997 to 7,000 in 2005. Therefore, we are worried that
there is too much dependence on mechanical, fixed forms of enforcement
and not enough on human beings&#151;policemen&#151;who can take
account of varying conditions. We are also concerned about the serious
failing in the Government&#146;s strategy. That very point was echoed
by the report published yesterday by the Transport Select Committee,
which stated that the country needed greater numbers of traffic
officers to enforce existing traffic laws. The committee chairman,
Gwyneth Dunwoody, went further and said that cameras are a useful tool
but could not replace officers. It is exactly that type of electronic
policing, blunt and arbitrary as it is, that is causing rather a lot of
anger around the country.</p>

amendment is not about whether cameras save lives or reduce
accidents&#151;clearly evidence suggests that in most cases they
do&#151;but about bringing a greater degree of transparency and
openness to the process of road enforcement and allowing people the
chance to see that surplus revenues are being spent directly on road
safety measures. Speaking of my own county, we could be as much as
&#163;6 million better off, and that money would provide so many more
road safety projects. I am quite happy that the money should be
hypothecated to road safety. That would be much more transparent
compared with it going to the consolidated fund and not knowing whether
or not we get that
money.</p><p><a name="06110160000092"></a>A
few months ago, in some press articles, the Government hinted that they
were interested in operating a scheme that we had been suggesting. I
believe that it is not too late for the Government to bring forward
their own amendment and include it in this Bill. I hope that they will
give some serious thought to it. I am sure that we would work with them
to tidy up the amendment to make it appropriate. This is an important
transparency issue. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06110160000093"></a>Moved, as an amendment to the Motion that

Bradshaw:</b> My Lords, I support what the noble
Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has said in contra-distinction to what the
Minister said. Being a member of the Thames Valley Police Authority and
Oxfordshire County Council, I am well aware of the new funding
arrangements. The amount of new money which is available to county
councils for road safety schemes from the new scheme to which the
Minister referred is very little. There are many schemes in the county
which would save lives but for which no funding is available. Contrary
to what the Minister said, I believe that although motorists are not
happy about being fined when caught by speed cameras, they will be much
more content knowing that the revenue accruing to a local or national
authority will, as the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, be spent on
improving road safety. There is a multitude of schemes but insufficient
money. That is why I support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06110160000095"></a><b><a name="61101-0011.htm_spnew145"></a><a name="06110160000492"></a>Baroness
Gardner of Parkes:</b> My Lords, I support the
amendment. I particularly want to emphasise my noble friend&#146;s
point about transparency. I do not agree with the Minister that people
are under a &#147;widespread misapprehension&#148; about how they
are being clipped by the so-called safety cameras. As he will know,
Marlow Hill in Wycombe is one case on which I often comment, and the
<I>Bucks Free Press</I> has attempted to get the facts of the case. I
think that transparency is necessary. The reply received from the
authority that receives the money is that, under the Freedom of
Information Act, it does not have to give any details or information
about the case because it is exempt. Why should the revenue from such
cameras be exempted? Why should there not be transparency so that
people know the figures?</p>



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_324"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 324</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110160000096"></a>I then tabled a Question in your
Lordships' House but the reply was, &#147;Sorry, we cannot tell you;
only the local people will be able to tell you&#148;. If the first
group is hiding behind the protection of an exemption from the Freedom
of Information Act and the Government are saying that they have no
information, what will be the position when, next March, we change over
to the system being suggested? Are we to have no idea how much money is
being raised, where it is going or how it is being spent? I strongly
support my noble friend's amendment because of the transparency it will
bring.</p><p><a name="06110171000001"></a><b><a name="61101-0011.htm_spnew146"></a><a name="06110171000794"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to
noble Lords who have spoken in support of the amendment, defective
though it is, as I have explained. Although we have a difference of
perspective, on one thing we are agreed: cameras are about improving
road safety and they have that effect. All motorists feel at times that
they have been caught somewhat unawares by a camera&#151;that is
often the complaint but not often justified by the evidence&#151;and
will express a concern that they have been prosecuted or fined.
Nevertheless, they recognise that they are likely to be more careful in
future. Road behaviour changes in those circumstances.</p><p><a name="06110171000002"></a>In case it is thought that while
representing the Government at the Dispatch Box I might be guilty of
undue bias with regard to the efficacy of cameras and other
constraints, let me say that the country where the greatest
transformation has taken place in the past few years has been France.
Anyone who motored in France in the not-too-distant past will be aware
that for the French speed limits existed as some form of entertainment
to see by how much they could be exceeded. But that is no longer the
case. Now there is the most rigorous observation by the French of
motoring restrictions in villages&#151;and a consequent improvement
in their accident rate&#151;because it is known that prosecution is
pursued with a great deal of vigour.</p><p><a name="06110171000003"></a>I am sure the noble Lord agrees with me
that cameras play an important part in road safety. The question is:
would people be even more satisfied with the activity of cameras if
they could see where the resources went? That is also the burden of the
noble Baroness&#146;s view: she would like to know where the
resources go. We do not normally extend to any other infringement of
our law the general proposition, &#147;Well, you&#146;ll be a lot
happier with the fine imposed on you if you know where the money is
going&#148;. We think that the fine and the punishment are related to
the offence, rather than to any desirable development afterwards to
which the resources are put. The noble Lord is introducing into
legislation an interesting concept, but I cannot subscribe to
it.</p><p><a name="06110171000004"></a>I have enjoyed contributions
which, let me say, I heard at Third Reading, on Report and in
Committee&#151;some of them I heard at Second Reading. We are now
dealing with Commons amendments, when the debate is still as protracted
and the amendment still as wrong and as
defective.</p><p><a name="06110171000005"></a><b><a name="61101-0011.htm_spnew147"></a><a name="06110171000795"></a>Lord
Hanningfield:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank noble Lords
who have taken part in the debate and I thank the Minister for
replying. I was hopeful that we would

indications in newspaper speculation that the Government would do what
I am suggesting. We all agree with the Minister that speed cameras have
improved road safety and reduced speeding, but they are not the most
loved things&#151;shall we put it that way? Often lives can be saved
by a small amount of money spent on a crossing. I know that because I
have to live with it all the time as leader of Essex County Council.
If, instead of putting that small amount of money in a local transport
plan and waiting two years for it to be agreed, we had a certain amount
that the public could see was hypothecated from speed cameras and put
into local road safety measures, it would suddenly transform the area
and save lives. I repeat that there are a dozen in Essex that I could
name straightaway. It would be a popular measure and would help the
public&#146;s acceptance and the whole road safety process.</p><p><a name="06110171000006"></a>I cannot accept the Minister&#146;s
reply. I had hoped that the Government would think again and I hope
that even after today we can agree that this money can be seen to be
spent locally rather than going into the Consolidated Fund when people
have to bid for it. I therefore wish to test the opinion of the
House.</p><h5><a name="06110171000147"></a>7.24

about the penalties imposed on drivers from the Irish Republic who

Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I beg to move that
the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 5. In
speaking to this amendment, I shall also indicate why I think the House
should reject the noble Lord&#146;s Amendments Nos. 5A, 5B and
5C.</p><p><a name="06110171000020"></a>I understand the noble
Lord's wish to raise the profile of the retro-reflective tape issue and
to see the fitting of reflective tape to all heavy vehicles at
the earliest opportunity. However, I remind the House that use of the
tape is already permitted and that many vehicles are already fitted
with it. The tape is helpful in the hours of darkness and in conditions
of poor visibility. But UK trucks are already equipped with various
conspicuity aids, such as side marker lights and rear reflective number
plates, so we are not convinced that the tape's road safety effects
will be as 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_329"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 329</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>great in the UK as they might be in other countries where lorries have
less conspicuous aids, apart from the tape.</p><p><a name="06110171000021"></a>I recognise the noble Lord&#146;s
sincerity in wishing to bring about sooner rather than later
what appears to be a sound road safety measure. But, as I have tried to
explain before, if we were to regulate to require fitment of the tape
in advance of changes to international requirements, we would be at
risk of infraction proceedings from
Brussels.</p><p><a name="06110171000022"></a>In addition, I must
point out that Clause 16 is deeply flawed in that, unlike the existing
powers that it reflects, it does not have any teeth. In theory,
therefore, the Secretary of State might make regulations requiring the
fitment of retro-reflective tape to trucks and trailers but, if owners
and operators failed to comply, they would face no penalties. It would
be far better to rely on the powers that we already have. They are
tried and tested, they include provision for enforcement and penalties,
and we have undertaken to use them as soon as international law
permits.</p><p><a name="06110171000023"></a>It
might help if I clarified the position on this subject further. Powers
to make regulations about retro-reflective tape already exist, and
regulations allow its use. Tape E-marked to UNECE Regulation 104
specification is acceptable throughout the UNECE, of which the European
Union is a member, and many vehicles are already fitted with it. A
UNECE amendment to mandate fitment of the tape for trucks seeking
Regulation 48 certification is in hand and is expected to come into
effect in 2009 or 2010.</p><p><a name="06110171000024"></a>I know
that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, finds that unacceptable, and
that the delay is there. The noble Lord will also recognise the
advantages of having regulations which extend to vehicles which
traverse the whole of Europe. There are great benefits in getting
agreement on standard requirements for all trucks. Although I recognise
the noble Lord&#146;s impatience, he ought therefore to acknowledge
the Government&#146;s intention to move as quickly as we can.
Nevertheless, we need this regulation.</p><p><a name="06110171000025"></a>In addition, the UK must accept vehicles
approved to the European Commission directive on lighting installation.
At this time, retro-reflective tape is optional under the directive.
There are plans to amend it to refer directly to UNECE Regulation 48
which is due to be amended to mandate fitment of tape. Until that time,
I am afraid that the UK would be open to infraction proceedings if we
introduced national requirements that were more stringent than the
current optional fitment.</p><p><a name="06110171000026"></a>Once
Regulation 48 and the directive on lighting installation are amended to
mandate retro-reflective tape, the UK will be able to mandate fitment
on all new trucks, including UK vehicles not approved to Regulation 48.
I remind the noble Lord that we have already committed to do this as
soon as we
can.</p><p><a name="06110171000027"></a>However,
European whole vehicle type approval for trucks and trailers is
currently being developed and is well underway. This is a massive and
important undertaking. The noble Lords, Lord Hanningfield and Lord
Bradshaw, have been vocal about the necessity for Europe-wide
regulations. It will harmonise the

cars and motorcycles, and thus create a single market where vehicles
which have been type-approved in one member state will automatically be
accepted in all other member states.</p><p><a name="06110171000028"></a>Trucks will include, among many other
requirements and vehicle types, mandatory compliance with the directive
on lighting installation and therefore fitment of retro-reflective tape
for new N2 and N3 vehicles and O3 and O4 trailers. It is expected to
come into force on 1 January 2010. Even if we ignored possible
infraction procedures and set out to make specific early regulations to
mandate the tape, not only does the process take considerable time but
it would also, I suspect, wastefully duplicate existing ECWVTA
work.</p><p><a name="06110171000029"></a>We are also required to
notify the European Commission of new or altered technical regulations;
failure to do so renders that regulation unenforceable. The
notification process itself takes time, and I am convinced that such
regulations&#151;even if they were not thrown out as a result of the
notification procedure&#151;would be likely to come into effect so
close to the expected coming into force of the international
requirements I have just described that our regulations would have
little impact. In any case, such regulations would apply only to UK
registered vehicles and would have no effect on the foreign vehicles on
our roads, whereas a European directive would be
all-embracing.</p><p><a name="06110171000030"></a>In 2005,
Loughborough University carried out a study on retro-reflective tape.
The final report noted
that,</p><ul><a name="06110171000140"></a>&#147;the effect of
the addition of retro reflective tape markings may not result in
similar [accident] reduction rates [in the UK] as those observed in
America&#148;,</ul><a name="06110171000121"></a>in
different circumstances. It also pointed out that calculating
cost/benefit ratios was difficult because limited data were available,
and that the data used may, for various reasons, have resulted in an
over-estimate of the reduction in the number of accidents which could
be attributed to the
tape.<p><a name="06110171000031"></a>Nevertheless, that is a
marginal argument. I have sought to convey to the noble Lord that we
are as one with him on the advisability of the tape and the benefits it
will bring. Under our regulations, we cannot avoid possible infraction
proceedings or act much in advance of the date that Europe is setting
as a target for the delivery of the requirements we need, which will
govern all vehicles on British roads. That is why I hope that the noble
Lord will accept the Government&#146;s case and, having moved his
amendment, will consider withdrawing it after the usual useful
debate.</p><p><a name="06110171000032"></a>Moved, That the House

noble Baroness said: My Lords, I listened with great interest to the
Minister&#146;s reply. It is interesting how many different things
can be said about, for example, the Loughborough report. The Department
of Transport&#146;s 2005 road casualty statistics, published on 28
September, show that despite a 1 per cent drop in the number of
fatalities from road accidents, deaths from accidents involving heavy
goods vehicles increased by 8 per cent to 485 in 2005, even though
there are proportionally fewer goods vehicles on the roads.</p><p><a name="06110171000035"></a>These figures represent
15 per cent of all road deaths, and clearly demonstrate that new
measures are required as soon as possible to reduce this
disproportionate number. Research by the Darmstadt University of
Technology&#151;the Minister did not produce that report&#151;has
found that adding retro-reflective contour markings reduced accidents
involving trucks and passenger cars under poor visibility conditions by
95 per cent. The Loughborough University report, published in May 2005,
to which the Minister referred, also concluded
that,</p><ul><a name="06110171000141"></a>&#147;there is a cost
benefit for fitting retro-reflective line markings to newly registered
vehicles greater than 7.5
tonnes&#148;.</ul><a name="06110171000122"></a>A
subsequent consultation by the Department for Transport also indicated
that there was overwhelming public support for introducing this
measure. However, the Department for Transport&#146;s own research
shows that this would be an effective means of saving lives and would
prevent 385 collisions involving heavy goods vehicles each year. As we
have heard from the Minister tonight, the Government continue to oppose
its immediate introduction.
<p><a name="06110171000036"></a>The Minister has cited the European
position, but I direct him to an earlier discussion in the House of
Commons when the Transport Minister was Stephen Ladyman. He stated that
if the Government were to introduce this measure it would certainly be
breaking EU law and action would be taken against us, which I think is
what the Minister was referring to as &#147;infraction
proceedings&#148;.</p><p><a name="06110171000037"></a>The European Commission disputes this,
and has now confirmed that this measure is likely&#151;as the
Minister said&#151;to become mandatory across the European Union from
2010. But it has stated that member states are free,</p><ul><a name="06110171000142"></a>&#147;to lay down national
requirements concerning the use of retro-reflective
markings&#148;,</ul><a name="06110171000123"></a>in the
mean time, so we would do nothing to offend EU law if we introduced
them as from now. That is the point of the amendment
today.<p><a name="06110171000038"></a>During the same debate,
Dr Ladyman claimed that the European Commission had &#147;started the
preliminary stages&#148; of infraction proceedings against Italy as a
result of its decision to introduce this measure in 2003. The Minister
even stated that there were objections to Italy&#146;s
decision,</p><ul><a name="06110171000143"></a>&#147;not only
from Great Britain, but from France and
Germany&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 9/10/06; col.

stating that there are no grounds to take action against Italy and that
it has,<ul><a name="06110171000144"></a>&#147;not
received to date any complaints concerning the Italian
legislation&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06110171000039"></a>The
Government also stated that the UN Economic Commission for Europe
regulations do not allow contracting parties to make the ECE104
mandatory before 2010. However, Italy, like the UK, is a contracting
party to the regulations but has suffered no action as a consequence of
introducing the measure. Indeed, the United Nations ECE secretariat has
also confirmed that it,</p><ul><a name="06110171000145"></a>&#147;has not been informed about
complaints on the Italian national legislation&#148;.</ul><a name="06110171000125"></a>If you introduce it, it does not seem
to infringe or impinge against any European
directive.<p><a name="06110171000040"></a>The final argument
that the Government raised against introducing this measure is that it
would damage the competitiveness of the UK haulage industry. Not only
would this amendment reduce the number of accidents involving heavy
goods vehicles, enabling more heavy goods vehicles to remain on the
road and reducing the cost of repairs, it would require only newly
registered HGVs to fit retro-reflective markings at present. The
Loughborough report again estimated this would cost about &#163;100
or 0.001 per cent of the total cost of a new vehicle. Surely that is a
very small price to pay for saving
lives.</p><p><a name="06110171000041"></a>The amendment has
received cross-party support in both Houses. It is now clear that there
is nothing to stop the Government taking action. In the light of this,
I hope that the Government will support the immediate introduction of
this life-saving measure and allow this amendment to stand.</p><p><a name="06110171000042"></a>There is some disagreement about the
interpretation of what the EU said and what it believes would happen,
but it seems to us that there is nothing, except the
Government&#146;s intransigence, to stop the fitting of these
reflectors on new vehicles as from today or as quickly as the
regulations can be produced. We all know that some regulations can
arrive quicker than others. The time for action is now. If the
Government wait until this measure is introduced across the EU, more
than 1,100 collisions involving heavy goods vehicles could occur, and
they could involve serious injuries and fatalities which this amendment
would prevent.</p><p><a name="06110171000043"></a>Moved, as an

Monson:</b> My Lords, the Minister pointed out that
the amendment was defective in that it did not include a provision for
any penalty in Clause 16. However, if this House were to pass the
amendment of the noble Baroness and send the amended clause back to the
other place, could it not rectify that before sending it back again to
this
House?</p><p><a name="06110171000047"></a><b><a name="61101-0012.htm_spnew156"></a><a name="06110171000804"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, again I am grateful
to noble Lords and in particular for how the noble Baroness presented
her case. Italy did not get off scot free. A letter was sent to Italy
indicating that its law was outwith the EU requirements. It might be
thought that if all that will happen is a rap across the knuckles, the
British Government should be prepared to take the same
action.</p><p><a name="06110171000048"></a>However, should a second
infraction of that kind occur&#151;particularly if we were the nation
that did it, with our reputation for scrupulous commitment to European
regulations&#151;it is less likely that it would be regarded as
acceptable. After all, the European Union would otherwise be faced with
a growing accretion of each country tackling this bit by bit and not
producing the European-wide perspective which it seeks to achieve. If
we carried out what is required by this amendment, we do not think that
we would be able to complete this process much before the European
position became rationalised.</p><p><a name="06110171000049"></a>In passing, let me reassure my noble
friend that of course when I said &#147;all vehicles&#148;, I meant
it in the sense of all vehicles in every part of Europe. I was not
indicating every size of vehicle. We are clearly talking about
trucks.</p><p><a name="06110171000050"></a>I find it a little
strange that the Official Opposition are so cavalier about costs. The
noble Baroness seemed to indicate that the costs were
marginal&#151;&#163;100 per vehicle. She then costed that
as a minute percentage of the total costs of the vehicle. Vehicles have
to be off the road while the tape is being fitted. That cost must be
taken into account. If it is suggested that it is just &#163;100 for
that alone, it is a somewhat extraordinary
valuation.</p><p><a name="06110171000051"></a><b><a name="61101-0012.htm_spnew157"></a><a name="06110171000805"></a>Earl

the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 6.</p><p><a name="06110171000062"></a>The House will recall that we discussed
this issue at considerable length when we first considered the Bill. An
amendment was made to Clause 20 to the effect that, where the offence
was tried summarily by either a magistrates&#146; court or a sheriff
court, the court could not impose a custodial sentence. The maximum
penalty of five years for conviction on indictment was unaffected. That
amendment was reversed in Committee in the other
place.</p><p><a name="06110171000063"></a><b><a name="61101-0013.htm_spnew163"></a><a name="06110171000811"></a>Lord
Lyell of Markyate:</b> My Lords, I looked this up to
see what happened. I do not know whether the Minister saw what
happened, but the Chairman at the time simply asked whether Amendments
Nos. 5 to 8 were not moved, and someone replied, &#147;Not
moved&#148;. That was plainly not in accordance with the whole tenor
of the debate, and I am very grateful to the Government for coming back
on the substantive
issues.</p><p><a name="06110171000064"></a><b><a name="61101-0013.htm_spnew164"></a><a name="06110171000812"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, we are coming back on
the substantive issues, but we are where we are. I described to the
House the effect of the amendment that was passed and the change to the
Bill that the other place then considered. The noble and learned Lord
disagreed with the Government on the issue of principle, and I am sure
that he is likely to express that disagreement in some form this
evening. The Government stand by the principle behind this part of the
Bill. We had a manifesto commitment
to,</p><ul><a name="06110171000146"></a>&#147;introduce much
tougher penalties for those who cause death by careless
driving&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06110171000065"></a>The effect
of the noble Lords&#146; amendment would be that the penalty
available on summary conviction where a death has occurred would be no
higher than the penalty available for simple careless driving. That is
not an acceptable position, so far as the Government are
concerned.</p><p><a name="06110171000066"></a>Public anxiety about
careless driving that results in death is very well documented. We made
it clear at the last general election that we thought that there was
sufficient public disquiet for us to put to the nation our intention to
toughen the penalties. The amendment would take that away. We maintain
that there is great public anxiety about the amount of careless driving
that results in death. Although I shall argue about certain aspects of
the amendment in detail, the issue between us is one of principle, and
I will not gain a great deal by articulating that principle at great
length this evening. I did not achieve a great deal last time, although
I spoke at great length. Nor, might I add, did all those who
contributed at length last time persuade the Government to adopt a
different position. What the Government are 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_337"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 337</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>expressing at this stage, and what I am stating from the Dispatch Box,
is that the amendment strikes at the heart of a principle on which we
have based this legislation and which we feel justified in
pursuing.</p><h5><a name="06110171000151"></a>8.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06110171000067"></a>Certain aspects of the noble
Lords&#146; amendment should cause the House disquiet. The
discontinuity between the maximum sentence available summarily and on
indictment could have unfortunate effects. One possible consequence of
the amendment is that any case that magistrates thought might warrant a
custodial sentence, however short, would be sent to the Crown Court for
trial. Trying more cases in the Crown Court would add to the expense
and would run contrary to views expressed during the consultation
exercise, principally by the legal profession, that the
magistrates&#146; courts should continue to be able to deal with most
of these cases. Indeed, this is what prompted us to make this offence
triable either way.</p><p><a name="06110171000068"></a>In
addition, under changes made to magistrates&#146; powers under the
Criminal Justice Act 2003, which have not been implemented yet but
shortly will be, if a magistrates&#146; court decided to accept
jurisdiction in a contested case but found, on trying it, that a
custodial sentence was justified after all, it would, under the
amendment, cease to be able to commit that case to the Crown Court for
sentence where it considered its sentencing powers to be insufficient.
We would therefore be presented with a real and obvious difficulty. I
appreciate noble Lords&#146; concerns&#151;how can I fail to after
the articulate way in which those concerns were expressed when we last
discussed these matters in this House?&#151;about the ability to
impose a custodial penalty for this offence and the factors that would
warrant such a sentence.</p><p><a name="06110171000069"></a>That is
why, as a result of the very informed debate and the cogently argued
case that was put, for which I pay tribute to the House, we have asked
the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which is charged with publishing
definitive sentencing guidelines for all criminal offences in England
and Wales, to consider this issue very carefully. It will also review
the existing guidelines for the offences of causing death by dangerous
driving and causing death by careless driving when under the influence
of drink or drugs. This will ensure that the courts are aware of how
these offences work together and what factors to consider when
sentencing.</p><p><a name="06110171000070"></a>It is crucial that
sufficient sentencing options are available to the courts&#151;I
emphasise that sentencing options are what are being provided. That is
why I hope that the House will agree to government Amendment No. 6,
which restores the drafting of Clause 20 to its previous state. It is
strongly supported by the Magistrates&#146; Association, which wrote
to the Home Office, following the acceptance of the noble Lords&#146;
amendment, to express its view that that decision should be reversed.
That, of course, is what the Government are seeking to do today. It is
also supported by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport
Safety.</p>



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_338"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 338</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110171000071"></a>To conclude, not only has this issue been
the subject of considerable interest and debate at a general election
that gave the Government a clear mandate to act in this area, but we
have very substantial support from interest groups concerned with these
issues. There are real attendant disadvantages to Amendment No. 6A,
which the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, will shortly move.</p><p><a name="06110171000072"></a>Moved, That the House do agree with the
Commons in their Amendment No. 6.&#151;(<I>Lord Davies of
Oldham.</I>)</p><p><a name="06110171000073"></a><b><a name="61101-0013.htm_spnew165"></a><a name="06110171000813"></a>Lord
Hanningfield:</b> My Lords, I beg to move Amendment
No. 6A, as an amendment to the Motion that the House do agree with the
Commons in their Amendment No. 6, leave out &#147;agree&#148; and
insert &#147;disagree&#148;.</p><p><a name="06110171000074"></a>We return to probably the most
contentious clause in the Bill. I will keep my comments mercifully
short because we know the arguments quite well and other noble Lords
wish to participate in this debate.</p><p><a name="06110171000075"></a>Of course we all offer
our deepest sympathy to families who have lost a loved one, but I
passionately believe that we have a duty to frame a law that is
workable and will deliver justice. Under the clause, a prison sentence
can be imposed for something that was purely an accident and simple
carelessness. Jail is not a suitable punishment for an act of
carelessness. The provision will result in the criminalisation of many
ordinary members of society. Of vital importance is the absence of
criminal intent which is necessary in the conviction of other crimes
that carry similar custodial sentences. Careless driving is very
different from dangerous driving and from carelessness resulting from
taking drink and drugs, even though the effects of those offences may
be similar.</p><p><a name="06110171000076"></a>Under the current
wording, a person would be guilty of careless driving if their driving
fell below what would be expected of a careful and competent driver.
That is markedly different from the test of culpability for dangerous
driving. To be convicted of dangerous driving, a driver must have been
driving in a way that, to a competent and careful driver, would be
obviously dangerous&#151;in other words, doing something that they
know they should not be doing. There is no such requirement for the new
offence of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving. Instead,
a person may commit the offence not only without intent but without
even realising the nature of such carelessness.</p><p><a name="06110171000077"></a>We are not arguing for this new offence
to be struck from the Bill; we are trying to ensure that the punishment
fits the crime. Importantly, the punishment should reflect the standard
of driving, not the consequences. We therefore cannot and will not
support this excessive punishment proposed by the Government. A
custodial sentence is a completely disproportionate punishment for such
an offence. This amendment therefore seeks to remove the custodial
element from the Bill. Furthermore, it should be left to the courts not
the Government to decide the severity of the punishment and the actual
offence committed.</p>

Attlee:</b> My Lords, I remind the House of my
interest as president of the Heavy Transport Association; I am also
close to other trade associations. I believe that transport Ministers
of all Governments, including this one, have made the right decisions
over the years and that is why we enjoy one of the best road safety
records in Europe. But the Government have gone wrong on this
one.</p><p><a name="06110171000080"></a>The Minister talked about
support from interest groups, but he will recognise that, because
nearly all the key personnel in these interest groups have suffered
personally from road traffic accidents, they are not exactly neutral.
The whole of Clause 20 is highly undesirable; it will have unintended
consequences, which I described in detail when the Bill passed through
your Lordships&#146; House and we considered this government
amendment. But we need to remember that the provision was not in the
Bill when it started in the House of Commons before the general
election; it was not even included when it came to your
Lordships&#146; House after the election, despite the manifesto
commitment and the fact that it was relatively easy to draft.</p><p><a name="06110171000081"></a>The Commons amendment
provides for prison sentences, even at the magistrates&#146; court;
this would be on top of automatic disqualification. The problem is
that, because some of the penalties&#151;a fine, disqualification and
prison&#151;are mandatory rather than optional, so that the court
would have to disqualify the driver, for example, the defendant would
be encouraged to plead not guilty and opt for trial at the Crown Court.
Worse still, if the driving error was very minor, the jury might well
acquit, if only because they know that disqualification is automatic
but inappropriate because the error was so minor.</p><p><a name="06110171000082"></a>Finally, when a motorist who is normally
very careful, competent and a perfectly decent member of society loses
his licence for a momentary lapse&#151;no matter how tragic the
consequences&#151;confidence in the system of motoring justice will
crumble and we will run the risk of seeing lower levels of compliance
in general. The Government have failed to explore other means of
meeting the needs of the bereaved and perhaps of making it easier to
secure conviction for dangerous driving.</p><p><a name="06110171000083"></a>Realistically, the Minister has Clause 20
in his pocket because it is already in the Bill&#151;we cannot stop
that. He may eventually succeed with his amendment, but I believe that
in the long term he will regret insisting on the Commons amendment. I
hope that my noble friend takes it to a Division; I will support him in
the Division Lobby.</p><p><a name="06110171000084"></a><b><a name="06110171000815"></a>The
Earl of Mar and Kellie:</b> My Lords, I continue to
be unnerved by the issue of intent and therefore must continue to

<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_340"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 340</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>opposition to this Bill and the help that they have given me in meeting
Ministers, Home Office officials and the families of those whose
genuine bereavement and upset is driving this clause.</p><p><a name="06110171000086"></a>This clause will do two things. It is
wrong in principle and is likely to do serious injustice. A third point
is that it is likely to confound expectations&#151;people will be
disappointed at the extent of its effect, because it will be terribly
unjust. To put unjust measures on the statute book is a deep mistake
which devalues the effect of justice for those who have been rightly
sent to prison for dangerous driving. They will simply say,
&#147;It&#146;s a
lottery&#148;.</p><p><a name="06110171000087"></a>Why
is it wrong in principle? Nowhere in this country, except in the most
arcane areas, do we send people to prison for ordinary negligence. I
was astonished to read the Secretary of State say in the other place,
as the basis of his argument, that taking a life is taking a life, no
matter how it is done&#151;in other words, the fact that, tragically,
careless driving leads to a death means that there ought to be a prison
sentence available. We do not take that view. Will that view apply to
industry, where employees are sometimes tragically killed because of a
breach of the Factories Act? Will it be taken in construction, or
education when people take children on trips? Will it be taken in
medicine or in transport generally? It is contrary to principle in this
country to send people to prison unless you reach the broad standard of
gross negligence. Ordinary negligence&#151;ordinary
carelessness&#151;sad though it is and tragic though it can be, is
something for which we do not send people to prison, and we are
entirely right.</p><h5><a name="06110171000152"></a>8.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06110171000088"></a>Secondly, there is likely to
be serious injustice because the clause blurs the at present very clear
distinction between dangerous driving and careless driving. Dangerous
driving is driving that falls far below the standards to be expected of
a competent and careful driver in circumstances where it would be
obvious to a reasonable driver that what they were doing was dangerous.
In other words, it has an element of intention or recklessness. If that
is the case, it would be perfectly right and proper that a prison
sentence should be available and sometimes imposed&#151;and, indeed,
that sometimes a very severe prison sentence should be
imposed.</p><p><a name="06110171000089"></a>I am in no way soft on
this issue. I commend the Government&#146;s actions in relation to
speeding, which are doing a lot of good. When I was Attorney-General,
I&#151;like my predecessor&#151;brought a number of cases before
the Court of Appeal and sentences in practice were greatly increased. A
lot of right and proper things have been going on and are being
maintained by this Government. But this is a very serious mistake. How
will defendants know how to behave? They will find themselves accused
of dangerous driving, but they will be equally likely to be sent to
prison if found guilty of careless driving. How will they know what the
ingredient of dangerous driving is and where the line comes between
that and careless driving? How will they know which aspect the
prosecution is saying is the real nub of the matter?</p>



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_341"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 341</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06110171000090"></a>At present and very properly, the Crown
Prosecution Service has to decide whether there is sufficient credible
evidence to give rise to a realistic prospect of conviction for
dangerous driving or careless driving before bringing such a case. When
the case is presented, the essential ingredients are stated to the
court, the defendant knows what he has to meet, and justice can be
done. This will blur that situation. The defendant will not know until
the sentence is given where the nub of the matter lies. As my noble
friends have said&#151;I strongly support what they have said from
their practical experience&#151;this will have unintended
consequences. There is a serious danger that more people will be
unwilling to plead guilty. There is also a danger that juries, thinking
that this is an unfair law, will acquit in circumstances where someone
might even have pleaded guilty if they had not felt it necessary to air
the whole matter.</p><p><a name="06110171000091"></a>It saddens me
tremendously to see the Government going down a route that will lead to
serious injustice. The hour is late and I have put the essential
points. I very much hope that the Government will not sit on what was a
purely technical oversight in this House and cling to their five years
in the Crown Court simply because an amendment was not moved. I had not
understood that that was remotely the Minister&#146;s intention. I
thought that we were at least being allowed to debate the matter so
that it could be handled properly one way or the other. It would be a
great mistake to introduce a prison sentence for careless driving when,
very sadly, a death has followed a case of carelessness. It does not
help a tragedy to compound it with an
injustice.</p><p><a name="06110171000092"></a><b><a name="61101-0013.htm_spnew168"></a><a name="06110171000817"></a>Lord
Monson:</b> My Lords, however well it may play with a
section of the tabloid press, the Government&#146;s plan to send
still more people to prison in a week when the British prison
population has reached an all-time high is surely the height of folly.
At this rate, we will need not only prison ships but also prison
railway carriages parked in disused sidings. The Minister said that if
the amendment is carried, the penalty would be no more severe than that
for simple careless driving. But the Minister is wrong, as the noble
Earl, Lord Attlee, pointed out, because there would be automatic
disqualification for at least a year. Simple careless driving hardly
ever results in disqualification, which is quite a severe penalty, and
rightly so.</p><p><a name="06110171000093"></a>It is true that
because of a truly ghastly procedural blunder after the Lords&#146;
amendment to Clause 20 was carried in the summer&#151;whose fault it
was I do not know&#151;the power of Crown Courts to impose a prison
sentence for this offence was not removed as had always been intended.
Despite what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, said, I do not
suppose that it is possible in this Session to do anything about that.
But at least a quarter of a loaf is better than
none.</p><p><a name="06110171000094"></a><b><a name="61101-0013.htm_spnew169"></a><a name="06110171000818"></a>Viscount
Simon:</b> My Lords, I think that the noble Earl,
Lord Attlee, said that certain pressure groups have an axe to grind. I
do not have an axe to grind, but noble Lords will recall that among
various things that I do I am heavily involved with the traffic police.

looking at it is that if this goes through as the Government want, the
right message will be sent out and people will take more care with
their driving and will not do the careless things that they do
now.</p><p><a name="06110171000096"></a><b><a name="61101-0013.htm_spnew170"></a><a name="06110171000819"></a>Lord
Berkeley:</b> My Lords, I have listened carefully to
some of the speakers on the Opposition Benches. I take from this that
the definition of &#147;careless&#148; is that it is just a
momentary lapse; that it does not really matter; that we are all
careless at some stages in our lives; and that if our carelessness
happens at the wrong moment and someone gets hurt or killed, it is very
sad. And that is it: we certainly do not want to go to jail, which
would be unheard of for a middle-class crime. I worry about this. If a
person is driving a car or vehicle, it should not be any different from
driving a train or flying an aeroplane. People are trained, although
some training is more than others. In any event, a person is in charge
of lethal equipment which could hurt not only you and your passengers,
but other people. Whether that is careless or just bad luck, as some
people might say, I do not know. I do not accept that just because a
person had a momentary lapse, it does not matter, which is the
impression that I am getting&#151;perhaps
wrongly.</p><p><a name="06110171000097"></a>The noble Earl, Lord
Attlee, said that we have the best road safety record in Europe, which
may be true, but we are still killing 3,500 people every year and
heaven knows how many hundreds of thousands of people are being
seriously injured. I do not accept that the Magistrates&#146;
Association or PACTS, of which I am a member, have given opinions based
on their personal sufferings. I know that other groups might do that,
but those two organisations should be listened to because they are
objective. I believe that if they have thought about it carefully and
think the Government&#146;s view is right, we should support
them.</p><p><a name="06110171000098"></a>I support this provision,
as I have all along. We should support anything which makes drivers
think carefully, so that they have to concentrate the whole time they
are at the wheel, looking for things that might possibly go wrong just
around the corner or checking for people crossing the road or
whatever&#151;just as train and aeroplane drivers have to. We must
get away from the amateur view that anyone can drive however they like.
I certainly support the Government&#146;s position on
this.</p><p><a name="06110171000099"></a><b><a name="61101-0013.htm_spnew171"></a><a name="06110171000820"></a>Earl

inspector was with him in the cab. The driver did not take the call,
but switched off his phone. He still got the sack, which proves the
point. I shall not go on about mobile phones, but whether we think it
right or not, that case proves that a very high standard of driving is
expected on trains. If you do not perform to the standard, you get the
sack.</p><p><a name="06110171000101"></a><b><a name="61101-0014.htm_spnew173"></a><a name="06110171000822"></a>Baroness

everything said by my noble friend Lord Berkeley and I shall not repeat
it. I have also listened carefully to other noble Lords. One Monday
evening at twenty to nine I had a father. At a quarter to nine I did
not have a father because he had been killed in a road accident. It may
have been a little lapse on the part of the driver, but it was a great
thing in a person&#146;s life. I shall be supporting the
Government.</p><p><a name="06110171000102"></a><b><a name="61101-0014.htm_spnew174"></a><a name="06110171000823"></a>Baroness
Gardner of Parkes:</b> My Lords, I am slightly
puzzled about how the decision is made on which charge will be brought
against a driver. If, for example, as in cases that we read about all
the time, a driver backing out of his garage tragically kills his own
much-loved child who somehow has got behind the car, would that person
be charged with careless driving? It certainly should not be dangerous
driving because there would have been no intention, but would a charge
of careless driving be brought in a case like that where the last thing
in the world the driver wanted to do was to harm someone they loved? If
not, are we talking about someone whose mind is distracted for a
moment? I am confused about the issue of carelessness and I would
appreciate some
clarification.</p><p><a name="06110171000103"></a><b><a name="61101-0014.htm_spnew175"></a><a name="06110171000824"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, as anticipated, this
has been an interesting debate and it would be difficult for me to
reply without undue length to every single point. On the question put
by the noble Baroness, the circumstances she has identified would
invite a series of other potential charges beyond careless driving. My
noble friend Lady Gibson has made a very important contribution to the
debate. It is of the greatest significance when a death is caused by
people not taking sufficient care when in their motor cars. Further, my
noble friend Lord Berkeley is absolutely right. I mentioned in my
opening speech the interest groups that support the legislation. The
Magistrates&#146; Association and the Parliamentary Advisory Council
for Transport Safety are not motivated by emotion beyond the proper
human emotion we all have when considering these matters, but their
members have not been personally affected by these issues. They seek to
influence and improve the law. I am happy to give way to the noble
Earl, Lord
Attlee.</p><p><a name="06110171000104"></a><b><a name="61101-0014.htm_spnew176"></a><a name="06110171000825"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> My Lords, the Minister puts great weight
on the decision reached by PACTS, which does an awful lot of good work.
But how was the decision arrived at? Was it a decision reached by a
vote of all the PACTS members? I attend meetings of the council, but I
have never voted on this issue. Perhaps it was a small group of PACTS
executives which made the decision.</p>

Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, it is not for me to
go into the decision-making processes of groups such as PACTS, but let
me say that it enjoys a high reputation because its members support
what it does and the Government take seriously representations from
that source. I sought to disabuse noble Lords of the notion that this
is all based on emotion; the issues have been established on other
grounds.</p><p><a name="06110171000106"></a>In moving the amendment
the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said that the punishment should fit
the crime. Let me make one point absolutely clear: there is nothing
about mandatory penalties in the Bill. The clause certainly proposes
maximum penalties, but it would be for the courts to decide which is
appropriate. It might be that a community penalty or fine is imposed.
In cases where those are not considered appropriate, a custodial
sentence may be passed. The courts will decide.</p><p><a name="06110171000107"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell,
must accept that the Government have addressed themselves to the Bill
which had been passed by this House. They take at face value, as they
are bound to, what the law would be if the Bill was enacted and they
had not effected any changes to what it contained when it was returned
to them.</p><p><a name="06110171000108"></a>I have listened to what
the noble and learned Lord said with the greatest care and I take his
views very seriously, but let me make it absolutely clear that the
amendment&#151;and noble Lords should consider this
seriously&#151;would restrict the ability of magistrates&#146;
courts to impose a custodial sentence but the Crown Court would still
be able to impose a maximum sentence of five years. That is why I
indicated that one of the difficulties which would occur if the
amendment was carried would be that magistrates&#146;
courts&#151;although it is expected and hoped that they will deal
with large numbers of these cases&#151;the moment they had the
slightest inkling that a serious penalty might be appropriate, would be
more likely to pass cases on to the Crown Courts because they would not
be able to deliver it. That is what the amendment would do it if were
passed and those who vote for it&#151;with all the best intentions in
the world&#151;would be creating what we regard as a serious weakness
in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06110171000109"></a><b><a name="61101-0014.htm_spnew178"></a><a name="06110171000827"></a>Lord
Lyell of Markyate:</b> My Lords, I am extremely
grateful to the Minister. If the House were persuaded by the arguments
that a prison sentence was inappropriate for careless driving, is it
within its procedural power on the ping pong to come back with a clause
which would reflect that? I believe it
is.</p><p><a name="06110171000110"></a><b><a name="61101-0014.htm_spnew179"></a><a name="06110171000828"></a>Lord

about what might be done at future
stages.</p><p><a name="06110171000111"></a>If noble Lords went into
the Lobby on the basis that there is a broad intention to which they
subscribe but aware that the amendment will produce a nonsense which at
some other stage ought to be tidied up, that would be acting in an
irresponsible way. If we did that we would be continually living in a
land of

with legislation. This House prides itself on the fact&#151;and
rightly so&#151;that it is concerned with the detail and revision of
legislation which comes from the other place. It should not be
suggested, particularly at this late stage, that the legislation may
not be quite right but some other opportunity should be taken to amend
it. We are not talking about the Committee stage of a Bill but the
considered view of the other place as to what should happen to it. An
amendment has been tabled which, in my view, is clearly
faulty.</p><p><a name="06110171000112"></a><b><a name="61101-0014.htm_spnew180"></a><a name="06110171000829"></a>Lord
Lyell of Markyate:</b> My Lords, is the Minister
really saying that if the Government believe an injustice is likely to
be done he does not have to give his mind to it? I can quite understand
if he gives his mind to it and says, &#147;No, we believe this is
right&#148;, but to take advantage of what was obviously a slip and
to do something which this House may well decide&#151;I hope it does
decide&#151;would lead to an unjust result would seem to me to be
wrong. Does the Minister
agree?</p><p><a name="06110171000113"></a><b><a name="61101-0014.htm_spnew181"></a><a name="06110171000830"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I indicated at the
beginning that I knew the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, and I
would collide over this Bill on a matter of principle&#151;and so we
have; we are quite explicit about that. I have tried to explain the
Government&#146;s position as accurately as I can and he has ably
explained his own.</p><p><a name="06110171000114"></a>It is also
my task to identify the fact that if this House should vote for this
amendment it would have an indefensible and unacceptable consequence.
It may not be intended by the movers of the amendment, but that will be
the effect. That is one of the reasons why the amendment should be
rejected.</p><p><a name="06110171000115"></a><b><a name="61101-0014.htm_spnew182"></a><a name="06110171000831"></a>Lord
Hanningfield:</b> My Lords, as I expected, we have
had a long debate on the amendment. As I said at the beginning, it is a
very contentious issue and there are some very strong feelings about
it. I regret the last part of the discussion because we all know that
if the House agrees to my amendment today we will get another chance to
discuss it again. Unless the other place accepts the amendment, there
will probably be another chance to discuss it. We got a bit bogged down
on the technicalities of when we table amendments. Of course, we take
advice. We do not always have the advice that the Government have, but
if we have to discuss this matter again we can take further
advice.</p><p><a name="06110171000116"></a>The issue is not
resolved. No one in this House would disagree that people should
receive the sort of punishment that suits the crime. However, some of
us feel that this potential new legislation might sometimes stop that
happening and that courts would acquit people when they should be
convicting them, due to the fine dividing line between something that
should not have happened because of a person&#146;s action and
something that did happen. Parliament is not the place to make these
judgments. We have heard some rather emotional speeches in which people
have said that Parliament should be the place that decides

strongly that this legislation is not, as the Minister has said,
leaving the power with the courts; it is taking power away from courts
and giving it to Parliament, which it should not do. That is why there
are strong feelings about
it.</p><p><a name="06110171000117"></a>With that, I should like to

36(5) of the Bill. The combined effect of these two provisions is to
create an environment in which we can move away from the existing
arrangements for recovering the costs incurred by the Driving Standards
Agency (DSA) in the appointment, and subsequent quality assurance, of
delegated examiners. The DSA currently charges delegated examiners for
the supply of the test result certificates they issue for the driving
tests they conduct. These charges are intended to cover the costs the
DSA incurs in respect of delegated examiners. This is an
unsophisticated and blunt recovery mechanism as the agency&#146;s
costs are not directly related to the number of tests conducted by an

the principal amendments dealing with taxis and private hire vehicles,
sometimes known as minicabs. They introduce two new clauses. The
remaining amendments in this group are consequential to the two new
clauses. They both have the same objective&#151;to make travel safer
for people who use these modes of transport. Against the background of
the Bichard report and the legislation that we have brought forward in
that regard, we have looked carefully at whether we should use the
opportunity presented by the Road Safety Bill to deal with any urgent
safety concerns in taxi and PHV legislation. The result is these new
clauses to deal with two worrying aspects of the legislation that we
identified.</p><p><a name="06110172000029"></a>Amendment No. 11
addresses our concern about a taxi or PHV driver&#146;s right to
continue working while appealing against a decision to suspend or
revoke his licence, even if he is considered to present an immediate
threat to public safety. The clause provides local licensing
authorities in England and Wales, outside London, with a new power,
which will enable them to suspend or revoke a taxi or PHV
driver&#146;s licence with immediate effect on safety grounds. This
power has already been available to the licensing authority in
London&#151;Transport for London&#151;for a number of
years.</p>

automatic right to continue working pending appeal has been a source of
justified concern to many taxi and PHV licensing authorities. They want
to use their licensing powers to ensure that passengers are safe using
local taxi and PHV services. They play a tremendously important role in
protecting residents and visitors who make use of taxis and PHVs in
their areas. The amendment will equip them to do so even more
thoroughly in circumstances, for example, where a driver has committed
a serious offence or is suffering from a medical condition that makes
it unsafe for them to continue
working.</p><p><a name="06110172000031"></a>Amendment No. 12
addresses our concern about what is commonly known as the
&#147;contract exemption&#148;; the provision that exempts drivers,
vehicles and operators outside London from licensing if the vehicles
are hired only under contracts lasting seven days or more. During the
earlier passage of the Bill, concerns were raised about what is now
Clause 47. The House will be aware that this clause tightens the
definition of a private hire vehicle in London and will bring vehicles
dedicated to contract work within the London PHV licensing regime. One
of the points made in the earlier discussion was that the clause would
be inconsistent with the retention of the contract exemption outside
London. Ministers promised to consider this matter. Having done so, the
conclusion that we came to is that public safety, and indeed
consistency, requires that we ensure that contract private hire work is
licensed both in London and elsewhere. That is why we have brought
forward the new clause in Amendment No.
12.</p><p><a name="06110172000032"></a>There are no compelling
reasons why private hire services provided under long-term contracts
should be outside the arrangements for ensuring public safety that are
considered to be essential for other private hire work. The need to
ensure public safety remains the same regardless of whether the hiring
is a one-off or part of a long-term contract. For a passenger possibly
at risk, the method of hiring is scarcely relevant; what is important
is that there is no doubt that all the necessary checks and procedures
have been comprehensively and effectively carried out. There are good
grounds for removing the contract exemption to ensure a level playing
field in the industry; unlicensed contractors have a commercial
advantage over their licensed counterparts, which cannot be
justified.</p><p><a name="06110172000033"></a>Both these new
clauses are strongly supported by those who have responsibility for
taxi and PHV licensing, and they have been welcomed by many in the
industry. I commend them to the House as being necessary to safeguard
the public, and I urge the House to agree to these
amendments.</p><p><a name="06110172000010"></a>Moved, That the

Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I beg to move that
the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 13 to 15.
In doing so, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, not to move his
Amendments Nos. 16A and 17A, but I shall of course seek to reply to any
points that he makes.</p><p><a name="06110172000015"></a>We think
that we have now produced a position with regard to the safety of level
crossings that should commend itself to the House. The first new clause
seeks to improve the safety of level crossings by making clear that a
level crossing order can impose obligations on traffic authorities as
well as on the level crossing operator and so better provide for road
traffic measures to control the behaviour of motorists. The other new
clause is a technical amendment which provides for the making of level
crossing orders to be delegated to the rail safety regulator rather
than be made directly by the Secretary of State, and prospectively
validates orders made by the Health and Safety Executive on his behalf.
Amendments Nos. 23, 24 and 32 are consequential on those two new
clauses. The remaining amendments remove clauses which the Government
do not think are necessary and which were not supported in the other
place.</p><p><a name="06110172000016"></a>When the Bill was
introduced into this House, much concern was expressed about safety at
level crossings. Now that other safety concerns have been tackled,
level crossings represent the greatest risk to safety on the railway.
In the main, however, the risk arises not from the actions of rail
users but from those of pedestrians and motorists who misuse crossings
in a reckless way. A number of amendments were tabled by noble Lords to
tackle the problem. The Government position was that those amendments
were either defectively drafted or that we were not convinced of the
need for further primary legislation.
</p><p><a name="06110172000017"></a>We did, however, undertake to
think about the issue and I am pleased to report to the House that in
the other place an amendment was introduced which seeks to tackle the
problem of misbehaving motorists by clarifying that a level crossing
order may put

operator. The amendment was introduced after agreement with Network
Rail on the
wording.</p><p><a name="06110172000018"></a>Level
crossing orders set out the protective measures to be provided at a
level crossing. &#147;Protective measures&#148; means the types of
signs, barriers, lights and so on needed to ensure the crossing is safe
both for road and rail users. The general process has been that, after
consultation with the local authority, the level crossing operator
applies to the Secretary of State for an order setting out the
necessary measures. The proposals are considered by Her
Majesty&#146;s Railway Inspectorate and the order made by the
inspectorate on behalf of the Secretary of State.</p><p><a name="06110172000019"></a>The protective measures
have traditionally been rail measures but the amendment makes clear
that road traffic measures can also be considered. This means that
there will need to be discussions between local traffic authorities and
the crossing operator, usually Network Rail, on a package of measures.
These could include rumble strips to slow traffic on its approach to
the crossing, additional signage, cameras and central barriers to stop
motorists from attempting to zig-zag around half-barriers. Network Rail
has agreed to fund these measures, so there will be no additional call
on the resources of local
authorities.</p><p><a name="06110172000020"></a>The Government have
looked at the other amendments introduced into this House but are not
persuaded of the case for special offences in respect of breaching red
lights at railway crossings and bridge strikes. Regarding red lights,
there are many instances where a violation can have catastrophic
consequences for motorists and pedestrians just as much as where
collisions occur on railway crossings. As the roads Minister made clear
in the other place, where the violation is blatant and dangerous, the
driving can and should be prosecuted as such with a significantly
higher penalty, including custody, than that which applies to breach of
a red light. If there is real evidence of a problem the Government
would be prepared to consider using subordinate powers under Clauses 3
and 4 of the Bill, subject to the agreement of Parliament, to set a
higher fixed penalty and higher penalty points tariff for breaches of
red lights where they occur at railway
crossings.</p><p><a name="06110172000021"></a>Bridge strikes
greatly interest several noble Lords. I believe the current offence of
careless and inconsiderate driving, with a maximum fine, subject to
parliamentary approval for Clause 22 of this Bill, of &#163;5,000, is
sufficient. In extreme cases, where danger is caused to other road
users, it may be appropriate to prosecute for dangerous driving with
the possible attendant
penalties.</p><p><a name="06110172000022"></a>The possibility of a
custodial penalty is a significant elevation of the gravity with which
society views an act of irresponsible driving. It is a very tricky path
when we start to designate very specific actions in their own right as
being as serious as those for which custodial penalties presently
exist. I have heard it argued for when people use mobile phone when
driving, for example. But how do we balance all these different
circumstances? My response is to say that it should remain a matter for
those who charge and 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_355"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 355</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those who sentence. Sentencing guidelines indicate that use of a mobile
phone might be considered an aggravating factor when sentencing for
dangerous driving. I think it would be appropriate for the Sentencing
Advisory Panel to take a look at the level crossing and bridge strike
situations. The Government are willing to make that request and I hope
the noble Lord will recognise that that is the basis on which
constructive action can be taken, which is the burden of his
amendments.</p><p><a name="06110172000023"></a>The other new
clause is not concerned with the content of level crossing orders but
is a technical amendment about who has the power to make level crossing
orders. With the transfer of the HMRI from the Health &amp; Safety
Executive to the Office of Rail Regulation earlier this year, we had
intended that the rail inspectorate would continue to make level
crossing orders. But doubt was cast on whether the wording of the
Railways Act 2005 would allow this. In turn, doubt was cast on whether
the delegation to the Health &amp; Safety Executive in 1990 was
sufficiently robust. The Railways Act 2005 and the Health &amp; Safety
at Work etc Act 1974 (under which the 1990 delegation was made) permit
the delegation of administrative functions but not legislative
functions. We have concluded that the making of level crossing orders
is a legislative function.</p><p><a name="06110172000024"></a>We
are, therefore, seeking to put beyond doubt that the making of level
crossing orders can be delegated and to make clear that orders made by
the rail inspectorate inspectors when they were in HSE are valid. If
approved, the amendment would confirm the legal position as that which
absolutely everyone thought it always was, and which has worked well in
terms of level crossing safety.</p><p><a name="06110172000025"></a>Moved, That the House do agree with the

Many causes of train accidents have been eliminated, but this one has
not, and it is getting worse. There were 229 near misses last year, 16
collisions at level crossings and 120,000 minutes of delay were caused.
At bridges there was even more delay: 340,000 minutes. There were 2,000
incidents which cost &#163;10 million to deal with and the figure is
going up.</p><p><a name="06110172000028"></a>The only point
between me and the Minister in examining this matter is the level of
penalties that are applicable to people who breach level crossings. He
has said that people who bash into bridges should be charged with
dangerous driving if it can be shown that they have driven without
regard to the size of their lorry into a bridge which is clearly
marked. Can

In that case the penalties would be worth inflicting because they would
have some
effect.</p><p><a name="06110176000001"></a>As
regards level crossings, I am sure that the Minister has seen the films
that I and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, have seen. The behaviour
of some motorists&#151;it is a small minority&#151;is criminally
insane at level crossings. There is a strong case for giving serious
thought to lifting the penalties under, I believe, the Road Traffic Act
1991. They are level 3, which means that a maximum fine of
&#163;1,000 can be imposed for such acts, unless they are elevated to
dangerous driving. I am well aware that in that case other penalties
would accrue. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say before
deciding what we should
do.</p><p><a name="06110176000002"></a><b><a name="61101-0015.htm_spnew189"></a><a name="06110176000177"></a>Lord
Hanningfield:</b> My Lords, I support everything the
noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, has said. Perhaps the Minister could further
clarify the matter. In previous debates we have spoken of accidents,
and we need to ensure that in the legislation we have properly tackled
the recklessness at level crossings. I would like to hear the Minister
comment further on
that.</p><p><a name="06110176000003"></a><b><a name="61101-0015.htm_spnew190"></a><a name="06110176000178"></a>Lord
Berkeley:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank my noble friend
for the Commons amendments on level crossings. We have had long
discussions about them and I think that they are really good. I am
pleased about the way in which Network Rail has accepted them and I am
sure that it will be a good step
forward.</p><p><a name="06110176000004"></a>I worry still about
these penalties&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said, there
have been 2,000 incidents of bridge-bashing. People think that you just
get delayed in your train for half an hour until the engineer comes,
looks at it and says it is all right. However, let us take the scenario
of a lorry hitting a steel-deck bridge and moving it six inches
sideways towards the track just before a high-speed train goes over it.
We are talking about hundreds of potential deaths&#151;especially if
a train is going in the other direction. It may not happen
often&#151;I hope it never happens&#151;but there is a need for a
deterrent.</p><p><a name="06110176000005"></a>We are not talking
about careful driving here; we are talking about intent. Not to check
the height of your lorry or to wriggle through half barriers to save a
few minutes is done with intent and sometimes it will go wrong. In
these circumstances, custodial sentences should certainly be possible.
The deterrent does not exist at present, as the evidence of the number
of incidents given by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, surely shows. I
hope that my noble friend can put my mind at rest and agree that the
deterrent must dramatically increase before we have a serious
accident.</p><p><a name="06110176000006"></a><b><a name="61101-0015.htm_spnew191"></a><a name="06110176000179"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley,
talked about bridge-bashing by lorries. It is a serious problem. In my
opinion, it is inevitable that we will have the kind of accident he
describes. It is only a matter of time. The penalties might not be
sufficient, but I am disappointed that we have dropped Clause
52&#151;and I am told that here I might be slightly out of order.
That clause provided for physical barriers to

all the penalties you like, but eventually someone will foul up and hit
the bridge hard just at the wrong moment. We cannot return to that
issue, but I am disappointed that we do not have legislation providing
for physical barriers to stop a driver inadvertently hitting the
bridge.</p><p><a name="06110176000007"></a><b><a name="61101-0015.htm_spnew192"></a><a name="06110176000180"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am doomed to
disappoint noble Lords this evening, even when, it is fair to say, the
Government are being at their most constructive. We have had extensive
debates on level-crossing safety and bridge strikes. I indicated to
noble Lords the significant progress we made on this, not least with
regard to cost factors, the relationship with local authorities and the
way in which the roads will be treated to protect level crossings. Now
the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, as is his wont, is seeking to push me
one stage further. He is asking whether I will prescribe the nature of
the offence and the attendant sentencing that should apply. I cannot do
that. I cannot go any further than I have. I said that we regard these
as serious issues. I indicated that the use of a mobile phone when
driving can be a serious issue at times: it can lead to a charge of
dangerous driving. I said that we will look to the Sentencing Advisory
Panel to consider the appropriate sentences where strike situations
involving level crossings and bridges occur.</p><p><a name="06110176000008"></a>I cannot go further than that this
evening. I recognise the commitment of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw,
to road and railway safety, which he holds very much to his heart. He
has contributed significantly to the Bill in that area. I hope that he
will understand that I cannot go as far as he would like in that regard
this evening, and that he will appreciate that it is for the police and
the Crown Prosecution Service to determine the charge. The maximum
penalty for careless driving is &#163;5,000, but for dangerous
driving it could be a custodial sentence of a maximum of two years.
That range, which we leave to the courts, is not insignificant. I hope
that the noble Lord will feel that he does not need to press me any
further this evening.</p><p><a name="06110176000009"></a>On

agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 1. I shall also speak to
the other amendments in this group, which all relate to the
establishment of the Independent Barring Board and the funding of the
scheme.</p><p><a name="0611023000032"></a>The main purpose of the
government amendments relating to funding is to place more detail and
precision in the Bill in the provisions for the fees and funding of the
Independent Barring Board. The Bill as published contained only a power
to prescribe the fee. The amendments place more detail in the
provisions. For example, they allow for differential fees in respect of
volunteers.</p><p><a name="0611023000033"></a>Amendments Nos. 92,
99 and 167 are designed to provide flexibility for the Secretary of
State in setting the vetting and barring scheme fee, and they give the
Secretary of State power to fund the IBB directly. Clause 21 currently
allows the Secretary of State to set and receive a fee from applicants
for monitoring. However, we want to set a fee that will enable the
scheme to break even during its first five years of operation.
Amendment No. 99 achieves
that.</p><p><a name="0611023000034"></a>Amendment No. 92 clarifies
the Secretary of State's power to waive the fee for those who undertake
regulated activity on a voluntary basis. Currently, volunteers receive
CRB checks free of charge and we undertake to continue that approach.
Amendment No. 167 puts in place a mechanism for funding the IBB. The
monitoring fee will be payable to the Secretary of State, not direct to
the IBB. The IBB will be a free-standing statutory body, so we need to
provide a power for the Secretary of State to pass funding to it.
Amendments Nos. 168 and 169 ensure that arrangements for presenting IBB
accounts to Parliament are in line with current
practice.</p><p><a name="0611023000035"></a>Finally, Amendments
Nos. 1 and 171 create a new schedule setting out provisions to ensure
that staff and property may be transferred from the Secretary of State
to the IBB, enabling the organisation to benefit from the experience
and skills of staff already engaged in similar
activity.</p><p><a name="0611023000036"></a>Moved, That the House

Walmsley:</b> My Lords, before commenting
specifically on the first group of amendments, I should like to make a
couple of general comments. Although, on the whole, we welcome the fact
that the 250 new amendments coming to us from another place improve the
Bill and make the Government's intentions clearer, I must express our
concern about the lack of time to prepare for today's debate. Both
opposition party teams are the same teams who handled the Education and
Inspections Bill, which completed its stages in your Lordships' House
only at midnight on Monday. We then had about 16 hours to lay
amendments, during some of which time we were having a well earned
sleep. That is why neither opposition party has had the opportunity to
lay any amendments, although we welcome the three government amendments
that accept the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee.</p><p><a name="0611023000038"></a>Speaking
personally, it has taken me a day and a half to read all the relevant
material. Unfortunately, I reached my conclusions about what needed
further questioning too late to lay any amendments on which to hang the
debate. I trust, therefore, that the Minister will forgive me for
raising those concerns in a more general way when we discuss each
group. However, I must ask why we needed so many very late amendments.
Was the Bill so very badly drafted? Could the need for all these
amendments be the result of the Government's failure to follow up the
Bichard inquiry sufficiently urgently, so that the Bill was drafted in
a great hurry in response to a public outcry about paedophiles working
in schools?</p><p><a name="0611023000039"></a>Members in this
House and in another place have had to raise a great many issues that
had not been adequately addressed in the original Bill. Fortunately,
the Government have listened in the nick of time, although that makes
it very difficult for opposition parties to scrutinise properly what
they have done, and I cannot guarantee that we have not missed
anything. I hope that the usual channels and the Government&#146;s
business managers will consider what I have said very seriously. It is
more than just a whinge to say that we have had to work even harder
than usual in the past few days. This is a very serious
matter.</p><p><a name="0611023000040"></a>The Bill is a good
example of the need for enough time for proper parliamentary scrutiny
of legislation, as well as of the listening qualities of the Minister
in this House, who has been open to improving the legislation in
response to our concerns, for which I thank him. In many cases, proper
scrutiny had to wait until the Commons stages, but a lot of the
pressure started here in your Lordships&#146; House, where the Bill
began.</p><p><a name="0611023000041"></a>My only comment on this
group of amendments on the funding and the establishment of the IBB is
to welcome Amendment No. 92 in particular, which allows the IBB fee to
be waived for volunteers. Many noble Lords talked about this when the
Bill was in this House, as we know that numerous charities were anxious
about being able to afford their liabilities under the
Bill.</p>

Buscombe:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to a couple of
amendments. Amendment No. 99 is a hugely significant amendment that was
added to the Bill at the 11th hour in another place. Despite consistent
questioning on funding proposals for the scheme both in this House and
in another place, this substantial change was introduced only at the
last minute, with almost no time to produce a compromise. Indeed, the
short title of the Bill, which we scrutinised more than six months ago,
contained the
words:</p><ul><a name="0611023000209"></a>&#147;Nothing in this
Act shall impose any charge on the people or on public funds, or vary
the amount or incidence of or otherwise alter any such charge in any
manner&#148;.</ul><a name="0611023000141"></a>Yet Amendments
Nos. 99, 167 and other consequential amendments provide for exactly
that. <p><a name="0611023000043"></a>In the debate on ways
and means in another place, my honourable friend Tim Loughton detailed
the inflation-busting rise of &#163;2 in CRB checks. I also ask noble
Lords to consider the Government&#146;s record on spending on
computer systems within their proposed budget. My main concern is that
the amendment amounts to a tax on job applications by another
terminology. After all, the sums will all go into the Consolidated Fund
for the Chancellor to do with as he wishes. Parmjit Dhanda, the
Minister in another place, gave no exact figure for the cost that could
be incurred by fees. Nor did he say what those fees would be. All we
have to go on is that fees will be charged for costs that &#147;have
been incurred&#148; or which the Secretary of State &#147;thinks
will be incurred&#148;.</p><p><a name="0611023000044"></a>Her
Majesty&#146;s Official Opposition do not want to hinder the progress
of the Bill, which we have broadly supported, or to stop the good
intentions behind the underlying measure. However, we are concerned
that, so far, the Government have not answered our questions at all. I
hope that the Minister will show that the Government are taking the
funding of this scheme much more seriously than they have in another
place.</p><p><a name="0611023000045"></a>I shall briefly discuss
Amendment No. 171, which is on secondments. I believe that it is a
direct response to the amendments that I tabled at earlier stages of
the Bill, and I am grateful to the Minister for tabling it. The
original idea was to ensure that, by allowing secondment places for a
certain time, people of a high calibre would be running the IBB. As a
result of the amendment, there will be a greater incentive for people
in related fields to work for the IBB. Secondments will enable
individuals to gain an understanding of the criminal barring and
checking scheme, and to enhance practice in their original
professions.</p><p><a name="0611023000046"></a><b><a name="61101-0017.htm_spnew202"></a><a name="0611023000229"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, I appreciate that the time to
consider these amendments has been constrained. We are in the usual
period at the very end of the Session when there is great pressure on
time, and I can only express my regret to the noble Baroness, Lady
Walmsley, that we did not have longer to consider the amendments. I,
too, was up until midnight on Monday, and then had to get on top of a
completely separate Bill. I entirely sympathise with the points 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_368"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 368</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that she made. If it is any consolation, there has at least been an
equality of misery across the Chamber in this
respect.</p><p><a name="0611023000047"></a>Part
of the reason why we have so many amendments is to consider the points
that were raised in this House, which we have sought conscientiously to
respond to. They were on difficult issues such as the definition of
pornography, the amount of work the barred individual should be able to
engage in and the vexed issue of the definition of
&#147;frequently&#148;, which occupied us for a good deal of time.
We have sought to respond to a whole set of issues in amendments, many
of which are detailed and technical.</p><p><a name="0611023000048"></a>I believe that the Bill that has come back
to us is much better as a result. I note that Mrs Maria Miller,
speaking for the Opposition at the last stage of the passage of the
Bill through another place on 23 October, commended the
Government,</p><ul><a name="0611023000210"></a>&#147;for the way
in which they have listened to the arguments, and for their willingness
to amend the Bill and thus&#151;we hope&#151;improve
it&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 23/10/06; col.

is improved by this process.
<p><a name="0611023000049"></a>I am glad that the noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, welcomed Amendment No. 99 and the support that
it gives to volunteers. I am sorry that I am not in a position to say
more to the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, on costs but I can state
again that we expect annual operating costs to be in the range
of &#163;16 million to &#163;18 million a year over the
first five years of the scheme, starting in 2008-09. We are continuing
to refine our estimates as we develop the operating model for the
scheme. The budget for setting up the scheme is &#163;16.6 million
over the three financial years 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08. This
figure for annual operating costs is additional to the costs of the
existing CRB disclosure and related processes, which amount to about
&#163;78 million per annum.</p><p><a name="0611023000050"></a>Putting those two figures in perspective,
we accept that additional costs will arise from the scheme, but the
great bulk are those already incurred in managing the existing CRB
disclosure and related processes, which cost nearly &#163;80 million
a year, as I said. Because we have not entirely refined the cost model,
we are not in a position to give the revised figure for the CRB checks.
We expect it to be higher than the current &#163;31 for a standard
disclosure and &#163;36 for an enhanced disclosure, on the basis of
the figures that we have given to Parliament. We believe that the costs
will continue to be reasonable and that the great bulk of the costs
involved in the scheme are those already incurred in managing the
existing CRB scheme.</p><p><a name="0611023000051"></a>On

steps to ensure that any risks are appropriately managed.</p><p><a name="0611023000054"></a>Amendments Nos. 8, 142, 206 and 254 ensure
that it is an offence for a barred person to foster or provide care and
accommodation to children. Any organisation that arranges a placement
will be required to check and ensure that the carer is subject to
monitoring and is not barred. The amendments also ensure that a foster
carer is able to take day-to-day decisions concerning their foster
child, as would a parent, without being required to check every
individual who helps to care for that child.</p><p><a name="0611023000055"></a>Amendments Nos. 18, 205 and 208 bring
provisions for childminders in Wales into line with those already in
the Bill for childminders in England. The effect is that registered
childminders and childminders who would be required to register but for
the fact that they do not care for children under the age of eight will
commit an offence if they mind children when barred or are not subject
to monitoring.</p><p><a name="0611023000056"></a>Amendment No. 214
adds deputies to the definition of regulated activity in relation to
children in Schedule 3. Amendments Nos. 217 and 233 ensure that, where
an activity is carried out by a member of a group of children or
vulnerable adults on behalf of, or under the direction of, a person
engaging in regulated activity within the group, the group member will
not be engaged in regulated activity. This would ensure, for example,
that a school sports team captain will not be engaging in regulated
activity.</p><p><a name="0611023000057"></a>Amendments Nos. 210
and 220 ensure that those people driving vehicles used only for the
purpose of transporting children or vulnerable adults will in
prescribed circumstances be engaged in regulated activity. Amendments
Nos. 215 and 234 ensure that an individual on either barred list will
be prevented from working for the IBB. Following discussion with the
industry, we have amended the Bill to ensure that while chat room
moderators will be subject to the scheme, IT staff who do not see the
content of the messages or contact service users will not.</p><p><a name="0611023000058"></a>In respect of vulnerable adults,
Amendments Nos. 226 to 234 ensure that regulated activity includes
local councillors with social services responsibilities, trustees of
vulnerable adults&#146; charities, the Older People&#146;s
Commissioner for Wales and all Commission for Social Care Inspection
inspectors. Amendment No. 146 narrows the circumstances in which a
pregnant woman or a nursing mother is considered vulnerable to those in
receipt of social care services, as was our original
intention.</p><p><a name="0611023000059"></a>We have also made
important amendments to the exemptions for employers from the
requirements to check contained in Clause 14. Amendments in this group
fulfil the commitment we gave to your Lordships that complementary
therapy and all prison and probation officers will be subject to the
requirements of the scheme and that other aspects of the clause,
including housing, leisure, educational, and recreational activities,
would be subject to a sunset clause, so that the exemption for such
employers would be time-limited.</p>

services and education records, will now be covered by the definition
of controlled activity. As we committed to do in this House, we have
also brought the provision of direct payments into the definition of
controlled activity, which meets our intention to cover all social care
staff. Since these amendments concern matters raised by noble Lords, I
believe that they will commend themselves to the House.</p><p><a name="0611023000061"></a>Moved, That the House do agree with the

Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I should like to press the
Minister on private fostering, which is covered by a number of
amendments. We welcome the government amendments relating to monitoring
and private fostering arrangements. However, while the Bill now gives
parents the option to carry out a monitoring check prior to placement,
private fostering arrangements are regulated under the Children Act and
a set of regulations pertains specifically to this situation. These
regulations place requirements on parents and local authorities, the
latter of which are charged with visiting and monitoring the welfare of
children placed in such arrangements. That being the case, there would
seem to be a serious gap if social services did not ensure, as part of
their monitoring arrangements, that an enhanced criminal record check
was carried out in respect of the carers in the placement. Children who
are privately fostered may be especially vulnerable to abuse and I
strongly suggest that a change is also made to the Children Act
regulations to require this check to be carried out by local
authorities once a private fostering arrangement has been notified to
them or comes to their attention in another way. This will ensure
commonality of practice between private fostering and other regulated
activities under the Children Act. Indeed, none of this can be done if
the private fostering arrangement has not been notified to the
authorities, which, of course, is voluntary for the time being. That
still concerns us because it may be an offence for someone who is
barred to foster a child privately, but the problem is identifying and
catching them. We cannot do that if we do not even make them liable to
notify the authorities.</p><p><a name="0611023000063"></a>I should
like also to say something about overseas workers and those coming into
the UK to do weekend locum work. There is a problem in Northern Ireland
with workers who work in regulated positions there, but live outside
our jurisdiction in the Republic of Ireland. The issue of overseas
workers was a feature of our debates in your Lordships&#146; House.
On the one hand, we do not wish to penalise those who come to work in
the UK, but, on the other hand, we need to be aware of the limitations
to vetting and barring arrangements in their host country. This issue
alone demonstrates that vetting is but one safeguard and it is
important that this message is conveyed in particular to parents who
rely on the new monitoring scheme. In terms of overseas workers, does
the Minister agree that in the online monitoring scheme, it might be
helpful to have a drop-down reminder for 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_371"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 371</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>parents and employers when the monitoring check status involves someone
who has been resident outside the UK? This could involve advising them
that monitoring has been possible only from the date of their entry
into the UK and encouraging the employer or parent to ensure that other
checks such as references are
pursued.</p><p><a name="0611023000064"></a>Secondly, given that
doctors and other health professionals are coming to the UK to do
short-term weekend locum work, how will it be possible to monitor when
someone works here but is not resident? I would be interested in the
Minister&#146;s views on these issues. However, I do welcome the
Government&#146;s response in this group of amendments to pressure
from this House not to exempt complementary and alternative health
services from the terms of the Bill, along with their decision to
include probation services and prison
officers.</p><p><a name="0611023000065"></a>Perhaps I may now ask
about Amendments Nos. 138 and 140 which bring those in Crown
employment within the requirements of the Bill. This includes the
National Assembly for Wales. Can the Minister tell us what
consultations have been held with the Assembly and whether he is
satisfied that there will be no unforeseen and undesirable consequences
of this measure? Before I leave this group, I want to ask the Minister
about the Government&#146;s thinking in relation to Amendment No.
146, which includes expectant mothers receiving community care services
in the definition of vulnerable adults. What is it about being pregnant
that makes a woman vulnerable? It seems to me that most pregnant women
enjoy robust good health and are quite capable of looking after
themselves, so I am a little curious about the Government&#146;s
thinking on this matter.</p><h5><a name="0611023000218"></a>10

Buscombe:</b> My Lords, regarding Amendment No. 62,
we are pleased that the Minister has brought back an amendment in
answer to our concerns at previous stages of the Bill. Like the noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, I am glad to see that alternative medicine has
been erased from Clause 14, and it is right that prison officers will
have to undergo checks. However, I remain concerned that no checks will
be made on other staff in young offender institutions who may have just
as close a proximity to young people as prison officers, and who would
certainly have frequent proximity under the new definition in the Bill.
Furthermore, I am very concerned that the sunset clause will not apply
to ending the exemption for other staff in young offender institutions.
I remind the Minister of the words of his noble friend Lady Royall of
Blaisdon at Third Reading in your Lordships&#146; House. She stated
that,</p><ul><a name="0611023000215"></a>&#147;those working in
young offender institutions who are currently checked by the Prison
Service&#151;that is, those working closely with prisoners in a
caring or supervisory role&#151;will also be
checked&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 7/6/06; col.
1345.]</ul><a name="0611023000143"></a>Yet I cannot see the
conclusive evidence in these amendments that this has been achieved. I
hope the Minister will be able to shed some light on how these
amendments will function.

Amendments Nos. 8, 142, 206 and 254, we support these measures to
ensure the safety of children in fostering and to allow foster carers
to take day-to-day decisions concerning their foster children without
being required to check every individual who helps to care for them.
Foster parents are therefore able to take decisions as any parent
would.</p><p><a name="0611023000068"></a>Amendment No. 145 gives
the Secretary of State the power effectively to define what constitutes
a family relationship. There are several problems with the amendment.
It provides:</p><ul><a name="0611023000211"></a>&#147;The
Secretary of State may by order provide that an activity ...
either is or is not</ul><ul><a name="0611023000212"></a>(a) carried
out in the course of a family relationship;</ul><ul><a name="0611023000213"></a>(b) carried out in the course of a
personal
relationship&#148;.</ul><a name="0611023000144"></a>To my
mind, the activities carried out within a relationship make up the
relationship itself, so this amendment provides an inroad into
legalising or criminalising components of a family
relationship. <p><a name="0611023000069"></a>There are
several other problems with the amendment, not least because it leaves
the order-making power to the Secretary of State alone, and subject
only to the negative procedure. It seems to conflict with Clause 43(1)
which states:</p><ul><a name="0611023000214"></a>&#147;This Act
does not apply to any activity which is carried out in the course of a
family
relationship&#148;.</ul><a name="0611023000145"></a>My
honourable friend the Member for Basingstoke, Maria Miller MP, asked
the Minister in another place a number of questions about the need to
have this amendment, and given that on the surface there seem to be so
many problems with it, I should be grateful if the Minister could
explain why it is so
necessary.<p><a name="0611023000070"></a>Amendment No. 146
ensures that pregnant women and nursing mothers are not classified as
vulnerable adults unless they are receiving community care services
particularly targeted at this group. I thank the Minister for taking on
board our suggestions. To classify them as vulnerable just because they
are pregnant, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has suggested,
reminds me of the unreconstructed thinking towards women that I thought
had been discarded after the advent of feminism. We think it is
sensible, though, to extend the protections of the Bill to women
receiving community care or health services as there are obvious
vulnerabilities in those
situations.</p><p><a name="0611023000071"></a>With regard to
Amendments Nos. 218 and 235, I hope the Minister can assure the House
that any orders to provide the changes will be brought before both
Houses for affirmative resolution. I am concerned that there is no
apparent affirmative procedure in the amendments as they stand.
Although I am sure the Minister will state that these amendments have
been brought into play in the interests of flexibility, I would be
grateful if he could give some examples of the kinds of situations in
which he expects them to apply. There is already a provision for barred
people to assist in emergencies and I find it hard to imagine such a
situation. The classification of barred activities has been much
debated during the course of the Bill, none more so than under Clause
14. I am sure the Minister will recall the objections we had to the
inclusion of prison officers in the list of
exemptions.</p>

Adonis:</b> My Lords, on the latter point, it was
precisely because of those objections that we have now included prison
officers and probation
officers.</p><p><a name="0611023000073"></a>In her remarks, the
noble Baroness asked a large number of questions. I may need to respond
to some of them in writing because they are technical in nature, but I
hope I can deal with some now.</p><p><a name="0611023000074"></a>On
the vexed issue, which we accept is difficult, of family relationships
and where they end and care beyond the family begins, we are clear in
respect of Amendment No. 145 that activities carried on in the course
of a family relationship or a personal relationship, where there is no
commercial consideration, are outside the scope of the Bill. As I have
said before, we do not want the Bill to intrude into private family
life. Amendment No. 145 gives the Secretary of State a power to
prescribe circumstances in which an activity may be said to be carried
out either within or outside the definition of a family relationship or
a personal relationship in Clause 43. We intend to use this to provide
that in certain, clearly specified situations activities involving
individuals that would normally be considered a private, family or
personal relationship as defined in Clause 43 will not be treated as
such.</p><p><a name="0611023000075"></a>This
ensures that we have some flexibility to respond to cases where
activity should be within the scope of the Bill, even where it is
carried out by a family member or a friend. Examples would include
those who act on behalf of those who lack capacity as a deputy, an
attorney or who are appointed by DWP to look after someone&#146;s
benefit or their pension. These kinds of activities are frequently
undertaken by those who are close to the child or vulnerable adult
concerned, but they are also activities of a public nature involving
the relative or friend concerned in duties that have legal consequences
and obligations. In these examples the activities concerned are not
entirely private, even when carried out by relatives or
friends.</p><p><a name="0611023000076"></a>We had many discussions
in our earlier debates about protecting those who lack capacity. I
believe noble Lords will agree that they do not want a barred person to
act in a capacity such as I have indicated above. We will use the
regulation-making power to ensure that family members or friends acting
as deputies, attorneys or who are appointed by DWP are within the scope
of the scheme.</p><p><a name="0611023000077"></a>As to the issue
the noble Baroness raised on pregnant women, it is precisely to meet
that point that the amendments limited coverage in relation to pregnant
women from the original wider definition. It is now limited to those,
as she said, in receipt of community care services. All other persons
receiving community care services are vulnerable adults and we believe
it would not be right to exclude expectant and nursing mothers from
this.</p><p><a name="0611023000078"></a>I
am informed that the officials of the National Assembly for Wales have
consented to Amendment No. 140, to which the noble Baroness, Lady
Walmsley, referred. The amendment removes immunity from prosecution for
the staff of the National Assembly, which means that a person will
commit an offence if he engages in regulated activity for the National
Assembly while not subject to 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_374"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 374</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>monitoring or while barred. A member of staff of the National Assembly
may be prosecuted for failing to make an appropriate check on a person
when that failure is a result of his act or reckless default. That
position is in line with that for Crown employees generally and will
help the National Assembly to ensure that the duties that the Bill
places on it are correctly carried out by its
staff.</p><p><a name="0611023000079"></a>The noble Baroness raised
the question of overseas staff. We expect schools to be vigilant in
carrying out checks in respect of overseas staff. Ofsted makes it clear
that local authorities check the suitability of staff from overseas and
take all available precautions to ensure that they are safe to work
with children. We advise that all checks are carried out and that
employers take extra care with other checks on overseas candidates, and
seek information about the person&#146;s criminal history from their
country of origin wherever possible. As I said when we debated this
issue before, the CRB provides advice to employers about countries from
which it is possible to obtain such information and how to obtain it in
a readily available and standardised format. We are amending
regulations to make CRB checks mandatory for all overseas staff,
including those who have never lived in the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="0611023000080"></a>On the
issue of communicating to private foster carers, as my honourable
friend Parmjit Dhanda said in another place, we recognise the need for
a widespread and ongoing communications campaign. In relation to the
requirement to check and be subject to monitoring, we recognise the
need to communicate to language schools and other organisations that
set up and have control over placements for children. In addition,
there are also requirements in the Children (Private Arrangements for
Fostering) Regulations 2005 to notify a local authority of a proposal
to foster a child privately. This applies to all private fostering
arrangements as defined in the Children Act. At the point of
notification, local authorities should tell the foster carers about the
circumstances in which the new monitoring and status provisions apply.
We will issue guidance in relation to this. Authorities are required to
promote awareness within their area of the need to notify private
fostering arrangements to the relevant local
authority.</p><p><a name="0611023000081"></a>In respect of
Amendments Nos. 218 and 235, I am told that the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee was satisfied that the order-making powers
in these amendments were subject to negative resolution procedure. I
hope that that deals with most of the points, but I shall deal with the
others in writing.</p><p><a name="0611023000082"></a>On Question,

Bill. In the first place, they seek to ensure that offences are clear
and apply to the right people. To that end, they clarify who is defined
as a regulated activity provider. Amendments Nos. 4 to 6 ensure that
responsibility for making checks before individuals engage in regulated
activity will now rest with the person or body ultimately responsible
for that activity. We have removed Clause 17, which provided for
offences to be committed by employees, and replaced it with a new
clause, inserted by Amendments Nos. 72 and 73, providing that those who
are acting or appear to be acting on behalf a regulated activity
provider or personnel supplier will commit an offence if they are at
fault. We recognise that while the regulated activity provider has
overall responsibility for making checks and employing appropriate
staff, the offence may be the fault of an employee or someone else
acting on behalf of the regulated activity provider, and they should
also be responsible in these situations.</p><p><a name="0611023000087"></a>For example, an employee of a sports
centre who fails to check on an individual being employed to teach
children&#146;s tennis lessons, because they did not know it was a
requirement to check, would not commit an offence. The owner of the
sports centre, or if it is a company the sports centre itself, would
have committed the offence. However, if the centre manager asked the
employee in question to carry out the check and they deliberately did
not do so, the individual would commit an offence under the
Bill.</p><p><a name="0611023000088"></a>We have also made
important amendments to the requirement to check. Clause 15, as it left
this House, provided an easement from the requirement to check where an
individual works in more than one NHS position at the same time; for
example, a permanent NHS employee who also undertakes temporary NHS
work on their day off. We now agree that relevant independent
healthcare providers providing NHS services under contract with the NHS
should also benefit from this provision, hence Amendments Nos.
65 to 67.</p><h5><a name="0611023000219"></a>10.15
pm</h5><p><a name="0611023000089"></a>The new clause inserted by
Amendment No. 60 gives the Secretary of State the power to place a
requirement on holders of certain positions to be subject to
monitoring, and to place requirements on an appropriate person to
check. We plan to consider with the Charity Commission whether it would
be appropriate to require checks, and in what circumstances. There
might, for example, be a requirement on the chair of the trustees, or a
person nominated by the trustees and checked by the Charity
Commission.</p><p><a name="0611023000090"></a>Amendments Nos. 43,
44, 45, 48, 59, 139 and 237 clarify how employers can comply with their
duty to check that an individual is subject to monitoring and therefore
not barred. Enhanced disclosures provide more information than an
online check, which can help employers assess whether an individual is
suitable for a particular position. Enhanced disclosures are currently
required in sectors involving very close contact with children, such as
schools and children&#146;s homes. These amendments provide the 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_376"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 376</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>power to require employers in certain sectors to obtain an enhanced
disclosure prior to a person beginning work, or to require the employer
to take steps to obtain a disclosure before work commences and at the
same time require an online check on an individual&#146;s status.
That will allow supervised employment to begin while waiting for an
enhanced disclosure.</p><p><a name="0611023000091"></a>The new
schedule inserted by Amendment No. 237 also explains what information a
regulated activity provider must obtain from a personnel supplier or a
contractor. For example, a girls&#146; dance school that hires a
teacher from an agency can rely on written confirmation that the agency
has no reason to believe that the individual is not subject to
monitoring, and has registered to be told if the individual ceases to
be monitored. However, if the employer was required to get an enhanced
disclosure through regulations under the Bill, they would be required
to obtain a copy of the enhanced disclosure from the
agency.</p><p><a name="0611023000092"></a>As the House is aware,
the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform met
yesterday to consider the amendments made to the Bill in the Commons.
Amendment No. 237A reflects the advice of the committee on the
appropriate parliamentary procedure for orders made under paragraph 14
of the new schedule inserted by Amendment No. 237. That paragraph gives
the Secretary of State the power to amend the new schedule to alter
what appropriate verification is. That power is needed to give the
scheme the operational flexibility it needs in the future. The
committee has advised that such a power to amend primary legislation
should be subject to the affirmative, rather than the negative,

implements the
recommendation.</p><p><a name="0611023000093"></a>Amendments in
this group also strengthen the provisions within the Bill in relation
to personnel suppliers, such as employment agencies and businesses.
Amendment No. 238 ensures that an employment business will commit an
offence if it supplies an individual to engage in regulated activity
where it has failed to ensure that the individual is subject to
monitoring. Amendments Nos. 26, 27, 35, 36 and 37 ensure that a
personnel supplier will commit an offence if it knowingly supplies an
individual who is barred, or not subject to monitoring, to engage in
regulated activity for any person, not just for a regulated activity
provider, even where the activity takes place only
occasionally.</p><p><a name="0611023000094"></a>With
regard to controlled activity, Amendments Nos. 90, 89 and 152 provide
the power to place a series of mandatory requirements on employers
through regulations. We will use these to require employers to make
checks and put in place the necessary safeguards when employing a
barred person.</p><p><a name="0611023000095"></a>Amendments Nos.
19, 38 and 50 ensure that an individual under the age of 16 who is
engaging in regulated activity is not required to be subject to
monitoring. In addition, those permitting or supplying the individual
to engage in regulated activity commit no offence by doing so and are
not required to check whether the individual is

weeks&#146; work experience at a primary school are not required to
go through the scheme and the school is not required to make a check in
such cases, which would be
ridiculous.</p><p><a name="0611023000096"></a>These amendments

Walmsley:</b> My Lords, this group of amendments
clarifies considerably many aspects of the offences that were raised in
your Lordships&#146; House. A pragmatic balance needs to be struck
between the need to get the checks done before somebody starts work and
implementing arrangements for supervised monitoring of the person who
has started work if the check has not come through. I rather suspect
that a number of employers and the IBB will have cause to be grateful
for that measure when they have to do a lot of checks very quickly when
the body is first set up. I hope that it does not all go horribly
wrong. However, the balance is probably about
right.</p><p><a name="0611023000099"></a>I have two questions which
have been suggested by the NSPCC. I shall be happy if the noble Lord
prefers to respond to them in writing. First, what is his understanding
of the role of regulators such as the Commission for Healthcare Audit
and Inspection in ensuring compliance with the Bill&#146;s
requirements through regulation and inspection? Secondly, how does he
intend to ensure compliance monitoring of regulated activity providers
in the community and voluntary sectors who come outside the remit of
statutory regulation? Does he agree that that issue should be built
into funding streams from government and statutory
bodies?</p><p><a name="0611023000100"></a><b><a name="61101-0018.htm_spnew210"></a><a name="0611023000237"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> My Lords, Amendments Nos. 19, 38 and 50
ensure that an individual under the age of 16 does not have to be
checked. We are very pleased that this measure has been included. I
remember mentioning to the Minister many months ago at an earlier stage
of debate that we did not want the Bill to encroach unwittingly on the
lives of innocent parties, and that we hoped the unintended
consequences would not be intrusive. These amendments will address that
problem. However, I hope that the Secretary of State will be vigilant
in preventing possible function creep of the Bill and that the Minister
can reassure noble Lords that orders taken extending the remit of the
Bill will be subject to the affirmative
procedure.</p><p><a name="0611023000101"></a><b><a name="61101-0018.htm_spnew211"></a><a name="0611023000238"></a>Lord

questions of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, concerning the
arrangements for monitoring compliance with the Bill&#146;s
requirements and how criminal offences will be prosecuted.
Inspectorates such as the Healthcare Commission and CSCI already have a
role in monitoring compliance with statutory requirements, including
ensuring that 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_378"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 378</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>services are operating safely and are not putting vulnerable groups at
risk of harm. Safeguarding has always been a priority for inspectorates
and we see no reason why this should not
continue.</p><p><a name="0611023000102"></a>The police and the CPS
will be responsible for investigating and prosecuting the criminal
offences created under the Bill. We should remember that those bodies
which come outside the remit of statutory regulation will be equally
liable for prosecution for a failure to comply with any of the
requirements created under the Bill. I do not want to commit to any
extra measures being taken until there is further evidence on how well
the scheme is working.</p><p><a name="0611023000103"></a>I confirm
to the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, that orders amending regulated
and controlled activity are subject to the affirmative

Adonis:</b> My Lords, I beg to move that the House do
agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 15 and 16. As noble
Lords will recall, there was no part of the Bill that was subject to
more difficulty than what has come to be known as the &#147;frequency
test&#148;.</p><p><a name="0611023000109"></a>For the
application of the bar, the concern previously put to us was that even
very brief or occasional contact with a barred person constitutes a
risk too far, not least because of the difficulty of defining
&#147;very brief&#148; or &#147;occasional&#148;. We listened
carefully to those views, and Amendments Nos. 16 and 31 reflect the
revised view, supported by all parties, that we should prevent a person
on a barred list from engaging in regulated activity and make it a
criminal offence for an employer to engage them even where the activity
is brief or occasional. We do recognise, however, that in an emergency
it may be necessary for a barred individual to engage in a specific
regulated activity and that to criminalise them for doing so would be
wrong. Amendments Nos. 15 and 30 create a defence where a barred
individual has to engage in regulated activity to prevent harm and
where there is no one else around that could engage in that specific
activity. That is intended to cover only a very limited range of
situations where, for example, a doctor barred from working with
children has to administer first aid to a child who has had an accident
in the street.</p><p><a name="0611023000110"></a>Amendments Nos.
203 and 224 are designed to ensure, for example, that a barred parent
would be able to enter a school to attend their child&#146;s
parents&#146; evening, or that an individual on the adults&#146;
barred list would be able to visit their sick mother in a care home.
However, a barred person who carried out an activity in a school, for
example, with the opportunity for contact with vulnerable groups, would
be 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_379"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 379</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prevented from doing so where the activity involved work, paid or
unpaid, in connection with the purposes of the school. While a barred
person will now be barred from regulated activity of any duration, the
requirements to check and to be subject to monitoring should still
apply only when the amount of contact is above a certain
threshold.</p><p><a name="0611023000111"></a>Amendments Nos. 200,
202, 219, 223 and 236 set out the circumstances in which the
requirements to check and to be subject to monitoring kick in. They
ensure that activities that take place overnight will be regulated
activity. They also define contact taking place on three or more days
in a 30-day period as regulated activity. These circumstances are
referred to in Amendment No. 236 as the &#147;period
condition&#148;. Similar revisions are made to the definition of
controlled activity by Amendments Nos. 74, 75 and 82. That means that
employers will be required to check, and individuals will need to be
subject to monitoring, if they are working in, for example, a
conference crèche for children that lasts for three days or
longer. Similarly, a volunteer helping out at a school campsite would
need to be subject to monitoring if they were looking after the
children overnight. It will be optional for employers to check
individuals engaged in regulated activity lasting for less time than
those circumstances specified in the period
condition.</p><p><a name="0611023000112"></a>Beyond those
situations, the requirements to check and to be subject to monitoring
will still apply when an activity is carried out
&#147;frequently&#148;. Frequently will take its normal meaning
and, as has been said previously in this House, guidance will set out
the Secretary of State&#146;s broad interpretation that the term will
cover activities that are carried out once a month or more often.
However, to provide a measure of protection for employers and
individuals who have followed this guidance, Amendments Nos. 22, 42 and
54 require the court to take into account the extent to which employers
and individuals have followed the Secretary of State&#146;s guidance
when imposing penalties for a failure to comply with the regulated
activity requirements. The amendments meet concerns raised in this
House about the definition of &#147;frequently&#148; and its
practical effects. I believe that they will be welcomed.</p><p><a name="0611023000113"></a>Moved, That this House do agree with the

to ensure that all individuals engaged in regulated activity are
&#147;subject to monitoring&#148;. That means that the individual
has applied to the scheme, that he or she is not barred and that the
Secretary of State is undertaking regular checks of key information
sources to identify new information about the individual, delivering
the continuous updating mechanism recommended by Sir Michael
Bichard.</p><p><a name="0611023000128"></a>We propose that the
online check should show whether an individual is subject to
monitoring, but not whether they are barred. As the Bill sets out,
those who are barred cannot be subject to monitoring, and employers in
regulated activity can only use people who are subject to monitoring.
Therefore, showing whether an individual is subject to monitoring
effectively ensures that employers do not recruit barred
individuals.</p><p><a name="0611023000129"></a>Amendments Nos. 104
and 105 move the provisions of how a check is made from Schedule 4 into
two new clauses, one of which provides for the mechanics of the check
and one for the information that is released. Amendment No. 104 also
delivers the commitment made on Report in this House to place a duty on
local councils to inform direct payment recipients about the vetting
and barring scheme. That was a matter of great concern to your
Lordships.</p><p><a name="0611023000130"></a>Amendments Nos. 103,
106 and 107 make similar changes to the notification system. They place
more detail about the system in the Bill and change the information
that is released. Employers who have registered an interest in an
individual will be told that he or she has ceased to be subject to
monitoring and so cannot be engaged in regulated
activity.</p><p><a name="0611023000131"></a>Amendments Nos. 125,
132 to 134, 131, 135, 136 and 137 provide for supervisory authorities
and professional regulatory bodies to receive more information,
including confirmation that the individual is barred. They also
consolidate the way in which supervisory authorities are defined. That
information is required by those bodies to help them carry out their
inspection and regulatory functions.</p><p><a name="0611023000132"></a>Amendments Nos. 108 and 100 create new
information offences. The first will criminalise anyone making a false
declaration to access individuals&#146; information illegitimately.
The second criminalises employers who force individuals to provide the
information about their criminal records history which they receive
when they apply to be monitored. Amendment No. 181 adds data held by
both the IBB and the Secretary of State in connection with his
functions under this Bill to Section 56 of the Data Protection Act, the
effect of which is to criminalise employers who force individuals to
make subject access requests for data under the Data Protection Act as
a condition of
employment.</p><p><a name="0611023000133"></a>Amendment No. 101
expands the role of the independent monitor to include reviewing all
decisions by the police to withhold police information from an
individual under Clause 21 and to review a sample of the information
that is provided to the vetting and barring scheme by the police. That
was another issue of great concern during the passage of

set out in Clause 23, covers only police information in connection with
CRB criminal records disclosures. The amendment adds police information
in connection with applications for monitoring. This change responds to
some of the points that the Joint Committee on Human Rights raised in
its report.</p><p><a name="0611023000134"></a>Amendments Nos. 141,
114 and 116 make it clear that a finding of fact, such as in court
proceedings or an employment tribunal, is not necessary for the purpose
of any referrals to the IBB. That is because there may be no such
proceedings in all the cases where we wish there to be a referral to
the IBB. In the Bill as drafted that was made clear in some, but not
all, of the referral provisions. The amendments remove any doubt. These
amendments provide for more streamlined flows of information within the
scheme and so will improve its operation.</p><p><a name="0611023000135"></a>Moved, That the House do agree with the

information flows, is the Minister satisfied that the IBB, when it
receives information that raises serious child protection issues,
irrespective of barring decisions, will share information appropriately
with social services? It is quite possible that, as a result of
referrals, the IBB may process key pieces of information giving a
fuller picture about an individual than a local social services
department is able to gather.</p><p><a name="0611023000137"></a>Secondly, in a situation where an
individual who is barred from working with children has children of his
own, will the IBB ensure that a referral is made to the appropriate
social services department so that a child protection assessment can be
carried out on those children? Will the local social services in the
area where the barred person resides be informed of a person&#146;s
barred status?</p><p><a name="0611023000138"></a>The vetting and barring
scheme, however well it operates, can only ever be part of the picture
of protection for children and vulnerable adults. Can the Minister
understand the worries of many of us that the Bill will be seen as a
be-all and end-all? Once organisations are satisfied that they can
comply with the measures in the Bill, they may consider that they have
&#147;done&#148; child protection. What are the Government doing to
ensure that they encourage all appropriate organisations to have sound
protection and reporting policies, a child-friendly ethos and enough
staff training? We welcome Amendment No. 101, which expands the remit
of the independent monitor and ensures that police force practice in
this area is compliant with human rights
principles.</p>

speak also to the others in the
group.</p><p><a name="0611025000004"></a>These amendments relate to
the operation of vetting and barring in the devolved Administrations.
They will enable the Government to deliver the commitments that they
have made to ensure that the vetting and barring scheme operates
successfully across the United Kingdom. These commitments include that
a person who appears on a barred list kept by the IBB or by Scottish
Ministers will be barred from working with children or vulnerable
adults across the entire UK, and that the relevant authorities across
the UK will share information so that information that could lead to
barring can be considered by the IBB or Scottish Ministers, as
appropriate, regardless of where in the UK the information first came
to light.</p><p><a name="0611025000005"></a>Amendment No. 143
enables provision to be made in future to take account of forthcoming
Scottish and Northern Ireland legislation. Scotland is making provision
for its own vetting and barring scheme. Northern Ireland will make its
own provisions, which will work in parallel with those in England and
Wales and allow the IBB to make barring decisions about individuals
living and working in Northern Ireland. Both the Scottish and Northern
Ireland legislation will be finalised after the Safeguarding Vulnerable
Groups Bill has completed it passage. Secondary legislation made under
this new clause will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure
if it amends provisions of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill or
confers a power to make secondary
legislation.</p><p><a name="0611025000006"></a>Amendment No. 153A
responds to a recommendation by the Delegated Powers Committee. It will
ensure that the order-making power in Amendment No. 143 is subject to
affirmative resolution, whether it makes amendment to the Safeguarding
Vulnerable Groups Bill or to any other Act of Parliament. We are
grateful for the committee&#146;s thorough scrutiny of the Bill, and
are happy to accept its recommendation in this regard.</p><p><a name="0611025000007"></a>Amendments Nos. 179 and 188 provide that
the IBB must not include a person on a barred list where Scottish
Ministers have already made a decision whether to include the person on
their list and the IBB has no new evidence. This will prevent a person
from being considered for more than one jurisdiction&#146;s list on
the basis of the same information

procedures in each jurisdiction. The intention is that the effect of
inclusion on the Scottish, Northern Ireland, or England and Wales lists
will be a bar from regulated activity across the
UK.</p><p><a name="0611025000008"></a>The amendments also give the
Secretary of State an order-making power that he can use to ensure that
a person is considered for listing by the most appropriate barring
authority, rather than by the barring authority that happens first to
become aware of information that could lead to listing. For example, we
intend that if the IBB receives information about a person who is not
subject to monitoring in England and Wales, but who is a member of the
Scottish scheme, Scottish Ministers and not the IBB should consider new
information on that person&#146;s
case.</p><p><a name="0611025000009"></a>Amendment No. 190 provides
that the Secretary of State must tell Scottish Ministers where the IBB

powers to make secondary legislation, to the extent that they affect
Wales, are to be exercised by the Welsh Ministers. These are powers
that significantly cut across devolved matters, such as the
requirements around checks for school governors. This clause also
requires the Secretary of State to obtain the agreement of Welsh
Ministers before exercising secondary legislation-making powers that
provide for requirements and powers that will affect the National
Assembly for Wales in its functions as an inspectorate. Amendment No.
191 provides that the IBB may provide information to Welsh Ministers
relevant to their functions&#151;formulating policy and monitoring
delivery of that policy.</p><p><a name="0611025000011"></a>These

consider introducing something similar here. Much has changed in the

chance further to consider that suggestion. It may not need to go in
the Bill but it would be helpful to know whether the Government intend
seriously to consider such a move, once the new Act has bedded down, as
a natural development of good practice. The big

is that it will benchmark non-statutory organisations, which currently
do not have a duty to vet and report, against a number of high
standards. In fact, why do we not pilot such a thing in one region of
England in parallel with the rollout of the measures in the
Bill?</p><p><a name="0611025000015"></a>On another cross-border

in the past, there has been considerable concern about whether
appropriate information has been passed from police forces in Scotland

one under the age of 18 will be automatically barred as a result of
offences committed or orders, such as sexual offences prevention
orders, made when they were under the age of 18. I know that that was
another issue of concern in the House when we first debated the
Bill.</p><p><a name="0611025000027"></a>Pornography was much
debated in both this House and another place. Amendments Nos. 173 to
177 and 181 to 186 align the references to pornography in relation to
the vulnerable adults&#146; and the children&#146;s barred lists,
fulfilling commitments that I made on Report. Any behaviour involving
pornography that harms a child or vulnerable adult is already covered
under the harm provisions. These amendments catch any other conduct
involving pornography that may indicate a risk to the vulnerable but
not necessarily harm them.</p><p><a name="0611025000028"></a>The
Bill already grants the Secretary of State the power to give guidance,
and the amendment adjusts this provision to ensure that guidance can be
given about what is inappropriate behaviour involving violent
pornography. It is intended that this should be used so that acceptable
behaviour involving adult pornography is excluded from
consideration.</p><p><a name="0611025000029"></a>Amendments Nos.
172, 178, 180 and 187 make clear in the Bill that a two-stage test
applies in discretionary barring cases. Where someone is being
considered for barring because he has engaged in &#147;relevant
conduct&#148;, such as behaviour that has harmed a vulnerable
individual, the IBB must first be satisfied that the individual has
engaged in that behaviour and then decide whether it is appropriate to
bar the individual. Where someone is being considered because they may
pose a risk of harm to vulnerable groups, the IBB must first be
satisfied that the individual poses a risk of harm and then decide
whether it is appropriate to bar the
individual.</p><p><a name="06110210000002"></a>Amendments
Nos. 156 and 250 create a new clause and new schedule specifying powers
to transfer individuals from existing barred lists to the new barred
lists relating to children and vulnerable adults. These amendments add
detail to the provisions that were already in the Bill. Paragraph (1)
of the new schedule allows the Secretary of State to require the IBB to
advise him on decisions under current schemes to ensure a smooth
transition. Paragraphs (2) and (3) relate to children and vulnerable
adults respectively, enabling the Secretary of State to make an order
setting out the procedures to be followed for
transition.</p><p><a name="06110210000003"></a>The Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee has highlighted a procedural
uncertainty in relation to the power to &#147;prescribe&#148; in
Amendment No. 250; Amendment No. 250A resolves this uncertainty.
Amendment No. 250 enables the Secretary of State to prescribe the
procedure to be followed by the General Teaching Council for England
when considering an application to be eligible to be registered as a
teacher from someone who is ineligible for GTC registration due to
having been on List 99 because of professional misconduct and
who is not included in the children&#146;s barred list. The
intention was that the amendment

Council for Wales.</p><p><a name="06110210000004"></a>Amendment No.
250A clarifies the procedural matters raised by the Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee, particularly in relation to the Welsh
Ministers&#146; power, supplementing the general provisions in
relation to subordinate legislation in Clauses 60, 61 and 64. It also
puts beyond doubt that the regulations will be subject to the negative

No. 199 ensures that a court will inform an offender that, as a

Buscombe:</b> My Lords, I shall comment on two
amendments. It seems that Amendment No. 195 on foreign nationals goes
some way to allowing for overseas workers to be included on the
children and adult&#146;s barred list if they are deemed to be on a
corresponding list. Will a record be kept of the dates on which
monitored overseas workers arrived in the UK? Can the Minister inform
the House whether or not this will constitute a full check on workers
from overseas applying to work, paid or unpaid, in regulated
activities? I cannot help but feel that Ministers in this and another
place could have done more in response to the amendments of my
honourable friend in another place, the Member for Basingstoke, and
comments and concerns that we raised in your Lordships&#146; House,
which would have implemented some serious provisions for overseas
workers.</p><p><a name="06110210000009"></a>Amendment No. 199
relates to a defence for barred individuals who have not understood the
legislation. I am pleased that the courts will have to inform a person
when he has been included on a barred list. The Minister in another
place had clearly read through the recommendations, made by noble Lords
on these Benches, that there needs to be good communication with those
who have been barred in order to prevent attempts to work in
inappropriate roles, on the basis that not all decisions will be
perfect. It is important that individuals are made aware of effective
charges brought against them. However, the Minister in another place
has already indicated that there is a possibility for the remit of the
Bill to extend. Parmjit Dhanda said
that:</p><ul><a name="06110210000035"></a>&#147;Over time, we

misunderstandings of legislation as a defence. My honourable friend in
another place, Maria Miller, has highlighted the problem. Legislation
that allows for its own complexity as a defence rather hoists itself
with its own petard. I should be grateful for some reassurance from the
Minister on the
matter.</p><p><a name="06110210000011"></a><b><a name="61101-0019.htm_spnew231"></a><a name="06110210000091"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I absolutely agree with the
later comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe. This is a very
complex Bill and it is important that everybody understands it as well
as possible, particularly those who are subject to its
measures.</p><p><a name="06110210000012"></a>We welcome Amendments
Nos. 196 and 197, which make it clear that no one under 18 will be
barred from working with children or vulnerable adults without the
right to make representation. Children and young people who commit
offences, particularly of a sexual nature, need to have their risks
assessed in a different way from adults. I pay tribute to my honourable
friend, the Member for Mid Dorset and Poole North, Annette Brooke MP,
for her relentless pursuit of this issue.</p><p><a name="06110210000013"></a>We know that as many as 16 per cent of
children may have been abused. They often go on to abuse in their turn,
thus perpetuating a terrible cycle of abuse. Research shows that
targeted interventions can be highly effective in reducing risk, even
for those children and young people who are at higher risk of
continuing harmful behaviours. We know that juveniles commit about a
quarter of all sexual offences and that there is clear evidence that
many of them have suffered abuse or trauma themselves. Those who go
along the criminal justice route are unlikely to have their needs
adequately assessed, let alone addressed and treated. I therefore hope
that the addition of representation in this legislation will mean that
children who display sexually harmful behaviour will have their
situations addressed on a case-by-case basis and have the appropriate
services provided.</p><p><a name="06110210000014"></a>I thank the
Minister for Amendments Nos. 173 to 177 and 181 to 186, which align the
treatment of pornography with barring people from working with children
and vulnerable adults, in response to inconsistencies to which I drew
attention when the Bill went through your Lordships&#146;
House.</p><p><a name="06110210000015"></a>I also welcome Amendments
Nos. 192, 193 and 195, which allow the IBB in the future to
automatically bar someone who is included on a specified barred list
from another country. The issue of foreign workers exercised us all in
the light of the fact that currently there are no equivalent foreign
barred lists, and provision for screening is very patchy. However, we
are now establishing a piece of legislation which we all hope will work
very well. I ask the Minister, if he is in consultation with his
counterparts in other countries&#151;in particular our partners in
Europe and especially the new accession countries&#151;to share the
experiences which the Government will gain from the operation of this
Bill. I am sure that we would like to help other countries to get up to
our standard, should the Bill turn out to work as well in practice as
we all hope it will, since it

our children and vulnerable
adults.</p><p><a name="06110210000016"></a>Finally,
on Amendment No. 199, which is on the duty of the court to inform
somebody that he is barred, will the Minister confirm that guidance
will specify that the court and the IBB&#151;whoever is responsible
for telling a person from what he is barred&#151;also has a duty to
ensure that the information has been received and is not lying unopened
on some doormat at an address at which the person has not lived for
years? I am still receiving mail for people who have not lived at my
London address for the past six years. Can he give me that
assurance?</p><p><a name="06110210000017"></a><b><a name="61101-0019.htm_spnew232"></a><a name="06110210000092"></a>Lord

from deep memory from our consideration of this precise issue last
time, so I may need to follow this up with a letter to the noble
Baroness. As I recall it, all such notifications are sent by
appropriate recorded delivery, for which a signature is required.
Therefore, although we cannot absolutely guarantee that documentation
will be taken in, this gives reasonable assurance that the document
will be properly received or returned to sender. If there has been any
update on that position in the last few months, I will let the noble
Baroness know. It is probably deeply dangerous for me to speak from
memory in giving her a direct response to
that.</p><p><a name="06110210000018"></a>On foreign offences and
inclusion on foreign barred lists, a point also raised by the noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe, I should stress that the current barring
schemes&#151;POCA, POVA and List 99&#151;are based on employer
referrals and can take account of any information that they receive,
including foreign offences, if notified by the UK police of allegations
of behaviour abroad. I am advised that there has been a case where an
English employer has referred an individual to the POCA scheme as a
result of allegations of behaviour when abroad while working for the
employer and that that has resulted in a
bar.</p><p><a name="06110210000019"></a>We envisage the provisions
for specifying foreign barred lists as prescribed criteria under the
new scheme as taking account of future developments in other countries.
We are aware of the operation of barred lists in Australia, New
Zealand, the United States and Canada. The noble Baroness, Lady
Walmsley, referred to our fellow European states and the new accession
countries. She asked whether we will be in communication with them. We
will certainly continue to be in communication with them&#151;whether
for the purposes that she specified: that they might have things to
learn from us; or for the purposes of us being able better to secure
information from them about the history of individuals as they present
themselves to work with employers in the United Kingdom. I can give
those assurances and I will cover any other matters in
correspondence.</p><p><a name="06110210000020"></a>On Question,

<I>Delivering on Child Poverty: what would it take?</I> (Cm 6951), an
independent report by Lisa Harker for the Department for Work and

committed to eradicating child poverty. We have made significant
progress by lifting 700,000 children out of relative poverty since the
Prime Minister set the historic target in 1998 to eradicate child
poverty by 2020.</p><p><a name="06110162000008"></a>Our success in
helping people into work hasbeen key to reducing child
poverty. We have seen2.5 million more people in work than in
1997 and there are now over 1 million lone parents in employment. This
has made a significant and sustainable contribution to reducing child
poverty. We need to continue to build on this success but recognise
there is more to do if we are to reach our goal.</p><p><a name="06110162000009"></a>I commissioned the report to inform our
next stage of strategy development, and I am very grateful for the work
that Lisa Harker has done during the summer. The report provides a
challenging but constructive assessment of my department&#146;s
current strategy on child poverty and some clear recommendations for
future policy development.</p><p><a name="06110162000010"></a>We
will, as previously announced, be publishing the department&#146;s
own strategy on child poverty later in the year. This will set out our

2020. Copies of the report are available from the Vote Office and the

Development Programme for
England</h3><p><a name="06110162000015"></a><b><a name="06110162000037"></a>The
Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(Lord Rooker):</b> My right honourable friend the
Secretary of State (David Miliband) has made the following Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06110162000016"></a>The Rural Development
Programme for England 2007-13, implementing the new European rural
development regulation, is an important element of the
Government&#146;s strategy for the future of rural development and
the environment. We set out our proposed priorities for the new
programme in a consultation document<sup>1</sup> earlier this year, and
since then have discussed them extensively both at a national and
regional levels.</p><p><a name="06110162000017"></a>On 24 May
2006<sup>2</sup>, the European Commission published proposals for
implementing all EU programmes during 2007-13 in the light of the
budget agreement reached by the European Council in December 2005. For
rural development, these proposals included the draft allocation of
funding for member states and a draft regulation governingthe
application of voluntary modulation. On19 June
2006<sup>3</sup>, the EU Agriculture Council confirmed the overall
allocation of rural development funds, and on 12 September these were
formally allocated to individual member states through Commission
Decision 636 of 2006<sup>4</sup>.</p><p><a name="06110162000018"></a>The Government have always stressed that
the final shape and size of the new Rural Development Programme for
England is dependent on the availability of receipts from voluntary
modulation. In the draft proposal on voluntary modulation (VM)
currently under negotiation in the Agriculture Council a number of
important issues remain unresolved, including on regionalisation (i.e.
whether or not we are able to set separate rates for England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland) and the franchise. We are continuing to
discuss these issues in Brussels but the draft voluntary modulation
regulation cannot be agreed by the Agriculture Council until a formal
consultation procedure with the European Parliament has been
completed.</p><p><a name="06110162000019"></a>However, at present
progress of the regulation is stalled in the European Parliament. The
EP&#146;s Agriculture Committee has recommended rejection of the
Commission&#146;s proposal and a plenary vote scheduled for 26
October was postponed for procedural reasons. It is likely to take some
time before the consultation procedure with the Parliament 



<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS15"></a><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column WS15</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is completed and the details of the regulation will then need to be
finalised by the council. We now anticipate that this process, and the
regulation itself, is unlikely to be concluded before spring
2007.</p><p><a name="06110162000020"></a>The Government&#146;s
preparations for the new programme are well advanced. But until the
voluntary modulation negotiations are concluded at the EU level, we
cannot reach our own decisions on the rate of VM and the total budget
for the programme. We therefore cannot submit our programme for
approval in Brussels, as we are required to do. (Once the programme is
submitted, the approval process can take up to an additional six
months.)</p><p><a name="06110162000021"></a>These delays mean that
the new Rural Development Programme for England will not be able to
start on time on 1 January 2007. This is deeply disappointing to me and
my department, but above all to farmers, land managers and other
potential beneficiaries in rural areas who want clarity about what
rural development funding will be available in 2007-13 as soon as
possible.</p><p><a name="06110162000022"></a>Our intention remains
for the new programme to start at the earliest possible date and my
officials are working closely with the European Commission, delivery
bodies and a wide range of stakeholders to achieve this. I can reassure
existing beneficiaries that their agreements will continue to be
honoured. Weare also considering carefully the contingency
arrangements for rural development scheme delivery that will apply in
the absence of formal approval for our new programme. I will continue
to keep the House informed about these and any other
developments.</p><a name="06110162000031"></a><sup>1</sup>

body. Subject to the approval of Parliament, the new body will be
established by Order in Council as an executive-non departmental public
body under the Science and Technology Act 1965. It will be business
focused with a business-led board. It will work closely with government
departments to ensure that policiesand spending programmes
contribute fully to the technology and innovation agenda, creating real
commercial advantage for UK
business.</p><p><a name="06110162000027"></a>The objectives of the
body will be to promoteand support research into and
development and exploitation of science and technology and new ideas
for the benefit of business in order to increase economic growth and
improve the quality of life. The establishment of the new body will
provide improved strategic focus, better operational flexibility and
greater consistency and coherence in the delivery of our technology
support programme as well as an improved ability to work with third
parties.</p><p><a name="06110162000028"></a>The main role of the
new body will be to delivera programme of government financial
support through collaborative research and development and knowledge
transfer to encourage business investment in, and use of, technology
across all sectors of the UK economy. It will provide leadership to
government departments and agencies and work with the regional
development agencies, the research councils andthe devolved
administrations on technological developments and innovation of
importance to UK industry. A key role of the new body will be to
promote close working between Government and business in developing and
exploiting new technologies. The new body will be asked to advise
Government on areas where barriers exist to the exploitation of new
technologies, and put forward recommendations as to how they can be
removed, but responsibility for the overall direction of innovation
policy will remain with
Ministers.</p><p><a name="06110162000029"></a>Graham Spittle, the
present chair of the Technology Strategy Board, has agreed to chair the
new body. This will help to ensure that the successful work of the TSB
is carried forward. Mr Spittle has a tremendous record driving
innovation in business and I greatly appreciate the leadership he has
provided to the TSB in his current
role.</p><p><a name="06110162000030"></a>Following a general review
of possible locations against a set of objective criteria, including a
number of specific sites proposed by the regional development agencies,
the Government have decided that Swindon should be the primary location
for the body. I expect the new body to be formally inaugurated in the
first half of the 2007-08 financial
year.</p>

will have personnel from many different units, formations and (often)
services, deployed from home locations across the UK and overseas. It
would not be practical for an additional &#147;family liaison

will have been referred by their unit's primary care provider to other
NHS hospitals, or an individual might have been admitted as a result of
accident or illness without reference to their parent unit. The numbers
of individuals falling into these categories is not recorded centrally
and could be established only at wholly disproportionate cost by
examining the personal medical file of every service man and woman,
which would additionally require the permission of all individuals.
From previous work, it is estimated that there might be around a

Comprehensive figures on the number of personnel who served in the

Administration Act 2006 includes a number of provisions to strengthen
the security of proxy voting which we intend will all be in force at
the May 2007 elections:</p>The new personal
identifiers provisions will apply to proxy votes. The elector who
appoints the proxy will have to supply their date of birth and
signature when applying for a proxy vote, and they can be checked by
the electoral registration officer (ERO) against any previously
provided by the elector to the ERO or local
authority.A person appointed as proxy who
wishes to vote by post will&#151;like other postal voters&#151;be
required to provide their date of birth and signature when they apply
for a postal vote and, at elections, they will have to provide them on
the postal voting statement, and if the personal identifiers do not
match this may lead to the vote being
invalid.Persons appointed as a proxy who
vote in person at a polling station will have to sign for their ballot
paper, like all other polling station voters. These signatures will be
kept after the election and may be scrutinized if there is a police
investigation into alleged fraud or an election
petition.There is a new offence of falsely
applying for a postal or proxy vote. This new offence was brought into
force on 11 September

that evidence from human intervention trials, strengthened by findings
from epidemiological studies, supports the idea that the effect of TFAs
on heart health may be greater than that of saturated fats. However, in

TFAs, their potential to significantly increase cardiovascular risk is
much lower than saturated fatty acids which are currently consumed in

McKenzie of Luton:</b> Budget 2006 Table 4.2 provides
estimates of the numbers of workers, who work more that 16 hours and
therefore may qualify for the working tax credits, facing high marginal
deduction rates (MDRs, or effective marginal tax rates). It shows that
the numbers facing MDRs above 90 per cent have fallen from 130,000 in
1996-97 to 35,000 in
2006-07.</p><p><a name="06110174000143"></a>The Institute for
Fiscal Studies report provides similar estimates although, as set out
in the respective publications, there are some specific differences;
for example they include individuals working a very few hours, and
therefore are still eligible for out-of-work benefits such as income
support. Previous analysis by the IFS suggests that the 1997 tax and
benefit system had over 300,000 working parents with an MDR over 90 per
cent. Their more recent analysis suggeststhat the number of
working adults with MDRs over 90 per cent is now 160,000.</p>

convinced that a distance-based charge is the right way ahead and are
working on the potential shape and form of a national road pricing
system. It was in the light of the progression toward national road
pricing that the Government decided it would have made no sense to
develop a system only for lorries, and that it was therefore right for
the Government to take forward plans to develop a single comprehensive
and cost-effective system that would include lorries alongside other
road vehicles. The 5 July 2005 announcement by the then Secretary of
State for Transport, Alistair Darling, reflected
this.</p>
