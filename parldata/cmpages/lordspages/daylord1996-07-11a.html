<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spopq0"></A><B> The Countess of Mar </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>To which specialist units the National Poisons Information Service advises general practitioners to refer patients for treatment for the chronic effects of exposure to organophosphates.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Cumberlege): </B>  My Lords, the National Poisons Information Service centres advise general practitioners to refer patients to an appropriate specialist unit. This could be one of five linked to NPIS centres or others situated in general hospitals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew0"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that reply. It is now four years since I first asked a Starred Question in an effort to gain proper medical help for farmers. Is she aware that we are still suffering from a lack of recognition of the problem by GPs and consultants? I am very grateful for what the Government have done; I realise that one cannot force people into doing things. However, will the Minister look into the issue once again to see if we can achieve a solution for the farmers who are suffering so dreadfully?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I believe that few have been more resolute and more tenacious in their cause than the noble Countess. I am delighted to tell her that the presidents of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Psychiatrists met the Chief Medical Officer at my request yesterday. They have agreed to set up a working group to review the evidence for possible long-term adverse effects of exposure to OPs. The group will also meet with the noble Countess and others she wishes to suggest. It will then be in a good position to offer advice on any course of further action which may be necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the House will be extremely glad to hear of the Minister's initiative in this area, which is extremely welcome. I join the Minister in congratulating the noble Countess on her efforts in this field.

<A NAME = "60711-01_para0"></a>Where there is a new and possibly undetected illness of this kind, is it not a matter of some concern that the present structures in the health service, by which hospitals are required to act independently, make it difficult for people to receive locally at each individual <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that that is the case. One of the problems that the noble Countess identifies involves general practitioners. They are independent people. We rely on them to make the diagnosis and to refer patients on. However, I believe that this initiative will help not only the general practitioners but also the consultants in individual hospitals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew4"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may express my gratitude to the noble Baroness the Minister for her reply to me.

<A NAME="60711-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What action they are taking through the European Union, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, NATO and the International Committee of the Red Cross to secure improvements in human rights and a peaceful resolution of internal conflict in Turkey.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, we continue to explore, with partners in international fora, the scope for encouraging more progress on human rights in Turkey and for helping to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the south-east of Turkey. We also raise our concerns in regular bilateral contacts with the Turkish authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his reply. However, is it not quite unacceptable that each successive political party in Turkey which advocates a negotiated settlement of this conflict is disbanded by government action? At the same time the Red Cross is excluded from the country, while the other international bodies named in my Question stand by, almost turning a blind eye.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that a blind eye is being turned by those bodies. We are not allowing them to do so. We are raising the matter whenever we can. Some of the actions taken against political parties have been disappointing. I refer in particular to the recent arrest or prosecution of members of HADEP at their annual congress. As we understand it, no one has yet been charged in relation to the incident.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that in addition to the arrest of members of HADEP following the party congress, three of the delegates were murdered on their way back to their constituencies? Have the Government taken up specifically with the new authorities in Turkey under Mr. Erbakan the exclusion from Turkey of certain UK-based persons including Mr. Jonathan Sugden and Mr. Helmut Oberdiek of <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, we are well aware of those situations. We totally condemn the murder of anyone going from one place to another, whether it be from a political meeting or any other occasion. We totally deplore such action. Until we have full details, and people are convicted, the Government should not comment further. We have frequently brought up the case of people who have been barred from visiting Turkey such as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, himself. We intend to raise the matter again with the new government. We shall bring it up at every opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the PKK, the Kurdish armed body normally cast as the villain of the piece, whichever way you choose to spell it, has operated a unilateral ceasefire for the past three months and wishes to start negotiations with the Turkish Government without preconditions? Will the Government encourage the Turkish Government to take up that offer? Does he agree that, otherwise, this destructive war is likely to go on and on until the legitimate human rights of the Kurdish population of south-east Turkey are honoured?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, we rather question the credibility of any ceasefire declaration by the PKK, which has carried out dreadful terrorist acts that we unreservedly condemn. It is for the Turkish Government to decide how to respond rather than for us. As I have stated, we repeat as frequently as we can to the Turkish Government that we should like to see an improvement in human rights and peace in the whole of Turkey. We will continue whenever we can to raise these matters in international fora and on a bilateral basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew12"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend tell the House whether we receive from Turkey or other countries advice on how to settle the Irish problem?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, that is a very good point. Some people try to give us advice. Whether or not it is well received is another matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that advice given from outside has been extremely helpful in the appalling conflict in Palestine between the Jewish state and the Arabs? I like the Turks, and I appreciate the facts on both sides. Does the Minister agree that if we took a positive stance instead of the negative response given to the noble Earl, our influence on Turkey might help in this conflict?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, I believe we take a very positive stance. We have not indicated in any way that we take a negative stance. Whenever we can we raise the issues about which noble Lords are so concerned.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister take it from me that we on this side of the House do not regard the comments made by the noble Earl, Lord Lauderdale, as being in the slightest bit relevant? Indeed, they represented a serious breach of good taste.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew17"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   Yes indeed, my Lords. Is the Minister aware that Turkey has made application for membership of the European Union? Will he give an undertaking that this Government will not begin to entertain that application while the current breaches of human rights persist? Does he believe that Turkey should be in receipt of aid from the European Union while the current position persists?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, we believe that the most effective way of helping progress on human rights in Turkey is to encourage closer ties between Turkey and western institutions. The Turkey/EU customs union and increased political dialogue are an important part of this process. It would be a great mistake to try to push Turkey further east.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Chalfont: </B>   My Lords, at the risk of committing yet another gross breach of good taste, does the Minister agree that the best advice we could give to the Turkish Government is how much credence to place on unilateral ceasefires by terrorist organisations?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, that is a matter with which I have already dealt. To return to the point about aid, funding to assist with the EU customs union was to be provided to Turkey. At the moment no EU aid is going to Turkey at all; it is being banned by Greece.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, will the Government take up with the Government of Turkey the recent commercial action that prevented MED TV--a British-registered company--from broadcasting in the Kurdish language to Turkey, Iran and Iraq?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, MED TV was, I understand, unable to renew its contract for access to satellite for its broadcasts. That is a purely commercial decision, not one on which this Government had, or could have, any influence.

<P>

<P>

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment   (Lord Henley): </B>  My Lords, my right honourable friend's proposals will give teachers a framework within which their professional skills can be developed and assessed. The professional framework will also allow for qualifications giving wider recognition to teachers' achievements. High professional standards form the best basis for enhanced professional pride.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Quirk: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate the supportive tenor of the Minister's response. Would he not agree that, along with the absolutely essential raising of standards of teacher training, our teachers need to feel reassurance that they belong to a noble calling that deserves the name of "profession", with all that this entails? Is it not surprising, to use no stronger word, that, although by no means under-provided with organisations devoted to pay and conditions, our teachers still seem to lack a college, institute, professional organisation, call it what you will, which can both attract more than a tiny minority of teachers to membership and which is devoted to directing such issues of public concern as codes of conduct, standards, ethics and the rest?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord may be looking for a professional body dedicated to enhancing the status of teachers, but I believe that that is a matter for the teachers themselves to set up. We have always made it quite clear that we do not see a role for a statutory professional body. We also believe that it is for the teachers and their unions, some of whose antics have been somewhat misguided, to take responsibility for enhancing their standing and the standing of their profession in the eyes of parents and the general public.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend say whether the paper that is to be published will deal with the training of teachers who deal with dyslexic children?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, the paper will be looking at the training of all teachers. That obviously will cover the training of those who deal with special needs, whether it is dyslexia or whatever.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister care to comment on the position with regard to recruitment of people for this training? Will he also comment on the widespread unease among members of the teaching profession? The overwhelming majority of parents whose children are in comprehensive schools are satisfied with their child's education and have confidence in that education, but, for cheap party political reasons, people tend to denigrate the whole teaching profession and generalise on the behaviour of a very small minority.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, we have never denigrated the entire teaching profession. We have said that there are some teachers who are not performing adequately and some schools which do not perform adequately. If I were to make a cheap party political point, I should say that there are some in the party opposite who recognise that <P>


<a name="column_440"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 440</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>situation and take their children to schools in boroughs other than the one in which they live. The noble Baroness ought to recognise that fact. As for recruitment, numbers in the teaching profession are satisfactory at the moment. There is some unease about certain subjects and obviously that is a matter that we ought to address.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Cox: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a member of the board of the Teacher Training Agency. Does my noble friend agree that the most effective way of enhancing a professional sense of pride in the teaching profession is to ensure that teachers are adequately prepared for their professional responsibilities; that inadequate professional practice, as established by Her Majesty's Inspectors, is dealt with very seriously; and that good professional practice is widely commended and encouraged?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I endorse absolutely everything that my noble friend said. As my right honourable friend the Secretary of State made clear today, we shall be looking at further improvements in teacher training and at performance tables for teacher training institutions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew11"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister please withdraw the inaccurate phrase "the party opposite"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, from where I am sitting, it is the party opposite.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Lord say whether the paper will cover England alone or whether it will include Scotland and Wales as well?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I understand that it is to be a paper for England and Wales but not the country north of the Border. If I am wrong, I shall write to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, returning to the subject of the original Question, does my noble friend agree that the Government would warmly welcome an approach from within the teaching profession which would have the effect of separating the issues of standards and ethics in teaching and the rates of pay and conditions, so that instead of having only a trade union as their collective voice, the teachers had a professional body to which they themselves would be answerable?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, the problem south of the Border, in England, is that the teachers have six different unions to represent them. Obviously we should welcome them forming their own body, as I said earlier, dedicated to raising their standards and enhancing their status in the eyes of the public.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recall that over the years a number of organisations, both union and professional, have made overtures to the department asking if it would be <P>


<a name="column_441"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 441</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prepared to steer a professional organisation through? That is not to interfere but to work in partnership with the teachers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I remind the noble Lord of what I believe I said earlier. We should welcome a teachers' professional body dedicated to promoting good practice but we do not see a case for establishing that on a statutory basis. It must be a matter for the teachers themselves.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that it would do much for the professional standing of teachers if the precise content of teacher training courses, including such things as detailed course profiles, the names of external examiners and indicative reading lists, were put on much more public display and, indeed, if that were to be a condition for their funding in future?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, getting right the training of teachers is an absolute imperative. That is why we see it as so important to step up the inspection of teacher training institutions, as I said earlier, and to bring in performance tables for teacher training institutions and generally open them up to observation from outside. We are going down that route and I hope that my noble friend will be greatly encouraged by that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, following an earlier answer, would the Minister now welcome a general teaching council?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I have answered that question on more than one occasion. If the profession wishes to set up a general teaching council, that is a matter for the teachers. As my noble friend Lady Blatch made clear when we debated this matter some two years ago, we do not see a case for establishing it on a statutory basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Morris of Castle Morris: </B>   My Lords, will the terms of reference of the DfEE paper on teacher training allow the department to consider and make recommendations on how to teach physical, moral and spiritual education, so that the teachers will in future be able to play their part in the moral crusade of the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew24"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, as I made clear earlier, it will cover all aspects of teaching.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-02_spnew25"></A><B> Lord Quirk: </B>   My Lords, Scotland has been mentioned and the question of a general teaching council. So, in all innocence, may I ask the Minister whether, in his view, the General Teaching Council in Scotland has led to an improvement in teaching north of the Border; or is it the case that teaching in Scotland before the General Teaching Council was set up was already so much better than it is south of the Border down Islington way?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I shall not quote Dr. Johnson on the subject of education in Scotland. I understand that the General Teaching Council in Scotland works perfectly well, but there is no need to establish, on a statutory basis, such a body in England. We have very different educational systems north and south of the Border. As I made clear earlier, north of the Border there is one union representing all teachers whereas south of the Border six unions represent teachers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Brigstocke: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that one of the most pressing needs for teachers is to have in-service training? It is not just the initial training that matters, but also after they have been teaching for several years. Does he agree that that could enhance enormously their feeling of pride?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is absolutely correct. That is why we make considerable sums of money available for in-service training. I regret that I cannot quote a precise figure to my noble friend on this occasion, but considerable resources are available.

<P>
<UL>Whether the Public Sector Borrowing Rate (PSBR) forecast for 1997-98 made in November 1995 remains a government target, and, if so, whether they expect the PSBR to be below the 3 per cent. of GDP required were the Government to decide to opt in to economic and monetary union.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security   (Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish): </B>  My Lords, the Government's fiscal objective is to bring the PSBR back towards balance over the medium term. The summer economic forecast published on Tuesday projects the PSBR falling to &#163;23 billion in 1997-98, around half its level in 1993-94.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-03_para0"></a>The general government financial deficit--the measure of the deficit used for the EMU convergence criteria--is forecast to fall to just below 3 per cent. in 1997-98.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, would not the simple answer to the first part of my Question have been to say, "No"? The plain fact is that since November the PSBR has risen by &#163;8 billion. In those circumstances, how can the Minister be so complacent in his Answer? As regards the second part of my Question, does he agree--I assume that he does--with the European Monetary Committee, one of whose members is a senior Treasury official, in its recommendation that there should be no tax cuts in November as it might threaten the prospects of our joining the economic and monetary union, if that is the Government's decision?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, as the summer economic forecast makes perfectly clear, the public sector borrowing requirement is not going down as quickly as forecast in the Red Book. The reason for that is <P>


<a name="column_443"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 443</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the Government's general receipts have been lower than was predicted. In relation to the second point, my right honourable friend the Chancellor made clear on a number of occasions that we, on this side of the House, are a tax-cutting party and will cut taxes, as we have done in the past, whenever it is right and prudent in the interests of the British economy to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clark of Kempston: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the percentage of GDP in relation to public sector borrowing is one of the lowest in the European Union? Does he agree also that the cost of servicing the public sector borrowing requirement has been that much reduced because of the reduction in the base rate of bank interest? Does he agree also that it ill becomes the Labour Party to criticise the public sector borrowing requirement of this Government when, in the last Labour Government between 1974 and 1979, they managed to double the national debt? Does he further agree that one of the other facets of our economy is the balance of payments and that the new figures on our invisibles show a surplus of &#163;20 billion, which is double what it was 10 years ago?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I agree with all the points made by my noble friend. Indeed, he is right to draw the attention of the House to the fact that currently the United Kingdom has the third lowest debt to GDP ratio in the European Union and only Luxembourg and France are better. He also draws our attention to the position of the last Labour Government, as the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, recalls well--he struggled mightily to achieve it. It would have been a good deal worse if his colleagues had been allowed to do all the spending that they wanted to do. Under the last Labour Government the debt to GDP ratio averaged 62 per cent.; under the Government of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister it has averaged 44 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the most well-informed sector of public opinion in the United Kingdom would not regard it as an unmitigated disaster if we failed to reach the ridiculous criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty? Is he aware also that a growing number of people do not share some people's obsession with the divine wisdom of bankers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, the criteria in the Maastricht Treaty are sensible for any prudent economy to try to follow. Indeed, most successful economies do try to follow them with low government borrowing, low tax and low public spending. That is what we are doing and that is why the OECD predicted that the United Kingdom will have the highest growth rate of any European Union G7 member this year and next, coupled with low inflation, as witnessed by this morning's figures.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Boardman: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that if a choice is to be made, it is better that we should follow the economic policy suitable for this country rather than distorting it in order to chase the criteria of the monetary union?

<A NAME="60711-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, the United Kingdom Government's first obligation is to the United Kingdom economy. We will not do anything that damages that when it comes to considering the European convergence or entry into the EMU. We have always made clear that these issues will be decided by us not in our desire to say "Yes" to everything Europe wants, but to make sure that our policies are based on what is best for the British economy.

<P>

<A NAME="60711-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Viscount Cranborne): </B>  My Lords, if we take the questions one at a time I am sure that both noble Lords will have an opportunity to speak. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, could begin.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Eatwell: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that in every government economic forecast this decade the figure for the PSBR has risen? To take a case in point, is he aware that the figure for the PSBR projected for this year is &#163;14 billion higher than that projected 18 months ago? In terms the Minister may understand, that is 7p in the pound in income tax. Given that the Government's fiscal policy is failing year after year, what are the Government going to do about it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that I can agree with the noble Lord that the Government's fiscal policy is failing. The public sector borrowing requirement is the difference between two large figures. A small change in those large figures makes a significant difference to the subtracted PSBR. As I said in my original Answer, government receipts have been lower than predicted, but general government expenditure has been on track, and the reason is that this Government control public expenditure. That is an important part of the calculation. But every time I come to this House with suggestions about controlling public expenditure, the party opposite opposes me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, the Minister referred twice to reduced receipts having affected the PSBR estimates. Does he agree that a large part of those reduced receipts has been due to the relatively poor performance--worse even than last year--of manufacturing industry over the past six or seven months? When does he think that trend will be reversed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that that is the main cause of the reduction in receipts. The reduction came in corporation tax, income tax and value-added tax. It therefore arises from three taxes. In relation to manufacturing industry and the economy generally, the noble Lord should welcome that important indicator, the unemployment rate. On the most recent figures, the unemployment rate in this country at 8.4 per cent. on the ILO standardised rate is considerably below the EU average of 11 per cent. and below the level of every one of the major players in the European Union, and falling.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 196, I shall speak also to Clauses 212 and 213. I am pleased to find myself here since I was assured by the press this morning that I had withdrawn my amendment and that nothing would happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para1"></a>The Government propose to sell the entire married quarters estate in England and Wales--around 60,000 houses and flats--on 800 sites to a private international developer, initially on a 25-year lease-back basis. The MoD will pay an aggregate market-based rent, reviewed every five years, or a guaranteed payment--whichever is the higher--but will manage and maintain the properties through the new Defence Housing Executive. The sites include the regimental patches which are a vital part of the support system for service families. I shall leave it to other noble Lords to discuss the financial and legal provisions. I shall identify the features of the scheme which have caused deep anxiety and threaten the already fragile stability of service morale.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para2"></a>One is the site exchange scheme under which the developer has the option to exchange units or sites occupied by MoD families for "comparable substitute accommodation". An arbitrator, not the MoD, will <P>


<a name="column_446"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 446</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>decide whether that meets certain criteria and is "comparable". Another feature is the requirement for the MoD to release a number of occupied properties annually--probably 600 to 700--over 25 years. That adds up to roughly 17,500 houses. A third is the right of the developer, after 25 years, to vacant possession or redevelopment, not necessarily providing a comparable alternative, and to dispose of sites or parts of sites. The only way the MoD can resist this repossession is to use, on grounds of operational necessity, a ministerial certificate whose legal status on judicial review must be very doubtful. Finally, the families fear that as rents rise the MoD will be moved to relinquish the most expensive sites under the site exchange option.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para3"></a>The project has been presented as an excellent piece of privatisation which will save the taxpayer money by disposing of empty houses and benefit service families because it will make possible long overdue repairs to a disgracefully run-down military estate and better management. The Secretary of State, when he wrote to the families, said what a good deal it was and that his key priority was the interest and well-being of service families.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para4"></a>I have nothing against privatisation, but the Government have, not for the first time, utterly failed to take account of something which cannot be bought and can all too easily be lost: the confidence of men in their leaders. The services feel punch drunk; they have taken so many cuts and been asked to do the impossible so often; this is the last straw. The families feel threatened and anxious wives make anxious husbands, who will probably leave the services when recruitment is at rock bottom and retention a serious problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para5"></a>Why do noble Lords think that we have brought this amendment to the House? It is because within the services there has been no two-way consultation of the kind that was used for the Bett Report or indeed for the homosexuality issue: there has only been one-way traffic. They have been told what will happen and their legitimate concerns, expressed over many months and their irrational anxieties alike have not been addressed. The fact that the new proposal has coincided, though in no way connected, with the decision of the Armed Forces Pay Review Board to increase rents by 10 per cent. to 25 per cent. has not helped.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para6"></a>The families fear, with some reason, that the developer will be able to pick off regimental patches or parts of them. Privatising service homes is not like privatising British Gas nor is an army quarter like a house with a mortgage. Service people have only a licence to occupy a quarter. They have no security of tenure. Some wives may move 39 times during their husband's career--think of the effect of that on the children. But at least so far they knew that the environment would be safe, stable and familiar and their men, many of whom may not have been home three Christmases running thanks to several tours in Bosnia and Northern Ireland, knew it, too. When two Welsh fusiliers were taken hostage in Bosnia some years' ago, the press rushed to see the young wives, demanding to know what counselling they and their children were <P>


<a name="column_447"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 447</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>receiving. They were told proudly that the regiment and the regimental wives did that. They knew the score. That is what the regimental patch is.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para7"></a>Those who live there now feel threatened and that is a serious failure of communication and man-management. Organisations like the Federation of Army Wives and the British Legion have tried to secure two-way consultation and have got nowhere and the anxieties have grown. We believe that there would be very great benefits--if the scheme is indeed so much in the interests of the forces--if a proper consultation exercise took place. It would not only be good PR--a very scarce commodity these days--but also it would be proof that we have not actually forgotten how to listen.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para8"></a>We have been told that the great prize to be won for the services in return for putting the security of future generations at the mercy of an international developer is the &#163;100 million which the Treasury is prepared to release over five years and ring-fence for use to improve property. (The MoD is already spending &#163;40 million annually on upgrading, anyway). How much of that &#163;100 million, one wonders, will be used to improve houses to be handed over to the developer. Is &#163;100 million a prize out of the &#163;1.5 billion at least which the Treasury is expecting from the sale?
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para9"></a>Widespread loss of morale and widespread anxiety, which because of the strong tradition of silence and loyalty can find a voice only through this House and the other place, are a high price to pay for a paltry &#163;100 million. I have to add that, as other noble Lords will show, the deal is a wonderful one for the developer but full of pitfalls and black holes for the country, both in the short and the long term.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para10"></a>Perhaps I may ask my noble friend the Minister, incidentally--and I gave him warning of this question--to tell the House what connection, if any, a Mr. David Hart has with the project? Is he a consultant? What is his status in this matter? My concern is that this project appears to be driven far more by the philosophy of the market than by any concern for, or understanding of, service needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para11"></a>Many noble Lords will feel that the Chiefs of Staff themselves have now endorsed this project publicly and therefore that should be the end of the matter, and that to continue to press the matter is possibly arrogant and certainly unnecessary. I suspect that the Chiefs of Staff, for reasons of pragmatism as well as loyalty, have no alternative. A threat to &#163;1.5 billion that the Treasury is counting on could only result in the MoD having to find that money in some other vital area.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para12"></a>But we are not asking for the scheme to be given up. Once it has been sold properly to the forces and once Parliament has had the opportunity, for the first time, to debate it in the light of that consultation and to test the safeguards, there is no reason why a good scheme should not go forward in October with due modification. The Secretary of State stated in the preliminary bids documents that he may, at his discretion, amend the timetable, alter the basis of the transaction or decide not to proceed with it at any time.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para13"></a>We are asking for delay to allow full debate in Parliament on the basis of consultation and a decision by affirmative resolution. I have never approached any <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>issue in this House as a gender issue, but I feel considerable anger, shared by other noble Lords with service contacts, over the determined efforts being made to suppress adverse comment even within the services. Wives cannot speak (I am not here referring to the official bodies) without risking harm to their husbands' careers or, at the least, acquiring a reputation as a troublemaker. The RAF News has apparently been forbidden to publish critical letters about the scheme. It seems that service wives have duties but no rights. We expect their votes as citizens, but we give them no voice on an issue so closely affecting their lives. In a free country that is disgraceful when the issue concerns neither security nor operational duties.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para14"></a>This project is a national decision with potentially far-reaching consequences, capable of a serious adverse impact on the morale and effectiveness of our fighting services. It deserves to be fully tested by due parliamentary process. Perhaps some indication of its importance is the fact that the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, who speaks after me and who should have been at the 75th anniversary celebrations of the British Legion, has come here expressly to support this amendment. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_time0"></A><H5>3.45 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bramall: </B>   My Lords, I would be the very last person to want to obstruct any administrative arrangements which were truly in the interests of the Armed Forces. I appreciate that by their insistent and somewhat unusual revelation that the Chiefs of Staff have accepted this comprehensive sale and, even more unusually, their approval of a Chiefs of Staff press conference on it, Ministers are claiming that these measures are exactly that. Indeed, I accept that the very real anxieties felt by families may be largely the result of a failure of communication and of consultation, which has been minimal, and that clearly this has to be put right.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para15"></a>But there are a couple of other points that I must raise. First, no one, by any stretch of imagination, can claim that this sale was devised with service families uppermost in mind. It was to be introduced primarily to satisfy the Treasury's urgent demand, for whatever reason, for &#163;1.5 billion or &#163;1.6 billion. It was from that starting point that Ministers have been pressed, by the Chiefs of Staff and others, to conjure up certain safeguards designed to see that service families will not be too disadvantaged and may even, with some initial improvements in standards, seem to benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para16"></a>In the short term I recognise that the policy may well be successful, particularly if the chain of command keeps a weather eye open to see that families are not exploited, although what the developers will say about apparent further restraints being imposed on them and how much it will encourage them to manipulate the estates at a later stage remains to be seen. It is about the longer term and the possibility of service families being squeezed into inferior and less appropriate accommodation through a combination of inevitably rising rents and the right of developers to offer alternative accommodation while developing selected estates for their own advantage that those closest to the problem still need to be reassured.
<P>


<a name="column_449"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 449</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para17"></a>I ask noble Lords to remember that these anxieties, some of them very strongly held, come on top of so much continuous upheaval over the last five to six years which has brought the Armed Forces, although well equipped, to a state of acute undermanning--a fate, I notice, that is not shared by the Conservative Benches today--and overstretched. There is a general feeling of alarm and uncertainty in many military communities. Indeed, there is a feeling among some families that they are being almost disenfranchised, husbands having been told, in no uncertain terms, that not only they but their families must do what they are told, lump it and stop bellyaching.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para18"></a>I know that it is Whitehall practice to consider major departmental assets as belonging to the Treasury, or the nation. But &#163;100 million over five years, about which so much play is being made as an indication of Treasury generosity, seems to me a measly rebate from the potential proceeds of this particular piece of asset stripping. Quite apart from the fact that if this amount was so badly needed to maintain the estate it should have been provided before--during this Government's lengthy responsibility for such conditions--much of it will be spent on bringing up to the developers satisfaction even those quarters which are surplus.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para19"></a>Set against the &#163;40 million or so spent yearly by the Defence Housing Executive, only recently established and praised to the skies in the last White Paper for excellent administration, the &#163;100 million does not constitute such a very big deal. And, of course, the money could easily have been provided by the executive selling off those quarters which truly are not needed. If a much larger rebate could have been negotiated by the Ministry of Defence with the Treasury, that really would have been a great boon to the hard pressed Armed Forces and indirectly to their families. It seems a good thing occasionally to remind the Treasury that it cannot always ride rough-shod over everyone.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-04_para20"></a>I am as concerned as anyone to see that surplus quarters are not left empty. I believe that the arrangements merit some continuing reflection and especially consultation, with particular emphasis--if morale is not to be affected--on the longer term when decent quarters may still be needed in specific areas and, who knows, perhaps in larger quantities than they are now. For that reason I am in full sympathy with the amendment of the noble Baroness which I know, and as every noble Lord in your Lordships' House must know, is put forward only with the most honourable and public spirited motives in mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Trefgarne: </B>   My Lords, I claim some qualification to speak because I was for three-and-a-half years the Minister responsible for looking after the married quarters estate in the Ministry of Defence. If my memory serves me right, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, was Chief of the Defence Staff at that time. I am sorry to have to tell my noble friend that we made a complete hash of it. At that time, at least, large numbers of married quarters stood empty. Large <P>


<a name="column_450"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 450</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>numbers of the empty ones, and, indeed, large numbers of those that were occupied were in a quite disgraceful state.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para0"></a>I remember visiting several RAF stations over which the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, was then presiding as commander in chief, I think, where the water was coming through the roof, the window frames were all rotten and the doors were falling out of their frames. I was ashamed to be the Minister responsible for such a scandalous situation. I did my very best to get it right but inevitably there was not enough money to do the job properly. I do not think therefore that I have any right to complain to the Government about a change in the policy that I presided over with such conspicuous lack of success.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para1"></a>I have to say to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, that the chiefs of staff were just as responsible as I for the policy at that time. I was told that the surplus married quarters could not be sold because they were needed, perhaps for some future deployment of troops yet to be decided upon. But the truth was also that many of the married quarters were unsaleable. All, for example, had the same heating system. No individual would buy a married quarter where the heating was part of some communal system. The electrical system, I believe, was common in many cases. Many quarters were, as I said, in a quite deplorable state. The best I could do was to call for the bulldozer at every possible opportunity and flatten them so that new ones could perhaps be built in due course.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para2"></a>Other surplus quarters that we wanted to sell were located in remote or distant spots. The RAF had many married quarters in distant parts of Scotland which naturally could not be sold in any numbers because not many people wanted to buy them. I therefore have no difficulty with the proposition that the married quarters should be transferred to the private sector. The result, I believe, will be better managed, better maintained married quarters--all very much in the interests of our servicemen and women.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para3"></a>The amendment we are considering seeks to interfere--quite respectably, but nonetheless interfere--with the executive actions of the Ministry of Defence and of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State. It is highly unusual--to put it no more strongly--to have amendments of the kind we see on the Order Paper today to a public Bill going through your Lordships' House. By her own confession, my noble friend, Lady Park, does not apparently intend to change the policy, simply to have my noble friend consult and bring forward a report to your Lordships in due course. That is not, in my view, the right subject for an amendment. If Ministers want to give assurances that they will do as my noble friend asks, that would be entirely proper. But it would be entirely inappropriate to include the proposed amendment on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para4"></a>I turn to some of the difficulties that have been advanced to support the amendment. I have heard much complaint, for example, that there is likely to be a Japanese owner of a number, if not all, of the married quarters to be disposed of. I do not know whether that is true or not. I am not sure it is particularly relevant. <P>


<a name="column_451"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 451</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Your Lordships may know that No. 1 Victoria Street, the headquarters of the Department of Trade and Industry is, believe it or not, owned by the Japanese and rented from them by the department. I happen to think that that is an advantage because I had the misfortune to serve in that building just before the Japanese acquired it and it was in a deplorable condition. I do not know whether any of your Lordships have visited the DTI at No. 1 Victoria Street recently, but it is a rather fine building now. It has been much refurbished at the cost, I believe, of the landlords.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para5"></a>Finally, I should like to deal with the principle--I address my remarks now to noble Lords on this side of the House--of moving such an amendment to upset a major piece of policy being advanced by the Ministry of Defence at a time when our political majority in the other place is so slim--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-05_spnew1"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Trefgarne: </B>   My Lords, I do not expect noble Lords opposite to be swayed by those arguments--they would no doubt find them appealing--but perhaps I may advise my noble friends that this is an important piece of government policy and I do not think that it would be right for a Conservative majority in this House, about which noble Lords opposite never cease to complain, to move in the way proposed by the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para6"></a>I very much regret that for the practical reasons that I have advanced, as well as for the political reasons to which I have alluded, I cannot support the amendment. I hope that my noble friend will not press it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_time0"></A><H5>4 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Chalfont: </B>   My Lords, I am somewhat surprised by the arguments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, who has suggested that in some way the amendment is improper. I shall return to that point later.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para7"></a>I rise to support very strongly the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth. Before doing so, I should declare, as I did in the House of Lords Register of Lords' Interests, that I am a consultant to a company which has put forward certain suggestions for the sale of the married quarters which it claims would benefit service personnel. In declaring that interest I must emphasise that that company would not benefit from any cancellation or postponement of the sale which might result from the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para8"></a>Perhaps I may begin by saying what, at least in my view, the amendment is not intended to do. It is not a wrecking amendment, as was implied by the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne. It is not designed to affect any other part of the Bill. It is certainly not intended as ammunition for any faction engaged in internal political manoeuvring. I have no wish to intrude upon private grief whether it is being suffered by the Government or by the Opposition. And I can give the House a categorical assurance that I am not seeking the leadership of the Right-wing of the Cross Benches.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para9"></a>Finally, it is not my intention in supporting this amendment to oppose the transfer of the married quarters estate to the private sector. I repeat that that is <P>


<a name="column_452"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 452</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not my intention. There are a number of very strong arguments for doing that. Indeed, the Government argue persuasively that the current plan for the sale is being negotiated on
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"terms which satisfy the interests of the Services and at a price which properly reflects the public interest". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para10"></a>It is therefore pertinent to ask, as I gather that some noble Lords are asking, what exactly is the intention of the amendment. My position in supporting it derives from my conviction--unfortunately, now shared by fewer and fewer people--that the Armed Forces are a very special part of our society, that they deserve special treatment, and that it is not always possible to base our attitude to their welfare and conditions on arguments which are valid for the rest of society.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para11"></a>The first point to be made is that there is a widespread feeling that the project for the sale, as put forward by the Ministry of Defence, has not been thoroughly thought through, especially with regard to the long-term implications. Noble Lords who have had the time and the good sense to read The Times this morning will have noticed a powerful argument examining some of the long-term implications and pointing out some of the dangers, not only for the Armed Forces, but for the national economy, of pursuing the sale. It can be argued--it is rightly being argued--that there are legal, financial and operational aspects of the deal which are open to question and which, in my opinion, need closer examination. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Park, I am content to leave these aspects of the problem to other noble Lords who are more qualified than I am to speak on legal and financial matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para12"></a>My own main concern about the project is that there appears to have been inadequate consultation, if any, with those most closely affected--namely; those who occupy the married quarters which are now to be sold into private ownership. There is widespread evidence from a number of sources, including the Royal British Legion and the Federation of Army Wives among others, that servicemen and women and their families are worried about the long-term effects of this sale on the security of tenure of their homes. I repeat the word "worried". If you have worried soldiers and worried families, you have a danger at the heart of the Army. I can confirm that to be so from my own contacts in the Armed Forces, and especially in the Army in which I had the pleasure and the honour to serve for so many years.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para13"></a>In that context, I have a feeling--I do not make this criticism in any polemical way--that the Ministry of Defence has paid insufficient attention to one of the less tangible but nevertheless very important aspects of the problem. As anyone who has served in any of the Armed Forces knows, the married quarters of a military unit are an integral and important part of the structured military system in which soldiers and their families are accustomed to live. Apart from the general social importance of close proximity between servicemen and their families when they are serving at home, the existence of the "patch", as it is called--we are all getting used to that expression for the married quarters estate adjoining a barracks--reassures the serviceman that when he is serving at home his family is nearby and <P>


<a name="column_453"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 453</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>well looked after, but, more importantly, when he is away on active service he knows that his wife and family are secure within the structured military system. That is at the root of one of the most important aspects of morale in the Armed Forces. There is a very real feeling that the current plan for the sale will erode that system. I repeat the phrase, "There is a very real feeling" because that is what I mean and that is what lies at the heart of my concern.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para14"></a>It may well be that those concerns are misplaced, but that is not the point; they exist and they are having a significant effect upon morale at a time when the Armed Forces need, and have indeed been promised by the Government, a period of security and stability after the turbulence and uncertainty caused by the defence reviews such as Options for Change and Frontline First.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para15"></a>The public intervention in this matter of the Chiefs of Staff has already been referred to by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall. If the Ministry of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff claim that they have engaged in a process of consultation, I can only observe that it has not been very successful because the proposal is still causing real concern to servicemen and their families.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para16"></a>I concede that Ministers and service chiefs have displayed great courtesy and patience in trying to explain the deal to me, to some of my colleagues and to others. They have converted many people to their view--they have gone some way towards converting me to their view--but they have apparently not convinced the people who really matter, those who are most directly concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para17"></a>As I commented at the beginning of my remarks, I have no quarrel in principle with the proposal to privatise the married quarters estate. In principle it sounds a good idea, but there must be ways of doing it which would allay some of the concerns of those who live in quarters which are to be sold. As the noble Baroness, Lady Park, said, the important point is that before a change in military policy as important as this is implemented, those most directly involved should be fully and effectively consulted, and the result of that consultation should be the subject of debate in Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para18"></a>This is where I return to my quarrel with the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne. The amendment seeks a period of reflection over what is not an executive decision of minor importance. It is not a piece of housekeeping for the Ministry of Defence to deal with in an executive way; it is an important change of military policy and to military culture in this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para19"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, has complained that this matter should not be the subject of an amendment to the Housing Bill. Very well. There is no need for an amendment of the Housing Bill. If the Government undertake to engage in the process of consultation and place the results of that consultation before Parliament the reasons for this amendment will fall away. I have no doubt that the noble Baroness, Lady Park, will be strongly in favour of withdrawing it.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para20"></a>Finally, it has been suggested that to embark on a consultation process of this kind will, in some mysterious way, undermine the Army's normal chain of command. I have discussed this matter with some of my noble and gallant friends in this House. Speaking as someone who has experience in these matters, I find that an extraordinary claim. All that is required is that the problem should be passed down the chain of command to commanding officers. All that commanding officers are required to do--as I was required to do on many occasions when I was in the Army--is to speak to their officers and men. Whatever else has changed in the Army, I hope that that has not changed. All they need do is to report the views of soldiers and their families upwards through the normal chain of command. Far from undermining or circumventing the normal chain of command, it seems to me that a consultation process of this kind can be carried out in the Armed Forces more quickly and effectively than in any other part of our society--because of the chain of command.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para21"></a>Before I sit down, I should like to refer to an unworthy suspicion that has been hovering in the minds of some of us and is openly expressed in the current issue of the Economist. This matter has been referred to by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall. I should like to quote a few sentences:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Should the Government be forced to withdraw the privatisation, Mr. Portillo would be hard pushed to stop the Treasury deducting the missing money from his budget. That would mean cancelling programmes for new weapons--which is why the generals, unlike the men and women they command, want the privatisation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para22"></a>I ask the Minister in his reply to tell the House whether there is any substance in that. Is it true that if the married quarters estate were not privatised the Treasury would demand corresponding cuts in the equipment programmes of the Ministry of Defence? I believe that we are entitled to a plain answer to that question. If it is true, it is perhaps not surprising that the Chiefs of Staff--men who I know have the national interest very much at heart--support the sale of the married quarters rather than contemplate cuts elsewhere in their equipment budgets. If this is so, it is a curious approach to what must be the first duty of any government--the effective deployment of resources for national security or (as it used to be referred to in the good old days) the defence of the realm.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para23"></a>I hope that the Government will agree to a period of reflection, reconsideration and consultation and bring the results back to Parliament. I can think of no argument against a brief delay in this sale which is not totally outweighed by the need to ensure not only that it is the best deal that can be achieved in the public interest but, more importantly, that it is fully understood and accepted throughout the Armed Forces.

I remind the Government of Napoleon's dictum that morale is to the material as three is to one. It seems to me that in this matter it is only the bottom line that counts, whatever the Treasury may feel is <P>


<a name="column_455"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 455</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>necessary in the way of money. The Conservative Party appears to have forgotten the importance of other considerations which in the past it always upheld. I very much regret that one of the great parties in the country has disregarded the considerations advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont. That is not worthy of it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para24"></a>I confess that I have received very few representations. I have made one or two inquiries. As I entered the Chamber I was informed by one noble Lord, who often speaks for the Army, that on the whole he believed the system and safeguards would work, although he was not ready to commit himself on some of the broader considerations. That may well be true, but that is not the whole of this argument. We are not concerned solely with what safeguards can be introduced in order to satisfy service wives and their men. We are also concerned with what the Government are destroying by failing to carry the Armed Forces with them before they do it. It is not sufficient to carry the Chiefs of Staff. I have had some dealings with Chiefs of Staff. I have at all times and in all circumstances respected them very much, but I know the pressures under which they are placed by Ministers of Defence, past or present. The Chiefs of Staff have the very difficult task of weighing in the balance the needs of and consequences for their forces and their loyalty to the government of the day, which they have to express in some way. They face a dilemma which has existed under both Labour governments and the present Government. I venture the opinion--without any evidence, and I am open to challenge at all times--that if the Chiefs of Staff were asked, free of any other constraints, whether they preferred this system to the old one the answer would be that they would prefer to continue as they are.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-05_para25"></a>Finally, I should like to deal with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne. My only difference with the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, relates to his statement that we must not be polemical about this. Why on earth not? I listened to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, with the utmost incredulity. It appeared to me that the Government's defence amounted to the following. In the 1980s the Government preferred to cut taxes rather than look after the living conditions of the Armed Forces. They preferred to win a general election, even if it meant that water poured through the roofs and ceilings of homes in which service personnel were living. His second defence of the Government was that they found it quite impossible to look after their own estate, that when the noble Lord was a Minister the office in which he worked was a disgrace and it was far better that the Japanese should handle it. If that is the defence of the Government, the sooner they are ejected neck and crop the better.

<A NAME="60711-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Cox: </B>   My Lords, I rise to endorse this amendment with reluctance. It gives me no pleasure to withhold support from the Government on this very important issue. However, I cannot in all conscience refrain from commending my noble friend Lady Park and other noble Lords who have put this issue before the House. Nor can I desist from strongly supporting the case that they have made. I particularly highlight the effects of the Government's proposals on the morale of servicemen's families. I regret not having spoken at previous stages of the Bill. I have been absent for unavoidable reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-06_para0"></a>The Government claim to be one that affirms family values and promotes policies which support family life. The proposals under discussion have caused profound anxiety and dismay to the families of many servicemen. The life of these families is never easy. They are prepared to make many sacrifices out of loyalty and a commitment to the demands of service life. However, the spectre now looming before them brings new fears as well as anger at the lack of consultation. Servicemen and women have votes but not a voice. Equally, their families are deprived of a voice to express their needs and concerns. However, some wives have voiced their concerns, inevitably anonymously. I should like to quote two of them briefly because they speak with the authority of first-hand knowledge and the authenticity of personal experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-06_para1"></a>I quote the first service wife:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If the terms of the proposed sale are so good, so favourable to the Armed Services, why is the MoD not telling us what they are? Why indeed? I suspect the reason is because the terms favour the government and those who have approved the deal will not be those who suffer its long-term effects. Those whose lives will undoubtedly be disrupted have simply not been consulted. I think this is wrong. Our Armed Services are the envy of the world: dedicated, loyal and hardworking. Their wives also make sacrifices: at least once every two years they must make a new home, find new friends, new schools, doctors and dentists for their children. They must also face the enhanced possibility of early widowhood. They will certainly have long periods of single parenthood. All these sacrifices they make willingly as part of being a serviceman's wife. But it is now, when they feel their homes may be threatened, together with the mutual support systems of their communities, that they are beginning to wonder whether the sacrifice is actually worthwhile and whether this is not a betrayal too far by a government which has already so drastically reduced manpower within the Army that there simply are not enough soldiers left to fulfil all the responsibilities required of them". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-06_para2"></a>I quote briefly a second service wife:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I feel the loyalty of the services is being exploited. If our married quarters were to become subject to sale I can see my husband being torn between his family and his service to the country. He might face the prospect of a sale of property taking his family away, tearing the family apart". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-06_para3"></a>It may be that such fears are unwarranted and groundless, as the noble and gallant Lord has indicated. It may be that the Government's proposals will work for the benefit of servicemen, women and their families. But perhaps I may ask my noble friend the Minister, why such fears have been allowed to become so widespread? What consultation has there been with all those concerned? What information has been made available concerning the details of the impact of these proposals on wives and families? Why do so many feel like this wife, who claims:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We, the wives, also contribute to this country's security and yet we have been treated with contempt and our legitimate worries dismissed as 'scaremongering'."? <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "60711-06_para4"></a>Wives have been treated with contempt. I understand that members of the MoD housing panel were not given details of the proposals concerning the sale of homes because they were "commercially confidential" matters. Subsequently they were accused of incomprehensible obduracy. Will my noble friend the Minister give an undertaking that all the facts will be made available and that full consultation will be ensured on the basis of those facts?
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-06_para5"></a>Finally, before I sit down, perhaps I may point out that such concerns may have wider repercussions. For example, if families fear that the proposed developments will lead to even more moves, or to moving families away from husbands and fathers so that family life becomes even more disrupted, morale will be damaged. Such fears may also encourage families to take out mortgages to buy their own homes in order to provide at least some stability. But that will be at the cost of even more separation from the husband and father of the family, and may lead to more stressful and broken marriages. Also, morale may be so damaged that retention of servicemen may be adversely affected and that in turn will affect recruitment and the defence of the realm.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-06_para6"></a>It cannot be said too often that this country has Armed Forces of which we should be proud and to which we should be grateful. I am deeply saddened to learn of these developments which have caused such hurt and anxiety to servicemen and women and their families. They deserve better treatment than this, especially from a Government who purport to place defence and family life high among their priorities. I hope very much that my noble friend the Minister will be able to promise the thorough and wide-ranging consultation needed to gain the confidence of all those who will be affected by proposals which have already caused such widespread anxiety, hurt and dismay.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-06_para7"></a>Unless my noble friend the Minister can convince my noble friend Lady Park on this matter, I hope that your Lordships will support the amendment standing in her name. If he can give those undertakings he will be doing a service to the Armed Forces and their families, to whom we and the country owe so much and who deserve all the support which we can give them.

As others of your Lordships who were there will be aware, it was a very moving service.

So we are here.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-06_para8"></a>I deeply honour and respect my noble friend the Minister and I am Conservative through and through--to my backbone and beyond. But I cannot help feeling that the whole of this proposition is paved with good intentions like the way to Hell!

<A NAME = "60711-06_para9"></a>My parents once had a milk round. When they were hit by financial necessity, as everyone is from time to time, they sold it to someone else. Of course, there were bits of the milk round which were very profitable (such as delivering in the villages) but there were also bits which were not (such as delivering milk to the outlying farms and cottages in the hills). When my parents sold the milk round they extracted guarantees from the buyers that they would still supply milk to those from whom they made a loss. As soon as the sale was completed the guarantees were dropped and the service was stopped. Guarantees have a strange way of vanishing.

<A NAME="60711-06_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Mountgarret: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the proposals announced on 28th November have a great deal of merit. I am also sure that those who believe otherwise have a strong argument, too, not least the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall. He is in the fortunate position of being able to speak from personal and present circumstances with freedom, unlike some of his colleagues who, as the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, rightly pointed out, have difficulty in reconciling their positions as politicians and servicemen.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-06_para11"></a>I am concerned not so much with the merits of the case because I frankly admit that I am not qualified to comment upon them. I do not have the necessary experience. However, I am concerned about the constitutional position. I expect that I shall be corrected, but I do not remember during the 30 years in which I have had the privilege of being a Member of your Lordships' House more than one occasion on which extra strong government requests for assistance have been made in respect of a matter which has never been considered by the elected Chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-06_para12"></a>Only a week ago we debated firmly and interestingly the constitutional position of your Lordships' House. Quite rightly, more than one speaker defended the position of the hereditary peerage and the contribution that it can make to your Lordships' House and to the country as a whole. However, there were those--and if Hansard is read your Lordships will see that I was one--who regretted the position whereby it is possible for a Conservative Government to call on the unqualified support of many Members of this House who for very good reasons, I am sure, are often absent from our debates. Therefore, one questions whether or not a privilege is being abused. That is a matter which gives me great concern and I should like to see it reformed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-06_para13"></a>That is the constitutional matter and perhaps I may now return to the matter before us. I believe that it is wrong for the Government to ask your Lordships' House to take a decision which would deny another place from considering this most important and, I can understand, contentious matter. I ask your Lordships to consider <P>


<a name="column_459"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>what would happen if we rejected the noble Baroness's amendment. The provisions announced and proposed by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State would presumably go through, and the other place would not have another opportunity practically to do anything about it. Let us suppose that difficulties were encountered and families were put in invidious positions or were upset. I sincerely hope that that would not happen but I do not have a crystal ball. The might and fury of those families and the Ministry of Defence would be directed at your Lordships' House, not at another place. We would be seen as the unelected Chamber that pontificated upon and directed the plight of the service families.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-06_para14"></a>This is the wrong position for your Lordships' House to be in. I believe that the correct course is to give another place the opportunity of considering, by way of consideration of Lords' amendments, the proposal of my noble friend. If there is agreement in another place with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State's proposals, then, when the matter again comes before your Lordships' House and there seems to be a considerable amount of public concern--opinions in the tabloid press, and so on--it will be right and proper for the Government at that time to encourage maximum support. In that way we ensure that government business goes ahead; we are not frustrating it unreasonably.
<P>

What is really important is to check the Executive when the Executive does mind. When we fail to do that, it is quoted against us--not by me, I hasten to say--as a reason for arguing that we do not earn our keep.

<A NAME="60711-07_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, during the Committee stage of the Bill the noble Earl the Minister said that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"legitimate concerns seem to have been overlaid with some fundamental misapprehensions."--[Official Report, 25/6/96; col. 898.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
He is quite right. I admit that I was labouring under a fundamental misapprehension and had not quite grasped what was going on. I thought that the management of the married quarters estate, the MQE, was being put into the hands of a trust or a defence agency. That should have brought in private sector expertise instead of civil service managers with only a short term involvement <P>


<a name="column_460"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 460</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and little experience. I naively thought that we were at the stage where the management of the MQE was moving into the private sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para0"></a>Unfortunately, I was not aware of the events which occurred last year while I was working overseas. Apparently, the scheme collapsed for various reasons, among them the fact that the MoD felt unable to relinquish the freeholds. Since the Committee stage the penny has dropped for me. I have now realised what it is all about: pound notes or, rather, coins, and quite a lot of them; in fact, &#163;1.2 billion worth.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para1"></a>My difficulties are threefold. First, the Government want to conduct a sale and leaseback of a very long term asset, the married quarters estate. I suggest that it is an unwise course of action as it will create problems for the future in order to make a short term gain. Will the noble Earl the Minister say what the difference is between the sale and leaseback of the married quarters estate and the sale and leaseback of the MoD main building, for example? Where does all this sale and leaseback business stop?
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para2"></a>The main building would be much more attractive to a developer or a financier as there would be less risk and it would not be so complicated a matter to administer. There is no question of the requirement not continuing for government buildings near Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para3"></a>My second difficulty is that the proposal will do precisely nothing to improve the management of the estate. In fact, the Minister for Defence Procurement in another place wrote, in The Times, I think:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Any change in housing arrangements is bound to cause concern, but service interests are being fully protected throughout the transaction. I could almost say that individual occupants will not notice any difference." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
In other words, the management of the estate will remain exactly the same. The Minister for Defence Procurement then described how the &#163;100 million would enable the estate to be brought up to scratch. I will address that point in a moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para4"></a>The Defence Housing Executive will still be the old MoD weighted down and hampered by archaic procurement and management procedures. The Minister also said that despite all this money it would still take five to seven years to get the married quarters estate up to the required standard. The Government have always extolled the virtues of private management, and I strongly support that policy. But the proposed arrangement will not introduce any private management or maintenance of the married quarters estate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para5"></a>The figure of &#163;100 million sounds an awful lot of money but it is allocated over five years and spread over possibly 40,000 houses. That works out at an average of just &#163;500 per house. I am sure that the noble Earl the Minister will point out that it is additional money. Even so, it is not a lot of additional money.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para6"></a>My final difficulty centres on the economics of the sale and leaseback. I am not an expert on high finance nor have I read the article in The Times today, but when the figures are analysed they do not look very attractive. If I make a ghastly error I shall be grateful if noble Lords point it out. I have made no attempt to discount the net present values. Of the 60,000 houses making up <P>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 461</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the married quarters estate a maximum of 12,000 may not be required. If the MoD sells the married quarters estate for &#163;1.24 billion, and the average value of the surplus houses is taken as &#163;20,000 each, the MoD will still be renting houses with a value of about &#163;1 billion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para7"></a>Financial institutions do not give out rather large cheques without charging interest and obtaining a return on their investments. If we consider an exceedingly modest rate of return of 8 per cent., the MoD will still have to pay &#163;50 million per annum or &#163;250 million over the first five years of the scheme. However, we must not forget that the MoD will still receive &#163;100 million over the same five years in order to upgrade the estate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para8"></a>There is one financial merit for the Government. They will effectively be able to borrow more than &#163;1 billion without it appearing on the public sector borrowing requirement. But there is real scope for leasing wasting assets such as vehicles and plant and the MoD already does so to an extent. That avoids tying up large amounts of capital. Fortunately, I have no intention of wearying your Lordships with that point as I intend to deal with it during tomorrow's debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para9"></a>It is not good enough to oppose a policy which is designed to address well understood problems without suggesting an alternative policy. My guess is that the rent paid by the services goes direct to our dear friends at the Treasury. If the rental income was paid directly to a defence housing agency, it would probably have an income of at least &#163;48 million per annum. On top of that, it would be able to sell redundant properties so that in fact it could quite likely remit funds back to the Treasury after having made satisfactory progress against agreed targets for upgrading the estate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para10"></a>If the MoD police force can become a defence agency--and I have misgivings about that--why can we not have a defence housing agency? The Minister may quote legal difficulties but this Bill provides him with an ideal vehicle for making any changes required. I urge your Lordships to support the amendment and to allow the other place to have another look at the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-07_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hogg: </B>   My Lords, I should like to start by craving your Lordships' indulgence because this is the first time that I have spoken at this stage of a Bill and I apologise in advance for any failures of etiquette which I may commit. I wish to apologise immediately for not being here at the start of the debate, owing to traffic.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para11"></a>Nevertheless, I have the courage to rise because in the four years that I spent in Whitehall, I watched officials and Ministers wrestling with, and failing to come to a resolution on, this particular problem. They started from the premise, as we all do, that the present situation is not at all satisfactory. It contains insufficient incentives to proper, good management of the housing stock, leading to an excessive carriage on the estate of empty properties, which is not only economically inefficient but unpleasant for those living in the area.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para12"></a>Moreover, service housing is inevitably squeezed to a low position on the list of priorities for defence spending when the Ministry of Defence comes to review its <P>


<a name="column_462"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 462</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>priorities in its annual battle with the Treasury; and I saw that happen time and time again. The inevitable result has been under-investment in the housing for service families, as anyone who visits such housing will have seen. It is not in the interests of service families to fall behind the improvement in the standard of housing in this country which we have seen in the past 25 years. Therefore, I urge your Lordships to support the Secretary of State because he is to be congratulated on arriving at a resolution and putting forward a proposal for dealing with this very difficult problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para13"></a>It is a complicated scheme. Of course, that enables a number of your Lordships to quarrel with particular elements within it. However, one of the reasons that it is complicated is precisely to provide extra reassurance to service families who are inevitably concerned to follow through all the possible implications of the change.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para14"></a>As I say, I believe that the Secretary of State is to be congratulated on arriving at a resolution and securing from the Treasury a sum of money for the improvement of service housing. I say with the very greatest respect--I use that phrase with more genuine honesty than I have often heard it used in your Lordships' House--to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, that if one really considers that securing &#163;100 million from the Treasury is small beer, one might just possibly reinforce some of the Treasury's opposite prejudices about the attitudes of the Ministry of Defence to money. Therefore, I hope to persuade at least some of your Lordships to support the Secretary of State and this scheme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, my name is to the amendment and therefore I shall speak in its favour. I shall declare an interest, as I did in Committee. Two of my daughters are married to serving officers and one is a serving officer herself. They occupy MoD service property. But I have no interest of my own.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para15"></a>As I understand it, the position is that the MoD will continue to be responsible for the maintenance of the properties and their upgrading. It will not be undertaken by the purchaser of the estate. Therefore, the position in relation to maintenance and upgrading will basically remain the same and in the same hands.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para16"></a>This is a matter which concerns the quality of that maintenance and upgrading and the quality of the management. I know that the Defence Housing Executive has been set up recently but I believe that it involves the same people who were dealing with those matters before. It is a case of more change, staying in the same place.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para17"></a>I understand that the MoD will rent the property from the purchaser at open market rents. I do not know whether or not the figures in The Times today which are suggested for the years ahead are accurate. None of us has any way of knowing that. But as sure as eggs are eggs, the rent will rise.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para18"></a>The amount paid for their quarters is determined by the Armed Forces Pay Review body. That will probably be below market rents. Therefore, if there is no improved management, there will be a gap that the MoD <P>


<a name="column_463"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 463</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will have to continue to fund. It may be that it will have to fund an increasing amount as the years go by from the beginning of a rent review to the next rent review in five years' time. That is not unusual.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para19"></a>I should like to take up one point made by my noble friend Lord Trefgarne. He said that no one buys properties with communal heating systems. I am afraid that that is not correct. Properties have been sold on the open market which have communal heating systems and other communal facilities also. Any decent solicitor should be able to draw up a workable agreement by which all the purchasers can abide.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para20"></a>What concerns me is that the purchaser of the estate will have the right to take back on notice to the Ministry of Defence pieces of the estate that he would like to develop or redevelop. When taking advice on that, he will hire experts from the property market. Why let the purchaser do that? Why does not the MoD hire exactly the same experts and make a profit for the MoD and for the country? If you have an opportunity to make money on your property, why do you give that away at a lower figure to someone else who will not pay you funds which will leave them out of pocket at the end of the day? They will not give everyone a Christmas present. They are in it for purely commercial reasons and will wish to make a profit. The bigger the profit the better. Not all sites will be ripe for redevelopment now. Some may be suitable in two years, five years or 20 years. But the MoD will have lost the opportunity.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para21"></a>Along with the agreement for sale, which is normally very simple, I understand that there will be side agreements designed for the protection of the services. But I have not heard anything which prevents the original purchaser selling on the estate as a whole or parts of that estate. It is at that stage that the side agreements get left behind and the services are without protection. I say that because the MoD would not be party to the agreement of that sell-on and, therefore, would not be able to play a part.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para22"></a>In Committee, my noble friend Lord Howe was asked a question about the time when the lease comes to an end; namely, would the services, if they needed the property at that stage, be able to keep it on? He said yes, and that he was relying on the Landlord and Tenant Act. I am not a lawyer but, as I understand it, that Act gives residential occupiers of tenanted property the right to extend their lease. The MoD will not be the residential occupier in such circumstances; the servicemen are the residential occupiers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-07_para23"></a>Moreover, in commercial property the Landlord and Tenant Act gives tenants the right to extend their lease when it comes to an end. But, again, the MoD is not a commercial tenant in the meaning of the Act as I understand it. I feel that we should send this to the Commons and let them have a look at it again.

<A NAME="60711-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hogg, about complications as regards the difficult history of the matter are not points of which I should like to make light. However, I suggest to your Lordships that it is those very <P>


<a name="column_464"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 464</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>complications--the history and the problems over such a period--that make it all the more important fully to consult and reassure the families who will be affected.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para0"></a>Much could be made of the MoD's failure to use empty properties in areas of housing stress; of its appalling failure to manage and maintain the properties which have quite extraordinarily been turned into an argument for the scheme, on the basis that the private sector can do better than the public sector; and of its failure to construct a strategy and stick to it over a period. However, the amendment is not about that. I have no wish to look for political differences: this is not a party political matter. Those noble Lords who know me will know that that is something which I rarely say.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para1"></a>I found the description of the noble Baroness, Lady Park, regarding the human aspects involved both today and in Committee to be very moving. Her description of the strains on service families struck a real chord; so, too, did her description of the management reasons for ensuring that the families support the proposals and that they are not left with feelings of confusion, of apprehension, of low morale and, possibly, even of betrayal.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para2"></a>In other housing sectors the Government make much of tenant involvement, and rightly so. Indeed, last night when this Chamber was somewhat emptier than it is now, we debated the role of tenants in decisions about the management of their own housing. We were told that amendments which were put forward from these Benches and from the Labour Benches to strengthen the position of tenants were unnecessary because they were involved throughout the process.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para3"></a>In Committee, when the amendment of the noble Baroness was debated, the Minister said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have already consulted and communicated extensively". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
He told the House that the Secretary of State for Defence wrote,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to the occupants of all married quarters in England and Wales to explain the position last autumn"; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
and, indeed, that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A parallel communication went to all personnel worldwide".--[Official Report, 25/6/96; col. 899.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is not consultation; consultation is a two-way process. If the benefits to the families are such as we are told as regards better conditions, and so on, what do the Government have to fear from consultation?
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para4"></a>In modern jargon: those who are affected should own the decision. This seems to be more a case of disowning. We on these Benches are most grateful to the noble Baroness for so cogently and energetically putting her case in the early hours of the morning in Committee and, again, this afternoon. We warmly support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clifford of Chudleigh: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for repeating what she said in Committee as regards the amendment that she moved this afternoon. I am also grateful to the other speakers who have taken part in the debate--for <P>


<a name="column_465"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 465</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>example, the noble and gallant Lord on these Benches and, indeed, many others who I believe support the noble Baroness.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para5"></a>As a result of the two or three schemes drafted to confront and best manage the recognised presence of empty and void married quarters, the MoD established the Defence Housing Executive about which noble Lords have already heard. Indeed, I shall be repeating various points and I hope that your Lordships will excuse me for doing so. That executive was given three years to fulfill its role, to dispose of the excess, costly and empty assets.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para6"></a>Before any move is made by Parliament in line with this Housing Bill, the Defence Housing Executive should be given time to act as managers of the housing stock. It should be allowed to present a "Plan of Operation Table" and give estimates for sales and the purchases of quarters. It should be allowed to carry out a policy of selective rationalisation, choosing the areas to be retained and those to be sold. If areas were to be sold, they should be complete estates--and noble Lords have heard this argued before--or patches, and sold with vacant possession.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para7"></a>The evicted servicemen--and I emphasise the word "evicted"--and their families should be helped financially to move into a new patch--quarters--selected by the Defence Housing Executive. In the same way, certain areas may be chosen by the executive or the MoD which would be available for redevelopment and sold. The proceeds should be used to improve the remaining stock of houses, to put the quarters in good order and a reserve fund set up to be available to purchase new houses if required in the future. If there were such a fund, the number of houses kept in reserve, vacant and void could be reduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para8"></a>Sadly, the life of this recently spawned housing executive is likely to be short; indeed, even shorter than the three years. Does the Minister honestly believe that the executive will enjoy the same remit that it now possesses when a private company, a merchant bank, steers the married quarters ship? I fear that we are in danger of putting financial interests before families.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para9"></a>It is recognised that there are 12,000 married quarters which are vacant or void at present. Of that number, 4,000 void quarters are reserved by the MoD for reasons such as: families posted abroad; unaccompanied tours where the wife and children may prefer, may select, to "live with mother" or a relation. It is clear that there are 5,000 to 6,000 properties that are available for sale; ready for grabs on the open market. That would leave a balance of about 2,000, some of which belong to the Royal Air Force, some of which are undergoing repair, restoration and redecoration; and, indeed, some of which are classified as "handover/takeover quarters" or related to short six-month tours.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para10"></a>Two to three years ago the MoD was encouraged by the Government to give this "married quarters streamlining scheme" a fair wind. The Chief Executive of the Cardiff Housing Trust was given the responsibility of showing how the streamlining could be done. He produced his report in 11 months. But it did <P>


<a name="column_466"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 466</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not meet the Treasury criteria. That chief executive was given a &#163;200,000 golden handshake for the efforts that he expended over that time. I wonder, would the Minister care to tell the House how much a warrant officer with 22 years' experience, some on operational duty, would be rewarded with after that length of service. Would it be &#163;25,000?
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para11"></a>The Bett Report was compiled under the direction of a personnel manager qualified in business--but not in war and not in the arena of counter terrorism, not a man experienced in the beneficial counselling and consolation delivered and witnessed in the married patch (the quarters) when a sailor, soldier or airman is wounded. The Bett Report is questionable. Mr. Bett's report is not one to be dismissed, but it certainly raised many an eyebrow in the married quarters when it suggested that outside professional counsellors, psychologists, might provide a better shoulder to lean on and to cry on--a logical replacement for the in-house friends next door in the married quarters.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para12"></a>The report raised the matter of stress. Many a serviceman's wife has dismissed the professional help from outside, content to depend on those who "know the form" and who have perhaps been in a situation where their husbands have been injured on duty. These servicemen's wives stick together and help the children in the affected families.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para13"></a>I think that I speak for many of the past as well as the present servicemen and their families when I say that they are "jarred off"--perhaps "fed up" is more politically correct--with politicians, psychologists and psychiatrists nannying them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para14"></a>People in this Palace of Westminster need to respect the system, well tried over many decades, of family management, man management, in the Armed Forces--tried, tested and, above all, trusted. We need to listen to what the servicemen are saying. They say, "You can post us abroad, let us say to Bosnia, or post us at home, let us say to Northern Ireland, and we will do the job that you ask of us. You, the politicians, don't interfere with us when we execute our duties, suffer death, incur casualties. We are trained to handle these situations when in the front line or on the patch, in the married quarters." They say, "Sir, we don't interfere when you suffer political casualties or lose by-elections or general elections."
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para15"></a>This short-notice attack by the Government on the essential self-help structure of the married quarters deserves to be sunk without a lifeboat, all hands lost.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para16"></a>I, too, speak to the same group of amendments as the noble Baroness, Lady Park. Those of your Lordships who attended the Committee stage rather late at night may be aware that I did not put my name to the noble Baroness's amendment. I do so now with a certain amount of reluctance because my view is that the Government should scrap the scheme altogether. However, as I said, the poet Hesiod was right: and half a loaf is better than no loaf at all, so I have put my name to the noble Baroness's amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para17"></a>I accept all the apologies that the noble Earl in Committee and now the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, made about the MoD management of the married quarters estate. It has been a disaster. Ministers have to accept that it has been a disaster. It is not the responsibility of civil servants. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, shakes her head, but I am afraid that the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, admitted that he had been deficient in his responsibilities as a Minister in managing the married quarters estate. I cannot disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne; who am I to do that?
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para18"></a>I hope that your Lordships listened carefully to what the noble Baroness, Lady Park, had to say, although I understand that there have been certain diversions in another part of this House between four and five o'clock this afternoon. I hope also that your Lordships have listened very carefully--I know the noble Baroness, Lady Hogg, does not listen very carefully--to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall. I have listened to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, for 40 years. Forty years ago I was a subaltern in "A" Company of the First Battalion, 60th Rifles, the Company Commander of which was Major Bramall. I have listened to the noble and gallant Lord expressing great wisdom ever since.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para19"></a>When I was, I accept, a rather unruly subaltern in that battalion, the noble and gallant Lord taught me two very important things. He said: "The first thing you have to remember, as a humble platoon commander, is that the important part of your command is the morale of your riflemen. The second thing is that your riflemen will never have good morale unless their families are happy." I had to go through many rather painful experiences with some of the riflemen under my command who were unhappy about their families for one reason or another, good or bad. Nevertheless, the noble and gallant Lord, Major Bramall, persuaded me that that was the right thing to do and I think he was right.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para20"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that this was not at the outset a major party political issue. It did not start as a major party political issue; it started, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hogg, pointed out, as an important policy initiative, announced as a Written Answer in the House of Commons in November 1995. I imagine that when the Minister comes to reply he will explain why it was put in that form and not put in a proper Statement to both Houses of Parliament.
<P>


<a name="column_468"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 468</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para21"></a>There is no doubt that the measure is unpopular. It is unpopular with Army wives, Air Force wives and others. Indeed, I have a letter in front of me from one of the consortia who are bidding for this married quarters estate saying:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The reaction to this privatisation from within the Armed Forces has unfortunately generally been hostile." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Nobody could express a greater truth than that, and that comes from one of the bidders.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para22"></a>I have also had many letters, as I am sure your Lordships have, from those who have been connected with the Armed Forces in one way or another. Most touching to me was a letter from a former member of the staff of your Lordships' House who had been a quartermaster in the 2nd Battalion, Coldstream Guards, during a company tour in Northern Ireland. He expressed in very moving terms how it was most important to have the married quarters estate blended in with the serving people, not only in Northern Ireland but elsewhere. I am slightly fastidious on the matter and will not mention the name of the former member of your Lordships' staff, but I know that if I were to do so noble Lords would appreciate the service that he has rendered to this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para23"></a>I said that I agreed with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that at the outset this was not a party political issue. However, it has been elevated to a party political issue--witness the number of noble Lords opposite who have come to listen, attentively I hope, to this debate. Indeed, the Conservative Whip for the week of 4th July 1996, a distinguished document--apart from certain blotches on the heavy lines--from the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Amendments have been tabled. Your attendance is essential unless for reasons of ill health." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I am so glad to see that the noble Lords opposite are in the best of health for a Division which is of the utmost importance to Her Majesty's Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para24"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Mountgarret, raised this point. Is this really of the utmost importance to Her Majesty's Government? I wish to make three comments. First, it is a modest amendment. The noble Baroness is not trying to shake the earth. All that the amendment demands is a period of consultation with the people who are really affected; that that consultation should be produced to your Lordships and another place; and an order produced which we can then debate. I cannot think that if the amendment is passed it will bring down the Government. It is not a matter of confidence in the Government as the Whip seems to claim.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para25"></a>My second point is that the Armed Forces are not the property of the Government. The Armed Forces are the Armed Forces of the Crown. They are not the property of any government be it Conservative, Liberal, Labour or any other party. We are here to defend the Armed Forces of the Crown, and any government which seeks to lay claim to be proprietor of the Armed Forces of the Crown is, I believe, constitutionally at fault.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para26"></a>My third comment picks up a remark made by my noble friend Lord Callaghan of Cardiff. I confess to your Lordships that I was brought up to believe in my <P>


<a name="column_469"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 469</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>innocent youth that the Conservative Party had the reputation of being the patriotic party. I was told that by my uncle. My uncle, my mother's brother, was a battalion commander in the Coldstream Guards. He led the battalion in the retreat at Dunkirk. He was awarded the DSO for his gallantry and honour in doing so. He always brought me up to think that the Conservative Party was the party that would defend the Armed Forces. He was one of the last to get on the boats at Dunkirk. When he arrived at Dover he finally got to a telephone. As your Lordships will understand, in those days telephones were not easy to find. He rang my grandmother, his mother, and said, "Mother, it's all right, I'm back". My grandmother, I must admit, was not in full possession of all her faculties at the time and the reply came down the crackly line of the telephone of those days, "My dear boy, have you deserted?"
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para27"></a>I put the question that my noble friend Lord Callaghan put to noble Lords opposite. Are they really no longer prepared to stand up for the Armed Forces of the Crown? Are they prepared, without proper consultation with those affected, to let this go through as is? Are they prepared to have families shuffled about without promises of alternative comparable education, and all the rest that the noble Earl will say?  Despite the fact that the Japanese own the DTI building in Victoria Street, are noble Lords opposite prepared to have the Japanese owning the married quarters estate in the Armed Services? Are they prepared for all that just to gain &#163;1.4 billion or &#163;1.5 billion for the Treasury, even if that is achieved?
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para28"></a>I have been on the Front Bench of my party in this House for 10 years. I find myself for the first time in total agreement with the noble Baroness, Lady Cox. I congratulate her; it is an unusual experience for me. Nevertheless, I believe that this is a cross-party issue. It is not an issue of one political party or another. I believe that your Lordships have a chance today to strike a modest blow for the Armed Forces who have suffered quite a lot over the past few years. They serve us well. They deserve our support. I believe that we should give it to them.

I shall demonstrate, I hope conclusively, that your Lordships should not be persuaded or even tempted by her arguments. Indeed, I believe them to be wholly misconceived.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para29"></a>But before I do so I should like to invite your Lordships to step back for a moment and look at what the Government are proposing. The Ministry of Defence has a married quarters estate consisting of tens of thousands of properties. There are two problems with this estate. One is that while many of the houses provide modern and comfortable living accommodation, too many of them do not. There are many hundreds of houses which might have been acceptable when they <P>


<a name="column_470"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 470</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were built in the 1960s and 1970s but which, frankly, nowadays are sub-standard. We spend money every year upgrading a proportion of this accommodation but we need to bring all the properties up to a proper standard and to do it quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para30"></a>The second problem is that too many of our properties are standing empty. A proportion of them need to be kept empty because service families tend to move house a lot and often at short notice. But far too many homes are genuinely surplus. Over the years the Ministry of Defence and the services have taken a rather haphazard and piecemeal approach to selling off such housing. It has not worked. A large part of the stock is difficult to sell by virtue either of its location or its condition; but perhaps more fundamentally the MoD tends to have other things on its mind than selling houses. There are many skills possessed by the Ministry to enable it to defend the realm: estate agency has not been one of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para31"></a>So the Government's idea is a simple one. It is to sell the married quarters estate and lease back the part of it that we want. We have a duty to house entitled service families in the right place and at the right time; but the houses themselves are an asset which the Ministry does not need to own. In all the debate on this question I have not heard a single argument to undermine that premise.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para32"></a>In passing, my noble friend asked about the role of David Hart in all this. Mr. Hart is one of a whole raft of independent advisers who have contributed at various times to our work on the future arrangements for the married quarters estate. He is unpaid and has no financial interest in the outcome of the sale.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para33"></a>From the sale proceeds we shall have an extra &#163;100,000,000 (ring-fenced) to enable us to get on with the upgrading exercise as we would wish to do. We are not talking here of luxury; but rather the installation of central heating and double glazing, modern kitchens and bathrooms to ordinary modest houses. Our servicemen will then get the accommodation they deserve.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para34"></a>The sale will also provide both the incentive and the means to solve the problem of empty homes--the incentive, because we will in future pay rent for the properties we keep; and the means, because we will be able to dispose of houses by simply terminating the relevant lease of six months' notice. That will save the MoD from wasting money maintaining and securing properties we do not need and allow us to concentrate on those we do need. And the private sector will undoubtedly be more efficient at returning surplus quarters to productive use, with potential benefits to both the private and social housing sectors.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para35"></a>Meanwhile the newly created Defence Housing Executive will continue the task of day-to-day management. Already the DHE is bringing about better more efficient management and maintenance of the estate and that represents significant progress.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para36"></a>The suggestion by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, that we could achieve those aims simply by selling off our surplus stock misses the point. It is precisely because we have found extreme difficulty in selling our surplus stock that a sale of the whole estate, with the surplus wrapped up in it, recommends itself. <P>


<a name="column_471"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 471</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>But if we were to wave a magic wand the 2,500 surplus quarters in the sale package are not worth &#163;40,000 each even if a buyer could be found for them all. The proceeds of routine disposals for surplus properties have never been sufficient to fund the upgrade programme we want, nor would they be in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para37"></a>But in a plan such as this Ministers must ensure that while ownership of the estate may pass to another, control of it does not. Let me make a number of points quite clear. Nothing in these proposals will affect the level of rents paid by service families. Rents will continue to be set independently by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body. There will be no change to a serviceman's entitlement to housing in the right place and at the right time. Much has been made of the need to protect the married quarters patch, a view with which Ministers strongly agree. That is why it will be ourselves, not the new owner, who will decide which houses are given up and which are kept for service occupation. That is a management function, which the DHE would need to exercise whether or not there were a sale of the estate. Service families will continue to deal with the DHE on a day-to-day basis. They will have no relationship at all with the new owner. The purchaser will have no right or power to break up or cherry pick or in-fill sites we occupy. My noble friend Lord Swinfen suggested that the safeguards might be lost when bits of the estate are sold. He is quite wrong. Safeguards will be incorporated in our leases. It is the MoD that is the tenant, and the leases last 200 years. I touched on the principal concerns of service families. They are perfectly understandable concerns. They are not, however, well-founded ones.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para38"></a>But the recurrent theme in our debate today has been consultation--the suggestion that we have failed to consult and inform. I can understand why this charge has been levelled against us; but I genuinely believe it to be misplaced. We have really done a very great deal to keep everyone in the picture. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State wrote to all married quarters occupants in England and Wales when the sale was announced last autumn, as fully as he was then able; and he has recently written again. My right honourable friend, his other ministerial colleagues and I have all devoted enormous efforts to seek to get our message across, and deal with the concerns that have been raised. There has been a huge quantity of correspondence and meetings, with Members of this House and of another place; with representatives of interested organisations including service families; with the media and with members of the public. We have also disseminated very full information through the chain of command at regular intervals.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para39"></a>And, most important of all, the service staffs have been fully involved as the proposals have developed. Their contribution has of course been indispensable, to ensure that our proposals fully satisfy the interests of the services. Without that, the Chiefs of Staff would obviously not have been able to express their support for our proposals which they reaffirmed only recently. The service chiefs are not in the habit of taking up such positions lightly. Their judgment deserves the fullest weight.
<P>


<a name="column_472"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 472</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para40"></a>One or two noble Lords asked why the Government cannot be more open about the financial details. We have, of course, been operating under the constraints of a commercial negotiation. In order to get the best possible result for the services and the taxpayer, it is vital that we maintain control of the sale process, and preserve the confidentiality of information which is commercially sensitive at this stage. So we have not been able to lay out every last detail of what is proposed, or publish the full commercial information (which is by any standard voluminous). But I believe that we have been able to give a clear picture of all the essential elements.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para41"></a>Despite all this, my noble friend's amendment invites us to suspend the process and conduct a consultation of all those currently occupying the quarters. I suggest there really has to be a limit to the amount of consulting that we do. We must be able to say, now that the Chiefs of Staff have expressed their support in clear terms, that this is indeed a good plan which ought to proceed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para42"></a>But there is another reason why I am opposed to further consultation, and that is that occupants will be fundamentally unaffected by the sale. We have said this time and again: the sale involves no change to their entitlement to a quarter, no change to the charges they pay, and no change to the maintenance and management service they receive from the MoD. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, that it involves no change to the military culture.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para43"></a>There is another point that I must stress. Although I am perfectly satisfied that this is in no way my noble friend's intention, we must be clear about the effect of her amendment on the sale process. To delay three or four months, as the amendment would entail, would not simply mean that everyone had further time to reflect. It would mean that the sale process would come off the rails. The reason is this. The shortlisted bidders have committed considerable resources, financial and managerial, to meeting the timescale that we have set. Their best and final offers are due at the end of the month. Delaying the transaction until the autumn or beyond would destroy something that is fragile but critically important--the momentum of the sale process. In a deal as unusual as this one, there is real competitive tension between bidders, tension which we have painstakingly built up and which must not on any account be undermined. To give time for reflection would be to invite the renegotiation of key aspects of our proposals, including the many important safeguards we have incorporated. We cannot now take an indefinite "time out" and then expect to be able to secure the best outcome for the services and the taxpayer on resumption of bargaining. That, more than any other reason, is why this amendment, beguiling as it may seem, would be fatal to our plans.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para44"></a>My noble friend Lord Mountgarret made a constitutional point. He said that we should give a chance to another place to debate the issue. It is very interesting that the Opposition in another place had two chances in the past fortnight to raise this issue for debate. Both times they chose to debate other issues such as water metering and family-friendly employment. <P>


<a name="column_473"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 473</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I understand that they have also decided to focus elsewhere on an Opposition day next week. One must ask why they have chosen to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para45"></a>We heard a very interesting speech from the noble Lord, Lord Williams. I did not think it was possible for him to rise any further in my estimation. But this afternoon has proved me wrong. The noble Lord gave us a masterly performance, for which I am sure many of us are truly thankful. But a performance is precisely what it was. It really is extraordinary to hear the noble Lord, whose party all week has been parading its heart on its sleeve in the cause of homeless people, trying now to entice your Lordships down a path which would prevent thousands of empty homes being brought back, efficiently and speedily, into productive use. The truth of the matter is that the Labour Party has been wholly opportunistic in the stance it has taken on this issue. All of a sudden to profess to champion the cause of the service family makes the noble Lord, Lord Williams, about as credible as a man who has murdered both his parents and who then pleads for clemency on the grounds that he is an orphan. It does not convince me for a moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para46"></a>I acknowledge that there are residual worries. Once the sale has been completed, I believe that the doubts and fears that have been expressed will be removed as service families realise that the sale has really made very little difference to them--very little, that is, apart from an improved standard of housing. The sale of the estate represents a prime opportunity to rectify past under-investment and finally get our housing provision right. We have a manifesto commitment to improve the quality and management of service housing. It really would be a tragedy if we were to let this opportunity slip through our fingers at this late stage which, I emphasise, is what my noble friend's amendment would mean.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para47"></a>It would also be a tragedy to miss this chance to resolve our long-standing empty homes problem. That, too, is the subject of a manifesto commitment. Having 20 per cent. or more of the stock standing empty hurts us all. It hurts the services, and it hurts the taxpayer because it costs money which could be better spent on something more productive.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-08_para48"></a>To sum up, may I say again that I know my noble friend's amendment proceeds from the best of motives. But it is wholly wrong. It is based on a misunderstanding of our proposals and their implications; and it would destroy any chance of getting the best outcome for both the services and the taxpayer. The best way to demonstrate our support for our service personnel and their families is now to allow the Government the chance to give them the housing they need and deserve. That is why I urge the House to support the Government.

<P>
<A NAME="60711-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, may I begin by saying a particular thank you to the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. He has treated this issue as a national one, as it should be. I also express my deep gratitude to noble Lords on all sides of the House who have supported the amendment. It is not a wrecking amendment but, I repeat, a national issue. <P>


<a name="column_474"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 474</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The co-sponsors, the noble Lords, Lord Chalfont, Lord Swinfen and Lord Williams of Elvel all made powerful contributions which served to emphasise that the proposed sale as it has been presented by the Government is not only a grave threat to the morale and well-being of service families at a time of great turbulence, but a remarkably poor business deal for the country. It is like selling the family silver in exchange for a post-dated cheque just large enough to pay for some plastic kitchenware.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-09_para0"></a>The magnificent intervention of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, was all the more weighty because he withdrew from the 75th anniversary of the British Legion celebrations expressly to come and speak, and vote. He, more than any of us, must surely have made noble Lords stop and think.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-09_para1"></a>Not least I must thank not only the many noble Lords whom time does not allow me to list individually but the army of faceless women and men who let us know that we speak for them as they are not free to speak. One of the splendid men who work in this House told me today that he had been able to be a good soldier because he knew that his family was safe. That is what it is all about. We ignore it at our peril.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-09_para2"></a>Most of your Lordships were in Westminster Hall today and heard my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor speak of our proud traditions. The fighting services and their families are a part of that tradition. We owe them a special duty. They are not an industry or a business; and we are not talking about bricks and mortar but about homes. The wives have a right and even the duty to defend the patch where their families live. If their husbands overseas cannot rely on the support structure of the patch for vulnerable families, their fighting effectiveness as well as their morale will be damaged. Noble Lords may have noted that we have even fewer soldiers at the same tasks, including in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-09_para3"></a>Decent housing ought to be part of the nation's provision for service families, an absolute right on the same level as health or education, or as the weapons of war. Money to pay for that should not rest on an unusual piece of manna from heaven graciously bestowed by a munificent Treasury as an exceptional favour and, incidentally, coming from the money that the ministry itself is getting. The project of sale will have major effects for future generations. If we reject it, we do so at our peril. It needs to be judged in full debate in both Houses. That is why this amendment was brought forward--not because I wished to prevent it happening but because I felt that it needed proper ventilation and proper consideration. It has not had that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-09_para4"></a>I thank my noble friend the Minister for his invariable courtesy. I must also acknowledge that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State gave me and the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, a courteous hearing, but it seems that we have not persuaded him to our point of view. I was agreeably surprised to find myself on my feet today, since, as I told your Lordships, I was assured by a succession of journalists and other Peers, first, that the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, was undoubtedly and adamantly opposed to me, then that the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, had withdrawn his support and, finally, today, that I intended to withdraw my amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-09_para5"></a>I have listened in vain to hear whether I had any concession whatever from my noble friend the Minister. I had none. Therefore, I fear that I have no choice but to test the opinion of the House.

<A NAME="60711-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas </B>   moved Amendment No. 197:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 17, at end insert ("which is a housing association").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, during Committee the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked why registered charities were not required to satisfy the same conditions for registration as industrial and provident societies or companies. The noble Baroness withdrew amendments on the understanding that we would come back with our own proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para1"></a>The Bill as currently drafted would in fact enable any registered charity to become a registered social landlord, regardless of whether it had been established for, or had among its objects or purposes, the provision of housing. Registered charities have an excellent record in providing social housing and we want to encourage others to come forward. But it was not our intention that a registered charity should be automatically eligible for registration. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for pointing that out.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para2"></a>The noble Baroness suggested we might apply to registered charities the same conditions under Clause 2 as other bodies must satisfy. That would limit the additional permissible purposes such bodies might have in the way we debated in Committee. That is perfectly reasonable for bodies set up specifically to be housing associations or housing companies. But many registered charities provide housing as a logical extension of their primary objects. A number of charities (such as the YWCA) already operate successfully in that way. It would not be appropriate to seek to limit their objects or purposes to those listed in subsections (4) and (5). The objects of charities are already constrained by the very fact that they are charities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para3"></a>Amendment No. 197 will require a charity to be a housing association. Clause 211 of this Bill (minor definitions) defines a housing association by reference back to Section 1 of the Housing Associations Act 1985 which is being retained. That Act defines a housing association as:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a society, body of trustees or company--which is established for the purpose of, or amongst whose objects or powers are included those of, providing, constructing, improving or managing, or facilitating or encouraging the construction or improvement of, housing accommodation".<P>

<a name="column_479"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 479</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
It is also required to be non-profit making using a definition which is the same as Clause 2(2). That latter requirement is axiomatic for a charity. I hope that satisfies the point raised by the noble Baroness in Committee. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his response to my amendment at the last stage. I confess that I would prefer to have won the last vote than to have gained this point on the drafting. Nevertheless, I am grateful to him for picking up the point. I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I, too, would have preferred not to have had the effect of emptying the House in such a dramatic manner.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para4"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel </B>   moved Amendment No. 198:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 21, at end insert ("and is properly capitalised").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I have raised this matter in formal conversations with the Government. I am not clear about the capitalisation of local housing companies. As I understood it, from certain correspondence which I have received from the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, the Government propose that local housing companies should be, in normal words, "thinly capitalised"--in other words, there should be nominal capital put up by those who wish to participate in the shareholding. That is certainly justified if it is the Government's intention to ensure that tenants can be shareholders. There may be rich and poor tenants, but by definition I believe that tenants do not have sufficient assets to put large sums of money into companies. It may also be true that financial institutions themselves do not wish to put up large sums of equity. They prefer to make their money by lending on top of the equity.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para6"></a>That raises a problem which I have tried to discuss with the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, as I am sure he will remember. The problem is that if local housing companies are to work they will need money. If it is to be provided almost entirely in the form of debt, that debt will have a charge on the properties owned by the local housing company. That is inevitable because no financial institution will put up money without taking a charge on the property. That will give rise to a series of rather difficult problems because the directors of the company will be required under the Companies Act to act for the benefit of their shareholders and also for their creditors. I understand the point.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para7"></a>The creditors, who have a charge on the properties in a local housing company, will act in the interests of their own shareholders--in other words, they will wish to realise their security if and when they feel that the company itself is threatened. For instance, if there is a default on the loan agreement and one interest payment is missed, it will almost certainly be the right of the lending institution to put in a receiver. In that case the whole concept of local housing companies will come to a complete standstill. It does not seem to me that the Government have to date thought this through properly. That is why I move this amendment, having warned the <P>


<a name="column_480"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 480</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that I was going to do so, in the hope that the Government have now given this matter consideration and that they can give a proper response to the problems that I have raised. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, indeed the noble Lord, Lord Williams, has raised an important problem. I hope that he and the House will forgive me if I answer him at rather greater length than he asked the question because I believe it is important that we set our views on this matter on the record to give noble Lords the opportunity to criticise them if they feel that that is appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para8"></a>The appropriate level of funding required by a company will differ from case to case. It is not something which could readily be put in legislation: nor is it necessary. Naturally, the criteria which the Housing Corporation will use to judge the suitability of companies for registration will cover their funding proposals. But to include a formal provision in the Bill is at best unnecessary, and might even be dangerous since it might be argued that the corporation had some liability if the company at some time became insolvent.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para9"></a>Housing companies will be set up either as companies limited by guarantee or as companies limited by shares. The companies will not be permitted to distribute profits, nor will they finance their activities by raising equity capital. We do not see that that will create any particularly new problems. Housing companies limited by shares will have some share capital, but it will be limited. It will be nominal or "thin", to use the word of the noble Lord, Lord Williams. I do not believe that &#163;100 would be unusual. In this respect they will be no different from a large number of private companies which only have a very small issued share capital. This is not to imply that generally companies are under-capitalised. Capital other than equity--for example loans--must also be taken into account. Loan finance frequently provides a major source of capital. Housing companies can also be expected to rely heavily on loan capital to finance their activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para10"></a>We expect most housing companies to take transfers of stock from the public sector. They will hold assets in the form of bricks and mortar giving rise to income virtually from day one. These assets will be financed through debt raised to meet a purchase price reflecting the value of the assets, which will in turn reflect anticipated cash flow from rents and service charges. With the right business plans, there should be no problems getting such companies off the ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para11"></a>Housing companies which undertake the development of housing from scratch are in a somewhat different position. They may need to proceed more cautiously at first. But in addition to their ability to raise loans, they will be eligible for grants from the corporation, a significant part of which is payable at an early stage to help cover the purchase of land and provide working capital for fees and costs and to enable development to start. We agree that such companies may need to borrow initially to get themselves established, but reliance on such loans, or indeed on grant, will not mean that they automatically fall foul of the insolvency rules, which, of course, only come into play in the event of a formal <P>


<a name="column_481"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 481</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>insolvency. The test is generally whether a company can meet its liabilities as they fall due, not that debts could be met in full at any time. We think it highly unlikely that directors would commit their company to repayment of debts before it had established its income.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para12"></a>Clearly, in every case the company will need to manage its affairs correctly to ensure that it is in a position to meet its liabilities as they fall due. But it will receive grant as and when necessary to help meet development costs. We expect it will also take out loans over that period. In practice, therefore, capital, by way of loan and grants, will be available when required to meet its development liabilities. Future liabilities in relation to its loan debt will be met from rents and service charges and be backed by the sale value of the assets. I would add that because of the quite proper concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, about the potential implications of insolvency provisions, my officials have been in contact with their counterparts in the Insolvency Service and, as regards the Companies Act aspect, with their counterparts in the Department of Trade and Industry. I understand that they take the view that there does not appear to be anything so intrinsically different about a housing company that would put it at greater risk of falling foul of the insolvency legislation than other companies.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para13"></a>We believe that housing companies will build on the experience of housing associations. There may in fact be little difference between them. We are comforted by the way in which housing associations, including Companies Act charities, have operated in this way for some years.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para14"></a>There is one aspect of the matter which concerned me personally and that is the question of whether one can rightfully advise someone to become a director of a housing company as a Companies Act company, given that it might be trading fairly close to the wind. There is no way in which we would wish to try to put a curb on the sort of advice which should be quite properly offered to someone who was considering becoming a director of such a company. Someone wishing to undertake that might seek advice from an accountant as to whether, in view of the company's business plan and the way in which it was set up, it carried an undue risk of personal liability in the event of insolvency or when things go wrong. That is something which would have to be taken into account. With a company which is taking on local authority housing there should be little difficulty because of the established nature of the business and the income that will be generated. The company would not be likely to get into difficulties so fast that it would run out of share capital. One can control the way in which one incurs liabilities to ensure that the income is coming in rather faster than that, one would hope.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para15"></a>If, there was such a danger--particularly, in the case of a housing company which was setting out to make new developments where there would be considerable danger of trading while insolvent (or at least infringing the Companies Act)--it would clearly be necessary for the company to seek capital, but not capital in the form of shares. We would expect it to have capital in the form <P>


<a name="column_482"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 482</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of either land donated to it or of guarantees given by third parties so that the people who were directors of it and running it could be sure that they were able to pay their properly incurred liabilities, particularly to creditors.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para16"></a>I understand the spectre which the noble Lord, Lord Williams, raises about the way in which the Companies Act might bite on people operating a housing company. We agree that that is a real problem. Potential directors of the company, as well as directors, would have to ensure that the company had addressed those problems and had as a back-up access to finance by way of guarantee. That would give the directors the comfort they required which, in other companies, would be provided by share capital.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para17"></a>I hope that that gives the noble Lord an understanding of the way in which we see the system developing. We do not have any difficulty comprehending the concerns he has. We think that they are well placed concerns. They are concerns which should be shared by people who are putting a housing company together. However, we believe that in practice they will be overcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_time0"></A><H5>6 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his response. Since we are at Report stage I am unable to interrogate the noble Lord, as I would in Committee, and have responses to questions. I can have only one shot at answering what the noble Lord said.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para18"></a>Firstly, I would say that if I were asked advice from anybody who was thinking of becoming a director of a local housing company, I would certainly advise them against taking that position. The noble Lord said that somebody would ask accountants for expert advice. I would certainly advise--and I am sure my noble friend Lord Berkeley who is sitting with me on the Front Bench would equally advise--that nobody should become a director of such a company, not because it is a bad company, but simply because the structure of the company is such that any director of such a company will be permanently at risk.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para19"></a>The noble Lord, as I understood him, said that the income stream for the company would come from the assets which had been transferred against borrowings at the market value of the assets, say from local authorities, to give one example. That may be fine in terms of income stream but let us take the situation where the housing market falls away. It has happened in the past. It could happen again.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para20"></a>Let us say that Bank X has lent a large sum of money against the value of the assets that had been transferred to the local housing company. Bank X has lent at full value because there is no capital in the local housing company to pay for the assets that it is acquiring. So it has to borrow the whole sum of money from Bank X. It is, in effect, a 100 per cent. mortgage. If house prices deteriorate, any bank is certain to take a very close look at what is happening in that company. If there is any problem in that company, it will trigger its charge very quickly. It is only right to do so. As a banker, I should say, that is the way banks operate.
<P>


<a name="column_483"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 483</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para21"></a>I find this whole concept a little difficult to accept. I find it difficult to live with the idea that a thinly capitalised housing company may purchase its assets from whoever it is on the back of a loan which has a charge at 100 per cent. of those assets and may trade as such, even for non-profit. As I say, I would not become a director, and I would not advise anybody else to become one.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para22"></a>However, this is Report stage. If the noble Lord has any further thoughts, no doubt he will reconsider the matter at Third Reading. But it has been a useful debate in determining where the Government stand on the issue. I am not entirely satisfied that the Government--even with the benefit of advice from the insolvency service and the Department of Trade and Industry--have got it quite right yet. I believe that any company that operates under the Companies Act in the way that the noble Lord has described is in potential serious danger. However, in the light of the fact we are on Report, unless the noble Lord has anything else he wishes to say, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-10_para23"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<A NAME="60711-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel </B>   moved Amendment No. 199:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 126, line 6, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) Any payment of remuneration under paragraph (2)(b) above shall be the level of remuneration payable to a person undertaking jury service in accordance with the Juries Act 1974.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is designed to make it clear that payments to board members of registered social landlords will be at the same level paid to jury members as compensation for loss of earnings. At the Report stage of the Bill in another place, the Government amended the Bill to allow the remuneration of voluntary board members of registered social landlords. The Minister said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we are not trying to change the ethos of the housing association movement". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
He added that the Government's amendment was,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"not expected to change the modus operandi"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
if I can quote the Minister's Latin expression--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"of a valuable movement that is based on voluntary service".--[Official Report, Commons, 29/4/96; cols. 816-17.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para1"></a>This amendment reinforces the express wishes of both the Government and the voluntary housing movement that the voluntary ethos of housing associations is not lost; that they do not become commercial organisations hiring their directors or council members on a commercial basis. The effect of the amendment will be that any remuneration paid to a board member of a housing association or registered social landlord will be no more than the level of compensation for loss of earnings that is available to a person serving on a jury. I think the case is made. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I quite agree with the noble Lord, Lord Williams, that the housing association sector has a long tradition of voluntary service. There are in England and Wales more than 25,000 people freely <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>giving of their time, serving on the committees of housing associations. Many more contribute to the running of registered social landlords as members of local, area and tenant committees.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para2"></a>The question of payment has received much attention during the last year. The National Federation of Housing Associations recommended that consideration be given to the introduction of a loss of earnings regime linked to the jury service scheme. That is very much what the noble Lord, Lord Williams, is proposing in the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para3"></a>As I explained when the matter was debated in Committee we are not advocating the introduction of payment to board members. But there is a continuing demand for new people to come forward and we need to be able to attract people from a wide cross-section. We have to recognise that not everyone is able to give their time freely but will incur expenses and should be suitably compensated. However, we must also recognise that for some their involvement may have other costs, including having to forgo some paid employment. Employment practices are changing. For many there is no standard working day. Some work flexible hours; other fixed shifts involving both early and late hours. Attendance at evening meetings could be inconvenient, especially if much travelling is involved. If we are to continue to be able to draw on people from a wide cross-section of backgrounds then it may be necessary in the future to make some payment or compensation for loss of earnings. We have consequently taken the opportunity of this Bill to enable payment over and above existing expenses, but still subject to corporation control over maxima.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, proposes that any remuneration to board members be at the level payable to a person undertaking jury service in accordance with the Juries Act 1974. If payments for more than expenses are to be introduced, there would be benefits to be gained from limiting payment to loss of earnings and from using an existing scheme which is well established. However, the hours involved in board membership are not precisely equivalent to jury service. Jury service tends to be in the day, but board membership would involve evening attendance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para5"></a>It would be necessary to consider also the position of such groups as the self-employed, the low paid and the unemployed. People who are released for jury service find, if they have a good employer, that they continue to be paid as well as receiving the jury supplement. Obviously, that is not the case for the self-employed--and it applies even less to the unemployed. We want to ensure that the payment regime that is put together can take account of the particular circumstances of the people it is thought necessary to attract onto housing association boards.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para6"></a>Furthermore, the amendment would require payment at jury service levels, while the Bill at present allows the corporation to set a maximum. It would be up to the individual organisation to decide whether to introduce a system and, if so, whether to make payments below the maximum. The Housing Corporation and, we <P>


<a name="column_485"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 485</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>understand, many others in the industry want the payments to be set at below jury service levels--or to have the ability to make payments at below that level.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para7"></a>The corporation has been giving thought to the question of payment and is considering whether to publish a consultation paper to seek views on possible options. This would explore the possibilities of a loss of earnings regime, based on public service models, such as the justices allowances (for JPs) or jury service. If any payment ceiling were to be introduced, it would be for an individual registered social landlord to decide whether to make use of it as many will probably wish to retain fully their voluntary service ethos.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para8"></a>The noble Lord has indicated that one reason for proposing this amendment is to establish clearly on the statute the maximum level of payment rather than leaving it to the discretion of the corporation as the regulator. We consider that there are good grounds for leaving decisions on the maximum level of payments to the corporation and do not see any need to impose any separate limit. The corporation will consult before using its powers under Schedule 1(3), so enabling any limit set to reflect the views of all interested parties. Should the balance favour a lower figure than that available under the jury service scheme, including perhaps a nominal sum, the corporation will be able to impose such a limit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para9"></a>We prefer the flexibility which the Bill provides at present. Other than that, we are thinking along very much the same lines as the noble Lord, Lord Williams, and I hope that he considers that sufficient comfort to enable him to withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para12"></a>I undertook in Committee to look again at certain provisions in Schedule 1 to the Bill to see whether the arrangements for regulating registered social landlords worked satisfactorily and unambiguously for Companies Act companies. We are satisfied that they do, but we have concluded there are one or two areas where the <P>


<a name="column_486"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 486</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provisions can be improved. That is a disingenuous way of saying that we are extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, for having pointed out the fact that we needed to look carefully at the way in which the Bill had been drafted. We have managed to convince ourselves that we can get round most of the problems raised and we are most grateful for having been given that opportunity. This amendment is the first fruit of that investigation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para13"></a>First, as the noble Lord pointed out in Committee, while the Bill allows the Housing Corporation in certain circumstances to appoint a person to be a director, a trustee or a committee member and allows them to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting, it does not allow them to move a resolution at such a meeting. We agree that that is a weak link, since without such a power the appointee has no effective way of getting the meeting to address issues of concern. Amendments Nos. 200, 202 and 204 rectify that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para14"></a>Secondly, in looking at the provisions under which appointed persons may act in certain circumstances, it has become clear that paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 which deals with registered charities, differs from the provisions of the Housing Associations Act 1985 and from those in paragraphs 7 and 8 in that it allows an appointed person to attend, speak and vote at a meeting of the directors and trustees: a right which they should have in any case. What is required is a right to attend, speak and vote at any general meeting of the charity, which Amendment No. 200 achieves.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para15"></a>Thirdly, we have concluded that the provisions of paragraph 13(2) of Schedule 1 dealing with orders of the court under Sections 425 and 427 of the Companies Act 1985 are not adequate and could be difficult to apply. Orders under these sections deal respectively with compromises and arrangements with creditors or members, and with the transfer of undertakings or property for the purposes of reconstruction or amalgamation of a company. Amendment No. 205 rectifies this by providing that any such order is not effective unless the corporation has given its consent. It further provides that a copy of the consent shall be sent to the registrar of companies along with the copy of the order.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para16"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 207 deals with an oversight in paragraph 24 of the schedule. It was always intended that failure to comply with an order of the corporation in respect of the holding of money or securities should be a summary offence, to be heard by a magistrates' court, rather than an offence to be heard by a Crown Court. This amendment rectifies that oversight. I beg to move.

I am also grateful to him for tabling some amendments which in some cases seem to rectify some of my problems with these provisions.

<a name="column_487"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 487</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para17"></a>The first difficulty that I see with Amendment No. 202 to which the noble Lord spoke--this difficulty follows through into Amendment No. 204--is the question of what happens if, at any general meeting of the company, the shareholders (or anybody else who is entitled to move a resolution) move a resolution to remove the director appointed by the corporation before he has been able to move his own resolution. It is up to the board to determine the agenda of the general meeting. The director is then removed if the shareholders vote in favour of the original measure and cannot then move his own resolution.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para18"></a>Secondly, what happens if the director appointed by the corporation moves his resolution and it is defeated by the shareholders? It may be a resolution to remove a certain director or a number of directors from the board of that local housing company. The shareholders have a right to vote on that and to reject the motion. What happens then? In my view, the authority of the corporation which appointed that director to engage in such an odd arrangement is thereby seriously damaged.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-11_para19"></a>The corporation does not have any power to do anything. As I see it, it has a power only to appoint a director who may at some point early in the general meeting be removed. If the director is not removed, he may move a resolution which may then be defeated. What happens in those circumstances? Although I recognise that the noble Lord has moved a little in my direction, I am not entirely clear about how the provision might work in practice.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I think that the noble Lord has a very clear appreciation of how it might work in practice. The Companies Act and all its provisions have primacy and the situation that he described is entirely in accordance with those provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-12_para0"></a>The purpose of these provisions is to provide the corporation with the ability to transfer discussion from the board of a company to the shareholders. In general, they will be different bodies, differently constituted, although one has appointed the other. That will give the Housing Corporation an opportunity to move its disagreements with the company into the forum of the shareholders' meeting. If that shareholders' meeting disagrees with the actions that the corporation is taking and so votes, that is its right. It will result in the corporation's actions at that level being ineffective. If the corporation so decides, it then has the option of moving further to its much more considerable back-up powers, a full inquiry and such panoply, but it is not intended that the procedure of moving matters into the realm of the shareholders should provide an answer. We are merely suggesting that that is the forum in which such matters should be discussed before the corporation takes the full-scale action of holding an inquiry involving, as it would, the corporation's assumption of a lot of powers over the housing association. I recognise the comic aspect that may ensue if there is a rebellion by the shareholders against the Housing Corporation. We do not believe that we can do anything about that without fear of getting into serious trouble with the operation of the Companies Act. In most cases we prefer to rely on good sense to make sure that these matters <P>


<a name="column_488"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>operate properly. Where they do not, the corporation will have available to it greater backup powers to solve the problem, if required.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60711-12_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 203. In Committee I suggested to your Lordships that it might be useful if the corporation maintained a golden share in local housing companies. The formal description of such a share is a special share. That is the normal procedure. I believe that by allowing this the Government will obviate all of the difficulties that we discussed in the context of the last amendment. The special share would give the corporation the right to do more or less what it wanted when it subscribed to the share. As the corporation stands behind the local housing company and as a last resort has the panoply of powers described by the noble Lord, it is much simpler to allow the corporation to take a special share and give that special share such powers as to obviate the difficulties that we have discussed. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, it may assist the House if I outline the safeguards already in the Bill. In order to become a registered social landlord in the first place, a company will have to meet the various statutory requirements. These include requirements not to trade for profit and to meet a series of published criteria. Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 prohibits the distribution of dividends with powers of recovery. This is backed up by the company's memorandum and articles, which will be approved initially by the corporation as part of the registration process. The Bill provides that any subsequent changes would similarly need to be approved.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-12_para6"></a>In the case of a company with share capital, its memorandum and articles will be required to include provisions prohibiting or restricting the transfer of <P>


<a name="column_489"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 489</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>shares. Thus, a company which is a registered social landlord cannot be, and could not convert itself into, a profit-distributing company; nor could its shares be transferred in a way which threatened the objective of an independent provider of social housing. No disposal of land including housing would be permitted unless it met corporation requirements or had express approval. Thus, a company could not divest itself of its assets without explicit consent. Even if it did divest itself, the resulting income could not be distributed to shareholders. Finally, the company may not de-register without the corporation's permission and without meeting published criteria. Thus, a company could not dispose of its assets and take itself and the resulting income out of the sector at will. The corporation's permission would not be granted for anything which constituted asset stripping.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-12_para7"></a>This represents a formidable set of hurdles. In the event of a company misbehaving, the corporation would have a series of sanctions, including the powers in Schedule 1 to appoint a director, hold an inquiry and to follow that up by directing the transfer of land, including housing. All in all, a registered social landlord is effectively constrained.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-12_para8"></a>Given the extent of these safeguards, we do not believe that a golden share is necessary or desirable. The golden share has generally been used as a transitional device, for example, while privatisation arrangements are bedding down in large companies. We do not want to put the corporation in a position whereby it is involved in running a number of small social landlords. The provisions of this schedule enable the corporation to appoint one or more individuals to try to help a company in difficulties. The corporation does this now with housing associations, almost always by agreement rather than by imposition. The individuals are chosen for their experience and good sense, but they are not there to represent the corporation at the expense of shareholders; they are there to help the association get back on the rails.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-12_para9"></a>We prefer the arrangements in the Bill under which the corporation is one step further back in its dealings with housing associations than we feel would be the case with a golden share. If there were a golden share the corporation might be tempted to get its hands dirty and become more intimately involved on a greater number of occasions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-12_para10"></a>I hope that what I have said about the safeguards already in place will enable the noble Lord to overcome his clear preference for the golden share and agree that, even if he does not like our way of doing it, it is none the less effective.

<P>
<A NAME="60711-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, to be frank I do not like the noble Lord's way and I do not believe that it will be effective. I believe that the golden share, which is well known in practice and in company law, is a much better way of doing it and will ensure that the corporation has control over local housing companies as I believe it should. To have to go back through the whole panoply of powers that the noble Lord has recited is much more difficult under the Bill as presently <P>

<A NAME = "60711-13_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 206 standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Dubs. It appeared from our discussion in Committee on this topic that there might be circumstances in which the corporation insisted on a certain number of accounting principles which a local housing company had to adopt and the law under the Companies Act, as amended, insisted on certain other principles, and both sets of principles were intended to represent a true and fair view. I believe that I pointed out to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that this was something of a nonsense. It is another reason why no one should become a director of a local housing company. No director can properly sign two sets of accounts both of which purport to represent a true and fair view. Having raised the matter with the noble Lord I hope that he has an elegant solution to offer to obviate what I perceive to be a complex difficulty. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Williams, that the problem he imagines existed in our minds when this matter was discussed in Committee did exist. Since that time we have had the opportunity to make a thorough review of the wording of the Bill as it now stands. If I go through the Government's interpretation of the wording I hope he will accept that it avoids the problem that we mutually raised at Committee. <P>


<a name="column_491"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 491</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Paragraph 16 or Schedule 1 gives the corporation power to determine accounting requirements for registered social landlords with a view to ensuring, first, that they are prepared in a proper form and, secondly, that they give a true and fair view of the landlord's housing activities and the disposition of funds and assets held by it in connection with such activities. Before determining such requirements the corporation must consult representatives of registered social landlords. In practice, it also consults others, such as the Accounting Standards Board, the Auditing Practices Board and the other regulators with an interest in the sector, including Companies House. Once it has done that it must obtain approval for what it proposes from the Secretary of State.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-13_para1"></a>The provisions of paragraph 16 bite only on the accounts relating to an organisation's housing activities. Our legal advice is that the requirement that such accounts are prepared in a proper form must mean, in the case of a Companies Act company, accounts which comply with the requirements of that Act. That provision appears at line 28 of paragraph 132.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-13_para2"></a>The corporation may well, for reasons connected with its regulatory role, require information which is additional to that required by the Companies Act or by the legislation relating to charities and industrial and provident societies. But in such cases it should be capable of being supplied as a supplement to the accounts. We do not believe that directors or auditors will face difficulty in complying with these requirements.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-13_para3"></a>On consideration, we are convinced that there is no need for separate accounts and no need for conflict in providing this supplementary information. When I spoke in Committee I thought that ultimately there might be two sets of accounts. However, there will be one set of accounts; that demanded by the statute which forms the basis of whatever the entity is. It will be the Companies Act in the case of a company. The corporation may require supplementary information which the auditors will report as an addition, not as an alternative, to what is required by the Companies Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-13_para4"></a>I hope that in providing that carefully revised interpretation of what is in the Bill the noble Lord will be satisfied that the problem which we both imagined existed does not exist.

It may well be that it has objections to the idea that a supplementary set of accounts in addition to those required by the Companies Acts may be produced by the corporation, in accordance with the instructions of the corporation, on more detailed matters or different aspects of the company's business, which also give a true and fair view.

<A NAME = "60711-13_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 210 I shall speak also to Amendment No. 214. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, for his letter to me explaining about the repair costs and service charges for housing. It was most helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-13_para14"></a>We discussed similar amendments in Committee, but I remain concerned that the Bill provides a disincentive to housing associations to build in future to high standards of construction, insulation, low operating costs, community facilities and so forth. Furthermore, I am concerned that it provides a disincentive to build in certain locations.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-13_para15"></a>In Committee the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, said that he thought I was talking about sheltered accommodation. I wish to confirm that that is not the case. The amendment refers to ordinary social housing perhaps with high standards and community facilities. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay, commented that if housing was to be sold the value of the community facilities and the high cost of the extra insulation and so forth would be reflected in the sale price. I refer your Lordships to col. 1459. That may or may not be the case. My concern is that we need to refer to the market or to the purchase price of houses built in the future and compare that with the cost of building.

<A NAME = "60711-13_para16"></a>I consulted again the William Sutton Trust, which is the sixth largest housing trust in this country. It raised four serious concerns which it believed should be reconsidered. The trust builds to high standards and low maintenance, but it believes that if that is not to be reflected in the sale price either it will make a loss or it will decide to build all its houses to a lower cost. Of course, when it builds houses it cannot know which ones will be sold and which will not. If it keeps the houses for a long period it will opt for low operating and maintenance costs, but if it sells them at a loss it will have less money for the construction of new houses.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-13_para17"></a>Secondly, the trust pointed out that it and possibly other trusts may stop building new flats as a result of the complex legal arrangements which will arise not only under this Bill but in connection with other legislation relating to owner occupiers of flats. The trust thought that there was a real likelihood that it would stop building flats.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-13_para18"></a>It also expressed concern that if house prices fall they will lose, as my noble friend Lord Williams said in our debate on Amendment No. 197. However, that applies to anyone. Its greatest concern, which I share, is that in locations where the market price is below the building costs trusts might stop building completely. Where are those areas? Not surprisingly, they are areas such as Liverpool, Stoke-on-Trent and the North East where such housing is probably required most.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-13_para19"></a>All those problems and concerns arise because housing associations are no longer to be in control of their complete housing stock. I believe that they accept the change, but if they must carry on building and replacing what has been sold I strongly believe that wording such as that in my Amendment No. 204 is highly desirable. We run the risk of housing trusts completely stopping building flats or houses in areas where they are most required. If there were a floor market price related to the cost that problem could be mitigated and there would be a continuation of social housing in those areas where it is most required. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60711-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has a point but, unfortunately, the market economy has an impact on the situation. I am fully aware that often housing associations have a simple formula. They know how much per square foot they can afford to spend on building, they know how many square feet they have for a flat or a house and they know roughly the market price. Often it is a combination of yields and interest rates. It can be the combination of a sudden rise in the cost of building materials due to a sudden demand and of contractors, if they have sufficient work, quoting higher prices in more difficult areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para0"></a>One of the objectives of associations is to build houses in the lower cost areas. However, I do not see how one can arrive at a particular floor as regards building costs because without heavy subsidy they would be influenced by the outside market.

<P>
<A NAME="60711-14_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, is still worried about this. I certainly do not think that the Bill should result in houses being built to a lesser standard than they are at the moment; nor do I see that it will stop flats being built. Of course, if you have any change there is always anxiety, and I understand that. Those who are involved are naturally apprehensive and wonder what is going to happen. I shall do my best to try to assuage the noble Lord's anxiety.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para1"></a>The statutory purchase grant scheme has been introduced so that, in future, certain tenants of registered social landlords will have the right to buy their home. On the whole, we believe that is a good thing. Something similar to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, was discussed in Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para2"></a>Let me tell the noble Lord what the position is. Landlords will receive the full market value of any properties which they sell. Where a property has certain amenities, such as a playground or something like that, the market value would be expected to increase accordingly. I do not think it would be appropriate to enshrine in legislation the requirement that the value of a property must reflect the fact that it enjoys access to communal facilities. We should rely on the market to determine the value of any particular property. If the noble Lord is selling his house it has a certain value attached to it. If the house has a garden three-quarters of an acre in size which goes with the house, then the chances are that the house will have a greater value.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para3"></a>That is why we think we ought to rely on the market to determine the value of the property. If a tenant purchases his home, which shares facilities or amenities with other properties, such as a communal garden, he will normally have to pay service charges for his contribution to the maintenance of those facilities. Of course, if a tenant buys, that does not deprive the other tenants of the full use of those facilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para4"></a>Amendment No. 214, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, would exclude properties where the sale price to the tenant was less than the original cost to the landlord. I would like to assuage the noble Lord's worries. Under the purchase grant scheme landlords will always receive the full market value of any property which they sell.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para5"></a>The noble Lord was concerned whether the property might have gone up or fallen in value since it was built. Mortgage rates and interest rates also go up and down. The point is that if the landlord receives the full market value of any property which he sells then of course he will be able to recycle that money, and if he wishes to purchase another property then the replacement property should reflect the same market value, whether it has gone up or down.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para6"></a>Even if the landlord were to make a financial loss he would at least be cushioned by the grant which he had received earlier, and he should have the option of buying a similar property on the open market. Perhaps I can explain that a little further. When the flat or the house was built it attracted a certain grant which, of course, lowered the net cost to the builder. When the landlord sells that property, of course the total price might have <P>


<a name="column_495"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 495</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>gone down, but that will be reflected in the fact that he will be able to use that lesser price to buy a house also of a lesser price because of the position of the market.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para7"></a>The traditional right to buy a council house does not allow a local authority to refuse to sell a property where its market value is below what it actually cost the local authority. The local authority may have spent a lot of money doing up the property just before it was decided that it should be sold. In this case, because the tenant would, in effect, be getting a considerable benefit, and a benefit of almost total renovation of his house or flat, the discount which he normally would have received may be waived or reduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para8"></a>I hope I have been able to persuade the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, that the position is not quite as frightening as he thought it was and that it is based on the market value. If the market value goes up then the landlord is relatively advantaged, but he will have to spend more when he purchases a replacement property, and if it goes down he will be relatively disadvantaged but he will pay less for a replacement.

<A NAME="60711-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, for that explanation. My concern has always been to see a continuing stock of social housing. I believe he has explained the position very clearly. We have debated the matter at length, both now and at Committee stage, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "60711-14_para9"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-14_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee </B>   moved Amendment Nos. 211:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 11, line 21, at end insert--
<BR>
("(5) The right granted by subsection (1) of this section shall not apply where the tenant is a tenant of a dwelling subject either to a planning obligation as defined by section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 or to a planning condition in the planning permission authorising the existing use of the dwelling, which obligation or condition has the substantive effect however expressed of restricting the use of the dwelling to occupation by persons who cannot afford to occupy houses generally available on the open market.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, my name has been added to this amendment. The Marshalled List was a little eccentric today, but my name appears on the supplement. I spoke on this matter at the previous stage. The amendment argues for so-called Section 106 properties to be excluded from the right to buy. In moving this amendment I speak also to Amendments Nos. 216, 221A and 221B.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para11"></a>The amendment has been revised since the last stage to take account of concerns raised by the Government about defining such an exclusion in law. The Government said at Committee stage that Section 106 agreements can involve a wide range of planning conditions which have nothing to do with affordable housing, and that has been taken into account in that the amendment excludes only homes covered by a Section 106 agreement concerned with that provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para12"></a>Secondly, it was said that the issue of tenure was not a part of the planning process, and this amendment does not refer to tenure. Instead it adopts the Department of <P>


<a name="column_496"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 496</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Environment's own definition of affordable housing, as used in its draft circular of last February. The Government's policy of increasing affordable housing outlined in the draft circular would be undermined, I believe, unless an exclusion, similar to the one which I am proposing, were provided. A home built specifically for people who could not afford to buy on the open market would be resold and taken out of that provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para13"></a>That is why I was keen to see the matter reconsidered. In particular, the Government's draft circular provides that there should not be commuted payments, in other words, payments in lieu of actual housing. At the last stage the Minister said that he believed that the Government's endorsement of this use of Section 106 agreements was fully consistent with extending home ownership through the new right to buy, and with landlords recycling the sale proceeds for the continued benefit of the local community. That was at col. 1475 of Hansard of 6th June.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para14"></a>If Section 106 homes are sold, or are available for sale, the local housing authority, or the local planning authority wearing that hat, might just as well take commuted payments, payments in lieu of an actual building, but that is what the Government now frown upon and outlaw in their recent circular. It does seem to be inconsistent. With a view to ensuring that this particular provision relating to affordable housing should not fall between two stools as a result of the changes to the planning guidance, and because of the Bill, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-14_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I was looking round because I thought that my noble friend Lord Kinnoull might wish to speak to his Amendments Nos. 221A and 221B. However, as he seems to have vaporised, I assume that he does not wish to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para15"></a>This group of amendments seeks to impose a series of further exemptions to the new tenant's right to acquire in Clause 16. In the early stages of the Bill's progress through Parliament, the right to acquire was welcomed generally. But at each stage we find that amendments are tabled which seek to limit that right. We have provided a series of reasonable exclusions which are based on rural areas of particular special needs. However, I do not believe that it would be sensible to keep chipping away further at the right to acquire, not least because each new item introduces further complexity. We have introduced legislation to give housing association tenants the right to buy their homes and we want as many of them as possible to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para16"></a>Amendment No. 211 seeks to exclude from the right to acquire any properties which are subject to a planning obligation or condition which has the effect of restricting the use and occupancy to people who cannot afford to occupy houses which are generally available on the open market.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para17"></a>Planning obligations and conditions may cover a very wide range of requirements, not just related to affordable housing. I believe that that could cause particular problems of definition for any exclusion from <P>


<a name="column_497"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 497</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the right to acquire. The noble Baroness's amendment acknowledges that difficulty in its very broad wording. In fact, that may cause considerable uncertainty and argument about just what are the "substantive" effects of obligations and conditions. I wondered what that meant because I am not quite certain what "substantive" means when describing an effect. I do not know whether it means a substantial effect or whether the qualification of the word "effect" means something more sinister. That would be a point of argument. I do not make great play on that; it is just that personally, I do not understand it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para18"></a>Planning obligations may be either agreements between the local planning authority and relevant landowners or offered voluntarily by a landowner. Planning authorities have wide discretion in the use of planning obligations and conditions. The exemption suggested by this amendment could apply widely, to the detriment of the many tenants who would be at risk of being deprived of their right to acquire.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para19"></a>Affordable housing may be for rent, for purchase on shared ownership terms or for outright ownership. Paragraph 40 of our Policy Planning Guidance Note 3 indicates that planning obligations cannot be used normally to control which of those three options should be used. They commonly limit occupancy to people with a local connection. But a family which occupies a property as tenants is likely to be equally qualified to continue to occupy it as an owner.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-14_para20"></a>For those reasons, I hope that the noble Baroness will not seek to press the amendment because I believe that it would cause further complications.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am very disappointed by that answer because it did not deal with the substance, whether substantial or substantive, of the matter. My point is that there is a planning procedure in place which is quite well known which provides alternative mechanisms for achieving greater stock: agreements with developers either to build housing or to make available some units of a total development to those who might otherwise not be able to afford either to rent or to buy. Tenure is not an issue in this amendment. That is one way of approaching, through planning, the problem of the shortage of stock when a local planning authority is making an agreement with a developer.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para0"></a>Frequently, a developer will be looking at a site which may not be suitable for the number of houses that he is prepared to negotiate around. It may be a particularly good site, perhaps a riverside site--and I have known that when I was chairing a planning authority some years ago--where the housing to be built was likely to achieve a very high price on the open market. The negotiations would go forward on the basis that while the developer may not be prepared to give up the good site for affordable housing, he would be prepared to make a contribution to the funds that the local planning authority/housing authority had available. Those funds then go into a pot in order to enable building elsewhere. That is a very important mechanism for minor but cumulatively important increases in stock.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, on behalf of my noble friend Lord Peyton of Yeovil, I move the amendment so that the Minister will have an opportunity to comment on it, if he so wishes. I gather that nine other amendments are grouped with this amendment. Perhaps it may be for the convenience of the House if the noble Lord, Lord Carter, speaks to Amendments Nos. 217, 218, 221 and 221C. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, Amendments Nos. 212, 213, 215, 219 and 220 stood in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, in Committee and were moved by the noble Lord, Lord Stanley of Alderley.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para5"></a>We covered the ground on them fairly thoroughly then so that there is no need to repeat that. In Committee we wondered about the definition which the noble Lord had used in his amendments. He is on to quite a good idea if the Government were so minded to accept the amendments, although I have a feeling that they will not. However, I shall be interested to see whether the Government have changed their minds since Committee stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para6"></a>This whole group of amendments concerns Clause 17. Our main concern is to ensure that the areas where right to buy for new tenants of social landlords would not apply should be properly defined and that there should be proper procedures for consultation before designation of areas. As noble Lords will know, in Committee we achieved a number of government undertakings on the record which we welcomed, and we thank the Government for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para7"></a>The Government propose to use the negative procedure to lay all the regulations listing the settlements where right to buy will not apply and we have undertakings by letter and in Hansard that once the areas are designated, the removal from designation will be a very rare event. If that is the case, it seems to us to be reasonable that such removal of the exemption, which we were told by the Government on a number of <P>


<a name="column_499"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 499</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>occasions in Committee would be very rare, should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and justified to Parliament. Our Amendments Nos. 221 and 221C deal with that aspect of the matter. I shall return to them later.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para8"></a>In order to head us off on the point, so to speak, the Government have tabled Amendment No. 217A which requires consultation only before the removal of the designation. Obviously we cannot oppose consultation--indeed, we welcome it--but, on its own, it is not enough. The Government can consult as much as they like, but there is no guarantee that they will take any notice of the consultation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para9"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 217A which is the consultation amendment tabled in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers. It is, so to speak, the consultation olive branch as regards the change in designation. As I said, we welcome the amendment as far as it goes; but, unfortunately, it does not go far enough. We certainly support the amendment, but we also hope to persuade the Government to accept either Amendment No. 221 or, more particularly, Amendment No. 221C.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para10"></a>The effect of the Government's amendment would oblige the Secretary of State to consult with local housing authorities and registered social landlords before they make the subsequent orders which would cause rural areas previously designated as exempt to cease to be so. It places a statutory duty on the Secretary of State to carry out the consultations required before making amending orders. However, we believe that it is a weak duty to require the Secretary of State to consult and then completely ignore the representations that might be made to him by the consultees. We note that the amendment does not even oblige the Secretary of State to have regard to what the consultees say.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para11"></a>Staying with the point of consultation, I should point out that the situation is a little ironic. I am just trying to recall the number of Bills with which I have been involved where I have attempted to put a consultation amendment on the face of the legislation. Such attempts have always been resisted by the Government. However, on this occasion we are delighted that the Government have accepted the argument and, indeed, have tabled an amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para12"></a>I move on now to our Amendments Nos. 221 and 221C which are tabled in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Stanley of Alderley. In fact, Amendment No. 218 is a paving amendment to these amendments. Before the Minister replies and points it out, perhaps I may say that, on further reflection, we tend to consider the drafting of Amendment No. 221 as probably being flawed. It would only give the Government six months after Royal Assent to lay the regulations which would designate all the areas where the right to buy will not apply. We do not know what the timetable is in that respect. Therefore, we have left the amendment on the Marshalled List so that the Government can tell us whether they believe they will be able to lay all the regulations which designate such areas within six months, or whether in fact it will take longer.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para13"></a>The amendment that we hope the Government will accept is Amendment No. 221C. It simply says that once an area or a settlement has been designated using the <P>


<a name="column_500"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 500</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>negative procedure--with which we have agreed--then removal of that designation should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. In Committee, we were told endlessly that the removal of the designation would be a very rare occurrence; that is, according to the Government. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will not argue that we will be taking up parliamentary time by the use of that affirmative procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para14"></a>As I said, the consultation proposed by the Government in Amendment No. 217A is all very fine and well--indeed, we believe that the Government should consult in any event--but it is not really enough. The outcome of such consultation resulting in the removal of those exemptions should be debated in both Houses. In conclusion, we welcome and support Amendment No. 217A and will be particularly interested to hear whether the Government will accept Amendment No. 221C which deals with the change to the affirmative resolution procedure.

<P>
<A NAME="60711-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Stanley of Alderley: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, perhaps I may speak now rather than speak to each amendment as it is called. I believe that that will make the process quicker and simpler. We should all remember what the noble Lord said; namely, that the purpose of the amendments is to ensure the confidence of landowners to offer land for exempt rural housing developments. The encouraging aspect is that all parties accept that fact, especially the Government, as evidenced by their tabling of Amendment No. 217A. That amendment makes it a duty to consult before making an exempt area non-exempt.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para15"></a>Without wishing to look a gift horse in the mouth--which, of course, I am doing--there are snags to the Government's amendment. In particular, what happens if no agreement is reached? If that were to be the case, it would surely be in everyone's interest, especially the Government's, to have the matter discussed in the open by Parliament. Hence the need for our Amendment No. 221 which would require an affirmative order.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para16"></a>I shall be most interested to hear the reply of my noble friend the Minister as to whether he likes or dislikes our amendments. Perhaps I may remind my noble friend that such a change would not take up much parliamentary time because, as my noble friend Lord Mackay said in Committee:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For the great majority of settlements the exemptions are never likely to change".--[Official Report, 11/6/96; col. 1584.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Like the noble Lord, Lord Carter, perhaps I may go further and apologise for the tabling of Amendment No. 221. I fully understand that that would have meant that all changes after six months would have to be dealt with by affirmative order. That is not what we desire. We are really only interested in the second amendment which was tabled yesterday. Indeed, I will understand if my noble friend Lord Ferrers feels that he needs to take a little time to consider the amendment. I believe that we have rather sprung the matter upon him. I very much regret that fact.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para17"></a>As regards Amendment No. 217, I am afraid that I failed to notice in Committee that my noble friend Lord Mackay did not give me a complete answer <P>


<a name="column_501"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 501</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regarding what happens to the money when a house which was exempt becomes non-exempt and is sold. However, my noble friend also said in Committee (at col. 1584 of Hansard) that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"where they [the landowners] have donated land and the tenant subsequently buys, the benefit of their generosity is simply rolled over into replacement housing". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is absolutely fine: but where? Will the replacement housing still be in the landowner's ownership, parish or district? I fear that I may well be far more parochial than my noble friend on the Front Bench as I would wish that money to replace something fairly locally.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-15_para18"></a>Perhaps my noble friend would also care to look with care at the points made by my noble friend Lord Dundonald in Committee (at col. 1590 of Hansard). He pointed out that such houses will be undervalued when they are sold for various reasons, so that the money raised will not be enough to buy a replacement house. I hope that my noble friend will be able to be positive as regards the affirmative order.

<A NAME="60711-16_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   My Lords, unfortunately, I was unable to be present in the Chamber during the Committee stage. However, I should just like to say how much I welcome the positive steps that the Government are taking in implementing the commitments that they made under the rural White Paper. It seems to me that identifying settlements in the countryside where the right to buy will be restricted is a sensible move. Indeed, I know that it has wide-spread support.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para0"></a>However, I have a degree of concern in that respect which has already been addressed by my noble friend Lord Stanley of Alderley. I just wonder whether the Government are prepared further to consider the matter. Clearly, low-cost housing depends to a degree on the willingness of owners to allow land to be sold at rates below market value. I am quite certain that it would cause very considerably grievance if such properties were later exempted from the exclusion of the right to buy, without those involved being properly consulted and the matter fully debated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para1"></a>I appreciate that the Government have introduced the amendment. However, I doubt whether it goes quite as far as it ought to. I am a little confused with these amendments. I must admit that I do not understand how they all fit in together. Nevertheless, I understand the principles behind them. I realise that they seek to find ways of ensuring that we can proceed in the best possible way, given the excellent lead that the Government have already set.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para2"></a>Personally speaking, I am not particularly attracted by the idea that, once settlements have been designated, they should be so for all time. After all, as we all know and appreciate, the countryside is a dynamic place. There will inevitably be times in the future when the Government will see fit to allow changes to be made. Moreover, I have to say that I am really not a believer in the insistence that any proceeds derived from such a sale should necessarily be reinvested in the same source. I believe that that can lead to imprudence and I am quite certain that my noble friends on the Front Bench will resist it rigorously, and they would have my support.

<A NAME = "60711-16_para3"></a>Amendment No. 221C, concerning approval by resolution of Parliament, is something which we ought to look at very carefully indeed. I am certain that, if dwellings are to be redesignated, the resolution should be subject to approval of both Houses of Parliament. I feel certain that that will be welcomed not just by local communities but also by local councils and indeed by those owners who have allowed land to go forward at a cheaper rate than it might otherwise have done. I hope, therefore, that my noble friends will consider this issue very seriously indeed. The Government have gone so far in this matter--and I congratulate them on that--that I think it would be a pity to spoil it for a ha'p'orth of tar.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, our concern from these Benches is that the rural exemption should be as good and effective an exemption as it can be. I will not say more, given the hour.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-16_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Peel may find this a little complicated because of all the amendments--I dare say he is not alone--but we are dealing with one subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para4"></a>I apologise to your Lordships for the fact that it was not possible for me to put down Amendment No. 217A earlier. My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing had already written to my noble friend Lord Shuttleworth telling him of our intentions. My noble friend is, of course, the chairman of the Rural Development Commission, and the letter was copied to those noble Lords who had expressed an interest in the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para5"></a>I hope that the amendment deals with most of the concerns that your Lordships have expressed and that your Lordships will consider it a better amendment than those which your Lordships have been kind enough graciously to put down.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para6"></a>Perhaps I may say what we have tried to do. Clause 17 allows the Secretary of State to designate rural areas where the new right to acquire will not be allowed to operate. We have published a consultation paper explaining the general approach which we propose to take in England, using a settlement population of 3,000 as our guideline. We are now consulting on the details for all the counties of England, and on the proposals for Wales. We shall listen carefully to the special cases for the exclusion of larger settlements with equally good claim.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para7"></a>I recognise the concerns about the arrangements for changing our rural exemptions. That is why we are proposing Amendment No. 217A which will require the Secretary of State to consult the local authorities which are affected as well as the representatives of social landlords before any designation is removed. Local interests will be warned of any proposed changes before an order is laid before Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para8"></a>As my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish made clear in Committee, if a settlement's population goes over the 3,000 population mark, tenants will not suddenly gain the new right to buy. That would only happen if the rural designations were changed. It would <P>


<a name="column_503"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 503</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be quite absurd if all of a sudden when five more people came into a village, taking the population to over 3,000, everyone suddenly acquired the right to buy. Once the designation is there, it is reckoned to be there for some time. We cannot rule out the possibility that a revision may be necessary where a small village grows into a new town over the years or where mistakes have been made. Obviously, if that happens, it must be remedied. Clearly the situation is grossly changed if a Milton Keynes is suddenly made to grow up around a small village. Once the rural exemptions are made, we do not intend continually to revisit them. For the great majority of settlements the exemptions are never likely to change. My amendment ensures that any changes will now also have to be consulted on before an order is laid before Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, wondered what the timetable was for designation of rural areas. The position is that the consultation process will finish at the end of the month and we shall then need to consider the responses. We hope to lay the orders shortly afterwards.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para10"></a>Taken together, Amendments Nos. 212, 213, 215, 219 and 220 in the name of my noble friend Lord Peyton would remove the Secretary of State's discretionary powers to designate rural areas and make it a requirement to designate. This obligation implies that rural designations will have to be continually reviewed and updated, which is obviously undesirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para11"></a>In our consultations we are using a 3,000 population guideline. I do not think that it should be written on the face of the Bill, as Amendment No. 220 in the name of my noble friend Lord Peyton suggests. That would prevent our having the flexibility we need in order to deal, for example, with the different circumstances in Wales, where a different approach is needed. The 10,000 population limit in the noble Lord's amendment, Amendment No. 219, would also cause the same difficulty and would limit the scope to correct any errors.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para12"></a>In our consultation exercise we invited comments on special cases. Amendment No. 220 in the name of my noble friend Lord Peyton, allows special cases where the Secretary of State is satisfied that there is likely to be particular difficulty in securing land for replacement properties. Replacement properties do not only have to be newly-built properties. Sale proceeds can be used to buy existing properties on the open market. My noble friend's amendment would limit our discretion to deal with special cases, on whatever grounds they may be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para13"></a>Our proposals for the rural exemption will protect small rural villages where replacement could be particularly difficult. Our method will allow a certain degree of flexibility to take account of the specific problems of certain areas. In my Amendment No. 217A we are proposing that the Secretary of State must consult before a designation is removed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para14"></a>Amendments Nos. 218 and 221 standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and my noble friend Lord Stanley of Alderley, and Amendment No. 221C, which stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, propose in slightly different ways that any subsequent <P>


<a name="column_504"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 504</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>changes to the rural designations would be by affirmative resolution. We always have this argument. Whenever anyone suggests that something should be done by a negative resolution everyone jumps up and says that it ought to be done by an affirmative resolution. The fact is that a negative resolution is as debatable as an affirmative resolution. If everything is put into an affirmative resolution, not only does it take up the time of Parliament but it also makes having a negative resolution rather absurd. Obviously, certain things have to be done by affirmative resolution. However, I do not think that is so in this particular case because it is not expected that there will be many alterations. In any case, if it were a negative resolution procedure, it could still be debated. The nature of these provisions is consistent with the use of negative resolutions and it has been endorsed by the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para15"></a>If we were to use a positive resolution, it could raise the curious spectre of hybridity. Your Lordships may think that that is curious, and up to a point so do I, but apparently that is a fact. Hybrid procedures apply only to affirmative orders. They mean that one person who is affected can pray against the order. One merely looks back a few years to the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill. That was of a slightly different character, I agree, but it involved the hybridity issue and we all got into a muddle--we did not get into a muddle; the noble Lords opposite did so. They were the Government, and they walked into the mud. I suggest that we do not do so over this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para16"></a>Amendment No. 217, also in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and my noble friend Lord Stanley is concerned with the use of sale proceeds. The noble Lord said that my noble friend Lord Mackay had failed to address the point on the last occasion. I am sure that, if he failed to address it, it was merely because he was anxious to address all the other points so copiously and correctly that that one happened to escape him.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para17"></a>Perhaps I may explain how we envisage the Housing Corporation using its power to determine the use of the disposals proceeds fund, because it is an important point.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para18"></a>My noble friend Lord Peel said that he did not want the sales recycled necessarily in the same place. I think I know what he means; and I think that I agree with him if by "the same place" one means physically, almost in juxtaposition with the existing sale. We expect that sale proceeds will normally be recycled in the same local authority area. But there needs to be some flexibility in order to take account of circumstances where more social housing is not a local requirement. Replacements will have to meet local priority needs. Associations will have to inform local authorities of all sales and they will be obliged to consult the local authority when deciding on the type, location and nomination arrangements for replacements. If the agreed need is for replacements in a particular area, whether that is a rural or urban area, that is where the sale proceeds should be directed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para19"></a>I hope that my noble friends will understand that. For instance, a piece of land might have been given by a forebear many years ago. If the housing associations <P>


<a name="column_505"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 505</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were to sell some of those flats, it might be imprudent, unnecessary and actually wrong to provide the replacement right next door. The point is that this system will allow people to purchase their houses and to become owner occupiers. The system then allows that money to be recycled again into social housing where that social housing is most appropriately required.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-16_para20"></a>I hope that with that explanation noble Lords will come to the conclusion that on the whole my Amendment No. 217A is a smashing amendment and will resolve the problems that noble Lords have expressed. We have to be careful not to confuse the matter with too many straitjackets and legalities.

<P>
<A NAME="60711-17_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Kinnoull: </B>   My Lords, before my noble friend sits down, I understand that I missed my opportunity to speak to an amendment within the grouping. I do not intend to waste the time of the House. However, perhaps I may ask my noble friend about Amendment No. 217A. On redesignating an area, the Secretary of State naturally and rightly consults the local authority and bodies appearing to him to be representative of registered social landlords but not the landed charity bodies which provide land. In many cases they provide land under a Rule 106 agreement, with the intention of providing land for social purposes. I hope that he will consider including a paragraph (c): that the Secretary of State would consult those bodies. Those bodies feel aggrieved. On many occasions they have stretched their duties, and provided land at a much cheaper rate than a charity normally should. A charity has a duty to sell its assets at the best possible price. However, through a Rule 106 agreement those bodies have been allowed to act in that way. If the Rule 106 agreements do not stand up in future, charitable bodies will have a more difficult task. There is a strong case for a paragraph (c). It would make my noble friend's amendment even more "smashing" than at present.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-17_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted to see the reappearance of my noble friend. I thought that, having gone through the Division Lobby, he had become so excited that he had gone home. I am delighted that that is not the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-17_para0"></a>My noble friend asks why we do not consult with those who have given the land. The principle is fairly simple although I accept that some people do not take too readily to it. The principle is this. Where you have some form of social housing, people ought to be able to buy their house or flat. The money can then be recycled to provide other social housing, and those people then become owner occupiers. That is the principle; that can happen anywhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-17_para1"></a>We then say that it must not occur in small areas. If one has a village of, say, only 3,000 people and people have the right to buy one runs out of social housing, and almost certainly it would be difficult to find other land in that small village in which to create new social housing. That is the reason that one excludes those villages.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-17_para2"></a>However, if in time those villages were to become bigger with, say, 10,000 people--in that case it would be well over the limit--those people ought to be allowed <P>


<a name="column_506"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 506</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the right to buy. I do not see that consultation with those who have provided the land is any more necessary in that case than in towns which are not excluded. Because charitable institutions may have bought the land, and may have owned the land, they will then have the finance to buy more new land and provide other houses.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-17_para3"></a>I hope that my noble friend realises that the paragraph (c) which he suggests, attractive though it may be, is an irrelevance in this case, if I may so say with respect. Once a village is over the 3,000 limit, it is in a non-designated area and is in exactly the same position as any other non-designated area.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60711-17_para20"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment returns to the subject of the amount of reimbursement to a registered social landlord. At the last stage of the Bill the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, said several times that the registered social landlords who sell under the new right to buy scheme will receive the market value of the property. I was not convincing as to my concerns that the nominal allowance written into the Bill would be sufficient to ensure that the market value and full reimbursement would be received. I hope that it may be worth returning to the matter for a second time.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-17_para21"></a>A housing association will not be able to replace like with like. There will not be equivalent reinstatement. With the system as proposed, the proceeds of sale from the tenant will be the discount paid into a disposal proceeds fund and the housing authority will be able to buy a replacement dwelling from the fund. It will be able to deduct from the proceeds which go into the fund a nominal allowance but none of the costs will be paid by the Government, and that is the point.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-17_para22"></a>At the last stage I mentioned certain costs. They include all the time involved in dealing with the procedure of selling; the overheads time (if I may so describe it) setting up the procedures; the staff time administering the scheme and dealing with particular sales, giving advice to sellers and purchasers and so on; and the usual costs of transferring property--conveyancing fees, valuation costs, disbursements such as stamp duty and land registry fees. With regard to the replacement dwelling, there will be the valuation and the fees incurred in acquiring the replacement dwelling; all the overheads associated with dealing with the replacement as part of the work of the housing association and the normal office costs; and repair costs which may be required to bring the replacement property up to a standard to match the one which has been bought. I hope that that gives some indication of the kind of costs that may be incurred.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-17_para23"></a>The amendment sets out the matter at some length and as well as defining replacement costs adds the issue of interest. At the last stage I referred to it as being at a high rate, which shows just how little litigation I do because it reduced from the 15 per cent. I mentioned--that was the rate some years ago--to the more recent 8 per cent. interest on a judgment debt, which is the way of assessing interest. The point is that there should be a true reimbursement. The aggregate of the discounts will not be adequate in my view. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="60711-18_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness's amendment would mean that in addition to funding the <P>


<a name="column_509"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 509</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tenant's discount, the corporation would fund further possible sales costs, such as she mentioned--staff time, valuation fees, legal fees and so forth.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para0"></a>It is right that, as in any business, the association's costs should be met from sales. That happens in the normal course of events. It is also the approach taken in the existing right to buy scheme for local authority housing. Indeed, in the voluntary purchase grant scheme for housing associations' existing stock, which started this year, the same principle is used. It has been accepted by landlords for the voluntary scheme and over 120 now take part.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para1"></a>Housing association landlords will be permitted to deduct the same fixed allowance as under the existing right to buy to cover their administrative costs for each sale. For houses, the allowance would be &#163;619. For flats, it would be &#163;1,391 in order to reflect the extra costs involved in giving estimates of service charges for repairs over the first five years.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para2"></a>In addition, landlords will be able to recover from their receipts the costs of valuation and survey fees. These are monitored and are subject to audit by the corporation. Typical costs, estimated by the Housing Corporation, are around 0.25 per cent. of value for valuation fees and about 0.5 per cent. for legal fees. On a &#163;50,000 property this would be an additional &#163;375, which I hope the noble Baroness will agree is not a vast sum. These costs would be deducted from the receipts from the sale before they went into the disposal proceeds fund. In total the Housing Corporation estimates that the costs might be in the region of &#163;1,000 to &#163;2,000.

<A NAME = "60711-18_para3"></a>I recognise the noble Baroness's concerns that this might reduce the sale proceeds which would be available for recycling into replacement properties. But overall, as a proportion of receipts, these costs are likely to be very small.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para4"></a>The noble Baroness was concerned that there would not be like for like because a dwelling would be sold for &#163;60,000 and there would not be &#163;60,000 with which to buy the next one. But one cannot regard this as an exact science. Costs and prices move up and down and interest rates move up and down. There will be gainers and losers on the side of the landlord and of the tenant. Inevitably, someone has to pay the costs. If the corporation were to pay those costs, it would increase its own costs and the result would be that it would be able to pay less for additional houses and additional grant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para5"></a>The natural result would be to reduce the amount of money which would be available for the rest of the corporation's housing programme. We do not wish to make the scheme more expensive overall, or administratively cumbersome; nor, indeed, do we wish to reduce the amount of work which the housing associations can do.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para6"></a>I like to think that we have struck the right balance. There will be expenses which will have to be paid by the tenant in purchasing the property and expenses to be paid by the landlord in selling it. The concept of a ring-fenced replacement fund is a significant policy <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>development. The corporation funds the tenant's discount through the grant. The associations' costs are met from receipts, as with the existing right to buy and the voluntary scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para7"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will feel on reconsideration that it is fair for each side to bear its proportion of costs. In the end the cost to the landlord is only a very small proportion of the sale proceeds. I believe that that is the best way to proceed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-18_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, my concern is in relation to ensuring that stock is replaced. So those to whom I want to be fair are the prospective occupiers of replacement stock. Given that we are talking about what is in effect a compulsory purchase from a charity, it was worth raising the point again, particularly when one thinks that in the case of a compulsory purchase order from an individual the full costs would be reimbursed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para8"></a>I shall feel a little better about this if, at any rate, the Government acknowledge--as I believe the noble Earl did in a way that his noble friend did not--that there are costs which have to be borne and that one cannot quite compare like with like. The exercise inevitably involves costs, and those costs will be lost from the totality of the value of the housing. Having said that and made my point in a way which is perhaps difficult to rebut because of the time in the debate at which I make it, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 221E I shall speak also to Amendment No. 221F. The first of these amendments in Clause 25 seeks to tempt the Government into giving a categorical assurance that the proceeds of sale following a sale under the right-to-buy scheme will be applied in acquiring a replacement dwelling. As Clause 25(1) stands, the application of the proceeds is,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for such purposes and in such manner as the Corporation may determine". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para12"></a>I am not suggesting that the proceeds will be spent frivolously. But the direct connection between proceeds and the replacement dwelling is not present in the Bill as we should like to see it. The purpose of the second amendment, which inserts a time period, is to ensure that an association would have the right to replace the dwelling, putting a minimum time on the corporation's power to deal with the proceeds of the sale.

In the debate on Amendment No. 221B I explained how the corporation will use its power to determine the use of this fund, the purpose of which will be to provide replacement properties for rent.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para13"></a>We wish to ensure that replacements meet local need, and that local authorities are involved in any decisions made. Associations will have to inform local authorities of sales and consult them when deciding on the type and location of any new dwelling and any nomination arrangements. I am sure that we all agree that local consultation is sensible. That will be set out in the corporation's determination to ensure that all landlords comply.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para14"></a>Purchase grants and social housing grant will be put into the disposal proceeds funds--that is public money. It is important that the corporation should have some control over its use and be able to give detailed guidance on the procedures to be followed when it is spent. The corporation intends to consult with local authorities and others before it issues the determination which will set all that out.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para15"></a>I am sure that the noble Baroness shares our concern that the fund is used wisely. But Amendment No. 221E would allow associations to replace properties without reference to any further guidance, and it also appears to dilute the principle of replacement by suggesting that other uses for the fund may be specified by the corporation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para16"></a>Amendment No. 221F would give a time limit of five years within which sale receipts should be recycled. Under the current provisions of the Bill the time limit will be governed by a determination which will be issued by the corporation. We agree that there needs to be a time limit, but our current view is that it should be three years rather than five.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para17"></a>The corporation will consult before the determination is issued. We would prefer to have the flexibility to set a time limit after the consultation has taken place, and to have the discretion to review the limit if any problems arise in practice. We believe that that will be more satisfactory than having it fixed in primary legislation. I hope that on reflection the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, agrees.

I do not imagine that there is any way in which the Government can require that any time limit will apply other than through their good relations with the corporation. I am not receiving any feedback in that regard so I am probably right.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-18_para18"></a>With regard to the purposes for which funds are applied, as Clause 25(1) stands the normal meaning of the words is that it is as wide as can be. The provision states,
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for such purposes and in such manner as the Corporation may determine". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I accept that it is not intended to use the funds other than for the purposes that we have been debating. I see no firm reassurance of that and do not believe that I shall get any further in making this point tonight.

Officials discussed this clause with representatives of the British Bankers' Association and the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the amendments reflect those discussions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-19_para1"></a>This is not a power we expect the corporation to have to use often. But should it meet resistance it needs to be able to take effective action. In the first instance it should pursue the registered social landlord. A notice requiring another person or organisation to provide information should only be issued where either a registered social landlord has failed to comply with a notice or the corporation has strong reasons to believe the information or documents in question are not in the possession of the landlord. This amendment makes that procedure explicit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-19_para2"></a>There was concern about the protection provided in the clause for the solicitors and bankers of a registered social landlord.

This makes it clear where responsibility lies. It is particularly appropriate because, in effect, the corporations are acting as government's agent in handling these loans.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-20_para8"></a>The revised provisions in these amendments reflect two factors which have become clear in the work already undertaken by the corporations to examine and describe their portfolios and in the preliminary inquiries by Rothschild. The first is that there is, as yet, no certainty about the best ways in which the latent value of these loans could be realised. It will not be possible to take a view on the best approach for several months. It is quite possible that some loans will not be suitable for sale and that there may need to be intermediate activity prior to sale in order to produce the most cost-effective solution. The provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of Amendment No. 236 ensure that the corporations should be able to take such steps short of outright sale as are sensible to achieve this. Any decision will be taken in the light of the best interests of the taxpayer.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-20_para9"></a>The second point deals with a potential problem. A standard form of charge used by the corporation in the 1970s had a rather curious provision to the effect that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Corporation may at any time after its power of sale has become exercisable transfer the benefit of this legal charge to any person". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
It might be argued that the corporation could not transfer the charge prior to the power of sale becoming exercisable. Leading counsel has advised the Housing Corporation that this is not so and there should be no inhibition on sale. But any prospectus would have to draw attention to this scintilla of doubt. This is not satisfactory from the point of view of either the vendor or the purchaser who may be uncertain as to their position. It will certainly not be satisfactory if the taxpayer finds that the value of the loans cannot be realised because of this technicality. Therefore subsection (4) puts the position beyond doubt.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-20_para10"></a>None of this will disadvantage the borrower, or the tenant, as the terms of any loans will apply whoever holds them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-20_para11"></a>Amendment No. 237 has precisely the same effect in respect of Scottish Homes, reflecting the different wording of the Scottish legislation. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60711-20_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   My Lords, may I ask my noble friend to take one factor into consideration. Can I ask him to look at the penultimate clause in the Bill at page 124. I think he will see that the provisions of the Housing Act 1988 relating to registered housing associations do not extend to Scotland. While it is important that this amendment be considered, perhaps between now and Third Reading he will look at the extant clause.

<P>
<P>

<a name="column_518"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 518</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>moment. It introduces a very interesting concept. I understand that Rothschild is looking into the whole question of disposing of the corporation's portfolio. The purpose of the amendment, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, quite properly described, is to allow the Government, plus Rothschild, to get on with the business. But it seems odd that at Report stage in your Lordships' House, the Bill having gone through another place and having gone through Committee in our House, the Government appear to be introducing an amendment which allows Rothschild--acting for the Government--to enter into any arrangements of any description for the purpose of realising the value of whole or part of the loans portfolio of the corporation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-20_para12"></a>I can only say that, faced with this amendment at this time of night, I do not wish to argue the point. I would have wished to argue the point in Committee had the Government produced the amendment at that time. In my experience as a banker, there is something pretty odd about the Government producing an amendment at this time of night at this stage in order to shuffle off the loan portfolio of the corporation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-20_para13"></a>It is not only the loan portfolio. The amendment provides for,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the transfer of any estate or interest of the Corporation", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

I hope that the limitations of subsection (1), which states the purpose for which these powers are required, effectively limit the way in which the powers that appear in subsection (2) are used. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for the purpose of realising the value of the whole or part of its loans portfolio". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
After that restriction is then drawn widely to enable a rather diverse, and perhaps in some ways strange, portfolio to be dealt with effectively. As a point of detail, Rothschild will not enter into the arrangements. It will simply advise on them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-20_para15"></a>In general all I can offer as a comment is better late than never. It is best that we have the powers set out in this Bill which enable the loan portfolio to be dealt with properly. I apologise to the noble Lord for the fact that we did not pick up these difficulties earlier and give him time to test me on them at Committee stage. But I believe we have got them right now.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-21_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, because we are running slightly later than anticipated and because my noble friend Lord Lytton has a very early engagement tomorrow morning, he has unfortunately had to leave the House and it now falls to me to move the amendment. I do so with considerable trepidation; first, because I lack my noble friend's expertise in property matters and, secondly, because I came to the issue very late having only recently been alerted to the dire consequences for both landlords and tenants if the Bill remains unamended.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-21_para8"></a>It is probably right that I should now make it clear that I have absolutely no interest to declare. I am a landlord in a small way, but I have never been, and am never likely to become, a landlord of any property which might fall within the HMO designation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-21_para9"></a>The wording of the amendment is pretty self-explanatory. Provisions almost identical to those in this amendment were in the Bill when it received its Second Reading in another place. However, as a result of Opposition fears, chiefly concerning fire risks--mistaken fears, it is now evident--the clause was removed on the Bill's passage through the other place. When the Bill was still in the Commons almost everyone accepted the claim that fire risks in HMOs were a staggering 28 times higher than for other accommodation. By the time the Bill reached this House, the Government had realised that 28 was a ridiculous multiplier and they produced a guesstimate--it was a guesstimate rather than an estimate--that the real multiplier was about 10. However, even that is much too high. Using methodology suggested by the Office for National Statistics--you cannot find a more respectable source than that--the true multiplier works out at 1.8--less than one-fifteenth of the original claim and less than one-fifth of the amended government claim.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-21_para10"></a>Obviously, that has an enormous bearing on the degree of expensive safeguards and restrictions needed. It is almost certain that if the Minister in the other place had been aware of the true multiplier of the fire risk at <P>


<a name="column_521"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 521</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the time he would never have agreed to Opposition calls to withdraw exemption for smaller HMOs. This amendment, which, to conform to the Government's wishes, has been slightly fine-tuned in comparison with the clause in the original Bill, would ensure that the Bill accords with the Government's original intentions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-21_para11"></a>Let us not forget that if they are over-regulated the smaller dwellings that are used as HMOs will be swamped by regulations intended for genuine risk situations. A poll, admittedly a straw poll, in London indicates that 80 per cent. of landlords would simply give up. That would be sad for the landlords and an absolute tragedy for the tenants, given the overall shortage of such housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-21_para12"></a>For all the bad publicity that HMOs have received from certain vested interests, they form a vital part of the housing provision, not least in relation to the Government's housing benefit calculations and also in relation to students and other young people. A number of HMOs are considered unsafe because of overcrowding or on environmental health grounds as opposed to fire risks, but those matters are actionable under existing powers. There is no need for a registration scheme to deal with these particular abuses. Therefore, it is important that relatively limited categories where problems are inherently less likely should be excluded, leaving the real risk categories to be dealt with by means of registration. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Monson, has said, the Government did an about-face on this aspect of the Bill in another place--and quite rightly, too. It became quite clear just how complicated and difficult an area this was. We decided that we wanted these powers in secondary legislation in order to use them flexibly. We wanted to give time and consideration to how to phrase them and update them when, for example, the results of our proposed research into fire risks in HMOs became available.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-21_para13"></a>Therefore, we have sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Monson, and the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, are trying to achieve by this amendment, but we have no wish to see any of this on the face of the Bill. We are not attracted by the rather hybrid scheme--part regulation and part Bill--that is proposed. The problems are not restricted to the question of fire risks in HMOs. There are problems with drafting exclusions to cover self-contained flats, the majority of which are owner-occupied, and a number of other areas. Although the Government set out down this road originally, we are convinced that our conversion in another place was the right one. We have no attraction to this amendment whatsoever.

<P>
<A NAME="60711-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I believe that I am able to give the noble Lord some comfort in this matter. The provisions in the Bill allow local authorities to have discretion about what standard of management is appropriate in each case so that they can deal with different types and sizes of housing management organisations. We believe that that is right. But they must act reasonably and have regard to any codes of practice or management codes issued by the Department of the Environment. Those codes will be usable as evidence if the landlord should appeal to the county court, as undoubtedly he will if he feels that the conditions imposed on him are unreasonable. Although the provision in the Bill seems wide, with the addition of guidance and management codes I believe it will be clear to any individual landlord how he ought to be treated. In those circumstances, I believe that the amendment of the noble Lord is unnecessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, when the Minister said that he would have some words of comfort I thought that it was the formula which one tends to hear so often.

That will count if the matter should go as far as the county court. Therefore, I derive comfort from what the Minister has said and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(b) owned by a registered social landlord;

(c) owned by a landlord who owns land disposed in accordance with section 32 of the Housing Act 1985.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the effect of the amendment would be to exclude from the Bill's special control provisions for HMOs certain types of properties which should not be caught by them. They include residential care homes for the elderly and hostels owned by registered social landlords. Paragraph (c) covers social landlords of former local authority housing not registered by the Housing Corporation. I am sure that the Minister has taken those points and I hope for a favourable response. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, special control provisions involve very significant powers available to local authorities and we expect them to be exercised with due consideration and necessary restraint. We have therefore already provided for a number of safeguards against the misuse of these powers. Every local authority which wishes to adopt a registration scheme with special control provisions will need the special approval of the Secretary of State for that scheme. They will have to make out a strong case for their adoption.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para4"></a>I can offer the noble Lord some worthwhile assurances. Following enactment of the Bill we will be consulting widely about the model registration schemes which the Secretary of State intends to make. We have already said that, subject to the consultation, we intend to exclude from the model schemes properties owned or controlled by responsible public-sector or social landlords, such as universities and housing associations. We are also planning to exclude from the model schemes properties which come under some other regulatory regime, such as registered care homes.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para5"></a>As the categories referred to in the amendment will almost certainly be excluded from all model registration schemes, we believe that it is most unlikely that the Secretary of State will agree to their inclusion in a registration scheme containing special control provisions.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, all four amendments in the group deal with the duty of care but they involve separate points. I do not know whether it would be best to deal with them together or separately--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, the grouping has been agreed and I hope that the noble Lord will feel that he can deal with all the amendments together.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord. There are three reasons for trying to omit the civil duty of care. First, there appear to be no transitional provisions should the regulations change. An owner may have just completed a programme of works in order to comply with the duty. However, if the rules change he will immediately be in default again. If conditions have become too difficult he will simply take his house out of the multiple occupation sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para10"></a>Secondly, landlords are not in much control over what tenants do to the premises once they have handed over possession. It is a common experience that tenants may deliberately remove fire precautions, such as door closers. A landlord does not have the kind of controls available to a hotel or factory manager. Thirdly, in view of current conditions and costs, civil litigation is an extremely inefficient way of resolving disputes for most people. A tenant who is not eligible for legal aid is unlikely to be able to contemplate legal action. Equally, a landlord facing a suit from a legally-aided tenant will be in a very difficult position. Even if he has a good defence, he will not get back his costs. As my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish recently reminded us, the litigious tenancy should not be encouraged.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para11"></a>I share the concern of many in this House about the degree of improvement which is needed in the private rented sector. However, the people who will be deterred by the provisions of this clause as it stands will not be the cowboy operators on whom we all wish to clamp down. Instead, it will be the responsible landlord, honestly trying to provide good quality accommodation, and honestly trying to comply with the law, who will be worried. Such landlords may well decide to invest elsewhere, in which case there will be no accommodation available where it is needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para12"></a>Landlords already have a general duty of care under common law, which will remain operative. My amendment would only remove what seems to me almost an invitation to vexatious actions which could affect all sorts of landlords, including housing associations and local authorities, even owners of shared freeholds.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para13"></a>Amendment No. 246 allows for another category of difficulty which the duty of care may create. The buildings to which the duty will apply are extremely varied, and many are old. It is likely that there will be cases where something about the building prevents it from being made to comply fully with the regulations. There have been cases where one part of the local authority has insisted on work being done to a building, and another part of that same local authority has prohibited that work from being done because the building is a listed building which should not be altered.
<P>


<a name="column_525"></a>

<B>11 Jul 1996 : Column 525</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para14"></a>There will also be occasions when the accommodation is being made available on a temporary basis, and the expense of full compliance would be disproportionate, or the owner might be intending to demolish the building in the near future.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para15"></a>There are also the problems that arise when the tenant will not allow builders in. I have experienced that, not with an HMO, but with a single tenant property where the tenant would not allow builders in to do essential work.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para16"></a>If reasonable defences are not available for special circumstances the owner will be compelled to withdraw accommodation rather than risk prosecution or lawsuits. As with the previous amendment, I ask the House to consider that this duty be laid on the full range of HMOs, not just on the rough end of the market. It would result in the withdrawal of accommodation, for example, for students in areas where accommodation is most needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para17"></a>Amendment No. 247 is intended to avoid possible confusion between the requirements imposed by the local authority under Section 347 and the requirements of the duty of care. Under Section 347 local authorities may require works to be carried out to a house in multiple occupation before they will include it in their registration scheme. A person might reasonable suppose that once he has carried out works which the local authority had asked for, the house is then up to any standard which he was legally obliged to meet. My amendment would ensure that that would be the case. It is extremely confusing for owners and their advisers if there is duplication and overlap between different sets of regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para18"></a>Amendment No. 248 addresses the situation of landlords on whom the local authority has no plans for enforcement action, but who still have to comply with the duty of care. Responsible landlords will be able to apply for their certificate of compliance, and after carrying out any works which the local authority requires, will know that they have complied. I am aware of one council which has much experience in HMO enforcement, Leeds City Council. That council is already looking at a voluntary system of accreditation for landlords. The amendment I have proposed would put this on a statutory footing. If landlords apply it would save time and effort on the part of the local authorities in having to seek out these properties.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para19"></a>The amendment also provides for disputes to be referred to the department, as is possible for building regulations. I believe there needs to be a review system of some national standing to ensure consistent and fair interpretation of the code by different authorities across the country. With such a system in place there would probably not be many appeals.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para20"></a>Finally, there is provision for the certificate to last 10 years. Clause 71 provides for a five-year interval between Section 352 notices. It is too short a minimum interval between compulsory works in a well-run property. Five years comes round very quickly. Therefore, I propose an exemption for 10 years. <P>

<A NAME="60711-22_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, for having jumped the gun in my strictures about our increasingly litigious society. I had Amendment No. 245 in mind and I spoke to it a little too early. But it does no harm to repeat those strictures since it is such a growing evil in our society. But naturally, I agree with everything which the noble Lord, Lord Gisborough, said in favour of Amendment No. 245.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para21"></a>I also agree with him about Amendment No. 246, but particularly in respect of property which is let on a temporary basis, possibly preparatory to sale or redevelopment. It seems folly in the extreme to compel people to spend fantastic amounts of money on a building which they will be letting for only a few months.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-22_para22"></a>I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, will confirm figures which I have seen which suggest that the average cost of complying with all the regulations which are envisaged and proposed will be &#163;14,000 per HMO and, as 80 per cent. will be involved, that will mean a total expenditure of something like &#163;2.86 billion. That is a horrifying amount of money and I shall be interested to see whether the Minister will come forth with figures to confirm or refute that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I have some sympathy with the concerns of landlords which my noble friend has eloquently described. I can understand that many landlords are concerned that local authorities will act unreasonably in demanding excessive standards and requirements. I think however that those fears are ungrounded because there are various important safeguards already contained in these provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-23_para0"></a>Amendment No. 245 would remove the ability for any tenants, or others who suffer loss or injury because of a breach of the duty of care under the clause, to sue for damages. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that where a landlord has failed to provide proper facilities or adequate fire precautions, it is correct that tenants or others affected should be able to obtain redress. If the tenant is responsible for lack of fire precautions, he will get nowhere in court.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-23_para1"></a>Amendment No. 246 proposes that various factors should be taken into account when deciding that a breach of the duty has occurred--such as the age and location of the property. It also provides that there should be some consideration of whether the amount of works a local authority may wish to see carried out to a property are in proportion to the risks to the tenants. Either party could argue that because of these factors the code of practice which the Government propose to make setting out a new national standard for HMOs, was not appropriate and the standards demanded were not reasonably practical to achieve and it would be for the court to reach a judgment on the facts of each case.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-23_para2"></a>I fear that the proposal outlined in Amendment No. 248 would have some very undesirable side effects. Requiring local authorities to react to every request from landlords to inspect and certify their properties would be unrealistic.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-23_para3"></a>Local authorities would find their time taken up inspecting and certifying HMOs managed by responsible landlords and kept in a reasonable condition, when they should be focusing their expertise on those properties most at risk where the worst conditions can be found. We have for some time been encouraging local authorities to adopt a risk assessment approach in dealing with HMO problems. Many have already adopted such methods. Although well intentioned, the proposal could throw those strategies into disarray.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-23_para4"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 247 would exempt all premises which have been registered by a local authority operating a scheme with control provisions, from the duty of care under the clause. I accept that when a property has been registered by the local authority it will be of an appropriate standard, and the manager is unlikely to be in breach of the duty of care. There is no guarantee, however, that these standards will be maintained throughout the intervening five-year period.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-23_para5"></a>The duty of care requires the landlord to take only reasonably practicable steps. If the code changes, no doubt it will say something about transitional provisions, depending on the circumstances. Often, it will not be appropriate to upgrade to the latest standard if reasonably modern standards have been complied with. Compliance with works required in a Section 352 notice by the local authority would be prima facie evidence that the duty of care had been complied with in respect of that matter. I hope that what I have said contains sufficient comfort for my noble friend and that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend the Minister for that explanation. He speaks with utter reasonableness, as if local authorities will be reasonable. Indeed, I hope they will. However, there have been cases where local authorities have insisted upon unreasonable provisions and even ones which, as I mentioned, contradicted one another and left people not knowing what to do. However, provided that they act on that, and take a reasonable attitude, all will be well. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-23_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I moved an amendment at the last stage with regard to fuel appliances. At that time, the Minister indicated that the Health and Safety Commission was bringing forward an urgent amendment and that it intended to issue a consultative document this month with a view to introducing regulations by the end of October. When replying, I wonder whether the noble Lord can give us any current news with regard to the commission's consultation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60711-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am not certain whether that information from my advisers will reach me in time for me to forward it to the noble Baroness now. Nonetheless, I shall speak fairly fast. I have considerable sympathy with the concern expressed by the noble Lord about the dangers of carbon monoxide and his wish that there should be clear and effective enforcement of maintenance standards in houses of multiple occupation to minimise those risks.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-23_para9"></a>In relation to the specific amendment proposed, I should tell the noble Lord that we feel it to be unnecessary. It seeks to amend Section 369 of the Housing Act 1985, which provides for the Secretary of State to issue a code of management practice for HMOs. The section as presently drafted gives specific examples such as water supply, drainage and fire precautions to which any code may apply, and I agree that there may be a slight presentational advantage for it to refer also to gas and solid fuel appliances. However, I should point out that the management code currently in force does contain a section dealing with gas and electricity appliances, and space and water heating installations. Therefore I do not see any real advantage to be gained in amending the section in the way proposed, especially as there is no reference in the amendment to electric or oil-fired appliances.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-23_para10"></a>My understanding is that the current arrangements work satisfactorily. Local authority enforcement officers have the lead responsibility in enforcing standards in HMOs, but, if they wish to invoke the additional powers under the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations, they can call in inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711-23_para11"></a>I am sorry to have to confess that I do not have with me details of the dates as regards the Health and Safety Commission's consultations on changes in the gas safety regulations. However, I shall write to the noble Baroness on the matter. It may also be helpful if I offer to write to my honourable friend Sir Paul Beresford, the Minister responsible for the work of the HSE, and invite his views about the problems which have been raised in this and previous debates both by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord.

<A NAME = "60711-23_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the effect of the amendment that I propose is to extend from four to eight weeks the period within which, after making a control order under Section 379 of the Housing Act 1985, a local housing authority must decide on the course of action it intends to take to follow up the making of the control order. A similar proposal was moved in Committee by my noble friend but as part of far-reaching reforms to local authorities' powers in relation to control orders. We thought at that point that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, gave a rather sympathetic reply and I very much hope that the noble Lord will give a sympathetic reply to the amendment that I move on behalf of my noble friend Lord Dubs.

Copies are being placed in the Library. This is the most outstanding example of partnership between government and industry to achieve an important environmental goal. We hope that the rest of Europe will follow this example. The regulations are based on the principles of a shared approach and the 15th December agreement, as set out in my right honourable friend's Answer to the honourable Member for Eastbourne on 7th May in another place, [Official Report, columns 73-75]. They are the outcome of a very substantial series of discussions with business to find the best way in which we can work together to meet an environmental goal: in this case the need to recover greater value from the 8 million tonnes of packaging waste which we generate each year.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60711w01_para0"></a>This is a pioneering process of partnership and dialogue which has wider lessons for how we seek to achieve environmental objectives. Inevitably there were differences of view along the way and difficult judgments on the right balance between fairness, effectiveness and minimising burden. There will be many issues in these proposals requiring further careful consideration on which the Government are keen to obtain views. Nevertheless we believe that there is a growing consensus on the best way forward, and the active and continuing involvement of all sectors is the right way to generate a sustainable long term approach, as well as achieving the co-operation necessary between businesses.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711w01_para1"></a>As an example of how we can help businesses assess what is required, we are making available on request a PC operable disc which will calculate the tonnage obligation for an individual business in relation to its own processes and patterns of trade.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711w01_para2"></a>There are three underlying aims which the Government remain committed to achieve:
(i) A more sustainable approach to dealing with packaging waste by internalising the costs of meeting higher targets for recovery and recycling. This harnesses the efficiency and creativity of the supply chain to meet environmental goals. Additional costs to business may, like other costs, be passed on to consumers, to the extent that they are not absorbed;
(ii) To help implement the EC directive. The main purpose of the EC directive on packaging and packaging waste is to ensure a single market for the free circulation of packaging but, in addition, member states must meet the minimum targets for recycling and recovery;
(iii) To achieve both these ends in the most efficient and least burdensome manner. The principle of having the choice of doing so through collective business-led schemes, which have the maximum freedom and flexibility in which to operate, remains a fundamental objective.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711w01_para3"></a>We are greatly encouraged by the work now under way to develop collective business operated schemes, and in particular the efforts to establish VALPAK, which is supported by 60 leading United Kingdom businesses. The establishment of such schemes will be evidence that, when given the opportunity, industry will deliver environmental targets with real efficiency gains.

<A NAME = "60711w01_para4"></a>This is a new approach. We have endeavoured to achieve a wide measure of consensus, but we will need to monitor closely the operation of the regulations and review their impact and effectiveness. The Advisory Committee on Packaging has proposed a framework for future monitoring and review which we fully endorse. The committee will have a major part to play over the next two years and we shall follow its advice carefully in the future development of this initiative.

They must also place notices of the application in local newspapers and the London Gazette. The Secretary of State is required by the 1992 Act to consider all valid objections and, where necessary or appropriate, arrange for a local public inquiry to be held into the application. The Secretary of State will make a determination only after taking into account all objections which have not been withdrawn, or, where an inquiry is held, the report and recommendation of the independent inspector. The specific issues which will be relevant to the decision whether to make the order will vary from case to case. For applications involving proposals of national significance, Parliament is given the opportunity to debate and vote on the principle of the project. Only if both Houses approve such a proposal will it go forward to a public inquiry.

<A NAME="60711w02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Responsibility for this matter has been delegated to the Director General of the Prison Service, who has been asked to arrange for a reply to be given.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711w02_para0"></a>Letter to Lord Marlesford from the Director General of the Prison Service, Mr. Richard Tilt, dated 11th July 1996.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711w02_para1"></a>Lady Blatch has asked me to reply to your recent Question about the numbering given to prisoners when they are given custodial sentences.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711w02_para2"></a>Prisoners are not automatically given fresh prison numbers when they receive new sentences. A fresh number is normally issued where a person is received into custody for a period that is wholly unrelated to previous periods of imprisonment. A sentenced prisoner receiving a further sentence or one who has been recalled to prison after release on licence would normally retain the same number.
<P>

<A NAME = "60711w02_para3"></a>Everyone received into prison has immediately to be given a unique identification number, irrespective of their status as an unconvicted, convicted or civil prisoner. Not all prisoners committed to prison have been charged or convicted of criminal offences and so do not have criminal record numbers. As no externally generated number can be guaranteed to be available for use at the point of first arrival, each establishment holds a set of prison numbers to allocate to prisoners on first reception.
