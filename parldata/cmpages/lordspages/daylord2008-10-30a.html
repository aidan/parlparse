Does he not agree that the obscene rises in rewards, bonuses and the like for corporate executives in recent years mean that the voice of fairness must now be heard inside the remuneration committees of companies and similar bodies? Does he not also agree that the Government must consider, urgently and immediately, some control over the membership of remuneration committees of all public companies in the longer run and, in the short run, of those companies in which public money has been invested for shares?</p>

The public are very dissatisfied that the BBC employee who is suspended&#151;I think that is the word&#151;is going to earn &#163;16,000 a day for doing nothing on a pretty regular basis.

It has indicated in its letter that it will expect the remuneration of senior bank employees to relate to performance, otherwise the authority will use powers that it has to operate sanctions against banks. Although I take some comfort from the fact that I am in line with what predecessors have said from this Dispatch Box in representing my own Government, I say that we are in a new situation and the Government expect, particularly with regard to banks and the financial sector, an improvement in the relationship between performance and pay.</p>

With all these banks now receiving all this money, are they now in the private sector or the public sector? I do not know what the National Statistician says, but to those of us who tried to follow what the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, said, it looks as if they are in the public sector, in which case they ought to follow precisely public sector pay guidelines.</p>

The Financial Services Authority is of course concerned particularly about those banks in which the Government have made a significant input of resources and about exercising powers with regard to that. However, as I said in response to the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, from the Liberal Benches, the Financial Services Authority is concerned not just about those banks, but the banking and financial sector as a whole. It has made it clear in its letter that, where the companies concerned require government support, that support will be conditional on the Financial Services Authority examining the reports on directors&#146; pay that the firms have to produce, and that, where they reflect unsatisfactory circumstances, the FSA will act.</p>

She is right that many workers who have no direct responsibility for the catastrophic decisions that were taken will pay the price, but the House will appreciate that some very significant lessons have been learnt by the banking and financial sector&#151;and the Government have indicated that they intend to monitor the situation closely.</p>

I know that RSLs use their own money for this, but I am not convinced that buying back shares in shared ownership homes to help older people is the most appropriate role for social housing grants. Essentially, we need to build more homes, as the noble Baroness knows, and more quality homes for older people, not just the traditional residential homes.

Perhaps I could ask the Minister a question relating to younger shared owners, as they form a particularly vulnerable group at this time of recession. They were marginal home buyers; now mortgage repossessions are running at some 45,000 per annum and nearly 1,000 families a week lose their homes through mortgage repossessions, with all the horrors that go with that. Will the Minister use her considerable influence with the housing associations and the Homes and Communities Agency to try to ensure that there are rescue packages in place for those shared owners who run into mortgage difficulty so that perhaps they can sell back the share that they have purchased from the housing association, become tenants eligible for housing benefit and stay put where they are, so we do not see the horrors of homelessness that follow from repossession?</p>

Young shared owners will be eligible for help with their mortgages if they fulfil the criteria of vulnerability for the new mortgage rescue scheme that is in development now. In addition, he is quite right in saying that RSLs have the option to buy back shares if shared owners cannot keep up the payments because of a change in financial circumstances. They have the discretion to buy back a share or buy out owners so they can reoccupy the property as a tenant. I would be very happy to discuss those measures in more detail with the noble Lord, because our department is looking at all ways in which to free up the housing market and support home owners at the moment.</p>

Bids are coming forward and the proportion of the funding going on homes for older people is increasing. However, the noble Lord is quite right: because we are concerned that older people do not have sufficient choice and quality in their housing, we last year produced a document, <I>A National Strategy for H</I><I>ousing in an </I><I>A</I><I>geing </I><I>S</I><I>ociety</I> that addresses long-term issues as well as putting forward specific short-term help for older people.</p>

Many of the people who qualified had incomes of less than &#163;10,000, so it was never intended as a massive expansion for older people. I can verify that the scheme is based on research. We need to bear in mind that about 12,000 units are provided for older people from 100 housing associations. As I said, because we are concerned about improving access, the Housing Corporation is freeing up its bidding processes and offering incentives to local authorities to come forward with more allocations. We are looking at an expansion in what we are providing.</p>

What is their attitude to the suggestion that emerged at a meeting in Kinshasa on Tuesday, chaired by the president and attended by Her Majesty&#146;s ambassador, and for which France, as president of the EU, has shown some enthusiasm, for a strong force&#151;a kind of &#147;Artemis mark II&#148;&#151;to strengthen MONUC&#146;s efforts to restore peace in the DRC and so in the region, and to restore space for pursuit of the vital Amani programme?</p>

There is chaos in the eastern Congo. The city of Goma is subject to an extraordinary degree of lawlessness. However, I can assure noble Lords that there is now a ceasefire which has held since late last night. The rebels are no longer advancing on Goma. I have within the past hour spoken to the UN special representative in the Congo and he renewed the request for European troops.

What is going on in the Congo, and has gone on for the past 45 years since the total failure of decolonisation, has been described as the world&#146;s worst humanitarian disaster. As the Minister rightly says, it has got very much worse in the past 72 hours. Obviously, we from this island cannot solve the tragedy or help directly by ourselves, and we must work with others. Where would he put the priority? Is it in trying to get more reinforcement for the UN troops, who seem to be in no position to stop the Rwandan-backed rebels&#151;if they are Rwandan-backed? Or can some European contribution be made given that Mr Kouchner in Paris is saying that there should be an EU force of 1,500 troops but Mr Solana is saying that he does not want troops, he only wants diplomacy? Could we really work bilaterally with our good friends in Europe and possibly avoid any undue European Union bureaucracy which would only delay things in helping these poor people?</p>

A failure to act with sufficient will and energy on the agreement has led to this flare-up of violence and a renewed political effort to ensure that it is implemented is key.</p>

We have made &#163;20 million available to the pooled humanitarian fund of which &#163;15 million had already been passed on to agencies. However, we must keep in mind the prospect that peace will not be restored. Therefore, we certainly cannot rule out an additional deployment, whether it is a strengthening of MONUC or a European force. It is too early to say whether that is necessary; and whether it would arrive in time is also questionable. We have first to try to secure a political solution backed by proper humanitarian support.</p>

Given the deteriorating situation there, and with Save the Children pulling out of Kivu yesterday and the situation in Goma which he has just described, does the Minister think that part of the political process to which he has just alluded should be a high-level diplomatic meeting between President Kabila of the Congo and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda? Given that, in the east of the Congo, one dimension is the conflict between Hutus and Tutsis, and that Kabila, certainly during a meeting that I had with him, has indicated his willingness to have such high-level diplomacy, is it not perhaps time that Her Majesty&#146;s Government facilitated such an interchange?</p>

We have to prepare for that now. For that reason, although we still have our doubts on compulsion and would not choose that route ourselves, we will not try to demolish the cornerstone of the Bill. It is therefore all the more important that the penalties for not participating are the right ones, a topic to which I shall return in a later group of amendments, and that genuine reasons for exemption from the duty to participate are recognised.</p>

<a name="81030-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08103032000078"></a>In Committee we moved an amendment listing various categories of persons who ought to be exempt. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, argued that the Government could see no case for a blanket exclusion, that each case would be dealt with on its individual merits and that Clause 39 would allow discretion in extreme cases. Although we have some reservations, we can see the Government&#146;s point. However, we still have a concern over one category of possible exemptions: the primary care giver. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, will be addressing the category of volunteers in later amendments, but for this amendment we are concerned with the exemption for the primary care giver to a young child under 12 months. Our concern stems as much from the needs of the baby as from the needs of the mother. It seems perverse that the Government extended maternity leave for working mothers, which we wholeheartedly supported, so that babies could enjoy a secure attachment and families would be given time to bond and settle down with their child, yet teenage mothers, who probably need this more, are expected to start courses relatively soon after their baby is born. What the Government are trying to do is perverse.</p>

One of the comments from the young people was, &#147;If we are parents when we leave care, we want support for ourselves and not just for the babies&#148;. So they do not want to be left in a situation where things go out of control and the baby gets taken into care; they want support from the very start. I am simply highlighting the very important work of Dr Roger Morgan and the good work of the Government in appointing such an impressive figure to make sure the voices of children in care and leaving care are heard. Whatever happens, whether young parents are obliged to stay in education and training or not, they need every support we can offer them to make the best of their own lives and their children&#146;s. I am sure we can all agree with that.</p>

I am delighted to be involved in continuing the discussions started by my noble friend Lord Adonis and in continuing&#151;faithfully, I hope&#151;the direction of travel that he initiated.</p>

<a name="81030-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08103032000084"></a>The fundamental point of this legislation&#151;to raise the participation age&#151;should be to give the same opportunities to, and have the same expectations of, every young person, whatever their background or situation. As we have stressed throughout our discussions, teenage parents or any other group of young people should not be treated differently from the outset and given a second-class offer. That is the prism through which we look at these issues.</p>

<a name="81030-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08103032000085"></a>In relation to teenage parents in particular, of course young mothers will not be expected to return to formal education if they are recovering from giving birth, as is the case with young mothers under the age of 16. They will be entitled to reasonable time off around the pregnancy, as is the case for young people currently in compulsory schooling. We will provide guidance to local authorities about what this should be and will fully consult stakeholders, representatives of the sector and others affected by the guidance. There will be a range of ways in which young parents can re-engage in learning when they are ready and they will receive support in doing so. As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, highlighted, the question of parenting classes would come in here. Where possible we look to incorporate such classes into the foundation learning tier, which will be accredited.</p>

<a name="81030-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08103032000086"></a>A set of flexible learning opportunities, timetabling and settings will therefore be available to help young parents to participate in a way that suits them. Information, advice and guidance are available to help young parents through the Connexions service and the targeted youth services, which are very important to this group.</p>

<a name="81030-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08103032000087"></a>The Government are committed to having a Sure Start children&#146;s centre in every community, where teenage parents can access a broad range of support in one place&#151;that is key here&#151;including childcare, education  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1695"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1695</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and training, parenting support and health-related information, advice and treatment. As the noble Baroness highlighted, training in parenting skills, provision to address the mother&#146;s other educational needs and childcare may all be integrated, enabling the young person to combine learning and caring for their child. We will look for ways to facilitate further development of programmes such as this.</p>

<a name="81030-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08103032000088"></a>There are already many examples of good and innovative practice on which to build in supporting young parents back into learning, and I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, is involved in promoting concerns such as that. For example, as my noble friend Lord Adonis mentioned in Committee, Newcastle-under-Lyme College in Staffordshire runs a learning programme for teenage parents at a local children&#146;s centre where childcare is provided. As well as working on literacy, numeracy and ICT skills, the programme helps participants to access other support services for themselves and their children, such as those provided by health visitors. Most participants later progress to further learning at the college&#146;s main site, so it is about giving parents the opportunity to progress.</p>

<a name="81030-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08103032000089"></a>Of course, as the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, highlighted, we must remember that teenage mothers do not always achieve the qualifications that they need to progress into further education. About 40 per cent of teenage mothers leave school with no qualifications. The ones who achieve better long-term outcomes for themselves and their children are those who gain employment, for which, as we all know, they need training and qualifications.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81030-0003.htm"/>


<a name="81030-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08103032000090"></a>Research shows that young mothers who have previously been disengaged from learning are often motivated to take part when they become pregnant to help to ensure better outcomes for their babies. Thus it is often important that they can start courses relatively soon after the baby is born. That is why we do not want to exempt them from the duty to participate. It is also important that further education colleges, for example, have more flexible start dates&#151;not just September&#151;to capitalise on this high level of motivation that pregnant women experience.</p>

<a name="81030-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08103032000091"></a>There may be challenges in providing the same offer for this group of young people, but it should not mean that they are excluded. We already have a system of support, and we will make full use of the intervening five years to develop this further as we move towards implementation of raising the participation age. That will challenge the system to provide for everyone, and it is not right that any group of young people should be excluded, ignored or neglected. As my noble friend Lady Blackstone said, we have in mind the interests not only of the baby but the mother. We need to make sure that the mother can best serve her child. I hope that, with those reassurances and our absolute commitment to ensure that we meet the needs of young mothers, the noble Baroness will consider withdrawing her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08103032000093"></a>The noble Baroness said that we discussed parenting classes, which we did, but the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said that that would happen only if they were for the requisite hours and it was accredited training. We would welcome that being put into the system. I do not disagree one jot with the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone. Nobody would want teenage mothers to have a second-class offer; that would not be right. Our concern is for the baby, which we discussed at great length on the Childcare Bill, when we spoke about the problems of shoving young babies into nurseries and their having lots of different carers. We just want to ensure that, when a local authority is trying to provide something for young mothers, the needs of the baby are taken into account. I would welcome a chat with the Minister between now and Third Reading to see if somehow that could be highlighted. I am sure that that would go some way towards reassuring me, but for now I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="81030-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08103032000096"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 64. Before making my remarks on Amendment No.2, I should say with regard to the previous amendment that the arrangements with Sure Start at the college in Newcastle-under-Lyme are just the sort of thing that we want.</p>

<a name="81030-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08103032000097"></a>This amendment probes a little further on the discussion we had in Committee when we established that when a young person had left school but was engaged in voluntary activities for more than 20 hours a week, that voluntary activity might count as work-based learning provided that the person undertook training activities within that voluntary activity that led to some form of accreditation. For many voluntary activities, such as working with children or older people, that would pose no problems. There are recognised qualifications to be gained leading to NVQs that are now required to work in those areas. Volunteers can easily participate in such courses.</p>

<a name="81030-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08103032000098"></a>A problem arises, however, in relation to the sorts of activities provided by the Prince&#146;s Trust and Barnardo&#146;s for young people who have been school drop-outs and who have left school with no qualifications and minimal, if any, literacy or numeracy skills. It is not clear whether they will be required to undertake courses that lead to accreditation. That is where Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 to Clauses 4 and 6 come in. The sort of programme provided by the Prince&#146;s Trust might be called a personalised learning programme. The young people concerned are not ready to take accredited courses, but are pursuing courses of learning that are tailored to their needs and help them to gain fulfilment through education and to move on further. Those courses may equip them to move on to accredited learning at a later stage. It may be that their special educational needs are such that they are unlikely ever to attain levels of skill or competence required for accreditation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08103032000099"></a>In response to some of the issues raised both by us and by other noble Lords during the Committee stage, the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, on 28 July 2008. His letter sets out in more detail what would be expected in these circumstances. I should like to read a number of extracts from the letter because it is important that this is on the record so that people will know what was said. In the letter the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08103032000716"></a>&#147;I agree with you that it will be vital that the provision available to young people is personalised to meet their specific needs and to give them the skills they need to progress further in education and to enter employment in future. As I set out previously during debate on the raising the participation age clauses, Clause 4 provides for young people participating in full time education and training do so by following an unaccredited programme of learning. This could include the type of re-engagement provision that is often provided by third sector and voluntary organisations.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08103032000717"></a>For those young people participating through the part time learning route, whilst we recognise the valuable skills and experience that young people in full-time employment will be gaining through their day-to-day work, we do believe that it is important that the course they are undertaking in their day a week of guided learning should be accredited. This will ensure that it is of good quality, and without this requirement employers could get away with providing very little training&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="81030-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08103032000100"></a>He then went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08103032000718"></a>&#147;For some of our most disadvantaged young people, who may have not enjoyed or progressed at school, the most appropriate option may be a programme of learning at &#145;entry level&#146; or &#145;level 1&#146;. We recognise the vital role such programmes will play in successfully raising the participation age and are working hard to increase the range of provision available to young people. In the White Paper <I>Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life </I><I>C</I><I>hances</I> (March 2006) the Government confirmed its commitment to developing &#145;The Foundation Learning Tier&#146; (FLT). This will be introduced across the country from September 2010, bringing coherence to entry level and level 1 qualifications and providing clear progression routes for young people onto level 2 and beyond. It will also include a skilled work pathway for young people who are not ready to undertake a full Apprenticeship.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="81030-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08103032000101"></a>How far does all this fit in to what is being proposed under the learning support agreements, which we will be discussing later? In the Minister&#146;s amendments after Clause 58, these, as she will admit, are not quite the same as personalised learning programmes, although such programmes could form a part of the conditional agreement between the local authority and the young person.</p>

<a name="81030-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08103032000102"></a>In responses to amendments on Clause 4 in Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, made it clear that those pursuing full-time education might pursue courses which in the end did not lead to an accredited outcome required by Clause 6 but those pursuing work-based learning were required to have some sort of accreditation. Does working as a volunteer count as education or training in this respect? Can pursuing a personalised learning programme with one of the voluntary organisations, such as the Prince&#146;s Trust, count as education and are they therefore exempt from the requirement to have this first-stage accreditation? There is still a lack of clarity here and I wonder whether the Minister can clarify precisely what will happen in those circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08103032000103"></a>Amendment No. 64 relates to Part 2, dealing specifically with young adults with learning difficulties. It raises slightly different issues. In our discussions in Committee on Clause 64, which is now Clause 56, it was clear from the Minister&#146;s reply that such services as are considered appropriate include the Connexions services. I pointed out to the Minister that many of these young people suffered from health problems, particularly mental health problems, and that providing them with appropriate services would mean bringing in the PCT and the child and adolescent mental health services. I asked him whether guidance would involve those two services as partners with Connexions.</p>

<a name="81030-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08103032000104"></a>He promised to think further on those issues and I am encouraged that the Government&#146;s amendment to Clause 58 on support learning contracts includes support in the form of medical and social care. But again, I seek clarification on whether Clause 56, which includes the words,</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000869"></a>&#147;such services as it considers appropriate&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000694"></a>includes health services, in particular mental health services. So many of these young people have mental health problems, and it is extremely important that the mental health services are brought in as partners with Connexions to help them to overcome them.

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08103032000109"></a>I understand the aim of the amendment, but I have sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said in Committee about accreditation.

<a name="81030-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08103032000110"></a>I am concerned about the process of accreditation which the Government envisage when it comes to entry-level qualifications. It really ought to mean no qualification at all. How can you have a qualification in an ability to work with other people, to behave in a social manner and to turn up to work on time&#151;all the skills which many young people are leaving school without? If you are going to pick them up at 16 and turn them out as competent adults at 18, they are the first things you have to address. The obsession that the  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1699"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1699</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Learning and Skills Council has for everything having to lead into literacy, numeracy or some other chain of qualification is poisonous to these basic levels of education. It means that the whole structure of those courses must be bent towards box-ticking, because that is all you can do at that stage. Such bits of literacy and numeracy are entirely outside the main thrust and purpose of the education that is being provided.</p>

<a name="81030-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08103032000111"></a>I agree that there needs to be a structure and supervision, but surely the best way of handling this is through the structure which the Government are providing in later amendments; one of local authority supervision through a contract between the local authority and the young person. If under that scheme the local authority, with a voluntary organisation, is providing a programme that is aimed at getting these young people motivated, directed and involved in society and their own futures, surely that is enough. That programme does not need to go through an expensive, time-consuming and essentially irrelevant LSC process. The control is there through the local authority. Most of these courses, particularly the good courses, will be local because they will rely on being run by motivated and directed individuals and will not generally be suitable for rolling out to the ordinary run of commercial education. They will work well within the local voluntary sector. Under those structures, there should be total freedom for the local education authority to provide these courses without them having to be formally accredited in some box-ticking way.</p>

I am particularly thinking of young people in care, or on the edge of care, because one can spend a short time in care in one&#146;s early childhood or later on and not necessarily be entitled to the full support available otherwise. There are many other children who have experienced the death of a parent or both parents or multiple trauma and are vulnerable. It is helpful for a Connexions adviser to have the best professional support in maintaining a relationship with a vulnerable young person. It is sometimes difficult to sustain those relationships, but it can be very helpful for a young person who has experienced the loss of a parent or family member or who has had a number of different placements with different carers to have one person consistently engaged in a relationship with him. However, that person needs good support, so I welcome what the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said.</p>

I have a rather long speaking note, but my speaking notes get shorter as the day goes by, so I am not going to drone on for hours.</p>

<a name="81030-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08103032000114"></a>I believe that all young people should benefit from staying in education or training until the age of 18 and that appropriately tailored, flexible and personalised programmes of learning will be essential to engage some of the hardest-to-reach young people. Speaking particularly to Amendments Nos. 6 and 7, if the noble Baronesses are thinking of the kind of informal or  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1700"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1700</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>non-formal education or training often provided through the voluntary sector&#151;the noble Baroness referred to the Prince&#146;s Trust&#151;that would be covered under full-time education or training. The type of provision described in Amendment No. 6 is recognised and allowed for under Clause 4. Appropriate full-time education or training is not required to be accredited. It can be provided at a school, college, higher education institution or otherwise, which allows for locations that are not formal education institutions. That is what the noble Baroness was pointing to. They may not always lead to formally accredited qualifications, although we know it is important to break down programmes into bite-sized sections and to start recognising young people&#146;s achievements as early as possible in whatever way is most appropriate for them. There is nothing in Clause 4 to prevent personalised learning programmes being integrated with individual support where that is needed, and it would be good practice to do so. I therefore believe that Amendment No. 6 is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="81030-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08103032000115"></a>On Amendment No. 7, our strong view is that informal learning should not count for the purposes of part-time education or training alongside employment. We recognise the value of non-formal learning, where it has a clear aim and enables young people to progress, and have made it clear that it will be allowed under Clause 4. However, since young people in a job develop their &#147;get up and turn up on time&#148; side, we think it reasonable to require young people in full-time education to be working toward an accredited qualification. It is important that they have the opportunity to participate in good-quality, accredited training; without the requirement for accreditation there would be no guarantee of the quality level in the training being undertaken.</p>

<a name="81030-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08103032000116"></a>In this context, the requirement for accreditation is our guarantee that, where employers are providing training, the learning that happens is substantial and of high quality. Without it, there would be a risk of creating a way out for employers&#151;and I know that we shall discuss that concern shortly, on an amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Layard. The noble Baroness has, however, raised an important point.</p>

<a name="81030-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08103032000117"></a>On Amendment No. 2 in particular, we certainly recognise that engaging in volunteering is an extremely worthwhile activity for young people. I have personally promoted that and believe strongly in it. It can help them to gain important skills and experience that contribute to their personal development and are valued by employers and universities. We are encouraging more people to get involved in voluntary work. However, I am also clear that those young people need to continue their formal learning in the same way as those in paid employment do. It might be as part of a volunteering programme, or mean undertaking a part-time course alongside the volunteering activity. Continuing, informal accredited learning will ensure that the skills they have developed are formally recognised and that they gain further qualifications. That is important to help them demonstrate what they have learned to future employers; it will help them to find work and to progress in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08103032000118"></a>Amendment No. 64 would put a duty on local authorities to provide health and mental health services. For a minority of young people, access to and continued participation in education and training depends not

This is an important issue, but I believe the amendment is unnecessary. Under the Children Act 2004, local authorities have a duty to co-operate with health partners, including primary care trusts, to improve the,</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000870"></a>&#147;physical and mental health and emotional well-being&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000695"></a>of children and young people The Act also introduces a duty on local authorities to co-ordinate the production of strategic children and young persons&#146; plans, to set a vision for all the services that children and young people gain in an area. Guidance on that duty emphasises the need for close partnership working, to ensure consistency between children and young people&#146;s plans and the primary care trusts&#146; local development plans.</p>

<a name="81030-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08103032000119"></a>Recently, there have been significant improvements in the delivery of child and adolescent mental health services, partly as a result of increasing funding in that area. For example, we have seen a significant increase in the numbers of multi-agency services there, and reductions in waiting lists. However, we want to see further improvements: that is why our <I>Children&#146;s Plan</I> commissioned an external review of such services, led by Jo Davidson, director of the children and young people&#146;s service at Gloucestershire County Council and Dr Bob Jezzard, an eminent child and adolescent psychiatrist. They will develop their report to the Government shortly, and we will be able to respond in full to the proposals for better, joined-up services. To be absolutely clear, a full discussion on the partnership agreements will be coming up later today. These are vehicles for promoting and achieving the participation of young people&#151;not the actual participation, which we will consider later in a different part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08103032000127"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I also welcome the Minister to her new role. She has always been seen as part of the Bill team but I compliment her on the way in which she has picked up the ball and run with it. I look forward later in our debates today to being able to thank her for a number of things she has now brought forward in response to the listening that she and her predecessor, the noble Lord, Lord Adonis&#151;who we miss very much&#151;did in our debates in Committee.</p>

<a name="81030-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08103032000128"></a>On Amendment No. 3, I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, that it has been a very eventful 14 weeks. Indeed, the British economy appears to be in turmoil, and that turmoil clearly will not go away for quite some time. There will be a certain amount of shake-out in some of our industries and the need for upskilling and reskilling among the working population will be greater than ever. The difference between us is how that will be best achieved. The amendment demonstrates that we prefer an entitlement for all adults to free level 3 tuition, throughout their life, to compulsion on 16 to 19 year-olds to carry on with some kind of education or training.</p>

<a name="81030-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08103032000129"></a>We therefore come back to the debate about compulsion versus entitlement which we had in Committee. We would prefer the Government to put in place all the things they are doing to widen the opportunity for young people to participate in education or training, to take away the barriers and provide support and help before resorting to any compulsion. There was much support for this point of view from all over the Committee. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, talked about the good reasons, such as parenthood, why a young woman may wish to postpone her post-16 studies; she has returned to that subject today. The noble Lord, Lord Elton, has talked about how compulsion does not work below the age of 16, since we still have a large&#151;albeit falling&#151;number of truants.</p>

<a name="81030-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08103032000130"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley, talked about the attraction of teaching those who choose to be there, rather than those who are compelled, and emphasised that choice is a large contributor to their success. She also talked about the gradual transition  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1703"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1703</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to adulthood from 16 to 18, and worried about the fact that this Bill passes the duty from the parent to the child in relation to attendance at education, with the consequence that a criminal offence is created when a young person fails to participate. That criminal element is one that the Government openly accept. Only yesterday in a meeting with interested Peers for which we were most grateful, the honourable Jim Knight from another place accepted that quite clearly, despite the various measures that the Government have now introduced to reduce the likelihood and impact of that criminal offence, none of which is 100 per cent watertight.</p>

<a name="81030-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08103032000131"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, also supported entitlement, and felt that a lot of work is needed on the wider offer to 16 to 19 year-olds before making it compulsory for them to stay in education. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, expressed concerns about the local authority enforcement officer and his powers. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, talked about the consequences of giving a young person a criminal record, particularly in relation to their future employment prospects. It is because of this general disquiet about the compulsion element that we felt it necessary to return to the matter of compulsion versus entitlement at this stage. We believe that the country and its economy will benefit if as many as possible, and as many as are capable, take qualifications up to level 3. As I said, the world of work is changing rapidly; that will continue, and perhaps even accelerate with new technologies coming along. That is why we need to give people the chance to become lifelong learners. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, referred to Mr Gladstone, who formed his fourth Administration at the age of 83, declaring that he had been a learner all his life. I hope that when I am 83 I will still be a learner too.</p>

<a name="81030-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08103032000132"></a>However, the Minister&#146;s predecessor claimed that this Bill, with its compulsion, would instil a greater culture of learning among teenagers and then, perhaps, further up the age range. It takes more than compulsion to change a culture. People change their attitudes when they enjoy something or see its benefit, not when they are forced to do something. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, talked about the increase in the number of young people already staying on, and the recent small reduction in the NEET category. Here he betrayed the real reason for the Government&#146;s compulsion approach. This Bill, which affects every young person, is really designed to deal with the 9.4 per cent not in education, employment or training. As we all know, hard cases make bad law. We have a fundamental disagreement about what will deal best with those young people.</p>

<a name="81030-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08103032000133"></a>In this Bill, and others that we are promised in the next Session, the Government are planning to provide many of the right things: support, apprenticeships, the right to time off from work for training, a wider range of qualifications and financial support. These are all the right things, but making the whole thing compulsory introduces a negative element which is unnecessary and may even have a negative effect, which none of us wants. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, also prayed in aid a good many other countries that already have a higher participation age and better attainment levels. This is a very simplistic argument in a field where

That is why I have returned to this matter one more time.</p>

<a name="81030-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08103032000134"></a>We have tried in many of our other amendments, which we will debate later, to mitigate some of the potential worse effects of the Government&#146;s compulsion approach. We have been pragmatic about that because it is likely that the Government will get their way. This amendment addresses our fundamental disagreement. Exemptions, minimal fines, support agreements and all, are fine in their way, but the Government, while claiming that a young person of 16 should be able to take responsibility for his own education and therefore bear the consequences if he breaks the law, in the next breath take away his right to decide when the time is right for him to continue his learning. We believe that that is wrong. The British Youth Council agrees with us. It carried out a survey recently which showed that a majority of young people do not want their free choice removed.</p>

<a name="81030-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08103032000135"></a>We should open the doors for young people, take away any barriers and help them to walk through those doors as soon as they are ready, but not create a one-age-fits-all situation.

But we have not put down amendments on Report because, as I said in moving Amendment No. 1, the world has changed. We need to have as well skilled a workforce as possible and to ensure that as many young people as possible participate. As I said, we would not go down this route but we are not going to stand in the way of the Government bringing forward compulsion.</p>

If we are to give people rights to educate themselves to a decent level, when the time is right for them appears to be the right way to go. To have a pupil who is motivated, who wants to learn and knows what they want to learn is so much better than having someone who is dragging their feet every step of the way. You can achieve so much more for the same amount of money. In a way, some children of 16 and 17 need some life experience; they need to get out there and learn how hard life is in the real world; they need to learn a bit more about themselves and what they want to do, and then come back to education. When that happens, they should be able to do so on the same terms as someone who already knows at 16 that they want to take a couple of A-levels and go on to university.</p>

If they have not had a basic education and have not learnt what they should have learnt earlier in life, the easy availability of a retraining course and the money to do that which has not been wasted by keeping them in school between the ages of 16 and 18 but is available for them when they need it, is surely the right way to go. Why should they have to pay for it? To have a quick week of education available for Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross would be a thoroughly good idea.</p>

I have amendments down about the criminal aspects arising from compulsion. I think that at this stage the Government will try compulsion, although there is no evidence that it works in other countries.

While she was speaking, I was minded of two statements by two totally different people. One was a memorable statement by Winston Churchill, that there was a treasure in the heart of every man if only you could find it; the other was a statement by the learning and skills co-ordinator in a young offender establishment in Northallerton in Yorkshire, who said to me that the main job of trainers and educators in prisons was to motivate people to learn. One of the biggest factors in that motivation was time; therefore, it seems entirely sensible that time should be allowed to apply. If people have not been able to engage and connect during school, let us not expect them automatically to go on with it until time and other things have been able to motivate them because they have somehow discovered that there is a treasure which has not yet been found and that needs developing.</p>

It is essential to reiterate what so many of us said at that time: we would prefer choice, or the carrot route, to compulsion. The more one hears about the sad situation that the world is in today, the more it would seem appropriate to look down that road. I recently attended a briefing by the Nuffield Foundation on the Engaging Youth inquiry. It made it clear that a wide range of young people will need all kinds of support before&#151;and, one hopes, when&#151;they see that they could engage in something rather more specifically educational. Among other things is a need for the personal mentor or helper to be around. That is where I would put a lot of my resources for these young people. Although I fear we will not persuade the Government to think again on this matter, about which I am sad, those of us who strongly prefer this route should make that absolutely clear.</p>

However, it is a difficult argument. The key is implementation, about which my noble friend has just spoken. As a general principle, every young person needs a mentor to help them forward. It is crucial that they find that person in the future.</p>

What she said about the review of CAMHS and how they can be made more effective for young people is also extremely important. I welcome the designated looked-after children CAMH services, which, where they are available, make a great difference. They are crucial to successful implementation, especially for the most vulnerable children, because we do not want them to slip into the criminal justice system as a result of our not quite engaging with them properly.</p>

We are talking about a choice between staying on in school in full-time education, taking a job and continuing in part-time training, and pursuing an apprenticeship. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said that young people must feel that it is right for them to move on and get a job. We need to be clear that that is covered as an option in the Bill. Young people will have choices about the route that they pursue post 16.</p>

<a name="81030-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08103032000149"></a>As many Members have highlighted, in today&#146;s fast changing economic circumstances and in a world where everyone will need skills to prosper, the Bill is extremely important. As we all know, the days when people leave school at 16 without qualifications but still make a good career for themselves by starting at the bottom and working their way up are pretty much gone. A recent CBI study showed that one in five employees still lack basic literacy and numeracy skills. The warning given to us by the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, was stark: up to 50 per cent more jobs will require high-level skills by 2020, which is an enormous challenge. Yet, despite a steady increase over the past few years, we still have a low rate of participation compared to other developed countries and we all agree that we need to go further. Our ambition must be that all young people continue in education, training or whatever choice they make. That is why we are legislating now; and that is why our legislation must be based on the principle of compulsion.</p>

<a name="81030-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08103032000150"></a>Through the September Guarantee, all year 11s are already entitled to a suitable place in learning. We are ensuring more take-up of that entitlement. However, we are aware that the new requirement does not mean all young people staying in school; it means that every young person should carry on in the right form of education or training to allow them to develop the skills that they need to succeed.</p>

<a name="81030-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08103032000151"></a>That goes hand in hand with later provisions in the Bill which ensure that adults are able to obtain basic- and intermediate-level skills. Both are absolutely crucial to meeting the future skills needs of our economy. We have set our ambition to achieve world-class skills by 2020 and we know that 74 per cent of the 2020 workforce has already left compulsory education. We need to act now to ensure that all those people who were not able to benefit from the package of reforms that we are now putting in place for young people get a second chance. At present, adults can access funding for basic skills courses&#151;a first full level 2 qualification and a first full level 3 qualification&#151;up to age 25.</p>

<a name="81030-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08103032000152"></a>These arrangements are significantly strengthened by Clause 73, where, for the first time, the Learning and Skills Council will be required to ensure that facilities for obtaining specified qualifications at level 1 literacy, entry-level 3 numeracy and vocational full level 2 are available in sufficient quantity and of a quality adequate to meet the needs of learners and, in so doing, increase learner choice. This is an important

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08103032000153"></a>If we replaced compulsion with the concept of an entitlement that could be postponed, as this amendment would, we would risk damaging the life chances of those who stand to gain most from the Bill&#151;young people who are least likely to participate now and are vulnerable and disadvantage, and adults who want to improve their skills and increase their prospects but are unable to do a full two years of full-time study.</p>

<a name="81030-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08103032000154"></a>There are carrots, but we need a stick as well. We have to put pressure on the system to gear up to deliver for these young people. Yes, the support has to be there; it has to be wrapped around so that vulnerable young people and children can fully participate and make the most of the choices that we want to create for them. I hope very much that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment because we have a duty to make a significant change for young people starting school this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08103032000162"></a>We seek to find a genuinely personalised approach for these young people who do not fit into the normal categories of those who might go on to take the usual qualifications without too much difficulty. Young people are as variable as the leaves on the trees; they grow up at different rates and they have different problems. We are delighted that the Government have accepted the learning and support contract approach&#151;even though they are calling it an agreement&#151;including social and health support, which I assume includes mental health. The only unfortunate thing about it is that this help is available only if the young person continues in the type of study prescribed by the Government. However, I very much took on board the reassurances that the Minister gave my noble friend Lady Sharp about the breadth of non-formal provision being acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08103032000163"></a>It is important that local authorities should be expected to go down the learning and support agreement route before embarking on any enforcement procedures. I should like the Minister to assure me that that must be done before they even apply for attendance notices. How will the Government ensure that they do that? Enforcement procedures should never commence if a young person has unmet needs. Will the Government issue guidance to ensure that local authorities do this? Will the Minister also assure the House that the duty to participate in Clause 2 will be fulfilled by a young person actively taking part in one of these agreements? How will local authorities be resourced to provide the necessary support within these agreements? How will current best practice be disseminated? I believe that there is some good practice out there.</p>

<a name="81030-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08103032000164"></a>Can the Minister also confirm that the sort of support envisaged can also be given to young people to help them to participate outwith one of these formal learning and support agreements, and can she say more about any guidance that she will send to local authorities about how they will tailor the package of support to each young person&#146;s needs and how their parents or guardians will be involved in developing the content of the agreement? When the local authority is the corporate parent, how will it negotiate with itself in relation to looked-after children?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08103032000165"></a>The Equality and Human Rights Commission expressed concern that the concept of reasonable excuse could be used as an excuse by government and local authorities and that this would mean that the most vulnerable and those most in need of support will continue to be ignored. It welcomes learning and support contracts because it thinks that that will help to ensure that that does not happen and will redress the balance in the Bill towards help and support and against some of the compulsion and penalty elements that we spent so much time debating and will do so again today. It is not going to be possible for all young people to participate without a good deal of help and support and taking away the barriers that they have had up to now to progressing in education beyond 16. That is what we all want to see. We very much welcome

I, too, welcome the Government&#146;s amendment, but I echo the noble Baroness&#146;s plea that local authorities must have tried a learning and support contract before embarking on enforcement procedures.</p>

However, he also emphasised our support for the approach and said that we would reflect very carefully on whether there was a case for specifying more in the Bill. On reflection, I decided that it might be beneficial to include something along these lines to make it clear that local authorities can pursue this kind of enabling approach. As a result we are introducing this amendment, and I am pleased that it has been welcomed. It enables local authorities to enter into learning and support agreements. I am not sure whether the difference in terms is material.</p>

<a name="81030-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08103032000168"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked a number of questions but I am not sure that I got them all. If I do not pick all of them up then I will write to her and copy it to noble Lords who have taken part in today&#146;s proceedings. She asked me to confirm whether enforcement could proceed where there was a young person with unmet needs. I want to make it clear that that should not happen. Enforcement should not proceed where a young person has unmet needs. Clause 39 states that even the first step&#151;giving a final written warning before enforcement action begins&#151;cannot be taken unless the right support has been offered and the young person has been given the opportunity to take it up. In addition, as noble Lords are aware, there are further safeguards to prevent enforcement happening inappropriately, such as the independent panel, which would be interested in the steps that have been taken.</p>

<a name="81030-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08103032000169"></a>The noble Baroness also asked how we will promote best practice around learning support agreements. Clause 39 requires local authorities to demonstrate that they have provided support and the opportunity to take advantage of it before enforcement action can be taken. A learning and support agreement, as the noble Baroness explained, would be a very good way of doing that. We will encourage local authorities to pursue this or similar approaches to re-engage young people who are struggling to fulfil the duty to participate long before enforcement action is considered. We want to make sure that we allow flexibility. However, having a tried and tested model of good practice is important and we will do our best to ensure that local authorities are made aware of that through guidance. I will write to the noble Baroness in more detail.</p>

If such an agreement is entered into, could that constitute full-time education? Can whatever is agreed to under this provision constitute full-time education? If it is entered into in respect of a young person who is also in employment, will this agreement encompass all that is required to be provided by way of education? In other words, is this sufficient in itself, or does there have to be some kind of educational arrangement existing outside this agreement in order to satisfy the terms of the Bill?</p>

Will the pathway plan for care leavers introduced in the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 be used as a model for some of these new contracts? I understand that these pathway plans have been well received, and it might be helpful to learn from best practice in this area when moving forward with these new support plans for young people. What particularly features as good practice in this area is the full involvement of the young person in designing the plan. It is such an obvious point that it is hardly worth making, but can the Minister confirm that all is being done to make the young person&#146;s involvement as important as possible in developing these contracts? Perhaps there could be monitoring to ensure that young people are indeed being drawn into these contracts.</p>

It is about ensuring that the young person is clear not only about what support is being offered but, at the same time, about what they need to do to participate. I am assuming that that includes full-time education. If they are in employment, it would include them attending 280 hours of training. It is about setting out clearly both for the young person and for the support services what the young person&#146;s needs are and what is defined as a service to meet those needs. Young people should know what to expect so that they know where they are and where they stand.</p>

In Committee, we discussed the many reforms in hand, and the Minister reminded us that by 2013 local authorities will have inherited from the Learning and Skills Council the responsibility for assessing the sufficiency of provision within a local area and to make sure that there are enough places in schools and colleges&#151;and, from now on, also on apprenticeships&#151;to satisfy the demands of young people. In Amendment No. 5, we suggest that that should be the responsibility of the Secretary of State rather than the local authority. The local authority is responsible for the provision of these places. Is it to be both judge and jury in deciding whether it is providing sufficient places of the right quality and sort? Rather, this amendment suggests that ultimately the Secretary of State should be responsible for ensuring that provision is adequate and that local authorities have risen to the challenge of the reforms in hand.</p>

Raising the learning leaving age to 18 does not make sense until these reforms are under way and we can be sure that the secondary curriculum motivates young people and encourages them to stay in learning. As the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, said in Committee, seven years is a short time in education terms. Delaying the implementation of these provisions by two years, to make sure that the current reforms, which are a necessary part of the whole package, are well embedded in the system, is a sensible thing to do.

If that happens, the Government must be absolutely certain that they will uphold their side of the bargain. They must put into place all the necessary investment, all the new courses, all the new provisions, so that the scheme runs smoothly from the outset. It would be intolerable to sweep young people into duty, and potentially punish them if they fail to comply, while the authorities were in a state of disarray and unpreparedness. 2013 may sound far off; it is in another decade. However, it will not be long in coming. The Government must be ready.</p>

I cannot recall any piece of legislation that has been prepared so far in advance of implementation. The normal practice with legislation and regulation is to ask schools to implement change from next September. Quite rightly, schools complain that they are given insufficient time to implement measures in a proper manner. I congratulate the Government on bringing forward this legislation and making preparations to give schools a reasonable period in which to prepare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08103032000187"></a>Secondly, there is a real danger for schools, and everybody else involved in this partnership&#151;employers, colleges of further education and training establishments&#151;in not being clear that, by that point, things have to be in place. I agree with the movers of this amendment that there is a tremendous onus on the Government and other partners to make sure that things are in place. However, I would resist any uncertainty about the date of implementation. The minute you bring in uncertainty, you lose the benefit of this legislation, which gives enough time to prepare and also clarity about the date of introduction. I praise the Government for giving sufficient lead-in time. It is now up to everybody in the system to make sure that everything is in order to be implemented at the point described in the Bill.</p>

This follows advice from many sources.</p>

However, we have entered a new economic climate. Mention was made of the voluntary organisations involved in supporting young people. Some of them are heavily dependent on donations. Given the change in the economic climate, we need to think whether it would be wise to put back these proposals from the Government. I hope that this helps the Minister to think through the clear change in the climate for developing these plans.</p>

We need to remember that we are talking about changes that will affect young people who started secondary school in September this year. We need momentum in taking forward these important proposals. These amendments were discussed in committee. My noble friend Lord Adonis set out the Government&#146;s agreement that we must ensure that there is sufficient learning provision for all young people if we are to expect them to participate. We will deliver on our part of the bargain.</p>

<a name="81030-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08103032000191"></a>Part of our rationale for legislating now is to galvanise the system to provide appropriate support and opportunities for all young people. By setting clear expectations in law that all young people must participate until they are 18, we make it clear that it will no longer be an option to forget about the student who sits quietly at the back of the class, watching the clock and waiting until they can leave.</p>

<a name="81030-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08103032000192"></a>With reference to Amendment No. 5, in March we published a White Paper, <I>Raising Expectations: </I><I>E</I><I>nabling the </I><I>S</I><I>ystem to </I><I>D</I><I>eliver</I>, which set out our intention to transfer the funding responsibilities for commissioning 16-to-19 provision from the Learning and Skills Council to local authorities. In future, assessing the sufficiency of provision will become the role of the local authority; that is where the responsibility should lie. Local authorities will do this through the strategic commissioning plan that they will complete as part of, or alongside, the children and young persons plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08103032000193"></a>I reassure noble Lords that we will be ready to implement the new participation age from 2013, and do not need to delay until 2015, as proposed. By 2013, the national entitlement to the new diploma&#151;which I understand is very popular with young people taking part in it&#151;and the apprenticeship guarantee will be in place, and the foundation learning tier for provision at entry level 1 will be established. The September guarantee, which was implemented for the first time in every local area last year, guarantees to offer a suitable learning place for all young people leaving year 11. This year it was extended to 17 year-olds. Already, we are gearing up the system.</p>

We need to see a change in the expectations and aspirations of young people. That is the other reason for making this change in 2013. As we know, the first young people to be affected began year 7 this September. They will start their secondary school career knowing&#151;and with their parents and teachers knowing&#151;that they will continue in learning post-16. We will keep our part of the bargain and create the best opportunities for these young people post-16. With that reassurance, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendments.</p>

I remind her, as I reminded the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley, that our proposals would not create more uncertainty: they give a definite date. On the notion of postponing the date, there are so many reforms in hand. The noble Baroness mentioned that, by 2013, the diplomas should be rolled out and we have the new apprenticeships, foundation learning tier and all of this stuff. We want to ensure, before forcing young people to stay on in learning in some form or another, that this is working. This gives it an extra couple of years. The Minister may come to rue the day that the Government rejected the amendment. They may find things take rather longer to bed down than they think.</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08103032000206"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment goes to the heart of what the Bill is about. If we are to ensure that every young person continues in education and training up to the age of 18, we must have a solid definition of what counts as &#147;education and training&#148;.</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08103032000207"></a>Before the Bill was published, we were led to believe that it would require at least a day a week, or equivalent, of off-the-job education and training. As it stands, however, it simply does not do that. There is no guarantee of anything that is away from the individual&#146;s work station. In our view, that is simply not good enough. Just to have on-the-job training is not enough. On-the-job is of course incredibly important; that is how the person learns a specific skill that the employer needs them to have. However, it is important for the individual&#151;and the Bill is essentially directed at individuals&#151;also to have transferable skills which enable them to develop their thinking skills, their ability to write and calculate, and the underpinning knowledge that relates to their work. This can only be achieved in an off-the-job situation. It does not require abstract learning. We are talking about part-time education, which has the huge advantage that the individual can immediately see how what they are doing off the job is relevant to what they are doing on the job. However, there must be transferable skills which are, in most people&#146;s minds, fundamental to what the Bill is about.</p>
<a name="time_11"></a>
<a name="81030-0006.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08103032000896"></a>1.15 pm</h5>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08103032000208"></a>In a world where firms may disappear any day, and where people are not necessarily tied to one employer for a particularly long time, it is even more important that we teach transferable skills. The Bill is meant to be promoting the interests of young people. These skills cannot be got just by sitting next to Nellie. They must be taught in a different location, where the worker can step back from the work station a bit and interact with an instructor and fellow students in a different and more reflective atmosphere. We ought to be building that into our concept of every young person being in education up to the age of 18.</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08103032000209"></a>Of course, to arrange that for the numbers of young people involved will take a lot of time and organisation. Fortunately, we have them: we are talking about something that is coming in five to seven years. It will then set the scene for the educational chances of our young people for at least 10 years after that. We should really set our sights reasonably high, and not think of what we could do next year or the year after.</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08103032000210"></a>That is the basic argument in the amendment, but there is also a completely practical issue of enforcement. If we want young people to have 280 hours of guided learning, how can we possibly check that they have had it if all those hours could be spent at the work station? If a worker is sitting next to his supervisor, how can you tell whether he is getting guided learning or not? The Bill&#146;s definition of guided learning is too loose. I shall quote a set of phrases that would satisfy the requirement for education and training, such as,</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000871"></a>&#147;participating in education or training under the immediate guidance or supervision of&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000697"></a>a supervisor. That is not adequate. We need a tighter definition of education and training than at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08103032000211"></a>It is wonderful that we are having this Bill. Many of us have wanted it for at least 20 years. The Government deserve enormous credit for having decided to introduce universal education and training up to 18. It really could be a landmark Bill, but I do not think that it is with this loophole. We urge the Minister to accept our amendment, or come up with something adequate at Third Reading. We would be happy to discuss this with her if she wishes.</p>

As a party, we have long maintained that it is important that there is education as well as just training in this context, and that off-the-job education should be provided in so far as the young person continues in training. We very much go along with the noble Lord&#146;s arguments.</p>

<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="08103032000213"></a><a name="81030-0006.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="81030-0006.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08103032001022"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> My Lords, I also support the noble Lord, Lord Layard. In childcare, many people, such as Dr Gillian Pugh, the former director of the Thomas Coram Foundation, think that the best training one can have is to allow childcare workers one evening a month, or every fortnight, to be away from the children, to sit down with a senior manager or experienced practitioner and talk through individual children&#146;s experiences. They might say that a boy does this or that, and that they are not quite sure what to do when he does. They might ask whether the senior manager thinks that they are doing the right thing. The whole group works together to reflect on the worker&#146;s practice and improve her relationship with the child.</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08103032000214"></a>That is one of the best forms of training, but it gets cut when the money is short; it is the most expensive element of training in social care. The current economic climate reminds us that tough times come and tough decisions must be made. Businesses may unfortunately feel unable to prioritise investing in young people, and may feel pushed towards simply using them to get whatever work needs to be done, possibly to their regret. Perhaps this is protection for young people to ensure that they get the investment and time to reflect and develop that we all wish them to have. I hope that the Minister can respond favourably to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Layard.</p>

I agree with every word of the amendment, possibly even more than he did. At Second Reading, I gave the Bill a huge welcome and said that I thought it was probably one of the most important pieces of educational legislation for many years. I referred back to the 1918 Act; we have waited 90 years to move forward. After waiting all that time, we really must get it right, otherwise, in 10 years, when we review what we have done, we will sit and regret deeply that we thought we were doing something progressive to help the most disadvantaged young people in our society, but find that all our aims and hopes have been dashed because we did not quite get it right by being more precise in how we define education and training.</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08103032000216"></a>Funnily enough, if a young person is unemployed, they may do better out of the Bill, as drafted, than if they have a job. I am sure that that is not what we intended. We have to remember that many young people aged 16 and 17 who have left school, often with very poor levels of prior achievement, will not be in good jobs; they will be in humdrum, often dead-end jobs. The kind of training and instruction that they receive will be pretty limited, which is why it is very important that the 280 hours of training should be spent away from their work stations.</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08103032000217"></a>I wish to make one small point to the Minister. Amendment No. 9 proposes that some of the clause should be deleted. I hope that in his reply, my noble friend does not spend 25 minutes telling us why those provisions should not be deleted. He would probably be right to say that some should remain in the Bill. My plea is that he focus on the real issue, which is where the 280 hours of education should take place. We do not have just a loophole, as my noble friend said, but a whopping great loophole which could become a cop-out for a lot of employers who do not take the education and training of young people as seriously as they ought to. It would be terribly naive for us to believe that all employers would be good citizens in that respect. Some will be struggling to keep their businesses going; others will not be engaged with the idea that it is part of their job to move the skills of those young people forward. Those employers will be more interested in survival, profit and getting the most that they can out of the young people&#146;s work than on focusing on their education and training.</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08103032000218"></a>For all those reasons, and those that my noble friend has given, a huge opportunity will have been lost if the amendment, or something like it, is not accepted. I do not argue that the training received by young people at work is unimportant. Of course it is important and it is often a way of motivating young people to attach education and training to what they are doing in the workplace. However, as well as that, they should have an opportunity to spend some time in a context where, as my noble friend said, they can discuss what they are doing with their peers. If the Bill is left in its current shape, many of those young people may receive some instruction, but because they will be working, they will not be in a context whereby they can reflect on what they are learning or discuss their training or instruction with other young people, or with those who are providing it.</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08103032000219"></a>In anticipation of what my noble friend may say, I do not believe, first, that the education and training given to young people off the job should be theoretical. It should not be about providing more opportunities for developing their literacy or numeracy, but be closely related to what they are doing at work. I am sure that every noble Lord in this House would agree that young people can be given some kind of development away from the workplace, whereby they can think about how that work can be applied to different situations or about whether the equipment that they are using would be relevant in other contexts. We need to focus on those sorts of issues. The Government have been incredibly courageous in the way in which they have framed the Bill. They have been specific that there  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1719"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1719</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>must be 280 hours of training, so they should also be specific about how and where the education and training should take place.</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08103032000220"></a>My noble friend may say that a lot of good employers have excellent and highly technical training, and that taking employees away from the workplace for training outside would somehow disrupt that. I would not be convinced by that argument, because young people can get all that excellent training with a good employer but, in addition, any good employer and anyone who has been involved in training people in the 16-to-17 age group would say that in addition they needed to do something away from the job. I hope that the Minister will address that.</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08103032000221"></a>While specific skills are very important for young people in that age group, transferable skills are even more important. Many of those young people will change their jobs four, five, six or seven times between leaving school and the age of 25. For that reason, if we leave this issue entirely to the employer in the workplace, we will fail in doing all the things that we want to get out of the Bill.</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08103032000222"></a>Finally, I hope that my noble friend will be positive in his reply to ensure that we achieve the hugely important objectives of the Bill and turn it into the progressive and lasting piece of legislation that we all hope for.</p>

None of us, on reflection, would be happy if at the end of the passage of the Bill we had not raised the aspirations of the whole nation by providing better quality training, leading to the adult training which is provided for elsewhere in the Bill.</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08103032000224"></a>My starting point is that it is very difficult to imagine a situation in which good-quality training did not involve some time away from the workstation, but that could happen, given the way that the Bill has been written. I am prepared to accept in the details of debate that there might be some specialised courses in some occupations with some high-tech providers where good-quality training may take place at the workplace for 100 per cent of the time. However, no noble Lord would agree that in most occupations, 100 per cent training at the workplace, with no time away for underpinning, applied skills, mentoring or talking, was necessary. The truth is that that would be possible under the Bill. If we leave the legislation as it is to accommodate the very few good employers who perhaps can make an argument for 280 hours of training at the work station that remains good quality, we leave a gaping hole that will allow the less good employers to get away with sometimes shoddy training that is masqueraded as education, training or employment with training for 16 to 18 year-olds at the moment. I say this for one particular reason. If you look at this in terms of supply and demand, there is not a powerful demand side in this. The sort of youngster who will end up with this less good training at the workplace

That is the person whom this amendment protects&#151;the 16 to 19 year-old who does not have higher aspirations or know that they could make the argument for anything better. This amendment underpins and protects them and that is essential. Not all 280 hours have to be spent away from the workstation, but a very significant amount does. I think it has to be half or more. If half or more of the 280 hours were spent away from the workstation&#151;which is not much more than half a day a week&#151;not only would we have legislation for the first time that meant that all 16 to 19 year-olds had the opportunity of education, training, or employment with training, but that it was good quality as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08103032000225"></a>I have a number of specific points for the Minister. In government-funded training you can argue that quality can be guaranteed. It is government-accredited, if you like, and so by definition the Government are going to make sure that the course or the training is good quality. What happens with non-government-funded courses for 16 to 19 year-olds? Why would somebody offer non-government-funded training in this regard if it was not to get away with not having to comply with the spirit of the legislation? How would you monitor non-government-funded courses? If you have a financial lever, you are able to withdraw funding if the training is not up to the standard that you want. How will the Government make sure that the training of non-government-funded courses is of the standard we want it to be?</p>

<a name="81030-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08103032000226"></a>In conclusion, I do not think for a minute that the Government disagree with what those of us supporting this amendment want to achieve, but there is the difficulty of wanting to leave flexibility in the system for things that suit employers and learners, without tying them down, and making sure we have legislative underpinning in terms of quality of training. My judgment is that at the moment the Government have the balance wrong. If amendments are not forthcoming, some young people will carry on exactly where they are now. They will have training that is meant to be good quality but it will take place 100 per cent at the workstation and it will lack the rigour and other qualities referred to by my noble friends to make sure that life changes for them and that this legislation is offering them something different from what they have at the moment. For those reasons, I support these two amendments and hope the Government are able to respond in a favourable way.</p>

I find myself entirely in agreement with what the noble Lord, Lord Layard, said about the importance of human interaction in a successful learning process and about getting together with one&#146;s fellow students and in a personal way with people who know and understand the subject and can deal with you face to face. However, I see problems with the idea that you should spend all your time away from the workstation. A lot of these people may be small employers. They may have their kids stuck in front of computer screens of some kind or another. To force them to provide extra computers and space for use an hour a day by the youngsters they employ is not sensible. Anyway, are not a lot of the courses they are going to be pursuing essentially distance learning courses which are designed to be absorbed at a workstation? As long as there is a dedicated time set aside for it and they are not supposed to interrupt it every two minutes another person is needed on the cash desk or whatever, the workstation is going to be the sensible place for them to do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08103032000232"></a>This problem is not restricted to this Bill. It is a direction which the Government are pursuing when it comes to learning within prisons. They are looking at getting students there to pursue distance learning individually on their own workstations rather than taught in classes by teachers. Once you go down that route, instead of having a group of pupils within a reasonably close physical proximity who are all studying the same course and are all at the same point on it, you have a group of pupils who are studying different courses, or if they are studying the same course, they are at different points on it. What is the point of getting that group of students together to discuss anything with anybody when all their interests and requirements are different? I am a believer in the old

I was about to say that the only example that I could think of was the Open University. It is the only institution that I am familiar with where you spend a lot of time working on your own but then everyone gets together. It does not mean that the whole programme is done away from your workstation or whatever, but there is a requirement for some of the programme to be conducted in a human rather than a mechanical way. Perhaps that is what we should be trying to include in the Bill; otherwise, as the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, said, the system will just be abused. No education will take place because it will be a formulaic course which happens to have been accredited somewhere and it will be delivered in a way that the students find extremely difficult to connect with. It will be a sort of blank, compulsory hour in every day that achieves very little.</p>

Nor am I at all sure how we would work it for the Prison Service, and that will be a challenge for OLASS when it comes to look at that side of things. The question is how to reintroduce the human element if you go for distance learning. I think that this issue is well worth discussing between now and Report, and I very much hope that the Minister will take up the invitation from the proposers of the amendment to sit down and talk to them.</p>

In order to avoid a young person being exploited during these 280 hours&#151;for example, in a hairdresser&#146;s doing menial tasks&#151;how will the Government ensure that, if they do not accept the amendment, the training that the young person gets will in fact be of good quality? That is the challenge: how to achieve that without an army of inspectors ensuring that it is done. I rest on that point.</p>

Therefore, I enter this debate with a certain amount of humility.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08103032000239"></a>Amendment No. 8 specifies that the part-time learning undertaken by young people in full-time work should be done away from their workstations. It is not our policy that this learning should always be carried out away from the young person&#146;s workstation. Of course, many young people participating in this way by combining a full-time job with part-time learning will be released by their employer to undertake training elsewhere, such as a college, so that all their learning will necessarily be entirely separate from their normal workplace. However, some other young people fulfilling the duty to participate in this way will receive part-time training provided by their employer&#151;perhaps at a private training provider or at their workplace. We want to encourage this, as it can be very high-quality learning that meets the employer&#146;s business needs and is immediately engaging and relevant to the young person. That is surely what we are all concerned about.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08103032000240"></a>I also could not help reflecting on a recent visit that I made to the Yorkshire and Humber region, where I listened to an employer in a daycare nursery who believed passionately in providing high-quality training. They did so and the training occurred in the workplace, although admittedly someone from a further education institution was brought in to assist in the process. So successful was the quality of the training that they set up a sort of mini-academy, which attracted people from other daycare nurseries. Therefore, there is not only one single route to providing this learning. We need to reflect on and understand what people want, what employers&#146; needs are&#151;a point referred to rightly by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas&#151;and what all of us who have contributed to the debate want; that is, ensuring that we provide a quality provision. I share that concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08103032000241"></a>One of the principles behind the changes that we are making to the 14-19 curriculum and qualifications is that learning should be personalised and delivered in a way that engages the young person and suits his or her individual needs and interests. Some young people learn best when they can immediately see the practical relevance and application of what they are learning. Therefore, it would not be right to specify in the Bill that for all young people learning must be away from the workstation.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08103032000242"></a>I speak from personal experience. As a young man, I suffered the worst and best of employers&#151;those who provided no training whatever and exploited their workforce, and a much better employer who provided an apprenticeship with high-quality training. So I know exactly the kind of perils that young people face in employment situations, about which the best we can say is that they are rich and varied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08103032000243"></a>Therefore, we do not believe it is right to specify in the Bill that for all young people learning must be away from the workstation. Doing so would unnecessarily prohibit a whole range of very worthwhile learning experiences. Some employers are now so serious about the quality of learning that they are looking to be accredited as awarding bodies on the same terms as traditional awarding bodies, and we would not want to deny young people the opportunity to learn with those employers. Simply requiring the learning to take place in a different location would not in itself provide any guarantees about the quality of the learning.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08103032000244"></a>I make it clear that I absolutely agree with my noble friend Lord Layard that the learning that young people undertake must be of the very highest quality. It must involve guided learning, and young people must learn new things, not simply do their day-to-day jobs. That is why I clearly oppose those who suggest that informal, unaccredited, in-house training or simply being employed without training should count. I remind noble Lords that that is the current situation. The Bill is a profound step forward. It is progressive legislation, which will make a fundamental change in the United Kingdom&#146;s workplaces.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08103032000245"></a>I agree that we need much more than that for our young people who are employed and that we would not meet their expectations if it were simply informal, unaccredited, in-house training, but we need to ensure that we continue to allow high-quality guided learning at the workstation, as we know that that is how some young people learn some things best. Although I know that it was meant as a passing comment, I thought that &#147;sitting with Nellie&#148; was an unfortunate phrase to use. I have had some of my best training by sitting down with people who have showed me exactly how to do something. That is very different from how I was taught at a further education college, which was good at the theory. However, when it came to the practical and to knowing exactly how to do a complex electro-mechanical task, there was no substitute for being with someone who had done that task and had a great deal of experience.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08103032000246"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 9. I know that my noble friend is concerned that the clause as drafted could allow employers a way out from providing any training. I reassure him that the clause does not provide such a way out. It says that a young person can be deemed to have participated in enough training if he has participated in a course or courses leading to an accredited qualification that has been assigned sufficient guided learning hours. I stress that point. There have been many contributions and concerns expressed. I understand the concerns, but they do not seem to recognise that the training cannot be just anything that an employer dreams up. If training is funded then it has to go through an accreditation process. Ofqual assigns guided learning hours to each qualification, as part of the accreditation process, as an estimate of the amount of guided learning required to achieve the qualification. This provides a straightforward way for young people, local authorities, employers and others to tell at a glance whether a young person is participating in enough learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08103032000247"></a>Deleting the reference to a course leading to a qualification with the right number of learning hours and relying on a definition that simply required a number of hours of guided learning would mean that someone could miss some hours of scheduled learning as a result of being ill for one day, for example, and would be required to participate in those hours at another time, rather than simply catch up on the learning they had missed, as would normally happen. To make it absolutely clear, this does not mean that employers can simply sign a young person up for a qualification for which they already had the skills and get them accredited without undertaking any actual guided learning. That would clearly not meet the terms of the legislation. In that case, the young person would not have completed a course involving a series of classes or lessons on a particular subject. They would not complete enough hours of actual guided learning to be accredited, so they would be in breach of the duty under the Bill, as would their employer.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08103032000248"></a>We should remember that in many cases the employer will be releasing the young person to do their learning somewhere else, such as a college. We should not presume that all these young people will be at their workstation all the time. Many people will go off on day release and similar schemes. In these cases there will always be a set number of scheduled hours at a completely different location from the workplace, so the question of getting round the requirements will not arise. We are talking only about circumstances in which employers provide accredited training and fund it themselves. My noble friend Lady Whitaker said that she was worried about small employers. I share her concern, but they are the most likely people to go down the funded route. If they do so, be assured that it will have to be accredited. There are safeguards in these circumstances.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08103032000249"></a>We need to ensure that we continue to allow high-quality guided learning that takes place at the workstation. We know that some young people learn some things best in that way. I have already dealt with the point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, who unfortunately is not here. I agree with my noble friend Lady Blackstone that we need to get it right in these circumstances. Perhaps I part company with her generalisation that someone would be better off unemployed than in a dead-end job. It may be a difficult choice.</p>

I was saying that, from the point of view of the Bill, they would be better off unemployed because they would get proper education and guided learning rather than low-quality education and guided learning entirely at the workstation. Does my noble friend accept that nothing, but nothing in the amendment suggests that learning at the workplace is not desirable? All it suggests is that, on top of learning at the workstation, there needs to be some learning outside the workplace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08103032000252"></a>My noble friend Lady Morris said that we need to be clear what the Bill requires and that simply accrediting existing skills without teaching or learning would in no way meet the requirements of the Bill. I will consider my noble friend&#146; point whether, in the specific case of employers who provide and fund the accredited training themselves, we need to do more to satisfy ourselves that the requirements are adhered to in practice. That could involve an increased and more proactive role for local authorities in verifying what is happening when a young person is registered as participating in employer-funded training and checking that a course is being followed. When a course of study leading to a qualification is being publicly funded, both the relevant funding body and Ofsted would have responsibility for ensuring that the appropriate number of guided learning hours was delivered and that the quality of learning experience was of a high standard. Mechanisms are in place for these organisations to require improvement if they have concerns about the guided learning conforming to the requirements of the Bill.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08103032000263"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the funding of sport currently falls into three distinct areas: elite sport, funded by UK Sport; mass participation in communities, funded by Sport England; and schools funding, which is helped by the Youth Sport Trust, which gets no outside funding, and the DCSF.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08103032000264"></a>In 1994 the National Lottery was started by John Major and the last Conservative Government. Four funding bodies were set up: the Millennium Commission, and bodies for sport, for charities and for arts. Let us look at what Her Majesty&#146;s Government have done with this legacy and how it has affected the funding of sport over their 10 years in office.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08103032000265"></a>Looking first at the recent Olympic successes, I point out that grass-roots and elite cycling has received &#163;49.8 million in lottery funds and &#163;18.6 million from the Exchequer since 1997; that is 73 per cent lottery. Since 1997, swimming has received &#163;332.8 million in lottery funds and &#163;14.2 million from the Exchequer; that is 96 per cent lottery. For the Paralympics, lottery funding of disabled sports, NGBs and competitors has been more than six times the Exchequer funding since 1997&#151;&#163;72.7 million versus &#163;11.6 million.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08103032000266"></a>Interestingly, the average age of a GB medal winner in Beijing was 28 and the average age of gold medal winners was 26. All their schooling and early training would have been under the previous Conservative Administration.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08103032000267"></a>Funding of sport is down since 1997. Raids on the lottery for government pet projects have seen total spending on sport decline by &#163;135 million&#151;that is 25 per cent since 1997. More than 80 per cent of grass-roots and elite sports grants have come from the National Lottery. Poor budgeting is costing us our sporting legacy. The Government&#146;s budget miscalculations and further lottery raids will cost sports distributors &#163;70 million. Fifty-eight per cent of UK Sport grants and 83 per cent of Sport England grants come from lottery funds.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08103032000268"></a>Some 800,000 children still do not get two hours of sport per week and 2.1 million children do no competitive sport. The Government were going to appoint 450 competition managers, one for every school sport partnership. Mr Burnham reannounced that they would be appointing 225.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08103032000269"></a>Elite sport is funded in the UK through UK Sport. This is currently a mix of National Lottery&#151;58 per cent&#151;and Exchequer funding, with the vast majority of the latter coming on stream following the announcement of additional funding for 2012 in 2006.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08103032000270"></a>UK Sport currently invests about &#163;100 million per year in Olympic and Paralympic success. Around 85 per cent of this money goes direct to the world-class programmes of national governing bodies to fund and support their athlete programmes, including coaching, sport science and medicine, clothing and equipment, international travel, et cetera, as well as the athlete personal award, which contributes to each athlete&#146;s living and sporting costs.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08103032000271"></a>The funding submission, which the Government went for in 2005-06, required an additional &#163;300 million of funding from 2006 through to 2012, taking the overall budget to &#163;600 million. The Chancellor&#146;s announcement was for a further &#163;300 million but stated that &#163;100 million of that would be raised by private investment. I wonder where that is.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08103032000272"></a>UK Sport now needs to give certainty to sports for their funding for the London Olympiad between 2009 and 2013 so that they can plan and build on the back of Beijing by recruiting and retaining the best coaches, medics, et cetera for the next four years. UK Sport will make all its funding decisions at its board meeting in early December. At that time it will therefore require certainty over the amount of money available to be invested, as the board will only invest what it knows to be available. At the moment, it is able to confirm only &#163;20 million. That has been embedded into lottery forecasts for the period, although this has not been confirmed yet by Camelot. Therefore it is looking at a shortfall of funding of &#163;80 million. Obviously that would impact on its ability to fund sports and to support them with appropriate services over the period.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08103032000273"></a>The DCMS has responsibility for raising the &#163;100 million. It has taken on Fast Track and is developing a scheme called Medal Hopes to raise money against the World Class Events Programme, and, in particular, the athletes funded on it. Since 2006 the Government have stated that they should plan on the basis of a &#163;600 million mission and that is what they have done. Nothing at the moment is confirmed, however, and there continues to be close work with the DCMS on this to ensure that by December we have certainty of necessary resources to make funding decisions, but we are only five weeks away.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08103032000274"></a>On drugs and the national anti-doping organisation, in December last year UK Sport made a recommendation for a new stand-alone agency, which the Government welcomed. Since then, it has been building up the business case and working with the DCMS to understand both the transition and running costs involved. The challenge remains in securing the funding for this and ensuring that the new organisation is able to be world-leading and world-class, with full case-management and investigatory powers, well in time for 2012. I wonder where the money is. The Conservative Party has always fully supported the creation of a fully independent anti-doping agency. Her Majesty&#146;s

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08103032000275"></a>Lottery funding has been crucial to the success of Team GB in Beijing. Since the Athens Olympics in 1996, 58 per cent of grants to elite sport have come from the National Lottery. With regard to Sport England&#146;s strategy, changing directions in the past has been detrimental. Various funding strategies and lack of long-term funding and vision has caused a stop-start approach to plans to boost mass participation. Conservatives have always favoured an NGB-centred strategy to drive up mass participation. Sport England should act as the bank and the auditor of sports funding and leave the NGBs to distribute funding accordingly.</p>

<a name="81030-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08103032000276"></a>Eighty-three per cent of grants going into grass-roots sport have come from the lottery this year. The total going into grass-roots sport now is &#163;135 million less than it was in 1997. As a direct result of Gordon Brown&#146;s raid on lottery cash, lottery funding going into grass-roots sport has fallen by nearly 50 per cent, from &#163;397 million in 1997 to &#163;209 million in 2006. Due to the Olympic raids, sport now gets only 13.5 per cent of lottery funding. About &#163;70 million has been diverted from grass-roots sport to pay for the Olympic overspend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08103032000277"></a>The Youth Sport Trust is responsible for young people&#146;s participation in and enjoyment of sport. It receives no government funding. The Youth Sport Trust plays a central role in supporting the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in the delivery of the PE and sport strategy for young people. The overall aim of the PE and sport strategy is to enhance the take-up of sporting opportunities by five to 16-year-olds; we believe this to be vital.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08103032000278"></a>The emphasis should be placed on primary schools. Those enthused in sport between the ages of seven and 11 are much more likely to continue playing it in later life. The Government must invest in physical education training during initial teacher training. Currently, 60 per cent of primary school PE teachers have less than six hours&#146; training in a year. This does not provide teachers with the confidence and capability to teach quality PE.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08103032000279"></a>On 13 July 2007, Gordon Brown announced a new target for children&#146;s participation in sport. This stated a goal to give every child the chance of five hours of sport every week; yet this was originally included in Labour&#146;s 2005 manifesto, on page 95:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="08103032000726"></a>&#147;Investment in school sports will ensure that by 2010 all children will receive two hours high-quality PE or sport per week. Building on that, we pledge that by 2010 every child who wants it will have access to a further two to three hours sport per week&#148;.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08103032000280"></a>The Conservative policy is to return the lottery to its four original pillars and release an extra &#163;400 million into elite and grassroots sport in the decade following 2012. We would use this extra money to drive increases in participation through the national governing bodies. We would give funding directly to the NGBs to increase mass participation within their sports.

Those involved in governing bodies distributing funds will know very well what opportunities there are. On the CASC scheme, we will increase funding to sports clubs by introducing gift aid relief on junior subscriptions. If the lottery had been left in the configuration intended by John Major and the Conservative Party, the previous decade could have been a fantastic one for sports funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08103032000283"></a>We are once again addressing the vital issue of funding sport in this country. In 1997, the Government promised a high level of commitment to sport. They promised international sporting events and initiatives that would enable and inspire young athletes. To a large extent, they have delivered on that promise and can be proud of the events that this country has hosted: events such as the Rugby World Cup, the Champions League final, the Cricket World Cup and the 2002 Commonwealth Games. I am sure that these would never have taken place without the active assistance of the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08103032000284"></a>Looking to the future, we will be hosting the 2012 Olympics and, if our bid is successful, the Football World Cup, which the Prime Minister is actively pursuing alongside the bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. So the Government have demonstrated their commitment to the nation as regards sport. The phenomenal success in Beijing was the icing on the cake. It was the biggest medal haul since 1912; a total of 47 medals, 19 of which were gold. The Paralympic Games boasted incredible success, too, with more than 100 medals. Those successes are the icing on the cake but, in my view, every cake needs a cherry and that cherry will be London 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08103032000285"></a>The task now is to match or improve on that total at the London Olympic and Paralympic Games.

If we do not, many other countries will poach them from us. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, was right in saying that the main reason for our recent success lies in the investment put in place by the National Lottery. However, if he were to read the debates&#151;I led for the Labour Party in the other place on the lottery&#151;he would see that most of the thrust for changes for sport came from the opposition Benches. Of course, there is the Exchequer cash for both the Olympic and Paralympic Games</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08103032000288"></a>There is more to be done before 2012, as a number of sports did not figure in the medal tables. UK Sport, the body responsible for helping to maximise the performance of all sports, recognises that it will not be easy to achieve. Its ambitions and ours will require a certainty of funding, but also leadership and consistency of approach. To this end, UK Sport has developed Mission 2012, a means of monitoring each element of performance and assessing potential danger areas. It will encourage sports bodies to stay actively aware of how their system is performing and to be creative in problem solving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08103032000289"></a>Winning the bid for London means that the international spotlight will be on London and our home-grown elite athletes, but it also comes with a duty to inspire those at all sporting levels to get involved. We will host the Games in world-class venues such as Wembley, Wimbledon, Lord&#146;s and the Dome. However, we must also ensure that we make local venues and facilities accessible nationwide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08103032000290"></a>There are measures that must be taken at the grassroots level. The CCPR acts to promote sport and recreation as part of a healthy society. As such, it is campaigning for gift aid to be made available on subscription to community amateur sports clubs. I hope that noble Lords will join in this campaign, as I pledge so to do. Gift aid would mean that it would gain 28p in every pound. This applies to subscriptions to the National Trust and the Youth Hostelling Association and would be of enormous support to local sports clubs. With &#163;538.4 million diverted from community sport to pay for the London 2012 Olympics, it needs all the help it can get.</p>

It should be noted that any negligence to cater for the vast majority of people who are disengaged from competitive sport will prove costly in

Elite success is predicated on mass participation and it is crucial that we, as a country, continue to promote mass participation in physical activity in its broadest sense.

The enjoyment of sport is a near universal activity that transcends differences between human beings. It is hard to come across anybody who has not been touched by sport at some point in his or her life. Sport brings people together and occupies a key part in the lives of many people across all countries and sectors. A love of sport is shared globally, and pride in the successful performance of particular teams can be a strong unifying factor in any community.</p>

Governments have rightly been encouraging more people to engage in sporting activity as part of a healthy lifestyle. We cannot, however, avoid the fundamental truth that there is a considerable reduction in participation in sport between the ages of 16 and 18 and when moving into adulthood. That is why promoting and facilitating grassroots sport is so important. Although a number of initiatives have been developed, I want to pay particular tribute to the work of the Rugby Football Union in taking action to promote its sport through the Go Play Rugby initiative. The success of that effort has been rehearsed in other forums, but I want to repeat that it is a good example of how best to re-engage people who may have lost touch with regular sporting activity. We need to learn from its experience and apply the lessons more widely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08103032000295"></a>Another key example can be found in the England and Wales Cricket Board, whose investment has significantly increased the number of children and adults playing cricket at grassroots level, and that has had an impact on performance at elite levels. County cricket clubs are better able to choose high quality players when the pool of people playing the game is increased.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08103032000296"></a>It is very difficult to debate a subject such as the Olympics without also reflecting on funding. The unfolding chaos in the Government's approach to the 2012 Olympic Games is a clear demonstration of that point. I share the concerns stated by the shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport that the Government's use of lottery funds to pay for the 2012 Olympics, largely as a result of their dithering on how best to leverage private sector investment, will have regrettable consequences for sport at the grassroots.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08103032000297"></a>I would be grateful if in his reply to this debate the Minister would assure the House that sports such as rugby union, cricket and netball will not lose out as a consequence of the Olympic Games. There is very real concern on this point, and it would be most helpful if the Minister could clarify the Government's position.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08103032000298"></a>I wish to focus my contribution this afternoon on the funding of grassroots sport and specifically on what could be done to the taxation regime to facilitate investment in grassroots sport. Whatever delight and success may be achieved as a consequence of the Olympic Games in London in under four years' time, if the price to be paid is reductions in resources available to local and community sports clubs we should ask whether that is really a course that we should want to progress.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08103032000299"></a>The interests of specific sports are, by and large, protected and promoted by national governing bodies, such as the England and Wales Cricket Board, the Rugby Football Union and so on. The taxation regime that they face is identical to that of companies, with this exception: national governing bodies do not obtain tax relief for expenditure on grassroots sport development, which is comparable to a company's research and development expenditure. As a consequence, sport governing bodies are taxed on their investment in grassroots sport activity and have to bear the burden of the administrative costs incurred in achieving tax compliance, which is a rather complicated regime.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08103032000300"></a>On that basis, I wonder whether the Minister would consider granting statutory tax relief for grassroots sport expenditure by national governing bodies. If, as seems reasonable, economic circumstances are going to make investment complicated, we should be examining options to facilitate the actions of national governing bodies in delivering grassroots sport activities in local communities. Another potential solution would be a corporation tax exemption for national governing bodies. A recent study has calculated that the cost of a tax exemption would be between &#163;5 million and &#163;10 million a year and would significantly reduce the amount of time spent by governing bodies on tax planning, compliance and payment. A recent study conducted by Deloitte found that, of the 26 European Union states that responded, all except the United Kingdom provided either a tax exemption or special relief to national governing bodies. Effectively, sport bodies in other countries across Europe do not pay corporation tax.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08103032000301"></a>One argument advanced is that sport governing bodies should establish charities in order to benefit from the tax advantages afforded to them. The economic benefits of this route are, however, dubious. The time and costs associated with running a charity are considerable, possibly as much as &#163;5 million a year for national governing bodies. Not all grassroots expenditure would meet the strict definition of charitable expenditure, and charities are unable to reclaim value-added tax, which may result in a substantial VAT bill. I understand that a number of national governing bodies have been in regular communication with the Government to press this point, with limited response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08103032000302"></a>Given that we are entering difficult times, sports bodies have genuine concern about their revenue streams. We have to acknowledge that the Olympic Games could prove more expensive than originally anticipated, particularly given the failure of the Government effectively to engage with the private sector. The stories that abound of sports professionals awash with money are not reflected in the experience of those involved at grassroots level. The National Lottery is increasingly being used to pay for projects that the Government deem worthy, and the original intentions are being undermined. In those circumstances, I urge the Minister to revisit what could be done with the tax system to assist sport governing bodies, and I very much look forward to his response to this debate.</p>

I have always felt that sports funding is rather a Cinderella subject&#151;at least, it has been in the past&#151;because it is the thorn around the rose. It is the thing you do not want to grasp, or the thing that will always come back and bite you. As the noble Lord pointed out in his opening speech, the lottery has covered up what was, shall we say, the refusal by Governments to take this subject seriously for many years. There was a culture of not taking sport seriously. When the lottery was set up, however, I remember the discussion was that it was supposed to be for three good causes. So, whoever took the knife to cut the lottery cake first, it is undoubtedly true that the present Government have taken many more little slices here and there.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08103032000304"></a>Those slices may be for very good causes, and we would not want to be in the middle of a coffin-waving contest over whether we should have research into somebody dying of cancer rather than a playing field, because everyone now admits that we can ultimately come back to this fact: many cancers are stopped or made less frequent by good sporting activity. We have a counter-productive argument there, one that is circular but which we often refuse to acknowledge as being so. If we take only part of that arc, how do we go from here?</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08103032000305"></a>Whatever the problem with the Olympics&#151;and I appreciate that there is one about resources being transferred&#151;they have given a seriousness to the discussion of sport that was not there before. That is undeniable to anyone who has followed the subject, and non-Olympic sports are feeling that they should up their game to try to get in on the edges. I will plead again that rugby sevens should have been included, as it is a wonderful day at a sporting event. I base that on the 2002 Commonwealth Games, which were probably why we have got the Olympics, for after a series of disasters&#151;let us remember Pickett&#146;s Lock, if we are trying to be as fair as possible&#151;we proved that we could do it. Where do we go from here?</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08103032000306"></a>If we accept that private sector funding will be much more difficult to obtain in the foreseeable future, and that the lottery cannot cover everything, we must try to tie in what is going on. To give the Government some praise&#151;of course, it will only be half-hearted, but that is why the Minister is there&#151;the new policy  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1735"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1735</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from the Department of Health builds in greater physical activity, but what do they mean by that? If there is greater activity, is that sport? Reading some of the policy documents and information we have had so far, I do not think that it knows. Are we telling the Department of Health, &#147;You should make sure that there are enough facilities for recreational sport or casual exercise, within certain parts of government such as local authorities, and you are now the gatekeeper on that level of investment and maintenance&#148;? That is the logical extension of bringing in that department.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08103032000307"></a>I have spoken about this subject before, but are we telling the Department of Health that sports medicine should be pushed further up the pile to ensure better access so that injured people, if they have had some form of accident but have neither a great deal of money available nor access to the top echelons of a sporting body, can get their bodies repaired so that they can carry on playing sport? One contributing factor in sport being played more by the middle classes than by those from traditional working-class backgrounds is that if you take part in work that uses your body, you will be less keen to risk damaging it. Why? Because many people with whom I played rugby gave it up after the third time of not being able to put weight on their knee for two weeks. It threatened their mortgage payments. That does not occur to many people who have not been there, but there it is.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08103032000308"></a>How do we tie this all together? After scanning through websites to find out exactly what this new initiative means, I am not sure. There is talk of healthy weight, then talk of the body mass index. I will refer back to a nice, 10-minute rant that I had about that being a medical thing that appears in every doctor&#146;s charts but does not take into account that muscle is heavier than fat. You can thus be an extremely fit athlete and have stopped yourself from being a less fit person, yet have gained considerable weight. Are they taking it seriously? Are they tuned in enough to do that? I suggest that people need to address that slightly more closely. What will they actually take on, and what are they going to do? I should greatly appreciate it if the Minister could give us the first hint today about how that thinking is going on and what is being encouraged.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08103032000309"></a>There are also an incredible number of departments involved. We all know that it is one thing for Ministers to say, &#147;There shall be co-operation in Whitehall&#148;. It is quite another to get people actually to co-operate. Everyone has their own primary objectives within their own department, which we see&#151;let us be honest&#151;in the bids for which gets a Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, is not here, but I am sure that while his experience in fighting for territory, which inspired &#147;Yes Minister&#148;, may have changed a little, it will probably not have done so by much. We have to try to see how those departments are brought together to address this issue.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08103032000310"></a>On some more specific points, I was going to talk about amateur sports clubs, but the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, has done us a service by taking that on and asking: if there is a level of taxation, how do we fit in? We do not know. The noble Lord, Lord Pendry, spoke about Gift Aid, but the thing about that is that it has covered up many cracks in our sporting culture. The  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1736"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1736</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>amateur sports club has survived in spite of what government&#151;generally, and not government by any particular party&#151;have done to it, not because of that. Over time, the current Government have acknowledged that the clubs are a great asset and should be supported, but it is also fair to say that they have taken a lot of pushing to get there.</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08103032000311"></a>Generally, this Government can stand up and say, &#147;We have done more in this field than anybody before us&#148;. The answer is, &#147;So you should have, because you are there now with the knowledge&#148;. The same responsibility will fall on any future Government, who should carry on being able to make that boast. What are we to do about that, and can we refer across again? I understand that the Learning and Skills Council no longer funds coaching courses to get people out there. If ever there was something counter-intuitive to much of the Government&#146;s approach of bringing government together, that is it. You are not giving as much funding towards your coaching courses, which allow your people to take part in a positive and safe way. It also makes sure that you have control over what goes on in the sport, to encourage greater participation in and enjoyment of it. Moreover, you have removed funding because it did not fit another government target about getting people skills for employment, and for the young. That was a laudable aim, but how do you bring the two together until there are employment opportunities&#151;not as many as for skills levels in coaching, perhaps&#151;when you have contradicted yourselves?</p>

<a name="81030-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08103032000312"></a>I could go on like this for some considerable time&#151;but only, I see, for another minute-and-a-half&#151;yet the fact of the matter is that the Government are making moves and noises that sound about right. What guarantees will they give that they will make real efforts to ensure that all parts of Government talk to each other about sport funding, that there are to be no more cuts into the lottery cake in the foreseeable future, and that we can start to say that spending to support activity, for instance, in the Department of Health, will support sport? We will thus make sure that sports funding is guaranteed and increased, to help that department, rather than saying &#147;Well, if the Department of Health is doing it, we will cut sport because we are already doing it twice&#148;, for double-minus counting is still double counting.</p>

I thank my noble friend Lord Pendry, who is under enormous pressure because of his obligations to sport elsewhere in the country, for his contribution. I am sorry that he is taking the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, off his Christmas list and hope that relationships will be re-established by then. I am not taking the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, off my Christmas list but, like my noble friend Lord Pendry, I was shocked by the nature of the challenge put forward by the noble Lord. He suggested that all was doom and gloom in government policy in relation to sport and that we had a fairly blasted landscape in the area of sporting achievement. That is not correct, so let us be absolutely clear about the facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08103032000314"></a>If we look at what the situation was in 1996, we certainly see a different position today. I remind the House that at the Atlanta Olympics we won only nine gold medals. If the noble Lord is saying that the extraordinary achievement of our athletes to win 19 gold medals and finish fourth in the medals table in the recent Olympics is down to their efforts and their coaches primarily, I agree with him wholeheartedly. If he is saying that government funding has a part to play, I agree with him on that too. If therefore we have four times the achievement in the Olympic Games in 2008 compared with 1996, which was at the end of a two decade period of Conservative rule, I can say only that our record compares very favourably with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08103032000315"></a>On school sport, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, berated me because the Government have not yet hit their target of five hours sport and exercise for children. However, that target relates to 2010 and, like all government targets, it is an ambitious one.</p>

But in the past decade we have seen a substantial increase in the number of hours available to children for exercise. The noble Lord identified the minority of children who are not getting two hours sport and exercise a week; but 90 per cent of our children are. When his party was last in power it was 20 per cent.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08103032000318"></a>The sale of school playing fields was rife under the previous Administration. We have put a stop to that. On the few occasions when playing fields are sold because of development possibilities or because they are substandard, it is on the strict condition that sporting facilities must be enhanced as a result of the sale. As we all know, through the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a massive reduction in the availability of facilities and playing fields for our schoolchildren.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08103032000319"></a>On swimming, it is now the case that 61 per cent of the country&#146;s total swimming stock and 52 per cent of public sector swimming pools have been built or refurbished since 1996 and the Government are now able to talk in terms of guaranteeing the over-60s free access to swimming pools. What a contrast with the perspective that we had when we came to power. So the charges of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, against the Government&#146;s record on sport are ill founded.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08103032000320"></a>I have listened carefully during the debate for suggestions on where we might get extra resources for sport. Having some responsibility as a government spokesman in this area, I am always eager to see how we can enhance opportunities for our people. I share with the whole House and everyone who has participated in the debate the sense of importance that sport represents in terms of opportunities for our people and for the health of our people. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, will recognise that health is not to be the lead department. In fact, the co-ordinating role for the onslaught on obesity is held by the Treasury as the funder; we have made clear that the Treasury has to have a role in this. But health has the statistics which measure the levels of obesity in the country, particularly among children, and it must play its part if we are going to make a  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1738"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1738</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>successful onslaught on what we all recognise is one of the worst features of our children&#146;s development. In western societies with ready access to the wrong kinds of food, we have levels of obesity which lead to ill health subsequently and are a significant factor in the difficulties faced by children. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, will recognise that the co-ordinated strategy involving the budgets of departments other than the DCMS is of significant importance.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08103032000321"></a>I listened for ideas on how to obtain extra resources and two sources were suggested. The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, said that we should look for a way in which we could exempt sports clubs from VAT. That is not an easy issue to advance and at the same time to suggest that it would not be a demand on public resources. Although it does not represent public expenditure, the withdrawal of such VAT would represent a significant reduction in government receipts, which is the other side of the ledger. We have been more concerned to promote schemes, particularly relationships with sports clubs, which yield grass-roots success.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08103032000322"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, said that sports clubs have filled the gap which society has otherwise left. That is not how I look upon sports clubs. Sport will always be a voluntary activity; the majority of organisations providing local and community sport will be voluntary ones. Would we want anything else? The only alternative would look dreadfully like state centralism and I shudder at the very concept. Of course sport at a local level is going to be voluntary; the question is how we can, through public resources, encourage the successful development of that voluntary activity and aid sports clubs which play such a significant role in this.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08103032000323"></a>Before the Summer Recess we debated in the Moses Room aspects of rugby union with regard to this factor. We have had debates in which we have discussed giving sportsmen chances to shine and a mix of government matching private resources to give opportunities to young cricketers. An intelligent way is to advance government resources to encourage partnerships between schools and private clubs. This is an absolutely crucial link to forge and one which a decade or so ago reflected a marked discontinuity which we have sought to bridge. We are concerned to give help to clubs, support in terms of resources for professional coaching and links between clubs and schools in order to overcome exactly the issue to which the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, drew attention.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08103032000324"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, berated the Government for their failure to produce the necessary resources, but we have provided four times the resources for Sport England than obtained in 1996-97. So when he berates the limited resources at the present time, let us put that into the context of the resources that were available in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08103032000325"></a>I listened for suggestions on the crucial issue of where the resources should come from, and what did I get from the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran? Having berated the Government for having raided the lottery, he suggested better organised use of lottery funds. What else did I get? That we should cut red tape and the administrative costs of the lottery. By heavens, the last refuge of the Conservative politician is to talk

I reject the point made by the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08103032000326"></a>I recognise that the Olympic Games are an important cost in the sporting arena and that inevitably there will be pressures on community sport as a result of our determination to make the Olympic Games a huge success, but let us be clear about a number of things. In terms of sporting recognition for the nation, hosting the great and successful Olympic Games of 2012 will do more to boost interest and participation in sport than pretty well anything else that we can conceive of. We are right to concentrate our efforts on making sure that the Games are successful, and on making sure that British athletes are equal to the challenge which, inevitably, competition at Olympic level requires.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08103032000327"></a>I make absolutely no apology for concentrating resources on elite athletes. I take pride, as, I am sure the whole House does, in the achievements of our Olympic gold, silver and bronze medallists, and indeed other competitors who acquitted themselves extraordinarily well at the Olympic and Paralympic Games this last year, giving a great lift to the nation. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, that we must have due regard to community sport. I recognise that we need to make sure that Sport England is equipped to play its full role in that respect. We guarantee that Sport England will have a greater budget over this forthcoming three-year period than it has enjoyed in the past. We recognise the limitations of that body, which has expansive plans and opportunities, and wants to fulfil its role in those terms. It has behind it a Government with a decade of significant achievement in sport. At the end of the day, this is not the responsibility of government, but the responsibility of sportsmen and women up and down the land, to whom we ought to pay tribute.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08103032000333"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, before introducing this amendment, I should declare an interest as president of the National Governors&#146; Association.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08103032000334"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to create a statutory right for children to participate in decisions that affect them in their education by introducing a new duty on local authorities and governing bodies of maintained schools to have due regard to the views of children. As your Lordships will know, the Government ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991. That gives all children the right to express their views and have them taken into account and given due weight, according to their age and maturity, in all matters affecting them. However, when in October 2008 the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child reviewed the implementation of the convention in the UK, it concluded that,</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000872"></a>&#147;participation of children in all aspects of schooling is inadequate, since children have very few consultation rights&#148;.</ul>
<a name="81030-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08103032000335"></a>The committee of 18 independent experts called for the Government to ensure that there is a statutory right for children to influence education decision-making. It called for the Government to,</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000873"></a>&#147;promote, facilitate and implement, in legislation as well as in practice, within ... schools ... the principle of respect for the views of the child&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000699"></a>and to,</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000874"></a>&#147;strengthen children&#146;s participation in all matters of school, classroom and learning which affect them&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000700"></a>That recommendation echoes those of the four UK children&#146;s commissioners and the 2007 investigation into citizenship education by the Education and Skills Committee.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08103032000336"></a>In September 2007, a review commissioned by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, on school councils called for all secondary schools to have a school council. The review found that the majority of teachers agreed that school councils should be a statutory requirement in England.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08103032000337"></a>Concerns were expressed in Committee that we should not be unduly prescriptive on schools as to how they listen to children. That is, of course, a very important qualification. In light of these concerns, the amendment has been redrafted. It does not specify the methods that schools and LEAs should employ to pay due regard to the views of children. However, it ensures&#151;and surely it is right, in today&#146;s world, to do so&#151;that every child has the opportunity to give their views on their education and for these to be taken seriously.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08103032000338"></a>Many of your Lordships will have participated in similar debates in 2002, when Section 176 of the Education Act 2002 was introduced. It obliges schools to have due regard to guidance on participation. But, sadly, this is not having the desired impact. In 2006, a freedom of information survey by the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance for England found that less than 45 per cent of local education authorities had taken any action to inform school staff of the guidance. The action taken, unsurprisingly, was minimal. Less than 20 per cent have run any training and only 10 per cent had informed children of the guidance.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1741"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1741</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81030-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08103032000339"></a>A 2007 Ofsted national survey of children&#146;s views found that nearly four in every 10 children&#151;38 per cent&#151;reported that children&#146;s views are listened to &#147;not much&#148; or &#147;not at all&#148; in the running of their school. A further 11 per cent of children said that they did not know whether children&#146;s views were listened to or not. That is nearly half of all children surveyed. A clear gap has opened up. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="08103032000340"></a><a name="81030-0009.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="81030-0009.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08103032001047"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> My Lords, my name is added to that of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, in supporting the amendment. The noble Baroness mentioned Article 12 of the UN convention. In addition, Article 4 requires the Government to undertake all appropriate legislative measures for the implementation of the convention&#146;s provisions. This is a call for legislation, not just to spread best practice.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08103032000341"></a>The children&#146;s Minister recently accepted the Government&#146;s obligations under the convention, saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="08103032000734"></a>&#147;We have an obligation under international law to ensure that the rights set out in the convention are given effect&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons Public Bill Committee, 24/6/08; col. 45.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000701"></a>Legislation is clearly required here, given the gap that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, has mentioned.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08103032000342"></a>As the noble Baroness said, there was some criticism that our previous amendment was a little too prescriptive, and we have tried to respond to that. There are many ways in which schools&#151;at least, those which demonstrate best practice&#151;very effectively listen to the voices of children and give their views due weight. I would like to give one example of the way in which that is done. In doing so, I declare an interest as a trustee of UNICEF UK.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08103032000343"></a>I refer to the Rights Respecting Schools programme. If any of your Lordships have not visited such a school, I think that they would find it very inspiring to do so. I have visited them at primary and, more recently, at secondary level, at an Andover school. I have never been to schools where the children are so empowered, happy, inspired and engaged in their education. That is because they really are valued, not just by the support staff and the teachers but because they value and respect each other. That respect is built on their understanding of their rights under the convention. Their rights are very overt in the curriculum and, as a result of those rights, so are their duties and responsibilities to each other. It makes for a happy school, high-quality learning and responsible and well adjusted young people; and it can only be to the advantage of everybody that young people grow up in schools such as those.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08103032000344"></a>That is just one way of involving young people and taking account of their views and, while it is one of the best ways, it is not the only one. That is why our amendment is not prescriptive. I welcome the fact that since we had our debate about this in Committee, the Equality and Human Rights Commission has supported our amendment. It says that Article 12 of the UN convention, which covers respect for the views of the child, states that when adults are making decisions that affect children, children have the right to say what they think should happen and have their opinion taken into account.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1742"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1742</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81030-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08103032000345"></a>The commission believes that this amendment will help to protect that right. So we hope that the Government, who have made great strides in listening more to the views of children and giving them their rights under the convention, will listen to the calls on all sides for this right to be heard to be enshrined in UK legislation. This Bill is the first opportunity we have had in legislation to put into effect what the Committee on the Rights of the Child called for in its report of 3 October, so I hope that we will take this opportunity.</p>

Perhaps I may take the first opportunity that I have had to welcome him to his new post and to wish him the greatest success in it. I hope that, by joining the list of people with whom he has to deal, I have slightly reduced the height of the fence that he feels he has to jump.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08103032000347"></a>I apologise to your Lordships, first, for not having attached my name to this amendment and, secondly, for, with disgracefully bad manners, tabling an amendment after today&#146;s Marshalled List had been printed, both of which I deplore. Unfortunately, three and a half of the past 10 days of my life have been wiped out by a virus. In the haste to catch up with other things that have become undone in that time, some things to do with this Bill have fallen by the wayside.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08103032000348"></a>I support the amendment. It has already been demonstrated that the Government are under a legal obligation to include a provision of this kind in the Bill. That bears repeating: they are under a legal obligation to do so, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, made clear. I shall add only a grace note or two to what has been said already. The benefits of consulting children are obvious when they are drawn into the process, but they lie elsewhere as well. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, did not mention the exercise, which she mentioned to me earlier, whereby an education authority consulted children about the architectural design of their school. It learnt a great deal of valuable material from it; in particular, ways of avoiding little secret places in which small children could be bullied by bigger children. Lower down the age range, it is very useful for a six-foot architect to be talked to by a three-foot child about what it is like to be in a room designed by the six-foot architect. These things are very valuable.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08103032000349"></a>It is an opportune moment to mention that the Government are engaged with rather less publicity than one might have expected in a 15-year programme of pulling down almost all the schools that exist and replacing them. If there was ever a moment when children&#146;s advice was terrifically needed, it is now, and this amendment, therefore, or something very like it, should go straight into the Bill.</p>

My noble friend Lady Morris then agreed that it was desirable to take the views of children into account, but sounded a note of caution that it

The amendment has been tailored to meet that small concern and I am happy to offer my support for it.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08103032000351"></a>We have argued, sometimes&#151;quite rightly&#151;at length, that one of the biggest obstacles to getting young people to continue in education is the lack of engagement that some feel. It is quite right, therefore, that schools and local education authorities make an effort to encourage such engagement. Of course, there may be concerns about giving a veto to mischievous children, but I think that the wording of this amendment avoids that risk. I agree with the spirit of the noble Baroness&#146;s arguments.</p>

This Government are committed to involving young people as widely as possible in matters which affect them.</p>

<a name="81030-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08103032000353"></a>We make decisions that impact on children and young people every day. Ensuring that their views are heard and valued not only has the potential to improve services for young people, as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, pointed out, but has a positive impact on the school environment and the local community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08103032000354"></a>Through effective pupil participation, schools give young people the opportunity to develop critical thinking, advocacy and influencing skills, helping every child to fulfil their potential.

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08103032000355"></a>The amendment, however, places a direct duty on school governing bodies to establish a school council or other mechanism and to have regard to the ascertainable views of all their pupils on matters that affect them. I do not agree that amending primary legislation is the most powerful or effective way of bringing about the improvements that we all seek. Research shows that more than 95 per cent of schools already have a school council&#151;I can point to my own experience as a governor of a local primary school, where we have an effective school council that ascertains the views of its pupils. We have updated and strengthened guidance, which should serve to encourage the introduction of school councils in the few schools which do not have them and support those schools which run them well and use them as one of a number of ways of listening to their pupils. I echo some of the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, who gave another example of an effective means of involving and empowering young people.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08103032000356"></a>We have a powerful lever, which we should not underestimate, in Ofsted inspections. They evaluate how well schools take account of the views of children and young people. The value of inspection is that it involves dialogue with the school about improving where necessary and recognising its strengths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08103032000357"></a>Section 176 of the Education Act 2002 already provides for the consultation of pupils on issues that affect them. It provides for statutory guidance, to which local authorities and governing bodies must have regard, about consultation of pupils when decisions affecting them are taken.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1744"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1744</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08103032000358"></a>We have just reviewed and strengthened the guidance, <I>Working Together</I>, to help schools effectively to put the principle of pupil consultation into practice. Furthermore, we have ensured that school inspection arrangements assess how well schools take account of the views of children and young people.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08103032000359"></a>The current arrangements offer a non-prescriptive approach, allowing schools to find the best way of involving young people. A rich variety of methods is being used by schools in addition to school councils. Supporting schools through guidance enables them to develop approaches that work for them and to adapt them over time as circumstances change.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08103032000360"></a>The amendment would require all schools to consult all pupils in all circumstances. This is against our drive to free schools up, within boundaries&#151;provided, in this case, through guidance&#151;to take their own decisions. We want to avoid introducing a broad statutory requirement that is likely to cause schools difficulties.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08103032000361"></a>I shall answer some of the understandable concerns expressed by a number of noble Lords. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and all noble Lords who entered into the debate, talked about the legal obligation and the current provision not giving children the right to be consulted, as required by Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. We continue to embed in practice the spirit of that resolution in a meaningful way for children and young people. Listening to children is an important outcome for all children, in <I>Every Child Matters</I>. We are ensuring that Ofsted inspectors look at how local authorities, as well as schools, are doing.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08103032000362"></a>It has also been said that we are not meeting the obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Although that has no direct legal force, and the detail of implementation is left to individual states, we think that the guidance is in the spirit of the convention and will provide a helpful mechanism in allowing schools effectively to listen to the views of their pupils.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08103032000363"></a>There is no difference between us on the need to ensure that schools involve and empower their young students and pupils. This is really about whether we need something in the Bill. We do not believe that we do&#151;we believe that we have enough effective powers already.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08103032000364"></a>I could not help smiling at the two references to height made by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, as my colleague and I are a bit sensitive to that, being somewhat vertically challenged. He made a point about consultation on the architecture and design of schools. That is a point very well made, but do we really need it in the Bill? We think that we have demonstrated in what we have achieved so far, with the guidance and Ofsted inspection, that current provision is more than sufficient. We hope that noble Lords will take that into account and that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, will withdraw her amendment.</p>

It surprises me that a number of noble Lords seem to think that there is a legal requirement to put this into practice under the Bill, and that this right has to be adhered to by schools, local authorities and governing bodies. In Scotland, children have had this right since 2000 and there has been no problem there at all. Indeed, Wales and Scotland have a much better record in this respect. Are we really prepared to be second to them in how we carry out legislative requirements?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08103032000366"></a>All I can say is that I am very disappointed, as I had expected a much more sympathetic response. I do not mind at all being told that certain words or commas are wrong and that the amendment should be taken away and redone, but we made it clear that children would be consulted in accordance with their age and maturity. We obviously do not intend that children should be consulted who cannot give any form of constructive reply that makes any sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08103032000370"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 12 I shall speak also to Amendment No. 13, which is grouped with it. In our Amendment No. 64 in Committee, my noble friend Lady Sharp asked why academies, city technology colleges and so on were not included in the Clause 11 duty to promote attendance. She supposed that the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, would say that it was because such a duty would be in the funding agreement, and so he did&#151;that is exactly what he said. He also said that, through that agreement, they must have regard to the same guidance as maintained schools on improving behaviour and attendance. However, those agreements cannot be challenged once they are set. He also claimed that there was no need to extend the legal duty to CTCs because they are successful schools which already have high levels of post-16 attendance, and that was why they were not listed in this Bill. Well, if that is the case, there is no harm in including them for the sake of equity and completeness.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08103032000371"></a>We have tabled this amendment again in order to emphasise the point and to ask the Minister why community schools will have a legal duty to promote post-16 attendance while academies will not. I should have thought that it was in the interest of all schools to do this once post-16 education becomes the law. This, by the way, is another amendment on which the Equality and Human Rights Commission agrees with us. That is a matter of some satisfaction to us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08103032000372"></a>Amendment No. 13 would amend Clause 12, which is headed:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="08103032000736"></a>&#147;Duty to make arrangements to identify persons not fulfilling duty [to participate] imposed by Section 2&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000702"></a>We return to this issue because it raises the question of local authority responsibilities in the implementation of this part of the Bill. They are responsible for chasing up the young person who flouts its directions and fails to register for either education or training. They are responsible for keeping a register of all young people in their area and checking up on what they are doing between the ages of 16 and 18 and for enforcing the provisions of the Act. In Committee, we had lengthy discussions on how they might do that and the resources at their disposal.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08103032000373"></a>As the Bill stands, the authority must establish,</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000875"></a>&#147;so far as it is possible to do so&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000703"></a>the identities of the people in its area to whom this part of the Bill applies. Amendment No. 13 therefore adds the rider that that should be &#147;possible and reasonable&#148;. As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said in Committee, the Bill as it stands puts no limit on things. What is &#147;possible&#148; may be wildly expensive. Is the local authority expected to employ private detectives to chase children who may have dispersed around the world? Reasonable, he said, seems to be the right word, to which the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, replied that it was really just a matter of semantics. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000876"></a>&#147;the definition of what is possible must encompass what is reasonable&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000374"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Elton, who is no longer in his place, then responded by asking that the Minister consult his lawyers. He said:</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000877"></a>&#147;Most of us are much more familiar with the use of &#145;reasonable&#146; in legislation than with &#145;possible&#146;, and there may be advantages in using it&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 1/7/08; col. 214.].</ul>
<a name="81030-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08103032000375"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, promised to write to the noble Lord, Lord Elton, and my noble friend Lady Sharp on the subject, and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said that he would also like a copy of the letter. As the Minister was writing, he was asked if he would also explain the mechanisms by which a local authority was expected to track down all these young people. My noble friend has not received a letter on the subject and I would be interested to know whether the noble Lords, Lord Elton and Lord Lucas, have received one.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08103032000376"></a>I return to where we started. What is &#147;possible&#148; is very open-ended. There are clearly limits to the expenditure that local authorities should conscientiously incur on such searches in carrying out their duty to identify who is failing to participate. It is therefore wholly reasonable that the words &#147;and reasonable&#148; should be added to Clause 12. I beg to move.</p>

When the Minister responded on this point, he made a somewhat less than watertight argument against the need to accept the amendment. He said that the city technology colleges,</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08103032000378"></a>That raises two points.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08103032000379"></a>First, I am sure that some if not all of the institutions listed in the Bill will be dismayed by the implication that they have been included because they are unsuccessful schools with uncommitted and poorly behaved pupils; in other words, they cannot be trusted in the same way as the Government&#146;s handpicked favourites. I hope that that is not the message that the Government wish to send out.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08103032000380"></a>Secondly, the exemption from being placed under a statutory duty seems to be based on a potentially ephemeral criterion. These colleges are successful now, and their current crop of students is currently committed, but will that always remain the case? What will happen if that fortunate situation changes? I can see the loophole in that argument opening up before our eyes.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08103032000381"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, merely used a poor choice of words to express himself. However, the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, is right to seek clarification. I agree with her that the two words &#147;and reasonable&#148;, which would be inserted by Amendment No. 13, would improve the drafting of this clause. It may seem a trifling point. However, as my noble friend Lord Lucas said when he spoke in favour of the amendment in Committee, simply asking the local authority to do what is possible is not practical in a technical sense. A local education authority could go to any number of lengths to establish the identities of those who are not complying with the duty; but not all will be feasible. It is right that there should be a duty for local education authorities, but it must be reasonable and practical.</p>

It is time that the Government faced up to the problem of these funding agreements and put in primary legislation what they actually intend. We spent most of this morning saying that this is a flagship piece of legislation that will change the world and make life different for all young people between 14 and 19. It is essential to the economic prosperity and well-being of our nation. It is even more important now, given the economic recession that may be coming, that we make sure that this is as good as it can be.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08103032000383"></a>Apparently, through all the debate, there has been a caveat that exempts 16 to 19 year-olds who go to city academies or other schools outlined in this amendment. I do not for a minute think that the Minister intends that this legislation should not apply to 16 to 19 year-olds who attend these schools; I would be amazed if she stood up and made that point. Presumably the answer is, &#147;Well, we deal with that in a separate way, by making it part of the funding agreement&#148;. However, there is no reason for a twin-track approach. These are publicly funded schools. Every penny of revenue funding for these schools comes from the taxpayer. Life has indeed changed, and the money that formerly was  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1748"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1748</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>given by sponsors to support these schools&#151;accounting for 10 per cent of the cost of academies&#151;is now no longer given in most cases, and never did arrive in the case of city technology colleges 20 years ago. The first question for the Minister is, why should wholly publicly funded schools, that take in children who are funded under the same financial regulations as any other child attending a state school, not be subject to this flagship legislation?</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08103032000384"></a>The second is, can the Minister give your Lordships an example of any circumstance in which she or a ministerial colleague would negotiate a contract in which abiding by this legislation was not a part? If she can, I would be amazed. The truth is, by not including these schools in primary legislation, she gives the impression that there is a separate negotiating business deal going on; that she is prepared to sit down with the funder who is going to sign the sponsorship agreement and talk to him or her about whether this legislation should apply to children in their schools. I do not believe that she is going to do that.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08103032000385"></a>The possible answer is, &#147;Why do this? Why not just accept the funding agreement? You have accepted that what I intend will be implicit in this piece of legislation&#148;. There are two reasons. I praise the Government, particularly under the leadership of the new Secretary of State, for trying, over the past 12 months, to draw academies and city technology colleges into the family of schools. Minor legislative changes have covered the teaching of core subjects of the national curriculum and admission arrangements that were included in the previous flagship Education Bill. The Secretary of State has been clear that academies will have to abide by these good things. I cannot think why the Government have not seized this opportunity to build on this, by making this the piece of legislation in which academies and city technology colleges are listed as institutions to which it will apply.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08103032000386"></a>This is about transparency. In primary legislation, it is transparent to all parents and taxpayers that this legislation will apply to children in maintained schools. The funding agreement is secret. I am not even sure that it is published. It is certainly not amendable through representations by the public. I do not think that it is even covered by the Freedom of Information Act, but I will stand corrected if I am wrong on that. There is no way in which the voter, the taxpayer or parent of the pupil can have an input. I find it difficult to think of any of my political colleagues who can make a case for it being acceptable to put into this flagship piece of legislation a secret funding agreement, negotiated on a one-to-one basis behind closed doors rather than openly and transparently.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08103032000387"></a>My final plea is that this legislation is not about schools, sponsors and the Government but, to my mind, about giving entitlement to young people. It gives entitlement to young citizens of this country between the ages of 16 and 19 to expect that we, as adults in this legislature, give them a right to high-quality education and training. Why are we creating a situation in the law of the land whereby this adult Parliament gives that right by primary legislation to all 16 to 19 year-olds apart from those who attend academies and city technology colleges? It is about time that the  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1749"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1749</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government looked seriously at how they deal with these funding agreements. I am surprised that the Secretary of State has not taken the opportunity to do it now. I could not speak more strongly in favour of Amendment No. 12. It makes sense. We owe it to the 16 to 19 year-olds who will attend these schools, and their parents, to ensure that their entitlement and opportunities are defended in primary legislation, just as they are for every other 16 to 19 year-old.</p>

I am not sure why it did not get to other Members who participated in Committee. I shall ensure that that letter is circulated.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08103032000389"></a>On the points on the use of the language to which that letter referred, we agree that we should limit the burdens on local authorities in general. Clause 12 forms a key part of the local authorities&#146; overarching duty to promote participation. It is clear that, for a local authority to fulfil its duty of promoting participation, it will need to know who is not participating and what is being done to re-engage them.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08103032000390"></a>If the amendment were accepted, it would weaken that duty on local authorities and could lead to them failing to provide the necessary support to help some young people re-engage. While Clause 12 would require the local authority to go beyond what is merely reasonable, we intend to make clear in guidance the kind of arrangements that, if made, would be taken to satisfy the duty; that is exactly what the noble Baroness was asking about. There will be guidance to help local authorities understand exactly what is expected of them.</p>

<a name="81030-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08103032000391"></a>However, I also suspect that the difference between our interpretations of the use of this language is not as great as it seems. While many of us in this House are familiar with the term &#147;reasonable&#148; in legislation, as opposed to &#147;possible&#148;, I assure noble Lords that there are in excess of 200 examples on our statute books of the phrase in question. I have not counted them, but I am advised that this is the case. While there may be a fine distinction between the terms, an interpretation of what is possible&#151;I cannot believe that I am saying this&#151;would also encompass what is reasonable. Altering the wording as proposed in Amendment No. 13 would give the wrong impression to local authorities on the importance of the duty. We are concerned that suggesting that local authorities should not use their best endeavours would downplay the pivotal importance of identifying young people who have fallen out of the system.</p>

He said we are requiring academies, through their funding agreements, to have regard to the same guidance as maintained schools on improving behaviour and attendance. I am hearing an impassioned plea that I should perhaps expand on those words in a more demanding fashion.

Perhaps she might reflect that the point of primary legislation means that, beyond her decisions in her office during her time as a Minister, the opportunities laid out in the legislation will be available to children and young people. I spoke in support of the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. I am not satisfied by a promise of just stronger words. Perhaps my noble friend might reflect on whether she might come back at Third Reading with a government amendment.</p>

Therefore, I suggest that instead of amending the ambition to have 400 academy funding agreements, it would be much easier to put it in legislation and add it to the list. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley, has made a most telling point, which I failed to do, and I pay tribute to her for that; it is a matter of transparency and of how it looks. If the Government want academies to be seen to be giving the same rights and entitlements to 16 to 19 year-olds as everyone else, there is no reason why Amendment No. 12 should not be accepted.

It is not possible in guidance to define what is possible, unless it is extremely long guidance. It is possible in guidance to define what is reasonable, and I recommend that the Minister think again about this. Guidance can certainly advise local authorities on the range of things they could put in place which the Government would regard as reasonable in carrying out this duty to identify young people who are not participating. I accept that they cannot carry out their other duties unless they know who the young people are, but it is not possible to define in guidance everything that it is possible for a local authority to do. If you do that, you are not defining what is reasonable. The Government might think they are limiting what a local authority would have to do but I think what they are proposing is actually broadening

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08103032000403"></a>Despite the Government&#146;s replies then, I think it is necessary to get absolute assurances on this point. The collection, use and sharing of people&#146;s personal details, which can include some highly confidential information, must be treated with utmost care and respect. The Minister&#146;s predecessor said himself in Committee that he understood that Parliament had an absolute duty to see that personal data are handled appropriately and not in an unauthorised way, and that security is paramount. He went on to point out that the provisions in the Bill are very similar to those which Parliament has agreed in respect of the Learning and Skills Act 2000. A good deal has happened since 2000 and while it may be embarrassing for the Government to be reminded, they none the less have a truly dismal record in keeping records safe. I do not think that it is unreasonable to look carefully at what reassurances and safety mechanisms we can place in the Bill.</p>

That may seem a very tight time frame, but once again it should spur efficiency and care on the part of the local authority, which would have to make a deliberate and considered choice about what information it was going to supply rather than simply offloading personal data indiscriminately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08103032000407"></a>Amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 66 reflect what I see as the desirability of opting in. They simply hand a measure of empowerment to the people whose details are being collated. They are, after all, their data and they should be allowed to say whether they may be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08103032000408"></a>I hope that noble Lords will recognise that I am not trying to be difficult on this matter. I strongly believe that we in this place owe it to the people whose lives will be affected by the measures in the Bill to show that we have considered the consequences. It is unfortunate that in the past year or so we have seen the worry, confusion and concern that are caused when vast amounts of personal data get lost in the post, are stolen from an office or are left uncoded on a laptop on a train. I hope that the Government have had the time and inclination to give more thought to this matter. I beg to move.</p>

In particular, we agree with the argument put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, when we debated this matter in Committee: given the constituency of young people to whom this provision is addressed, it is unnecessarily bureaucratic to expect them to have given their written consent to this information being included.</p>

It suggests that the Border and Immigration Agency should be included in the list of institutions at Clause 16(2).

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08103032000412"></a>The issue is whether the Border and Immigration Agency should be added to the list of information providers in Clause 16(2). The list comprises all the agencies that are expected to supply information to the local authority about the activities and movements of young people so that the local authority can build a comprehensive database of all young people in its area. It includes the health authorities, police and probation services, and young offender services. We pointed out that, with the substantial number of people immigrating into this country, and especially with the arrival of a considerable number of unaccompanied

The Minister responded by saying that the list exactly reproduced that in the Learning and Skills Act 2000 and he did not see that the Border and Immigration Agency would provide information that could not be obtained elsewhere. However, when I questioned that, giving the example of eastern European families settling in some areas of the UK, he promised to go away and think about the issue further, asking officials how such a family might otherwise be picked up. I wonder whether the department have indeed had further thoughts on the subject, and I shall be interested to hear from the Minister what they are.</p>

Young people can be acutely sensitive about their personal data and what is known about them&#151;perhaps in some ways more than adults are. They mind very much what people say about them&#151;behind their backs, as they would see it. On many occasions, the information about us is wrong; there is a lot of sloppiness and carelessness. You are very dependent on the people who enter the information being scrupulously careful, but that is not always the case. I have seen my own health records and was appalled at the number of errors there were. I am sure that that is multiplied many millions of times over in the huge plethora of information that various government agencies now hold about us all.</p>

<a name="81030-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08103032000414"></a>A young person should know that this information has been recorded. They should see it so that they can find out whether it is correct. They should understand who holds it and who has access to it. I understand very well why my Liberal Democrat colleagues feel nervous about young people&#146;s ability always to sign things. The only way to know that somebody has actually read something and knows what is being said about them is if they send back a written return. Otherwise they may just shove it in the bedroom drawer and not bother to read it. It is terribly important that they know what is being said about them and that they have an opportunity to correct it. I very strongly support the amendment and hope that the Government will think seriously about it.</p>

It does not say that it must be relevant to any of the functions of the authority or school. If I am wrong, I shall be glad to be reassured but it seems that there could be some eccentric gathering of information that could be quite harmful to the individuals concerned.

<a name="81030-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08103032000417"></a>I shall start my response to this important discussion by outlining some of the general points about the information-sharing provisions in the Bill. It is worth being clear again that this information sharing is not new. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, alluded to that. Information sharing between learning providers and Connexions and between Jobcentre Plus and Connexions has been in place since the Learning and Skills Act 2000, as my noble friend Lord Adonis made clear in Committee. Schools, colleges and job centres currently provide information to Connexions so that it can track young people and provide appropriate and timely support.</p>

<a name="81030-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08103032000418"></a>Accepting the amendments would add bureaucracy and complexity to the system, although I understand the concerns that have motivated them. They would reduce the ability of local authorities to provide the timely and appropriate support to young people that is so important. We know that interventions that are rapid are most likely to be effective in getting a young person back into learning. That is what is so important. In addition, and probably most importantly, a number of safeguards are already in place. Under the Data Protection Act individuals have the right to request a copy of the personal information held on them by an organisation. As the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, said, if there are concerns about accuracy, that is the route for people to ensure that information is correct. The organisation must inform the individual if personal data relating to him or her is being shared, if notification is practicable. That is a very important safeguard.</p>

<a name="81030-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08103032000419"></a>Amendments Nos. 14, 16, 17 and 66 require consent. There is a great risk of inertia in any system in obtaining consent, whether written or not. If consent were required, many young people or their families might simply forget or neglect to sign and send the necessary form. This is a particular risk for young people who have a wide range of needs and may have chaotic lifestyles. If a young person did not provide consent to his basic identification information being passed on, the local authority could not track the person or know when that person had dropped out of education or training. That local authority might not be able to provide that person with any support, let alone timely support that was tailored to their needs.</p>

<a name="81030-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08103032000420"></a>I would also like to clarify, and to reassure the House, that although these clauses create powers to provide information, this does not remove the responsibility to act in accordance with the Human Rights Act, the common law of confidence and the Data Protection Act. Although they do not specifically require consent, it could be required by other legislation and in legal principles, which present a series of safeguards determining whether disclosure is lawful or not.</p>

<a name="81030-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08103032000421"></a>A requirement to consent would add complexity to the system, placing considerable additional burdens on local authorities and other public bodies. It also has the potential to cause delay in getting important information to the local authority, which would in turn prevent it from tracking young people effectively and therefore from intervening to provide support that is timely and appropriate to their needs. I believe that Clauses 14, 15 and 16, as they stand, strike the right  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1755"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1755</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>balance&#151;and it is a balance&#151;between enabling the local authority to deliver its functions of promoting participation and identifying young people who are not participating with respecting young people&#146;s rights to prevent certain information being shared about them. These amendments on obtaining consent would do no more than obstruct the process that is already in place and functioning well.</p>

<a name="81030-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08103032000422"></a>Regarding Amendment No. 15, learning providers have had arrangements in place to notify parents about information disclosures to Connexions since 2000. It is normal practice to write to all parents of pupils approaching the age of 13, letting them know that information about their children will be shared with Connexions unless they request that it should not be. That position will continue.</p>

<a name="81030-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08103032000423"></a>On Amendment No. 19, the Data Protection Act means it is necessary to inform people when personal information about them is being shared, provided this is practical. It would be an unnecessary and inflexible burden to set in primary legislation such a specific time limit as set out in this amendment. I hope that, in the light of the reassurances with regard to the Data Protection Act, current practice and so on, the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment, given the safeguards.</p>

<a name="81030-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08103032000424"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, asked if we would think about Amendment No. 18, and we have done so. The question was whether we should add the border and immigration agency, now known as the UK Border Agency, to the list of public bodies under Clause 16. The list in Clauses 16 and 62 reproduces the list of Section 120 of the Learning and Skills Act. This was because we want Connexions to be able to access the same information under Clause 62 as it does under Section 120 of the Learning and Skills Act. We want it to have access to exactly the same kind of information as it does now. We have, however, worked with the Home Office to consider further the information-sharing powers available to the UK Border Agency, and it is clear that, through a common law power, they are already able to share information with local authorities. In addition, the new Immigration and Citizenship Bill will further support their role of promoting the well-being of young people. It is important to emphasise that this common law power already exists. Given the situation and the progress under way, I hope that noble Lords will accept that it would be inappropriate at this stage to add the UK Border Agency explicitly to Clause 16 as it could have unintended consequences for the common law provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08103032000425"></a>If I may quickly respond to the query of the noble Lord, Lord Elton, the information has to be in the possession of the school or college but must be relevant information in relation to the local authority&#146;s functions under the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08103032000437"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the amendments in this group were tabled in Committee and I have tabled them again today for slightly different reasons. Amendment No. 20 inserts a new clause on careers education. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, while supporting the amendment, suggested that it could sit better in a different part of the Bill. That may be so, but I am less concerned about that than with the meaning of the amendment. I would like the Secretary of State to conduct a review into how effective the provision of careers advice is in England and whether it would benefit from a single, all-age advice and guidance service.</p>

<a name="81030-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08103032000438"></a>I have read carefully the response of the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, in Committee. He said that he recognised that the reforms under way for 14 to 19 year-olds would present a challenge to information, advice and guidance providers and that the Government would need to focus on continuous improvements and bringing the performance of all providers up to the highest standards. Yet while he acknowledged that the system was imperfect, he concluded his remarks in a somewhat offhand way by saying that the Government had conducted significant reviews of Connexions in recent years and they did not believe that a review of itself was likely to be a lever to drive up standards. I am sorry that I am repeating the previous Minister&#146;s words to the current Minister, but I feel that the Government have understood my argument. I am not seeking a review for the sake of having a review&#151;that would be a waste of time, effort and money&#151;but I have said previously in this place that I do not believe that Connexions is up to scratch as a careers adviser. If, as the noble Lord said, the reforms affecting 14 to

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08103032000439"></a>As noble Lords will see from the wording of the amendment, I am not calling for a review of the system in a vacuum; I am calling specifically for it to be compared with systems in place in the other countries of the United Kingdom. I am well aware that devolution to the smaller UK countries means that different parts of the Kingdom may have different policies, but that should not exclude each country from looking at what the others are doing. If we spot a good idea in practice somewhere else, we would be foolish, to say the least, not to consider it. That is what will drive up standards, not the mechanisms of reviewing the system. Like all noble Lords, I want to see the best possible careers advice provision to help young people at all stages of their education to make the most appropriate decisions for their future. I hope that the Minister will give due consideration to this proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08103032000440"></a>I have brought the second amendment in this group back today because when I moved it in Committee, the Minister, who was not the Minister at that stage, was caught unawares and did not feel that she could address the matter fully. She promised to take the issue away and consider it. I trust that she has now been able to do so. The amendment makes a simple point. It allows young people to have direct contact with those who might be considered role models in their chosen career, training or education path.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08103032000441"></a>As I said before, I applaud the Government for including in Clause 61 the means to provide information electronically. The internet is a useful tool, and young people happily use it to inform themselves as well as for entertainment. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said in July in support of this amendment,</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000879"></a>&#147;face-to-face interviews are extremely important and we should make sure that we do not simply rely on the internet&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/7/08; col. 1515.]</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000705"></a>My amendment would make sure that as many options as possible are considered to help young people get a good feel for the decisions they must take on the direction they are going in. I hope that when the Minister was reflecting on this she saw that I intend this amendment to be helpful and to allow young people to arm themselves with as much useful information as they can before they embark on their future. I beg to move.</p>

I hope that that is so because it is important that young people in primary schools are given access to knowledge about careers and begin to think about what careers they might pursue at a later stage.

We cannot do away with careers advisers in schools; a specifically trained Connexions careers adviser is vital. There is no reason why teachers should not provide careers education, but they must be given training. If we are going to use general teachers, they should have specific CPD training on careers education. Many of them do not know about issues outside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08103032000445"></a>Amendment No. 67 is concerned with getting specific information about particular careers and talking to people who are pursuing them about what they involve. I mentioned last time, and I shall mention again, the website horsesmouth.co.uk. Another website called Vitae is being developed by the Cambridge-based Careers Research and Advisory Centre. It involves people who practise particular careers talking about what they do. In that sense, an internet exchange is quite useful. Horsesmouth.co.uk is interactive, so a young person can ask questions of the person who has pursued a career.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08103032000446"></a>Amendment No. 68, a little amendment in my name and the names of my noble friends Lady Walmsley and Lady Garden, seeks to put right what seems an anomaly. Sections 43 to 45 of the Education Act 1997 give the Secretary of State the right to extend by regulation the scope of careers education and guidance. The Secretary of State has used the powers in Section 45B to extend the scope of careers education to primary schools and lower year groups in secondary schools, but it does not apply to those aged 16 and over&#151;precisely the 16 and 17 year-olds whom this legislation catches.</p>

<a name="81030-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08103032000447"></a>It is an anomaly. In responding to an amendment that I tabled in Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said that it did not matter as those young people get it anyhow. If I may say so, that was not a good enough response. If there is a duty on schools to provide careers education and information, advice and guidance on careers, it is appropriate that the duty should include those aged 16 or 17. Our simple little amendment provides that the Minister may by regulations extend that provision&#151;it is only by regulation that the Minister has to operate&#151;and makes good that anomaly.</p>

They reminded me of a programme broadcast 10 years ago, where a black man in America, who had run a programme for young black boys in schools, had recruited professional black men to go into schools to help boys with their reading. After a period of months, it culminated in those men taking the boys to their place of work and showing them around. If that is what the noble Baroness is driving at here, then it is very welcome. People with professional experience coming from outside to talk to young people would give them the benefit of that experience.</p>

<a name="81030-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08103032000449"></a>That prompts me to ask the Minister about Criminal Records Bureau checks, because, while children are concerned that people working with them have those checks, they can be an obstacle for people working outside to coming in and engaging with young people. Particularly, it appears that there is often quite a long delay in processing those checks. Perhaps the Minister might write me a little note on what is being done to speed up Criminal Records Bureau checks and ensuring that they are not repeated too often. That would get the balance right between ensuring that someone is safe and avoiding too much bureaucracy.</p>

I do so because I tabled an amendment in Committee on non-stereotypical careers advice and work placements and I was so reassured by the Minister&#146;s answer that I did not put down any amendments for Report. However, I have since had some correspondence from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which was very disappointed to learn that,</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000880"></a>&#147;the &#145;Work-related training guide&#146; produced by DCSF&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000706"></a>for employers, schools and colleges does not, in fact, mention that issue once. Of course, that has rather upset the commission. It believes, not unnaturally, that this must be addressed because the current work placement model is deficient. Obviously it can operate in a number of ways. Those who are well connected find their own placements, usually of good quality; some people will choose from lists because lists can be presented to them; and the third group will be allocated to placements. That means that some people are still being stereotyped in the decisions made for them. As we all know, they will be those who have less information, who are more likely to be at the bottom of the pile and who have less access to those who can advise them more carefully. The commission found, for example, that only 15 per cent of girls and boys received any advice on non-traditional placements.</p>

<a name="81030-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08103032000451"></a>I ask the Minister to again look at this area to see whether an outline of how schools and employers can tackle stereotyping in work placements can be produced. A statement of information and guidance should not be limited because of assumptions about gender, race, disability and so on. Education-business partnerships could perhaps be developed, with careers advisers being more proactive in supporting and/or finding non-traditional placements.</p>

I support the content of the debate about the importance of careers education and guidance and I should like to make a few brief points.</p>

<a name="81030-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08103032000454"></a>As we move more towards a personalised curriculum and give people more choice, the more important careers education and guidance becomes. However, there is a danger in concentrating too much on the provision of information. It is absolutely crucial that the provision of information is accurate, timely and of high quality, but that by itself will not produce a good guidance system which is supportive of people in making appropriate decisions at appropriate times. That is far more complex and difficult to legislate for. Will the Minister assure the House that her department is considering how young people make decisions and what support they need?</p>

<a name="81030-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08103032000455"></a>In the north-east there is a 14 to 19 commission which includes all the partners at regional, school, FE and employer levels. They are coming together to try to make the 14 to 19 agenda work. I have the privilege of chairing the commission at the moment. We have set up a youth board so that young people can advise us on what they think. Interestingly, they put proper careers education and guidance at the top of their agenda. They did so because they felt it was the part of the system that was not working. This part of the legislation covering careers education and guidance is for young people and this is a time when we particularly need to hear their views and their voice. Perhaps my noble friend will also reassure us that there is provision for the department to listen to young people about how they think careers education and guidance can be best provided to them and at what point in their lives.</p>

I start by responding to Amendment No. 67 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Verma. She is right: it is the amendment that came up when I was surprised to be sitting in the hot seat. I am delighted that the noble Baroness has tabled the amendment for debate again today so that I can respond. She explained very eloquently the need for young people to have access to the widest possible arsenal of tools to help them in making their decisions about future career options.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08103032000457"></a>The national service, Connexions Direct, offers information, advice and support to young people in England. It has been extremely successful. The service provides profiles of more than 800 jobs through its jobs4u careers database, which is an important resource. This does not detract from other resources, such as horsesmouth.co.uk. The jobs4u careers database includes  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1761"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1761</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>case studies of personal experiences in specific roles, and the profiles are frequently updated. If a young person cannot find information on the specific role that they want, Connexions Direct will provide more information for them via the website, and find an appropriate case study. It is about giving young people access through the internet to real-life examples of careers. The provisions that the amendment would make are already available, and it is our intention that the service should continue to offer advice and information of this kind, and to make sure that we are connected to the services that other providers make available to young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08103032000458"></a>Amendment No. 20, which would require the Secretary of State to commission an independent review, is not necessary. Noble Lords will be aware that there have been reviews on this subject, as the noble Baroness highlighted. They have been undertaken in recent years. That is not to say that further consideration of this vital subject is not important, but the end-to-end review of careers education and guidance, which reported in July 2005, and the Leitch review of skills, completed in December 2006, also addressed the issues of careers services for adults.</p>

<a name="81030-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08103032000459"></a>We have listened carefully to the arguments for an all-age careers service and we do not disagree with them per se. We see that there is a need for a joined-up service that meets the needs of people at all ages. Teenagers face different challenges from adults, not least learning choices and the personal issues associated with the transition to adulthood. The Connexions service, working in partnership with schools and colleges, is best placed to meet these needs. Clause 56 will transfer, as noble Lords know, the delivery of the Connexions service to local authorities. This will help local authorities to embed Connexions within integrated youth support arrangements to improve support for the most vulnerable people, which must be key.</p>

<a name="81030-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08103032000460"></a>The Government have accepted the recommendation of the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, to establish a universal adult careers service, which will be operational from 2010-11. The key elements of this service are described in the Adult Advancement and Careers Service prospectus, which was launched yesterday, I believe. We will ensure that links are made between the adult and young people&#146;s careers services; for example, through case conferences between adult advisers and Connexions advisers. We are talking about an all-ages strategy, which is very important.</p>

<a name="81030-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08103032000461"></a>Amendment No. 68 would extend the requirement for schools to provide careers education to include learners aged 16 to 18. Section 46 of the 1997 Act, which is the focus of this amendment, already allows regulations to be made to extend the age for careers education in schools and requires further education institutions to provide a programme of careers education. Therefore, new primary legislation would not be required to extend these duties to pupils above the age of 16.</p>

<a name="81030-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08103032000462"></a>I do not believe that this amendment is necessary, but I believe that the subject is extremely important. High-quality, impartial information, advice and guidance help young people to make choices that position them for success in life. As my noble friend highlighted, and

I hope that I will be able to convince the noble Baroness that we have a strong enough commitment. We see this as very important. It will become more important as our 14 to 19 reforms offer young people a wider choice of learning and increasing numbers stay on in education and training. Diplomas are delivered by partnerships of schools, further education colleges and other learning providers. To begin delivering diplomas, each consortium must demonstrate that it offers high-quality information, advice and guidance to young people. This is a key part of our strategy.</p>

<a name="81030-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08103032000465"></a>My department is offering support to all consortia to ensure that the guidance they offer meets our national quality standards. Those standards, which were debated recently, focus on independent high-quality advice for young people. We are also working with the National College for School Leadership and the Learning and Skills Improvement Service to raise the profile of careers advice and to help school and FE leaders improve the quality of their provision.</p>

<a name="81030-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08103032000466"></a>This is a challenging agenda, but we can also take time to celebrate success. The recent Ofsted review of 14 to 19 implementation found that the quality of information, advice and guidance was good or better in 12 of the 16 partnerships visited and at least satisfactory in three others. That is encouraging, but we need to continue to improve information, advice and guidance services.</p>

<a name="81030-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08103032000467"></a>These reforms are important and I hope that they will be welcomed.

The Government agree that it is extremely important that fair procedures are followed. My noble friend undertook in his reply to the letter to consider whether there was a need to strengthen the provisions in the Bill to make it clear that employers will be able to challenge a decision by a local authority to take enforcement action and that there is a satisfactory appeal route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08103032000475"></a>We have considered this matter carefully and are today proposing amendments that provide for employers to object to a fixed-penalty notice in the first instance and to appeal against such a notice to the first-tier tribunal in the second instance. As we have discussed previously, the enforcement powers that local authorities have in relation to employers will be used only as a very last resort and will always be preceded by informal engagement with employers to ensure that they understand their duties and are given the chance to put right the situation voluntarily. We will develop clear guidance in conjunction with employer organisations during the next five years to ensure that employers fully understand what is expected and do not risk facing enforcement action. However, should the enforcement provisions need to be used, it is important, as I hope that noble Lords will agree, to make it clear that employers have the rights of objection and appeal that I set out. I therefore hope that noble Lords will support the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

There is a recurring theme throughout this debate: the balance between persuasion and coercion. For the measures in the Bill to succeed, employers must be fully engaged with colleges, schools and other learning providers. Their active involvement is fundamentally important. It is far preferable that they be willing participants and convinced of tangible benefits both for the young people concerned and for their business.</p>

<a name="81030-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08103032000478"></a>We recognise that if young people are entitled to receive appropriate training in their employment, it will impose duties and responsibilities on employers. But it should be as a very last resort that enforcement is required. I welcome the Minister&#146;s assurances on that score.</p>

<a name="81030-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08103032000479"></a>We are pleased that provisions have been introduced to clarify what employers can expect if they do not meet requirements and that the Government have responded so positively to concern expressed by the Committee on the Constitution that employers should have opportunities to set out their objections to a penalty notice. We also welcome the assurances that any reduction in penalty would be repaid with interest.</p>

<a name="81030-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08103032000480"></a>In the debate on 3 July, noble Lords asked questions to which the answers remain unclear. How are Clauses 22 and 23 going to work? How will a local authority find out if employers do not allow access to education and training when they should? The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, stated that information could be obtained through the Connexions service, through engagement with young people and through contact with employers, where it may transpire that young people are not participating in education or training. But it may not be a simple task to obtain sufficient reliable information to prove contravention. This could be time consuming and tie up resources that the authority may feel would be better spent elsewhere. Even if a local authority has obtained convincing evidence, it could have reservations about enforcing penalties. We had assurances from the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, that the word &#147;may&#148; in Clause 22 meant that the local authority had discretion over whether to require the employer to pay a financial penalty.</p>

<a name="81030-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08103032000481"></a>Enforcement is going to take resources of time and finances and, as the CBI and others have advised, risks deterring employers from taking on young people. It would not help the aims of the Bill if the penalties alienate small businesses, where the majority of young people find employment. Since this was debated in Committee, the economic climate has not made it any easier for employers large or small to give high priority to training programmes and a light touch on enforcement is even more desirable than before. Recently, the Government have been particularly encouraging of the public sector to increase its work placements. I wonder how enforcements will be managed within the public sector and what safeguards there are that public sector resources will not be diverted to cover appeals and penalties.</p>

However, my main point is that in the Bill the whole emphasis on enforcement is to create a power not a duty.

I hope very much that I can answer all the noble Baroness&#146;s questions in detail and copy that answer to the rest of the interested Peers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08103032000507"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the Government have rightly put a great emphasis in all their public sector programmes on measuring outcomes and ensuring that things that are put in actually produce results at the end. This amendment is an attempt in small part to ensure that the effectiveness of the legislation is measured carefully and reported on widely.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08103032000508"></a>I am grateful to the Confederation of British Industry, which sent a very helpful briefing on this subject. It emphasised that reporting of this kind would increase business confidence, which it feels is not at the moment entirely with the provisions of the Bill. Furthermore, the impact of the current economic crisis on the employment prospects of young people is a terribly important outcome from the provisions of the Bill, and whether the provisions work should be carefully monitored and reported. That is why I am asking in the amendment for an annual report to Parliament.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08103032000509"></a>There are three categories of report, but they are not at all comprehensive; there should be other areas as well. We have talked a great deal under previous amendments about careers advice to young people. It is relevant here to quote the CBI&#146;s employment trends survey this year. It highlighted the fact that 52 per cent of employers said that they were dissatisfied with school leavers&#146; knowledge about their chosen careers.  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1770"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1770</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>In other words, some very shaky careers advice had been given to those young people when they made their choices, because employers felt that the choices were inappropriate. It is vitally important that the effectiveness of the new arrangements that are put in place for 16 to 18 year-olds should be monitored and the genuine outcome from these new arrangements reported.</p>
<a name="time_25"></a>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08103032000510"></a>Secondly, we have not talked enough about the duties being imposed on employers, which are very new. They feel a great deal of discomfort about them. The CBI says that its members are unenthusiastic about some of the provisions in the Bill. They dislike not only the idea of requirements on them to provide time off for young people to attend training courses equivalent to one day a week but that it involves police participation, checking that the young person has arranged a suitable course, and that there are enforcement notices, financial penalties and so forth. They are unhappy. They are asking for good advice and support to reassure them that they will not face financial penalties if they have acted in good faith, and that they will have good advice and help in identifying and accessing high-quality and relevant training and provision for their young employees. Above all, they would like reassurance that they can continue to employ these young people. Otherwise we will find that many employers will not want to employ them. They will say that it is too much trouble because they run the risk of incurring penalties which they do not want and that they do not have time to check on programmes themselves and so forth. The effectiveness of the advice and support given to employers to enable them to fulfil their duties is something that Parliament should be told about and should be carefully monitored by the department.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08103032000511"></a>Thirdly, there is a real risk that as we impose on young people the duty to undertake education and training in their latter years&#151;16, 17 and 18 year-olds&#151;the quality of the learning programmes available to them will not be of the highest quality. It will still not reflect the real needs of employers. The CBI again points out that employers spend &#163;39 billion a year on staff development. But the CBI-Edexcel education and skills survey this year highlighted that only a third of employer training leads to a recognised qualification. Therefore, the requirement that the young person must follow only government-specified training may discourage employers from taking on a young person.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08103032000512"></a>The CBI emphasised that it supports the progress that the Government have made on qualification reform, but asked the Government to maintain their momentum in accrediting employers&#146; own in-house training and ensuring that it is easier for employers to award their own recognised qualifications. An annual progress report on the quality of the learning programmes and the relevance of these programmes to the needs of the young people themselves and their employers would be an important thing. I know that the Minister has been telling us that there is a good reason why none of the amendments that have been moved today can possibly be taken on board, but I hope that she will give a more favourable response to this one. I beg to move.</p>

The amendment covers three areas.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08103032000514"></a>On the issue of practical support for firms, we pointed out in Committee that if conditions on firms are too onerous they will simply avoid employing the very people that this Bill is designed to help. Small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned that the additional costs incurred by implementing the provisions in the Bill will be considerable when set against their profit margins, especially now as we head into recession. If the Government are determined to press ahead, red tape and costs must be kept to a minimum, or the consequence will be a reluctance to employ young people.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08103032000515"></a>We said in Committee that qualifications must have relevance to what the young person is trying to do. There must be a good provision of qualifications, so that he or she is not unable to follow his or her chosen path because there is only a limited number of courses open to them. Employers are more likely to find young people employable if they trust the standard of the qualification and see that is has accorded the young person some relevance to their business. These matters are crucial to the success of the Bill. My noble friend Lady Perry is right that progress on them must be reported annually to Parliament.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83"></a><a name="08103032000796"></a> Clause 38, page 21, line 5, leave out from &#147;(c. 56)&#148; to the end of line 6</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08103032000524"></a>Amendment No. 45 raises the issue of who is a parent, and what happens when the so-called parent of a young person, who flouts his duties under Clause 2 of the Bill, is a local authority. Clause 38(4), which comes at the end of the chapter dealing with parenting contracts and orders, defines a parent using the formulation given in Section 576 of the Education Act 1996. This excludes a person who is not an individual. The ordinary person might wonder what sort of person is not an individual. To the legal mind, the answer is obvious: institutions are sometimes defined as persons, but are not individuals. In this instance, the person who is not an individual is presumably the corporate parent; and specifically, the local authority in the guise of the corporate parent. The question therefore arises, what happens when the young person who fails to attend education or training is in local authority care? Since the local authority is responsible for monitoring what the young person is doing, and for remonstrating with the parents, who is responsible for remonstrating with the local authority? What procedures are there for making sure that the local authority fulfils its role as a responsible corporate parent? I hope that the Minister can give me a response.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08103032000525"></a>The second amendment, Amendment No. 212, is about a different issue; schools forums. As the House knows, schools forums are a relatively recent innovation, introduced in the Education Act 2005. We set up procedures for the passporting of moneys for schools directly to schools&#146; budgets, giving local authorities no discretion on the size of the budgets. However, the allocation between schools, although formula based, leaves a little discretion to local decision making. This was put into the hands not of local politicians, through the local education authority, but of the newly created schools forums, to be composed of representatives of school head teachers and governors.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08103032000526"></a>The guidance on schools forums issued by the department is explicit. Paragraph 1.18 of the good practice guide states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000881"></a>&#147;it is good practice for Schools Forums to aim for a membership structure based on an equal proportion of head teachers and governors, though this is not always possible for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless it is vital that even where equal numbers of head teachers and governors cannot be achieved there is sufficient representation of each type of schools member in each group to ensure debate within the forum is balanced and representative&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000707"></a>It is clear that this is not happening in many parts of the country. The National Governors&#146; Association has had many complaints about this from its members. Indeed, its research has revealed that, while some authorities have equal numbers, many do not. Norfolk, for example, has a schools forum of 22, with 14 heads and, at present, only five governors. Nottinghamshire has nominally 32 members, but currently 16 heads and   


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1773"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1773</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>eight governors. West Sussex has nominally 28, with 18 heads and eight governors. Birmingham has nominally 22 members, with 17 heads and four governors.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="08103032000527"></a>There are, of course, other authorities&#151;Oxfordshire, Durham, East Sussex and Essex&#151;where there is parity in numbers. However, there are enough examples of where there is no parity, and where local authorities seem to be doing little to achieve it. Rather, they retreat behind the excuse that they cannot find governors to fill the slots. I have received a comment from the chair of the National Governors&#146; Association in response to that criticism:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_84"></a><a name="08103032000797"></a>&#147;I would add that we receive comments periodically from our members about the lack of governor representation on schools forums, but have never had any suggestion from them that there are difficulties in recruiting members for this very important purpose. Most governors recognise how vital the schools forum is and want to ensure that the governor voice is present and are concerned to have parity with the heads&#146; representatives&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="81030-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08103032000528"></a>Amendment No. 212 takes advantage of the fact that Clause 148 deals with the constitution of schools forums and seeks to tighten up the wording in relation to membership. Whereas new subsection (4A) states that the forums shall include membership representing schools&#146; bodies and head teachers, the amendment would ensure that, as the good practice guide suggests, there should be equal membership from both parties. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="08103032000529"></a><a name="81030-0014.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="81030-0014.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08103032001094"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I again declare my involvement as president of the National Governors&#146; Association. I support everything that was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. Now that the NGA and the head teachers&#146; association have got together on their respective responsibilities, it seems not only fair but sensible that there should be equal numbers represented on school forums, which have quite considerable power. I cannot think of a more sensible way of going about that than through a probing amendment such as this.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08103032000530"></a>There is also a slightly dubious situation when excess money sometimes comes back into the local authority. What is that to be spent on or recycled into? If an equal number of governors and head teachers cannot guide the local authority on particular needs, perhaps spending decisions might not be seen as entirely fair from an outsider&#146;s viewpoint. Sometimes a school has unspent money in excess of some 5 per cent of its annual budget, which is not an insignificant amount.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="08103032000531"></a>Then there is the issue of the status of &#147;parent&#148;. I very much hope that my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham might provide some guidance on the situation that has been discussed of the status of &#147;parent&#148; in relation to people in prison. Various things happen, whereby the state may not be as good a parent as it should have been when looking after the health of the prisoners in its care. That is not a dissimilar situation to that of children in care. We know that a child in care is 10 times more likely to be excluded from school and that three out of every four children in care will leave school with no qualifications, compared to 6 per cent among the general population.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="08103032000532"></a>I stress these issues because they need to be looked at in more detail. It would be extremely useful to receive some guidance from the Minister.</p>

We were concerned that the social care worker responsible for the young person when they went into custody remained with the young person throughout the period of custody and acted in loco parentis. The question of how those responsibilities will be exercised for those in custody relates to the whole concept of this Bill, as has been mentioned on a number of occasions. Therefore, I hope very much that when the Minister takes what has been said into account, she does not forget this important group of people, not least because they will come out of custody and back into the community. It is essential that they are picked up from that moment and receive the support outlined in the Bill.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="08103032000536"></a>There are separate means of enforcing the important responsibilities of local authorities, which have their own duties to promote participation for all young people, including children and young people in care. The Secretary of State has the power to give a direction to a local authority under Section 496 or 497 of the Education Act 1996 if they are failing in that duty, and that is the duty that we will be relying on when we are talking about the role of corporate parents. Looked-after children, including children in care, will be able to stay in their care placement until they are 18 if they want to. This is something important to have come out of the Children and Young Persons Act. We are flipping over the normal assumption. We will be encouraging children and young people to stay in care until the age of 18, and there has to be a very good reason for them to think about leaving. They will receive focused support to stay in learning and succeed. We will ensure that young people in care and leaving care receive information, advice and guidance tailored to their needs, particularly through the very important targeted youth support arrangements being introduced, and that their social worker or young persons adviser, as their lead professional, has access to information about the choices available to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="08103032000537"></a>On Amendment No. 212, local authorities currently decide the composition of their schools forum, and in the vast majority of areas this happens in consultation with the forum members and includes both head teachers and governors. Current regulations, as we have heard, state that school members must be elected by members of the relevant group, and local authorities with strong associations will certainly find this easier to facilitate than those without. This amendment will not change

Officials monitor the workings of schools forums on a regular basis and can look again at the national picture of composition and the effectiveness of forums. If there proves to be a case for making stronger regulation for the proportion of governors to head teachers, the power already exists for this to happen through secondary legislation, but I assure noble Lords that we are looking at this situation.</p>

In relation to looked-after children, it is a case of &#147;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&#148;. What do you do with the local authority if a child is in care but nevertheless is flouting the regulations? The Minister makes clear that it is the responsibility of the child&#146;s social worker and that ultimately, if the local authority does not seem to be performing its duties, the Secretary of State has to step in and remonstrate with it. It is the Secretary of State who is responsible for making sure that the local authority performs its functions as the corporate parent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="08103032000540"></a>I am glad that we have clarification on this.

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="08103032000541"></a>I am a little disappointed by what the Minister said on Amendment No. 212. Here, there is explicit legislation concerned with the constitution of schools forums, and, if I may say so, it would be so simple just to introduce the amendment that I am suggesting rather than try to achieve the same thing later through regulations. The Minister tells me that we do not need such a provision in the Bill as it can be achieved through secondary legislation, but, as she can see from the figures that I quoted, many authorities are falling down on their responsibilities. What parity of representation is there here? As I said, a very small amendment to the legislation would do the trick.</p>

<a name="81030-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="08103032000542"></a>We will think about these things and consult further, but we may conceivably see the issue come back at Third Reading.

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="08103032000551"></a>In Committee, we raised fears of criminalising young people for failing to participate in education or training at the ages of 17 and 18, especially as some of them may be working but without their efforts being recognised by the Government because of the number of hours worked or because the training is not accredited. That any young person might receive a criminal record because of provisions that we pass in this Education and Skills Bill really should give pause for thought. Many organisations that work with young people share our concern.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="08103032000552"></a>At Second Reading and again in Committee, we persistently questioned the Government about the possibility that a young person who would not participate or pay their fines might, once they had reached the age of 18, be liable to a prison sentence. Despite his initial reassurances that that was not the case, the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, had to admit that it was a possibility, so we are grateful that the government amendments in this group will not allow that to happen.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="08103032000553"></a>However, we are still left with the likelihood that some young people will be criminalised by the Bill and we are unwavering in our view that this is wrong. If the Government insist on compulsion and the necessary sanctions they will need to impose this, the young people in question should be dealt with by the civil courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="08103032000554"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said that the Government had concluded that a civil endorsement system would not work in practice. He argued that civil penalties would be enforced in the civil courts, which are not geared up to deal with young people in the way that youth courts are. He said that judges who sit in the youth courts receive specialist training on dealing with young people and that the court is not open to the general public. I have to say that those comments have been met with incredulity by the judges to whom I have spoken. The civil courts

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="08103032000555"></a>One area in particular where the courts deal regularly with young people is when they issue ASBIs&#151;their take on the ASBO. These are injunctions that a landlord can bring against anti-social behaviour, and quite often they are taken out against young people. The courts have the powers to appoint a litigation friend for a young person under the age of 18 and also to sit in private.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_87"></a><a name="08103032000800"></a>&#147;While debts may be enforced using civil recovery methods&#151;for example, recovery by bailiffs&#151;in practice such methods are rarely used against young people under 18&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000708"></a>That is true. The courts can use other final sanctions, such as attachment of earnings or benefits, which are sensitively means calculated and which must not tip a young person into poverty. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_88"></a><a name="08103032000801"></a>&#147;In addition, the local authority would have to pay a court fee to pursue a civil enforcement method which, again, might not be appropriate in practice and would lead to mounting costs.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>3/7/08; col. 469.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="08103032000557"></a>We are constantly being told that this sanction will apply to only a handful of people. If the Government are right, the costs cannot be that great. But the risk of incurring these costs may act as another incentive on the local authority to do all in its power to engage the young person in training rather than launch proceedings against them. I cannot tell your Lordships how strongly we on these Benches feel about this. I beg to move.</p>

The fact that I hope to speak only briefly does not at all reflect how passionately I feel that the Government are on a totally wrong course in criminalising any young person who remains outside education and training. I feel deep despair that all the work done to make education attractive and positive for young people, to turn it into something that offers pleasure, joy and satisfaction, could so easily be damaged by the sharp alternative, which will be seen as, &#147;Either you stay in education or training, whether you want to or not, or you may end up going to prison and having a criminal record&#148;.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="08103032000559"></a>I cannot believe that the Government are going down that route. People of all political views and occupations find it impossible to believe. They say, &#147;Surely this cannot be right&#148;. They say that they heard the item on the radio about raising the school leaving age and thought it a splendid idea, but nobody mentioned that the alternative to someone staying on in training or education was to turn them into a criminal. If the Government change nothing else, I beg them to reconsider this extraordinary provision. To my knowledge, we would be the only country in the civilised world with such a provision.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="08103032000560"></a>There is absolutely no evidence that compulsion of any kind makes a difference. Six out of the top seven countries on the OECD table showing the percentage of young people staying on in education and training  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1778"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1778</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have no compulsion at all. Not only is there no criminal element to compulsion; there is no compulsion whatever. They have a culture that makes education desirable and where it is clearly relevant to the needs of the adult population and the young people as they become adults. We need to try to foster that culture in the United Kingdom. We are not doing so at the moment. We are very low on the international league table on the numbers of young people staying on. Not only making the provision compulsory but having a criminal offence as the alternative could make our culture worse. It could make education even less attractive and less important in this country.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="08103032000561"></a>I beg the noble Baroness to think for a moment of the success that her Government&#146;s policies have already demonstrated in providing what I called in Committee the carrots: the educational maintenance grant, the new curriculum, and so on, which I support and of which I wholly approve. They have begun to turn the statistics round and more young people are staying on. Why spoil it now by making this horrendous sanction? Even if the Minister says that it will be in extreme cases only and will probably never happen or will be a last resort, nevertheless the message is there, which is crucial to young people. The message it conveys is that education is something that you have to do or you will be criminalised. I beg the Minister to please think again before she and the Government go down that route.</p>

It is quite clear from the meeting we had yesterday afternoon with Jim Knight MP, the Minister in another place, that the Government accept that there will be a criminal offence in some cases. He told us that he thinks this is right if young people decide that, despite all the help they are given and despite all the barriers being taken away, they will not comply with the law the Government wish to introduce.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="08103032000563"></a>We do not agree with that. We think it is wrong to criminalise young people. There is no doubt that this offence will be revealed in CRB checks&#151;soon to be ISA checks&#151;and that young people will be obliged to disclose it under certain circumstances when making job applications. It is quite wrong: a criminal offence should be something that is anti-social and that hurts other people. The Government would say that this hurts only the young people themselves. In a free country, people should be free to hurt themselves if they really must. We would rather they did not, but in a liberal democracy they should be free to do that, as long as it does not hurt anybody else. If young people conscientiously believe that now is the wrong moment for them to pursue their education, they should have the freedom to do that as long as they have an entitlement to go back to education later on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="08103032000564"></a>The Minister, Jim Knight, told us yesterday that, at the end of all these procedures, young people could be accused of contempt of court if all attempts to persuade

That is a criminal offence. It is clear, therefore, that the Government are proposing to criminalise young people on a matter about which they are not hurting anybody but themselves.

The focus of the policy is firmly on ensuring there is an appropriate and engaging learning opportunity for all young people and with the right support for them to stay in learning and succeed so that all who want to participate can do so. Successful implementation will depend on achieving this. If a young person is not participating, the emphasis will always be on help and support to address problems and re-engage the young person in learning long before any enforcement action is even considered. Looking specifically at Amendments Nos. 50, 52, 55 and 57, the presence of sanctions is necessary to make a reality of the new requirement to participate. If the new requirement is to be a serious one and to have the impact that we want in practice, we need to be clear that it is possible to enforce it as a last resort if absolutely necessary.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="08103032000568"></a>Similarly, local authorities are used to holding in reserve a range of powers which they rarely, if ever, use, but which help to make a reality of requirements that they are responsible for implementing. As the representative of the Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services said in evidence sessions held in another place,</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000882"></a>&#147;as a director of children&#146;s services, I have a range of powers that I never use. However, if I did not have them, I would have different conversations with a range of people ... without them, my leverage on the activity would be much reduced&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000709"></a>Numerous safeguards are built into the system to ensure that a young person does not face enforcement action unexpectedly and inappropriately. There must be no reasonable excuse for their non-participation, and they must have been given appropriate support to participate. They must be given 15 days&#146; notice of the authority&#146;s intention to begin the first stage of the enforcement process, as noble Lords are aware. There is a route of appeal to an independent panel at every stage and if at any point in the enforcement process the young person returns to learning, formal action will stop.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1780"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1780</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81030-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="08103032000569"></a>So a young person will be given an attendance notice only after all other attempts to engage them have failed, and there are a number of checks and balances to ensure that they are used only appropriately. However, in introducing the process of attendance notices, we need to be clear what will happen if they are not complied with; otherwise they will be ineffective.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="08103032000570"></a>It is this set of clauses that clearly lays out the consequences of failing to comply with an attendance notice. As I think everyone in the House accepts, it will be extremely rare for a young person actually to reach this stage in practice, but it is absolutely necessary to make the rest of the system work. For this reason, these clauses must stand part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="08103032000571"></a>I will now speak to Amendments Nos. 47, 48 and 49, which seek to classify as a civil offence the offence of breaching an attendance notice. I appreciate the strength of feeling opposite. We have previously considered this option in some detail and concluded that it would not be in the interests of the young person or the local authority for the offence to be a civil offence, with a civil enforcement system. As the noble Baroness has said, civil penalties are enforced in the county courts, which are not set up to deal with young people in the way that youth courts are. I know that she takes issue with this, but, importantly, for example, judges in youth courts receive specialist training. We see it as important that as a matter of course youth courts are closed to the general public.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="08103032000572"></a>I hear what the noble Baroness is saying and I am very interested in her views and in what she has brought to the discussion. However, a civil enforcement system for those under 18 could lead to greater financial costs to them. In a county court, the amount of debt for which a person is liable can increase as interest, court costs and recovery costs are added. In addition, the local authority could face mounting costs of pursuing the action.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="08103032000573"></a>But that, for me, is not the issue. Let me also remind noble Lords that the criminal sanction comes only at the very end of the enforcement process. Civil sanctions alone do not present a realistic means of enforcing an attendance notice. I appreciate the noble Baroness&#146;s strength of feeling, but I hope that she will withdraw her amendment today.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="08103032000574"></a>On the government amendments, during Committee important points were raised in relation to the enforcement system for young people who fail to participate in education or training, and we did listen. That is why we have taken the incredibly unusual steps that we have. On 17 July in Committee, detailed questions were raised about the fine enforcement process for adults, as opposed to the youth courts system, and my noble friend Lord Adonis committed to come back on them. It was agreed that there was a need for amendments to ensure that a young person could not enter into custody as a result of defaulting, after the age of 18, on a fine imposed on him for failing to participate in education or training. As noble Lords are aware, it is the clear position of this Government that no person should enter custody as a result of committing the offence of failing to comply with an attendance notice without reasonable excuse. I appreciate the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, but if someone

In relation to those aged under 18, we are satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure that that will not happen, and custody is not an option available to the youth courts for default of payment of a fine.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="08103032000575"></a>However, my department has been working with the Ministry of Justice to consider this matter.  While we do not believe it is realistic in practice that a court would impose a custodial sentence for non-payment of a level 1 fine on someone aged over 18, we would like to remove the possibility to achieve greater certainty on this point, about which the House was so concerned.  It is particularly important for all those affected by this legislation that we are absolutely clear about this. The government amendment achieves greater certainty by transferring from the magistrates&#146; court to the county court the enforcement of a fine imposed for this offence only once the individual turns 18.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="08103032000576"></a>Similar provisions already exist under Section 87 of the Magistrates&#146; Courts Act to enable the magistrates&#146; court to transfer enforcement of a fine to the county court. However, in the case of this fine, if the court felt that it was appropriate to continue with enforcement action, it would be required to do so once the young person had reached 18. These provisions do not alter fine enforcement in general. They apply only in the specific case of a fine imposed for the offence in Clause 45 of failing to comply with an attendance notice without a reasonable excuse.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="08103032000577"></a>I hope that noble Lords will welcome these reassurances and that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment and support the government amendment.</p>

I did not once say that local authorities should not have within their armoury sanctions or powers to use against people who fail to undertake education or training.

I was speaking to a group of civil judges at the weekend, and they deal with young people every day on a range of issues. I should like to speak to the Minister between now and Third Reading because I do not understand the Government&#146;s thinking on this. One does not have to be a mathematical genius to work out that the combined forces of the Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Cross Benches mean that we could hold the Bill up for a while on this point. Nobody really wishes to do that because we have got to get it on to the statute book as there is a lot of work to be done. We are not saying that there should not be a sanction. We are simply saying that we do not want to take part in any legislation that criminalises a young person simply because, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, he has chosen, without hurting anybody else, not to participate for whatever reason. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="08103032000585"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am grateful to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee for its careful scrutiny of the Bill and for its report and recommendations. I tabled these amendments last week to give effect to those recommendations, as my noble friend Lord Adonis committed to do in his letter to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, on 14 July.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="08103032000586"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 53 and 54 ensure that the maximum amount that can be set in regulations for the financial penalty given to a young person could never exceed the maximum fine that a young person could receive in the court in the final stage of the enforcement system, as recommended by the committee. The maximum sentence that a young person could receive in the youth court is set at a level 1 fine, which is currently a maximum of &#163;200, although the exact amount is determined in each case by the court depending on the individual&#146;s means and circumstances. Of course, in practice, we have already said that the financial penalty for young people would be significantly less.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="08103032000587"></a>Further government amendments in this group ensure that any regulations made setting the financial penalty that a local authority can give to an employer who has failed to comply with their duties would be subject to affirmative procedure, except where those regulations reduce the penalty. The committee in fact recommended that the affirmative procedure would only be needed for the first use of the regulation-making power and for any subsequent regulations that raised the penalty by more than inflation. However, it has proved difficult to link the provisions to inflation in this way and we have therefore gone beyond the committee&#146;s recommendation and propose the affirmative procedure for every use of these regulations, except where they reduce the amount.</p>

<a name="81030-0015.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="08103032000588"></a>I hope that, on that basis, noble Lords will feel able to consider these amendments, and I beg to move.</p>

The issue of fines has been a sore one, and not simply because noble Lords have sought to make life difficult for the Government; it is because we have heard from groups outside the House&#151;such as the Z2K Trust, which puts in long and thankless hours trying to help young people who find themselves in difficulty&#151;that have been utterly dismayed at the prospect of fines being imposed. It would be quite ruinous to start slapping large fines on the very people who need help the most&#151;teenagers who have few

I think that she has been briefed about these. Barnardo&#146;s welcomes the Government&#146;s amendment to impose an upper limit on the fines that can be imposed, but seeks assurances on a number of issues.</p>

<a name="81030-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="08103032000591"></a>First, any penalty should be set at a level that reflects the financial support available to the poorest young people. Can the Minister reassure us on that? Secondly, could we be assured that young people would be able to make payment of any penalties in instalments, and would not be financially penalised for doing so? That should really be an option at the first issue of the penalty; the young person should not have to come back later to make an extra appeal to be able to pay by instalments.</p>

<a name="81030-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="08103032000592"></a>We also need assurance, thirdly, that the amount payable will not escalate like a congestion charge penalty if the notice is not paid within a certain period&#151;especially where there is evidence of financial hardship. Fourthly, will the department work closely with voluntary organisations like Barnardo&#146;s to review financial support for 16 to 18 year-olds and in developing financial incentives to encourage participation? The EMA is helpful for a number of young people, but a lot of organisations hope that the Government will be able to go somewhat further than that.</p>

In considering and consulting with others about the appropriate penalty, we will take into account the wider context of the income available to young people at the time, including through financial support. On instalments, we have said that that should be possible and that we will use our regulation powers to provide for it. As I understand it, it is not possible for fines to escalate in the way the noble Baroness is concerned about. I stress for the record that we will be happy to work with Barnardo&#146;s and all stakeholders concerned about the interests of young people to ensure that the system works and is fair and appropriate given the financial resources of young people.</p>

I am particularly interested in the second part of the amendment, which refers to children in custody, This is by no means the first time that this issue has been raised. Indeed, as Chief Inspector of Prisons, I raised it in 1999 as a requirement to enable speech and language therapists to assess everyone coming in for what they could do, could not do, their communication difficulties, healthcare and so on. This went on to a trial proving that these people were indispensable in every young offender institution, not only in the areas of speech and language but to guide disciplinary staff, education, healthcare and so on.</p>

Will there be some facility to explain what the hidden difficulty is, either to the parent, in the first case, or to that young person who is in the system? By this I mean that if you tell somebody that they are dyslexic&#151;to use an example that I know about&#151;their first question is, &#147;What does that mean?&#148;. If you then give some diatribe about working harder and not getting your Bs and Ds wrong, you probably deserve to have something thrown at you. If you explain that it is something to do with problems of short-term memory and the way one functions and processes information, and nothing to do with intellectual ability, you may open the door to that person being receptive to forms of help in the future. That is why it is very important that somebody is there to explain, either to the parent or the young person, exactly why they have failed&#151;or, at least, one of the reasons why they have failed&#151;in the past. Without that, simply going back to something like a classroom situation, particularly in the case of young offenders, is only going to make a bad situation worse.</p>

The Government are very anxious that young people have a choice in their education options and that they learn to use public transport. Yet often that choice cannot be exercised and young people have no alternative but to resort to private cars because there is no public transport available or because it is unduly expensive.</p>

I referred in Committee to Somerset, where, for &#163;420, young people can obtain an annual Rover ticket to cover all transport needs. However, far too many local authorities are not doing what they are required to do, and transport to and from college remains a big issue for many young people.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a><a name="08103032000636"></a>It is very lame for the Minister to respond that local authorities have these duties and should be carrying them out. This Bill will in many senses exacerbate the problem, because it will increase the number of young people seeking to travel to and from home to school or college. However, it also offers an opportunity to strengthen the local authorities&#146; duty, and the amendments do precisely this. Instead of lamely lamenting the fact that local authorities do not do their duty, the Minister can accept the amendments or promise to bring forward others that do the same.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="08103032000637"></a>It is quite wrong that colleges are having to devote, in total, somewhere between &#163;3 million and &#163;4 million of their funds to providing transport facilities that local authorities are not providing when that money should be devoted to the education of young people.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="08103032000638"></a>Amendment No. 73 is also in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Low. I pass on the noble Lord&#146;s apologies for not being here to speak to this amendment himself. Again, we are bringing back this issue, because although there has been some progress and discussion since the Committee stage, the trail seems to have gone cold. We would like to know what has happened to it and to have assurances that the Minister will take up the cudgels and make sure that things happen.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="08103032000639"></a>We have redrafted the amendment in order to meet some of the objections that have arisen. As before, the amendment puts an explicit duty on local authorities to ensure that qualified disabled students up to the age of 25 have access to a means of transport. We define qualified disabled students as those who, by reason of their disability, cannot use public transport without assistance and for whom private transport is also out of the question; for example, blind and visually impaired students.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="08103032000640"></a>The main stumbling block in the discussions that have been held has, as always, been costs, and the danger that the amendment would lead to vast expenditure on taxis for long journeys for the students concerned. There are two responses to this objection. The first is that the total number of students involved is extremely small, in the region of 10,000 from a total in further education of well over 1.5 million. The number is so small in relation to the total that it should not worry the ministry.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="08103032000641"></a>Secondly, &#147;qualified disabled learners&#148; consist only of those who are visually impaired or who have complex disabilities. There is a large number of people who are listed as disabled but who are perfectly able to travel by public transport. Even among those who might be  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1793"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1793</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>listed as qualified disabled learners there are quite a number who, if given assistance, can use public transport. A number of local authorities are providing what are called &#147;travel trainers&#148; so that the students concerned can be trained to travel. For example, a visually impaired student might well be able travel by train or bus provided that they learn the route and know what changes have to be made. Given a certain amount of travel training in this respect, they can and like to be independent. Similarly, a blind student is often able to travel with a dog. If the student concerned is making the same journey as other students, other students might be able to travel with them as travel assistants. Local authorities could employ them in that role. Given a little creative thinking, local authorities do not have to provide expensive taxis; there are other means of meeting the requirement. That is why, in rephrasing the amendment, we have defined &#147;access&#148; so that it,</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000883"></a>&#147;may include the provision of training or assistance with travel on public transport as well as the direct provision of the means of transport&#148;.</ul>
<a name="81030-0017.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="08103032000642"></a>This issue has been around for a very long time. When we discussed it in Committee, I spoke about the extent to which I had worked on it with Lady Darcy de Knayth. We saw a little movement from the Ministry during the summer. Some meetings took place, and there has been correspondence with Skill about it. However, the trail seems to have gone cold. I hope that the Minister will tell me that she will take up the cudgels on behalf of the disabled students that we are discussing. These rights and duties already exist in legislation relating to local authorities but, once again, local authorities are not delivering on those duties. The Ministry should make sure that they do. I hope that the Minister will see fit to accept our reasonable amendment and that we can see some real progress. I beg to move.</p>

As I prepared for this Bill I had the opportunity to meet representatives from a wide range of organisations, many of whom have devoted years to helping young people to find the opportunities that we are discussing in this Bill. By and large, they welcomed the Government&#146;s proposals to one degree or another, but one point that was impressed on me several times was that even if the Government and local education authorities opened up new courses, apprenticeships and training programmes, they would be worthless unless the people supposed to benefit from them are able to get there. Young people who seek training and education opportunities may not have the wherewithal to travel from place to place in pursuit of their duty under the Bill unless some provision is made for them.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="08103032000644"></a>I have already spoken about the need for the Government to be quite certain that they have done all they can to enable young people to fulfil their duty. These amendments follow that theme.</p>

Current legislation strikes a balance between protecting the interests of young people everywhere and giving local authorities the flexibility to direct resources to local priorities.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="08103032000646"></a>I am sure that the noble Baroness will agree that it is right that local authorities should have the discretion to determine how to target their funding to meet local needs. By 2010-11, the increase in total government grant for local services since 1997 will be 45 per cent in real terms. Drawing on this funding, the current duty requires local authorities to take into account the costs of transport in preparing their transport policy statements and this should ensure that transport is affordable for young people.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="08103032000647"></a>Furthermore, I can announce that we will use the opportunity of the fourth Session Bill to amend the current post-16 transport duty and strengthen local accountability. We will do that by bolstering the current duty on local authorities to prepare and publish a transport policy statement, requiring them to set out in the statement the assessments they have made in drawing up their transport policy and by improving the route for appeal to local authority policy, if a parent or young person believes that transport provision is a barrier to their participation in education or training and that their circumstances have not been adequately considered in the transport statement. I therefore hope the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="08103032000648"></a>Amendment No. 73 relates to transport provision for learners with learning difficulties. In Committee, my noble friend Lord Adonis committed to looking at this issue over the summer. Over the summer we have been working with Skill: National Bureau for Students With Disabilities to work out the best way forward. I recently met the noble Lord, Lord Low, who is unfortunately not able to be here today, to discuss progress and the need for momentum. As part of this work, my department has looked at the services and support that are made available to learners with learning difficulties by local authorities and how we can support them to develop commissioning and other systems to improve their efficiency and reach. We have also commissioned some work from Skill, looking at the needs of this group and possible solutions. This research is in its final stages, and we will consider the findings very carefully; in particular, it will inform decisions about how we legislate in the new fourth Session Bill.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="08103032000649"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, this new Bill proposes transferring the funding and responsibility for commissioning 16 to 19 provision from the Learning and Skills Council to local authorities from 2010. Local authorities will also have responsibility for commissioning provision for learners with learning difficulties and disabilities. We are sympathetic to the purpose of this amendment and think it needs to be considered within the changes as a part of the fourth Session Bill. The proposal made in the White Paper was that responsibility for the participation of these learners will sit with local authorities.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a><a name="08103032000650"></a>In the mean time, we believe that we can make a number of improvements to the existing system. The noble Baroness highlighted those, including strengthening   


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1795"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1795</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the current learning difficulty assessment guidance to include an explicit reference to considering the young person&#146;s wider needs, including transport. We will consult on this guidance directly after the Bill receives Royal Assent.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a><a name="08103032000651"></a>The noble Baroness is right that travel training can be extremely beneficial for this group of young people. It is an area that we particularly asked Skill to consider. Its interim findings advocate the benefits and the good work that is going on in many areas but, but it also recognises that it can be of variable quality and not available everywhere. To address that we have committed to highlighting good practice in travel training through our guidance on transport to local authorities and we will underline their responsibilities in this area in a series of workshops to take place in the spring. We will also work with awarding bodies, which I see as an important mechanism to encourage the accreditation of travel training as part of the foundation learning tier to enable colleges and providers to attract funding for this training more easily. That will really help.</p>

<a name="81030-0017.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a><a name="08103032000652"></a>We believe that these measures will improve the transport support available to this group and will bring all local authorities up to the standards of the best. I will be looking closely at progress and will consider whether it is necessary to do more alongside other local authority duties as we introduce legislation in the fourth Session. I assure noble Lords that the trail is not going cold. In the light of my comments, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

As I understand it, the Government will bring forward legislation in the next Session to put rather more pressure on local authorities to require them to be specific in their travel plans and to justify their assessments of what is needed. There will also be appeals where it is felt that they are not doing what they should. In relation to the first two amendments, that is a good response. We shall be looking at what comes forward in the next Session and will raise the issue again if we feel that it is not being adequately addressed. We look forward to seeing what comes forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"></a><a name="08103032000654"></a>In relation to the third amendment, I am delighted to hear what is happening. All that the Minister mentioned sounds positive. I know that the Government have been working with Skill partly in order to establish the numbers involved. As I indicated, it looks as though the actual numbers needing help in this way are relatively small in relation to the total number of disabled students and those with learning difficulties. Many of them do not need special transport arrangements. I am pleased to hear that the Minister will carry these discussions forward. Again, we look forward to seeing legislation in the next Session.

<p><a name="stpa_437"></a><a name="08103032000659"></a>The noble Lord said: Lords, this is one of a group of three amendments, the first of which proposes that the financial support that the Bill proposes should be given to those between the ages of 19 and 25 to obtain a level 3 qualification should be extended to those up to the age of 30. I propose this amendment against the background of what our Select Committee on Economic Affairs in 2006-07 said about apprenticeships in this country. In its report for 2006-07, the committee said that whereas we had 43 per cent at level 3, France had 52 per cent and Germany had 78 per cent. That is indicative of how far behind we have fallen.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a><a name="08103032000660"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Leitch, in his<I></I>final report on world class skills, tells us, in section 3.50, that we need to deliver more than a doubling of adults at level 3. Bearing mind that the Germans and French will not stand still, that seems about right. It is an awesome challenge, born out of the necessity to be competitive; and it is the foundation from which we can aspire to move on from level 3 to meet the targets that the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, sets for us to be competitive at level 4.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a><a name="08103032000661"></a>The Government and others have talked, in the light of the report of the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, of the need for 40 per cent of our adults to reach level 4 by 2020. The noble Lord, Lord Leitch, says in his report that we need to reach 45 per cent to be competitive. The United States and Germany were already at 40 per cent two or three years ago. To aim for 40 per cent by 2020, when major competitors are there already, hardly strikes me as aiming to be competitive. The figure of 45 per cent, which the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, says is necessary, is a modest target.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a><a name="08103032000662"></a>The history of this country is one of report after report telling us that we are not competitive in our skills base. The first report that I know of was in 1867, at the time of the great Paris Exhibition, which awakened us to the fact that we were no longer out in front. Professor Alison Wolf, in a book a few years ago, recalled I think 23 reports in the following century repeating that message. Of course, there have been more since; the report of the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, is the latest. Looking at that evidence, are we doing enough? By raising the issue of level 3, are we confident that we will not be once again in the same position as all those illustrious persons and committees who have made their recommendations and said, &#147;We must wake up and do much better&#148;, only to find themselves saying the same again a few years later?</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a><a name="08103032000663"></a>I welcome what the Government are doing, but they must do more. Originally, the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and I were proposing, as with level 2, that we should cover all ages. We have brought that down to 30 because we know that money is scarce now. However, given the challenge of our imperative need to be competitive, it seems that the Government need to consider the means by which we will achieve what needs to be achieved&#151;I refer to the call of the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, for a doubling of the number of those at level 3. I put forward the amendment on that basis.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1797"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1797</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_442"></a><a name="08103032000664"></a>The following two amendments refer to those who left school with least to show for it; not even a level G pass in their GCSE. The Government have provided&#151;and this corresponds with the recommendations of the noble Lord, Lord Leitch&#151;that, for those who left school without the English or maths to make sense of life and be basically competent at a low level, there should be free educational opportunities throughout their working lives. This is excellent. However, I say to myself, this is good for starters, but they need vocational skills as well. What is proposed at level 2 is the equivalent of five GCSEs for free in vocational subjects. These people need vocational skills. They are our fellow citizens who have least to offer to employers. I have heard it said that employers are not interested in investing in vocational skills at these very low levels. That may be because they can meet their requirements through the highly skilled workers coming from eastern Europe, notably Poland which has first-rate vocational education. That is reflected in those coming across to this country. Are we going to say that we are not going to do as much for the people whose need is greatest as for other groups, to enable them to get a job and contribute to the economy? I fear that we are not doing what we need for both our own interests and theirs.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a><a name="08103032000665"></a>The amendment is much more modest than that which we originally had in mind. We had proposed that such people should have the same deal as is offered to those who are aiming for level 2. We have watered that right down and limited it to the 19 to 25 year-olds, mirroring what the Government propose at level 3. We have referred specifically to information and communication technology as part of the area which should be under consideration. The government policy paper published on 17 October identifies information and communication technology as on a par with English and maths as the requirement for any pathway in the foundation framework that they are developing. We argue for other qualifications as well, but leave it to the Secretary of State to specify what they should be.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a><a name="08103032000666"></a>In tidying up my inexpert drafting of these amendments, the Table Office has missed out what was, to me, a key word from Amendment No. 76. I wished to say of the Secretary of State&#146;s power to determine what should happen, that it &#147;shall be&#148; as&#151;the word &#147;as&#148; was missed out&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08103032000884"></a>&#147;specified by the Secretary of State from accredited units and qualifications within in the foundation learning tier&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000710"></a>That leaves the Secretary of State to decide when and what. In other words, this is a marker&#151;an opportunity for and challenge to the Secretary of State to pick up what he thinks that the Government can afford, and what is more useful at a particular time. It could not be a more discretionary amendment to the Bill. It does not make immediate demands on the public purse.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a><a name="08103032000667"></a>I move the amendment on level 3 out of concern for our competitiveness and have tabled Amendments No. 75 and 76 regarding those at the foundation stage out of concern for our fellow citizens who most need our help, for their own sakes and for ours. I beg to move.</p>

First, the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, has been able to take forward these complicated matters. I am enormously thankful for that. Secondly, sadly, the economic situation has changed quite dramatically. So, as we have already heard, we are reluctantly looking at a different situation.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a><a name="08103032000669"></a>What is decided at level 3 bears directly on what we can achieve at level 4. Let us focus on that. Our achievement at level 3 will largely determine the ceiling of what can be achieved at level 4. In supporting the amendment to extend to 30 the age limit for support for level 3 students, I note that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, referred to Germany and the United States having already exceeded the commonly quoted target of 40 per cent at level 4 by 2020. The same may of course also be said for Japan, Canada and Russia, which have similarly already achieved that level 4.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a><a name="08103032000670"></a>How can a Government be serious in setting targets for 2020, as we know this Government are, which five competitor nations have already achieved? Who knows how many more will join them, including France and South Korea, for example? It would not be extremely worrying if we could assume that, having already passed 40 per cent at level 4, those countries would rest on their laurels; but we have no grounds for assuming that that will happen, when it is commonly accepted across the globe that competitive advantage is achieved by investment in education. In 12 years, those countries could well reach 50 per cent.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a><a name="08103032000671"></a>Speaking bluntly, I am more than sad that we are pulling back from the proposals that we made earlier that support for students aspiring to level 3 should extend across the entire working life, or certainly until at least the age of 50; but I am aware that cost is very much an issue. I note, however, that at the Labour Party conference&#151;admittedly it was last year, but nevertheless it was important&#151;the Prime Minister said that,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_155"></a><a name="08103032000868"></a>&#147;this is the century when we cannot afford to waste the talents of anyone ... we need to unlock the talents of all our people. In the last century the question was can we afford to do this? In the face of economic challenge, I say: in this century we cannot afford not to&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08103032000711"></a>I would gladly accept the argument that there are more cost-effective ways of achieving progress towards the kind of level 3 performance that we need by 2020&#151;somewhere between 45 per cent and 50 per cent, as my noble friend Lord Dearing argued. However, if the Government cannot even accept our proposal to extend the age limit for support to 30, or something around that age, bearing mind that 70 per cent of those who will be of working age in 2020 are already at work, will the Minister answer the following now, or before the next stage of the Bill? First, in the light of the performance of other countries, what is a desirable level of achievement for level 4 by 2020? Secondly, by what measures will the Government achieve that figure and what will each measure contribute?</p>

In many senses, the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, knows that we believe that the amendment is rather tame. He and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, explained that they would have liked to endorse the earlier Liberal Democrat amendment which proposed that there should be an entitlement to a level 3 education at any age&#151;including after retirement&#151;for all students if they had not received the benefit of it previously.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a><a name="08103032000674"></a>These days, we often talk about the lack of aspiration of young people, and perhaps of the teachers of young people. Here there is a lack of aspiration by the Government. We know perfectly well, from the Leitch report, that we must look to mature students to fill the gap in our skills base, which the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, rightly pointed out. The gap at level 3 is glaring and has been for a long time. The Government are doing practically nothing to fill that gap. We have not got enough young people coming through the system at level 3 and level 4 and we must be prepared to help students achieve qualifications at this level.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a><a name="08103032000675"></a>The minimum we can do is give those who aspire to a level 3 qualification the same rights as we give to those at level 4. Those at level 4 have the right to a loan to cover the cost of their tuition. Part-time students at level 3 do not have the same rights. Mature students at level 3, even if they are full time, do not have the same rights. There is a gross inequality here for those at level 3, many of whom lost out in the education system at an earlier point. That the Government do not have the inspiration or the aspiration to meet their needs is a very sad indictment. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, quoted previous Labour Party manifestos and their aspirations as to what should be achieved. The Government are letting down a whole group of the population.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a><a name="08103032000676"></a>As for the foundation-tier levels, these seem to be minimal qualifications. It is very sad that the Conservative Party takes the line it is taking, and very mean indeed. Here we have people with no qualifications whatsoever. The Conservative Party knows very well the importance these days of accreditations or qualifications of some sort or another. Surely people have a right to aspire to the lowest level of qualification. We are giving everybody the right to take what we call the full-fat level 2 qualification. If people do not have the capability of doing the full-fat level 2, surely the minimum we can do is encourage them to acquire the level 1 foundation-tier qualifications that we are now providing. From these Benches we endorse these amendments from the noble Lord, Lord Dearing.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, accuses us of a lack of inspiration and aspiration. I find that a bit over the top given that here we are discussing an Education and Skills Bill which is raising the participation age and applying free funding to a significant range of individuals. I reject her charge. I feel that, as we approach Christmas, I am somehow being labelled Scrooge and I will endeavour to prove that that is not a fair description.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a><a name="08103032000678"></a>This Bill gives us something extra in our efforts to raise skill levels. For the first time it introduces a legal requirement to ensure the Learning and Skills Council waives fees for adults undertaking specified basic skills&#151;first full level 2 and, for adults aged 19 to 25, first full level 3 qualifications. This is a really strong signal of the Government&#146;s commitment to supporting skills development. Amendment No. 74 would extend to those aged up to 30 the duty on the Learning and Skills Council to secure free tuition for a first full level 3 qualification. We know level 3 skills deliver good returns to individuals and the economy. The returns over the lifetime of a person moving from level 2 to level 3 are around &#163;45,000, so it is right, as the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, said and many employers demand, that as many people as possible should be qualified at higher levels, including at level 3, which is often a gateway to further higher level learning. However, level 3 learning programmes do not come cheap and our initial analysis is that extending the duty on the Learning and Skills Council to include free tuition for a first full level 3 qualification for adults aged between 25 and 30 would cost around &#163;85 million over the next three years. This includes education and training secured by the LSC through both Train to Gain and mainstream further education routes.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a><a name="08103032000679"></a>We are already doing much to help all adults, including those over 25, to reskill and upskill by helping them gain full qualifications at level 2 and level 3. Compared with 2001, there are now 2.2 million more adults of working age with qualifications at level 3 and above, and around 100,000 adults achieved a level 3 qualification in 2006-07 through LSC-funded programmes. Over the next two years alone, we plan to increase by 20 per cent the investment in level 3 training that the economy needs. I do not see a lack of aspiration in that kind of investment.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a><a name="08103032000680"></a>Unfortunately, if I were to agree to this amendment&#151;and I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, that we have considered it carefully&#151;I would have to divert resources within the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s budget away from the priorities that we have set out for the next three years. That would have a significant impact on the provision available for the lowest skilled and most disadvantaged individuals in the country&#151;a subject on which I know from my conversations with him that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, has strong feelings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_455"></a><a name="08103032000681"></a>I want to address the question of competitiveness, which was touched on by both the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. Compared with countries such as France and Germany, we have  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1801"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1801</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>far fewer young adults achieving a level 3 qualification. Evidence shows that the number of 19 to 21 year-olds qualified to level 3 as a percentage of the population is on a par with our competitors in Germany, the US and France. However, our competitors have caught up and overtaken us in relation to 25 year-olds: 74 per cent of adults aged between 25 and 28 in Germany and 62 per cent in France have level 3 qualifications or higher, compared with 54 per cent in the UK. We need to build on a strong base up to the age of 19 to keep pace with other countries, and that is a rational and reasonable approach. Even when the other provisions in the Bill that raise the participation age are fully implemented, there will still be young adults up to the age of 25 who, for various reasons, will benefit from being able to undertake level 3 qualifications without having to pay tuition fees.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a><a name="08103032000682"></a>I have cut out some of the argument in the interests of time, not because it was not necessarily important.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a><a name="08103032000683"></a>In Amendments Nos. 75 and 76, noble Lords focus on the other end of the learning spectrum and wish to make qualifications within the foundation learning tier free to those aged 19 to 25. As a Minister with responsibility for skills, I am fully behind the goal of supporting the most disadvantaged adults in developing new skills and bettering themselves. This is already a key objective of the Government and a core mission of our department. I wish to be clear, as was the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, that level 2 is the platform of skills that will make a real difference to an individual&#146;s career prospects. People with skills at level 2 or higher are half as likely to be unemployed as those with skills below it. There is no evidence that individuals achieving qualifications below level 2 reap such fruitful returns. Therefore, it is right that we prioritise our efforts and resources on supporting as many individuals as we can in getting to this level.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a><a name="08103032000684"></a>We have a set of actions already in place that we believe will address the concern expressed by noble Lords that, for some learners, a full level 2 qualification is an extremely challenging step. Those in receipt of means-tested benefits and many on the working tax credit do not have to pay tuition fees for any LSC-funded learning. This includes those undertaking qualifications which will, in the future, be part of the foundation learning tier.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a><a name="08103032000685"></a>In addition, we continue to drive forward integration of the employment and skills services that we offer jointly with the Department for Work and Pensions to ensure that the most disadvantaged individuals are given the opportunity to develop the skills that they need to find sustainable employment and progress in their careers.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a><a name="08103032000686"></a>We are backing up our commitment to learning below level 2 with significant funding. Each year we invest a total of &#163;1.5 billion in learning below level 2. Again, that does not strike me as lacking in aspiration or willingness to invest. In 2008-09 alone, we expect to support more than 2.2 million LSC-funded places on learning below level 2. Shortly, we expect to publish the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s grant letter for 2009-10, which will reflect our strategy for continuing investment in further education and skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_461"></a><a name="08103032000687"></a>I should like to address the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, emphasised. We believe that equipping people with essential skills in numeracy and literacy is one of the best ways in which we can help them. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, wanted what they saw as a rather modest extension to that to include information and communications technology. Having done a bit of investigation, I can say in response that in many cases of improving literacy and numeracy, ICT is used as a means of delivery. It is a very good means of doing it. Also I am told by those involved in further education that it is not the only means of delivery. Some people respond much better to embedding this in other forms of delivery. We are going some way towards equipping people, albeit not quite as far as the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and his supporters wish.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a><a name="08103032000688"></a>I stress that we still believe that we have got it right in focusing on numeracy and literacy, as did the Leitch report. We are committed to examining the scope for extending administrative entitlements to free learning into the foundation learning tier in the future, as set out in the <I>Adult Learning and Skills</I><I>:</I><I> I</I><I>nvesting in the </I><I>F</I><I>irst </I><I>S</I><I>teps </I>document, which we published in November 2007. Over time and as resources allow, we will concentrate public funds on programmes that align with these ladders of progression. In particular, we have stated our commitment to look at extending the administrative entitlement for 19 to 25 year-olds to foundation learning tier programmes.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a><a name="08103032000689"></a>The Government will continue to monitor progress towards the ambitions of the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, very closely. In the future, should we decide that we are in a position to extend the funding duty in proposed new Section 4B(4) to courses below level 2 or to those aged over 25 at level 3, the proposed order-making power in proposed new paragraph 9 of Schedule 1A will give the Secretary of State this flexibility.</p>

<a name="81030-0018.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a><a name="08103032000690"></a>I return briefly to the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. The Leitch report did not say 45 per cent; it suggested exceeding 40 per cent at level 4. In response we said that we would aim for 36 per cent of adults qualified at level 4 and above by 2014, on the way to world class by 2020. This is up from 29 per cent in 2005. I shall write about the impact of measures to get to level 4 because the amendment is on level 3. The noble Baroness has that assurance.</p>

<a name="81030-0019.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a><a name="08103032000691"></a>I hope that noble Lords are sufficiently reassured that the Government are serious about improving higher level skills and supporting the most disadvantaged adults, and that the Bill builds in flexibility to reassess our priorities in the future. We do not have infinite resources, but we believe that we are focusing and targeting them in areas where the Leitch report indicated there was the greatest need, and in areas where employers identified the greatest need. That will benefit employers, employees, and the country as a whole. In light of that I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_471"></a><a name="08103050000007"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we come to a large group of government amendments. I wrote to noble Lords on 23 October setting out the detail of the amendments that were laid in response to concerns and debates in Committee. The amendments put into effect the commitment made by my noble friend Lord Adonis that the Government would no longer seek to move the responsibility for registration, regulation and monitoring of independent educational institutions and non-maintained special schools from the Secretary of State to Ofsted. I will outline them rather than go into detail because I have written to noble Lords on the question.</p>

<a name="81030-0019.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a><a name="08103050000008"></a>Noble Lords may ask why the Government have decided to implement this change to the Bill through a large number of separate amendments to Part 4 rather than deleting it in its entirety and relying on the regulatory regime as it exists for independent schools in Chapter 10 of the Education Act 2002 and for non-maintained special schools in Section 342 of the Education Act 1996. Chapter 1 of Part 4 of the Bill re-states the entire regulatory regime for independent schools and, as we have just discussed&#151;or as we might have discussed&#151;offers the opportunity to ensure that protection is in place for children in the growing independent and part-time sector. In doing so, Part 4 makes a number of drafting and policy improvements. As one example, the Bill introduces a new right of appeal for proprietors of independent educational institutions and non-maintained special schools against decisions by the regulator, such as the refusal of an application for initial registration from a new institution.</p>

<a name="81030-0019.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a><a name="08103050000009"></a>There are other changes in Part 4, which, my noble friend Lord Adonis stated, the Government will continue to support. In particular, he drew attention to the two issues of concern to the Independent Schools Council and on which, having discussed further with the ISC, we have reached agreement. To avoid any doubt, it is worth reiterating these commitments here. First, we have agreed that regulations sitting under the new standard for leadership and management in Clause 81  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1804"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1804</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be modelled on the Independent Schools Inspectorate&#146;s criteria for judging leadership and management set out in its current inspection framework. Secondly, in abolishing the category of schools &#147;approved&#148; under Section 347 of the Education Act 1996, we are clear that we do not want to introduce extra bureaucracy as a result of a deregulatory measure. We are therefore committed to publishing a central list of all independent schools that are registered as being specially organised to provide for children with special educational needs. In doing this we will look to the possibility of enhancing the information available to parents and local authorities that is contained on the list. To discourage local authorities from creating additional red tape for schools, we will be publishing strengthened, clear guidance, on which we will consult. Indeed, throughout the implementation of these changes, my department will continue to work closely with the sector and schools affected by the repeal of Section 347. It is with these commitments as a backdrop that the amendments in this group are tabled, and I refer noble Lords again to the letter I wrote containing the full detail on these amendments. I beg to move.</p>

Because this Bill forces young people to remain in some sort of education until they are 18, Clause 129 allows those over 16 to exempt themselves from religious worship. I do not believe that that goes far enough. Amendment Nos. 192 to 194 would allow a pupil of sufficient maturity, intelligence and understanding to opt out of religious worship in school, and Amendment No. 195 would allow such a pupil also to exempt themselves from religious education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_543"></a><a name="08103050000115"></a>I want to make it clear at the outset that by using the word &#147;intelligence&#148; it is not my intention to exclude from these measures young people with special educational needs or those whose IQ is below the average. Many of those young people know their own mind in matters of morals and ethics perfectly well, and they should not be excluded from the meaning of these amendments.</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_544"></a><a name="08103050000116"></a>Since we discussed these matters in Committee, I have received briefings from a new multifaith organisation, Accord, which shares my concerns about the quality and content of religious education in the UK of today. It believes that in a pluralist society, it is important that students are taught about different values and beliefs. While this is done well in some schools, it is not in others. It reports that at the moment RE syllabuses fail to take sufficient account of the many children who are not religious, or who have a different religion from the one they are assumed to have.</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_545"></a><a name="08103050000117"></a>Many children are not receiving the benefit of instruction about the wide range of faiths in our country and around the world. Religion is an important aspect of culture and, if well taught, can add enormously to a child&#146;s understanding of the world around him. If I believed that it was being well and broadly taught everywhere, I may not have felt the need to propose these opt-outs. Surveys have found that a high proportion of young people are not religious, and the Human Rights Act now equally protects the right to hold and to manifest either religious or non-religious beliefs.</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_546"></a><a name="08103050000118"></a>However, the views of Accord are not just those of people who profess no religion, but also those of many, of several different faiths, who are profoundly religious but are concerned about the quality of RE syllabuses. So I call their views in aid to support my case, though they have not overtly supported my amendments. I also call in aid the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which does support my amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_547"></a><a name="08103050000119"></a>Since our original discussion of this issue in  debates on the Education and Inspections Act, the JCHR has produced a trenchant report with very strong recommendations to the Government. In our discussions on this Bill in July, the Minister ignored those recommendations, saying that the Government&#146;s position had not changed since the previous Bill. Section 70 of the School Standards and Framework Act requires pupils to &#147;take part in&#148; a daily act of worship, not just to attend&#151;a rule that is honoured more in the breach than in the observance by most schools. It is manifestly obnoxious to expect or require older children to worship a god or act in accordance with rites in which they do not believe. At the very least, that section needs to be amended to remove that requirement. Would it not be far better to require schools to have inspiring, inclusive assemblies that explore ethics to which all pupils can relate and which bring people together, rather than giving them something to mock?</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_548"></a><a name="08103050000120"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, relied heavily in his response on the so-called administrative burden on schools, suggesting that a large number of young people would seek to opt out and the so-called Gillick test would have to be applied to each. Our children are some of the most tested in the world, and I cannot see that it would be beyond the capacity of schools to include a test of all children at some stage to gauge their understanding of the importance of moral issues and the strength of their personal beliefs.</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_549"></a><a name="08103050000121"></a>As I said in July, the thing is done by school nurses every day, when young people under 16 ask for contraceptive services but do not want their parents to know. This situation does not bring schools to a halt. Giving young people their human rights under UN conventions to which we are signatories would not bring schools to a halt either, and it is not an adequate excuse.</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_550"></a><a name="08103050000122"></a>Young people would not be likely to fulfil the Gillick competence criteria until they had already sat through about 10 years of compulsory religious education and worship. If that is not enough time to convince a child that he wants to hear more, I do not think there is any justification for forcing him to carry on any longer. Passing these amendments would put pressure on the local standing advisory councils on religious education and on the agreed syllabus conferences to improve and broaden the syllabuses and bring them more into line with what children need in the 21st century to prepare them to live in our multifaith society. If the content and quality were better, fewer students would wish to opt out. It would also put pressure on those schools that do not do it already to prepare the sort of inclusive, inspiring assemblies to which I referred earlier. A lot depends on the schools themselves, but they are currently fettered by the unreasonable and unfair requirements of legislation. By these amendments, I seek to free schools and students from those constraints. I beg to move.</p>

The amendments in this group extend the right set out in Clause 129 for sixth formers in non-maintained special schools to withdraw from collective worship to all competent pupils in every school. In addition, the amendments, if accepted, would allow competent pupils to opt out of RE as well as collective worship and, for the first time, extend the statutory rights to pupils of academies.</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_551"></a><a name="08103050000125"></a>Fundamentally, they would change the settlement that has been in place since 1944 regarding the provision of religious education to children and young people and the right of withdrawal that may be exercised by parents. I know that the noble Baroness is aware of that, but it is not something that the Government can support right now. The amendments also introduce new arrangements for the withdrawal of pupils from collective worship.</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_552"></a><a name="08103050000126"></a>The Government recognise the value of collective worship in schools because it contributes to young people&#146;s spiritual, social, moral and cultural development by exploring social and moral issues and their own beliefs. Collective worship is a long-standing aspect of school life, and many parents want their children to benefit from it, whether or not they have a strong Christian belief themselves. The current position in the case of maintained community, foundation, voluntary and special schools is that all pupils must receive RE unless withdrawn by their parents, as the noble Baroness is aware. All pupils should attend collective worship unless withdrawn by their parents up to the age of 16 or they withdraw themselves in the sixth form.</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_553"></a><a name="08103050000127"></a>Clause 129 replicates these provisions for pupils at non-maintained special schools so that all maintained schools and non-maintained special schools would be placed on the same footing. The Government judge that there is no good reason for children in non-maintained and maintained special schools to have different rights in relation to collective worship.</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_554"></a><a name="08103050000128"></a>These amendments reproduce similar ones debated in Committee. Indeed, the noble Baroness reminded us of a debate, which noble Lords may remember, during the passage of the Education and Inspections Act in 2006. At that time, the Government agreed with the noble Baroness that there was a case for extending the right of withdrawal from collective worship to children over compulsory school age, and we duly brought forward amendments to the Bill. Noble Lords on both sides of the Committee recognised the difficulties that would result from the amendments currently before us, and my noble friend Lord Adonis made clear that the intention behind them was a step too far. Over the Summer Recess, the Government&#146;s position has not changed. We believe that the balance has been struck in the right place by allowing sixth form pupils to withdraw themselves from collective worship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_555"></a><a name="08103050000129"></a>As noble Lords may recognise, religious education is a distinctly different issue that relates to the content of the schools&#146; curriculum. A non-statutory national framework for religious education now seeks to ensure that children gain a broad and balanced understanding of religion. More local standing advisory councils on religious education are now adopting syllabuses based on that framework. We welcome that development and see no case for changing the law at present to provide children with an opt-out from religious education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_566"></a><a name="08103050000145"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this is a probing amendment to find out whether the Government are aware that the current law on post-16 admissions in schools needs to be updated to take account of the current and future patterns of provision and young people&#146;s choices. Young people currently have a statutory right to state a preference for the school or college of their post-16 education. However, today they do not really distinguish between educational provision made by a school or college. They decide what they want to do, then look around for institutions providing the right courses. The law has not completely caught up with that fact.</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_567"></a><a name="08103050000146"></a>Most schools set out to admit external candidates to their sixth forms. They advertise information meetings and have application forms to complete. Schools welcome those external applicants, although admission numbers are rarely set for new entrants unless the school is designated to provide sixth-form education for young people from a number of schools. Schools set relatively low admission requirements for academic achievement, but they must of course be the same for both internal and external candidates. That is because schools now provide a wide range of courses for all abilities, some being more popular than others.</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_568"></a><a name="08103050000147"></a>However, schools operate course oversubscription criteria. The first criterion, for those who can get onto courses, is often to admit internal applicants first. That is not generally published. Thus, a school may be prepared to give external candidates three out of their four A-level choices, and thus offer them a place, but not to give them their fourth&#151;on the basis that all the places available have been filled by internal candidates. A place is often offered on a less popular A-level course to fill it up. However, it may have been that fourth course that the young person particularly wanted, but there is no appeal to the schools&#146; adjudicator, as there is no refusal to admit the student. In other words, it is relatively easy to be offered a school place, thus ruling out the chance of appealing against refusal to admit the applicant, who therefore has no rights of appeal despite not being admitted onto the course that he or she wants. Indeed the only recourse for a young person in these circumstances would be to accept the place, complain to the governors and then, if the governors do not yield, go to the Secretary of State to intervene on the grounds that the governors&#146; refusal has been unreasonable to meet the person&#146;s curricular needs.</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_569"></a><a name="08103050000148"></a>This goes to show that as the country moves, with the development of diplomas, towards a de facto tertiary post-16 system where a majority of young people at 16 access part of their option courses at different institutions, the law on post-16 school admissions

Has this registered with the DCSF or DIUS&#151;I notice that the noble Lord, Lord Young, on the Front Bench at the moment&#151;as the only change in the Bill is found in Clause 136, which introduces weak, meaningless appeal rights. If all young people were able to have equal access to the post-16 provision that they wanted to follow and not be dependent on where they studied previously, it would be a very good thing even if it was somewhat difficult to deliver.</p>

<a name="81030-0021.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_570"></a><a name="08103050000149"></a>An anomaly has crept in here and, as we move to a post-16 education system where we are expecting young people perhaps to opt for courses and be at one institution or another institution, there is inequality. As I say, if they change institutions and opt for courses that are already filled with internal candidates, they are put on the bottom of the list and cannot get on to the courses they require.

Ideally schools would provide all possible options so that no one would be disappointed. However, we do not have an ideal system but one where budgets, staffing availability, pupil numbers and much else besides influence what courses of study schools can provide for their pupils.

I am sure that many of us, as parents, have been through the process of helping our children to find the right sixth form college or school. As noble Lords will be aware, the next Education and Skills Bill will propose transferring the funding and responsibility for commissioning 16 to 19 provision from the Learning and Skills Council to local authorities from 2010. As part of this duty, local authorities will be responsible for ensuring that there is sufficient provision available to meet the needs of all learners in their area. That is where we are directing, with due respect, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_574"></a><a name="08103050000155"></a>It will be a duty of the local authority to ensure that there is, from 2010, sufficient provision available to meet the needs of all learners in their area.

This and other changes that we are making to the range of post-16 options will ensure that all young people can access a course of learning that is appropriate and relevant. I echo the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, in relation to this. We should be wary of giving them an almost impossible task of trying to ensure, through the process of admissions, that every course of study that any particular student might wish for will be available at every school or college. I hope that the assurances I have given on the duty of local authorities&#151;to ensure a diverse range of provision from 2010&#151;show that we are cognisant of the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp.

The purpose of this amendment was really to bring to the department&#146;s attention the fact that there is a degree of inequality here that is a problem. Clearly, if some students have to change school at 16 and others can stay within the same institution, it should not necessarily be the inherent right of those staying within the institution to fill up all the popular courses. It may be that a student chooses a particular institution because it is well known that it teaches a particular subject. We have all these specialist colleges and schools now; some are much better at teaching some subjects than others and have a very good reputation. As this Bill is implemented and we have more young people staying on in school wanting to opt for particular courses, this could be a bigger issue.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_307"></a><a name="08103050000393"></a> Clause 140, page 92, line 23, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>&#147;( ) prohibiting a governing body from exercising the power conferred by subsection (1) in such a way that any pupil is required to receive educational provision outside the school premises for a greater number of days in a school year than is specified in the regulations,&#148;
<a name="81030-0022.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_577"></a><a name="08103050000160"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I move on to government Amendments Nos. 206 and 207. Clause 140 provides a specific power for governing bodies to require registered pupils to attend a place off-site in order to receive educational provision that is intended to improve their behaviour. A school governing body already has the power, under Section 29(3) of the Education Act 2002, to direct pupils off-site to receive instructional training. The power was intended to enable schools to send pupils to other schools or FE colleges to take academic or vocational subjects that their own school could not provide. However, there are concerns that governing bodies may also be exercising this power for a number of purposes that go beyond those stated in the Act, albeit that they are used to benefit the pupil concerned. This amendment seeks to allow regulations to be made concerning the maximum length of time that a pupil can be referred off-site for education relating to their behaviour. It has always been our intention that referrals to off-site provision to improve pupils&#146; behaviour should be only for a temporary period.</p>

<a name="81030-0022.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_578"></a><a name="08103050000161"></a>In response to a concern expressed earlier in the process by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, we will reinforce this by having regulations stating that governing bodies cannot direct a pupil off-site beyond the end of the academic year in which they are so directed. Along with the statutory review that must take place when a pupil is off-site, we can be confident that students will not be pushed out of mainstream education on the back of this clause. In addition, Clause 140 allows regulations to be made requiring a governing body exercising the power to require a pupil to attend off-site provision to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. It is the intention to issue guidance on the use of the power and, indeed, illustrate guidance that has already been issued in draft, to show how it is intended that the power should operate.</p>

<a name="81030-0022.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_579"></a><a name="08103050000162"></a>The Government are committed to transforming the quality of alternative education provision and, as part of this, to raising the standards of education for pupil referral units. We published our White Paper, <I>Back on Track,</I> in May, setting out our proposals for achieving this. Central to our strategy is a focus on early intervention to prevent behavioural problems leading to permanent exclusions and on stronger accountability by holding local authorities to account for the outcomes of young people in pupil referral units, which I hope noble Lords will agree is extremely important. We are determined to improve this sector, which is so crucial to the life chances of some of the more disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. I beg to move.</p>

We share its concern and are delighted that the Government are going to prevent governing bodies using this power as a way of dumping inconvenient pupils. It will be important to see the detail of the regulations and the accompanying guidance. I will ask only one question about that today, because of the late hour. Will governing bodies be able to renew, in the following school year, the same power to send a young person somewhere else for the purposes of improving their behaviour? In other words, could one order finish at the end of a school year, only to be replaced by an identical action at the beginning of the following school year, thus neutralising the Government&#146;s limitation on the power in the amendments?</p>

<a name="81030-0022.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_583"></a><a name="08103050000171"></a>On 14 October, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families announced that from the summer of 2009, children would not be required to take key stage 3 tests. Over the summer, my department looked at the assessment arrangements for the national curriculum, taking account of the recommendations of the Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families in its third report of the 2007-08 Session on testing and assessment. We fully agree with the Select Committee that the principles of national testing are sound. Testing, assessment and accountability must encourage and reward the best teaching so that it properly supports pupils in their learning and development and schools are judged fairly on how they support the progress and well-being of every child.</p>

<a name="81030-0022.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_584"></a><a name="08103050000172"></a>In his Statement on 14 October, the Secretary of State described in detail the key principles that must guide our approach. He said that our system of testing and assessment should, first, give parents the information that they need to compare different schools; secondly, enable head teachers and teachers to secure the progress of every child and their school; and, thirdly, allow the public to hold to account national and local government and governing bodies for the performance of schools.</p>

<a name="81030-0022.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_585"></a><a name="08103050000173"></a>National curriculum tests at key stage 2 meet these key principles. Key stage 2 tests provide a reliable and consistent source of information for parents at a crucial transition point for their child, as well as allowing the public to hold the system and the Government to account for the performance of primary schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_586"></a><a name="08103050000174"></a>I do not wish to speak at length to the amendments; I have written in detail to noble Lords about them. Amendment No. 207 requires schools and local authorities to implement national curriculum assessment arrangements as they exist at the current time&#151;that is the key change that we are making.</p>

<a name="81030-0022.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_587"></a><a name="08103050000175"></a>I assure noble Lords that the amendments refer only to the assessment arrangements within the national curriculum. We are not providing for a power to change any other part of the national curriculum after the start of the school year, because that would make the job of planning and delivering the curriculum in schools extremely difficult and undermine the thoughtful planning of teaching and learning that has already taken place.</p>

<a name="81030-0022.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_588"></a><a name="08103050000176"></a>We want the changes to the assessment arrangements to come into effect as soon as possible. That is why Amendments Nos. 219 and 220 bring the legislative changes into effect on Royal Assent. Amendment No. 238 is a consequential amendment, ensuring that the amendments to the legislation are carried forward when Section 74 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 comes into force. I have spoken quickly to the amendments, but I know that noble Lords will be keen to progress their effect. I beg to move.</p>

We are delighted that the Government took into account the advice of the Select Committee. The Minister did not mention that the Select Committee also pointed out that SATs for 14 year-olds were both expensive and unnecessary. My honourable friend Mr Laws in the other place made it quite clear in the middle of July that he thought that we should scrap them there and then, because the debacle over their marking had shown that they were not only expensive and unnecessary but also unreliable. He called for the money that we were saving to be put into one-to-one tuition to tackle basic problems in reading and writing of the kind that we discussed when considering the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Elton. There is a need for money to be put into those basics, and we are delighted to see it. In general, we very much welcome this development.</p>

We do not want to see standards brought down so that children can quickly be put through a succession of exams. This is not a matter for this Bill. It deserves a great deal more thought and consultation and a sea change in attitude from the Government.

The UN committee recommended that the Government ensure that children who are able to express their views have the right to appeal against their exclusion as well as the right to appeal to SENDIST, in particular those who are in alternative care.</p>

<a name="81030-0022.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_592"></a><a name="08103050000183"></a>The Minister pointed out that there were several areas in the educational field, not just exclusion appeals, where young people might be given such a right. She has undertaken to consult on the matter in early 2009 and then come back on the issue. I replied to her letter and gave her a number of areas on which I should like to ask her some questions tonight. She has notice of the questions, which are as follows.</p>

<a name="81030-0022.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_593"></a><a name="08103050000184"></a>Will it be a three-month formal consultation, in line with the Cabinet Office consultation code, or will it be a different period of consultation? What will be its scope? Is the consultation on proposals for how to give children the right to appeal or on whether they should be able to appeal&#151;or do different things apply to different rights of appeal? Will the consultations be on both the right to appeal exclusions from school and the decisions of SENDIST? Will it be for both primary and secondary schools, or are secondary pupils alone regarded as being capable of making such appeals?</p>

<a name="81030-0022.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_594"></a><a name="08103050000185"></a>Will the consultation explore the use of advocates as an aide to children, particularly those with communication difficulties? Will it simply cover England or England and Wales? What would be the response to Scotland and Northern Ireland, or is it a completely devolved issue? How does this link with the developments in Wales that we already have to allow children to appeal exclusions? They are consulting on enabling them to appeal to SENDIST as well, so they are ahead of us in this particular respect, as they are in many others relating to children.</p>

<a name="81030-0022.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_595"></a><a name="08103050000186"></a>What efforts will be made to engage children and young people in the consultation, rather than just adults or their carers, and especially those who have already been excluded and gone through the experience of not having a voice in the matter? How will the Government involve young people with special needs?</p>

<a name="81030-0022.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_596"></a><a name="08103050000187"></a>I also gave the Minister notice that I would ask her some questions about SENDIST, because considerable concerns have been raised about the tribunals that have been lumped in with mental health tribunals and others. We received a letter from a couple of parents expressing severe concerns about the new system of tribunals. They said that they were unfair to children with special needs as they will be more complex and costly and that, for the vast majority of parents who cannot afford legal representation, their chances of obtaining justice would be much reduced. With a second level of hearing for the case management directions as well as no limitation on the number of witnesses, there will be significant additional costs. It is important that access to this sort of appeal is not limited to those who can afford legal representation from somebody who understands the complexity of the system. It is important, too, that the further complexity does not extend the time that these procedures take, because young people are desperate sometimes for their needs

We are sympathetic to the broad intentions behind the amendments. However, as she said, my noble friend Lord Adonis stated our position when we discussed this issue previously&#151;namely, that it is not necessary to legislate to give pupils a right to makerepresentations in exclusions since statutory guidance already covers this by allowing pupils several opportunities to give their views. Neither do we wish to impose new financial burdens on local authorities by requiring them to make arrangements for the provision of independent representation or assistance.

After further consideration during the Summer Recess, particularly in light of the observations of the UN Committee on Rights of the Child, I am happy to reassure noble Lords that, as I outlined in my letter of 14 October to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, it is our intention to consult on giving pupils under 18 their own right to appeal in their exclusion proceedings, within the wider context of other appeal forums including appeals to the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal&#151;SENDIST&#151;and admissions.</p>

It is our intention that there be a three-month formal consultation, in line with the Cabinet Office <I>Code of Practice on Written Consultations</I>.

It will be primarily about how a right of appeal following permanent exclusion might be implemented, and on what other policy areas, such as SENDIST, this should apply to.</p>

On the whole, the responses supported the Government&#146;s proposals. The Tribunals Service has also consulted on the rules for the Health, Education and Social Care Chamber this summer. The final version of the rules will come into force on 3 November and has been altered in response to representations from people with an interest in special educational needs.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_317"></a><a name="08103050000403"></a> After Clause 141, insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_318"></a><a name="08103050000404"></a>&#147;Traveller Education Services</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_319"></a><a name="08103050000405"></a>It shall be the duty of all local education authorities to establish a traveller education service which shall be resourced in proportion to the population of gypsies and travellers identified in the Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessments required under the Housing Act 2004 (c. 34).&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="81030-0023.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_605"></a><a name="08103050000199"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 211 requires all local authorities to establish a Traveller education service, resourced in proportion to the GRT population in their area. We tabled this amendment to revisit some points made by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, in his reply in Committee on 21 July. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08103050000445"></a>&#147;a good proportion of local authorities maintain a Traveller education support service ... I have written to all local authorities to urge them to ensure that their provision is good&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08103050000239"></a>Can the Minister tell us what response there was to this reminder? We pointed out that eight to 10 local authorities did not provide any Traveller education service, in spite of the fact that they had GRT populations, and there was anecdotal evidence that others were giving it very low priority. A Traveller education service worker recently told Frieda Schicker of the London Gypsy and Traveller Unit of his concern that Traveller education services in London are being quietly allowed to die, and there is no mention of Traveller education services on any of the London borough websites.</p>

<a name="81030-0023.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_606"></a><a name="08103050000200"></a>What guarantee is there that Traveller education services will be maintained separately and not absorbed into the general funding for ethnic-minority achievement, and that when TES staff leave they will be replaced? Does the Minister agree that funding of Traveller education services should be separately identified in local authority budgets? What assurances can the

<a name="81030-0023.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_607"></a><a name="08103050000201"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, mentioned the importance of the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller Achievement Project, which was launched in 2006 to improve the quality of educational provision for, and the rates of attendance and standards of behaviour of, Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils, and thus raise their attainment. He said that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_320"></a><a name="08103050000406"></a>&#147;Forty-seven schools in 12 local authorities are currently involved in that programme and a further 40 schools in 10 new local authorities will join the programme in the autumn of this year&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/7/08; col. 1632.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08103050000240"></a>Can the Minister say whether that has happened and what results this programme has achieved so far? Perhaps a note could be placed in the Library, in view of the lateness of the hour. Could she give details of the schools involved, and any strategy for further expansion? Could she say how the Traveller education services are involved in the programme, and whether the department is consulting ACERT, as the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, so helpfully did on a number of occasions?</p>

<a name="81030-0023.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_608"></a><a name="08103050000202"></a>The Minister went on to mention the publication, in February 2008, of <I>The Inclusion of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller Children and Young People</I>, which offered practical advice to local authorities, schools, pupils and parents on how to raise attainment among GRT pupils. How are local authorities responding to this advice, and has there been any attempt to get feedback on the outcomes?</p>

<a name="81030-0023.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_609"></a><a name="08103050000203"></a>The Minister commented on the e-learning programme, which began in 2004, and said that it had already increased pupil motivation, improved achievement and produced easier reintegration for those pupils who returned to school. In strand B, for key stage 4 pupils who had disengaged from education, he said that the majority of the initial participants had gained successful results in the first level of a wider skills GCSE. Since the majority of GRT pupils drop out of education by key stage 4, that seems to be a promising route to higher achievement. It would be good to have a further progress report&#151;again in writing, if the noble Baroness prefers.</p>

<a name="81030-0023.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_610"></a><a name="08103050000204"></a>Finally, I ask about a couple of points made by the Minister in his letter to the Traveller Law Reform Project, which he referred to in that debate. The letter referred to a suggestion by the TLRP that the duty in Clause 65 to assess the needs of young people with special educational needs should be widened to include all those disadvantaged in the education system. The noble Lord undertook that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_321"></a><a name="08103050000407"></a>&#147;Officials will work to explore if there is a way to take your concerns around this issue forward&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08103050000241"></a>Can we have an update from the Minister?</p>

<a name="81030-0023.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_611"></a><a name="08103050000205"></a>In the same letter, the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said that DCSF officials were working to set up a group drawn from the GRT community that would meet to discuss ongoing and future education policy, and that he envisaged the group meeting twice a year. I have not heard, through my contacts with the GRT

<a name="81030-0023.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_612"></a><a name="08103050000206"></a>Finally, I congratulate the DCSF on the outstanding success of Gypsy Roma Traveller history month, and thank the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, for the impetus that he gave to that project. I hope the current Minister and the DCSF will build on that achievement, which inspired and excited many people in the communities. I beg to move.</p>

Young Gypsy and Traveller people are among those whom this good Bill most needs to reach. Now that their traditional ways of earning a living are diminishing, they and their parents are coming to want educational and skill qualifications to equip them to continue to do so. However, they still face astonishing discrimination and bullying in secondary education, as I heard from a most impressive group of young Roma Gypsy students last week. I will not read out the report of that meeting at this hour, but it is harrowing. Without Traveller education services, many of them will lose heart, as they do now. My noble friend&#146;s predecessor was positive on this point, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, but local authorities did not follow his lead and make provision. They must do so, or many of these young people will be unable to make much at all from the opportunities furthered by the Bill.</p>

I assure him that the same concern is felt by those of us on these Benches: that all children should receive the high-quality education that is their right. Because all children should receive that education, it is unnecessary to establish a separate Traveller education service. It is the duty of local education authorities to educate all children for whom they are responsible, regardless of their background.</p>

This is a question of making them consistent and universal. The service already exists.</p>

My point is that it is a duty on local education authorities to educate all children regardless of their background. We must put effort into seeing that that is done.</p>

Funding is not ring-fenced, as this is against DCSF policy. Traveller education services are funded through the authorities&#146; revenue support grant, and ethnic minority achievement grant. These grants are for all vulnerable pupils, not just for the Gypsy Roma Traveller community.</p>

<a name="81030-0023.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_613"></a><a name="08103050000212"></a>The noble Lord asked for an update on progress. Since July, the national strategies Gypsy, Roma and Traveller Achievement Project has been extended across  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1829"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column 1829</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a further 10 local authorities, bringing the total to 22. This will disseminate good practice in Traveller education to secondary and primary schools in these areas. In late 2009, it will produce guidance documents available to all schools.</p>

<a name="81030-0023.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_614"></a><a name="08103050000213"></a>New target-setting groups for local authorities will be laid before the House in December. The number of groups will be reduced from 17 to eight, and Gypsy, Roma and Traveller is one of these. This means in practice that any authority with three or more pupils from this group will set progression targets at key stage 2 and 4 for Gipsy, Roma and Traveller pupils.</p>

<a name="81030-0023.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_615"></a><a name="08103050000214"></a>In response to concerns about the possible erosion of Traveller education support services, the DCSF has commissioned the National Association of Teachers of Travellers to undertake a survey of its members to explore this issue in more depth. The results of the survey will be available in December and will enable the DCSF to implement appropriate action. To enable Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils who regularly travel with their families, the electronic learning and mobility programme has been extended to include more than 700 Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils who may otherwise have had their education interrupted.</p>

<a name="81030-0023.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_616"></a><a name="08103050000215"></a>I am sure that there is a lot more to talk about and I am concerned that I may not have answered all of the noble Lord&#146;s questions. He suggested that I write to him, which I will do to expand on my comments. My colleague in the other place who joined the department at the same time as me, Sarah McCarthy-Fry, is the new Minister for Gypsies, Roma and Travellers. She is very keen to meet the noble Lord to hear his views on the subject and his perspective on the issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_617"></a><a name="08103050000216"></a>Although it is late, I hope that we have been able to continue the momentum that the noble Lord initiated and my noble friend Lord Adonis responded to. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I hope that it will be possible to meet her with some of the officials from ACERT, with whom we had an extremely productive meeting with the noble Lord, Lord Adonis. I shall pursue that matter immediately. I am also grateful to the noble Baroness for what she said about the electronic learning programme. It is an impressive achievement that 700 pupils who would otherwise probably not have been receiving an education are in this programme. I congratulate the DCSF on what it has done on that. I very much look forward to the results of the NATT survey, which the noble Baroness said will be published in December. Perhaps that will provide a peg on which to hang the discussion with ACERT. I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for her reply and for promising to follow it up with a letter. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="08103038000001"></a>Thursday, 30 October 2008.</h2>

<h4 align="center"><a name="08103038000005"></a>The Committee met at two o'clock.</h4>


<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000006"></a>[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall) in the Chair.]</p>

<p><a name="08103038000007"></a><a name="81030-gc0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="81030-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08103038000129"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall):</b> I remind the Committee that in the event of a vote in the Chamber, the debate will adjourn for 10 minutes from the sound of the Division Bells in order to allow noble Lords to vote. It has been agreed that, should any of the Questions for Short Debate not run for their allotted hour, the Committee will adjourn during pleasure until the end of the hour. Therefore, each of the Questions for Short Debate will start on the hour. In the event of a vote, the time lost will be added to the allotted time for the debate.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="08103038000002"></a>Women in Public Life</h3>

<p><a name="08103038000008"></a><a name="81030-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81030-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08103038000130"></a>Baroness Gale</b> asked Her Majesty&#146;s Government what measures they will take to encourage the full participation of women in public life.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000009"></a>The noble Baroness said: The Equality and Human Rights Commission has recently published a document entitled <I>Sex and Power 2008</I>, which shows how slow women&#146;s progress is in all fields of political and public life; the document calls it &#147;a snail&#146;s pace&#148;. The House of Commons is a good example of how slow women&#146;s progress is. Since 1918, when women were first able to stand as Members of Parliament, only 291 women have been elected, but during that same period 4,363 men were elected. If it was possible to put all the women who have ever been elected into the House of Commons today, they would still be in the minority. Women have been able to sit in your Lordships&#146; House since 1958 and, to date, 1,044 men and 198 women have been appointed as Peers: 84 per cent men and 16 per cent women. So whether elected or appointed, women are, and always have been, a minority in both Houses.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000010"></a>In other walks of life have women fared any better? The <I>Sex and Power</I> report talks about the &#147;missing women&#148;. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08103038000113"></a>&#147;If women hope to shatter the glass ceiling and achieve equal representation we would need to find over 5,600 women &#145;missing&#146; from more than 31,000 top positions of power in Britain today&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08103038000110"></a>This includes all public appointments, business, local authorities, media, civil servants, senior judges and, of course, the missing women in the Commons&#151;198 more women are needed, and in your Lordships&#146; House we need another 225 to achieve equal numbers. Can the Committee imagine what the House of Lords would look like with those additional 225 women?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000011"></a>However, there are some good stories. In the nine years since the first elections to the Welsh Assembly, there has always been a good number of women elected. In fact, the 2003 elections saw the Welsh Assembly become the first democratically elected legislature in the world to have an equal number of  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC32"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>men and women. As far as Wales is concerned, this did not happen by accident. The Labour Party, in readiness for the first elections to the Welsh Assembly in 1999, took a decision to field an equal number of women and men candidates. That was not as easy as it sounds&#151;I know, as I was there&#151;but as a result more Labour women were elected than Labour men, showing that the electorate do not discriminate when it comes to electing women candidates. The problem lies not with the electorate but with the political parties, as their members are reluctant to select women candidates. Unless action is taken, such as through the Labour Party policy of all-women shortlists, this problem will persist.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000012"></a>I have given up believing that over time prejudice against women will be overcome. None of us will be here long enough to see that happen. Today we live in a society in which women are in most cases unable to achieve their full potential. How can this be dealt with? Can government, in bringing in equality laws, change the perceptions, prejudice and culture that exist? I believe that laws can go some way in helping women. I am thinking of laws such as the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002, which allows all-women shortlists, the Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination Act. Soon we will be debating the new equality Bill. We also have the national minimum wage, two-thirds of the beneficiaries of which are women, and the right to ask for flexible working.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000013"></a>On public appointments, in May this year the Women&#146;s National Commission began working with the Cabinet Office on a new initiative to encourage more women to apply for posts on public bodies. I declare an interest: I serve as the commissioner for Wales. The commission will work with four government departments, as well as the Appointments Commission, publicising the current adverts for posts on the boards of public bodies and encouraging women with the specific skills and experience to apply for these posts. By sharing information on public appointments and engaging with women about the importance of their representation within public appointments, the Women&#146;s National Commission believes that it will be doing all that it can to encourage women to apply for these posts.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000014"></a>I was interested to learn that the Prime Minister has asked the Speaker of the House of Commons to convene a Speaker&#146;s Conference. The conference has been asked to:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08103038000114"></a>&#147;Consider, and make recommendations for rectifying, the disparity between the representation of women and ethnic minorities in the House of Commons and their representation in the UK population at large; and to consider such other matters as might, by agreement; be referred for consideration&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000015"></a>The conference is expected to report its recommendations in 2009. The first such conference, in 1916-17, secured cross-party agreement on the principle that women should have the right to vote. It led to the Representation of the People Act 1918, which extended the right to vote to women over 30 years of age. If the recommendations of this present conference are as powerful as those of the 1916-17 one were, we should expect great things.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000016"></a>In a recent announcement, my right honourable friend Harriet Harman MP, the Minister for Women and Equalities, spoke of the setting-up of a national  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC33"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>equality panel, which will gather and examine data from the last 10 years, as well as using current information, and will commission new research where necessary. It aims to provide an analysis of how equality trends have changed over the last 10 years, mapping out exactly where gaps have narrowed or widened in society. When the report is published in late 2009, it should give us a better idea of how equal our society is, and I hope that we may get some solutions.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000017"></a>However much legislation is brought in, government cannot do everything in terms of changing attitudes. It is difficult to deal with the prejudice in some people&#146;s minds against equality for women; they are bound up by their own culture and prejudice. Would it make a difference, I wonder, if boys and girls were from an early age taught mutual respect in a gender-free style? Girls and boys should be taught that they are capable of doing whatever they wish. No doors should be closed because of gender. Does my noble friend the Leader of the House think that this could be achieved?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000018"></a>Many countries now use a quota system to ensure that women are elected and that has proved to be successful in bringing more women into public life. Could we use such a system in the UK? I think that that is worth looking at. We should learn from other countries that have tried to tackle the underrepresentation of women in political life.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000019"></a>There are so many women with the talent, ability and merit to rise to the top, but they are not allowed to get there because of cultural attitudes in organisations and of individuals. Changing attitudes is a lot harder than changing the law. The glass ceiling is there, unseen but obvious. When Hillary Clinton made her speech conceding to Barack Obama, she said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08103038000115"></a>&#147;Although we weren&#146;t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it&#146;s got about 18 million cracks in it, and the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000020"></a>That is what it is all about. Each one of us can make a difference in whatever field we work in. We can make a difference and make it easier for the next women who come along. It is a long path that we have to travel, but perhaps, with the help of a sympathetic Government, we can make that road less bumpy for the next generation of women. I look forward to the response from my noble friend the Leader of the House.</p>
<h5><a name="08103038000118"></a>2.10 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08103038000021"></a><a name="81030-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81030-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08103038000131"></a>Baroness Pitkeathley:</b> I thank my noble friend for securing this debate and for giving us the opportunity to focus on an issue that is dear to the hearts of so many of us, as women and as parliamentarians. We are mostly people who became parliamentarians as a result of participating in public life. I endorse the comments of my noble friend in validating the steps taken by the Labour Government to increase the participation of women. Your Lordships&#146; House, as only one example, is a very different place in composition and, I venture to suggest, in culture since I first entered in 1997. Much of that change is due to the increased number and participation of our women Peers.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC34"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000022"></a>I also acknowledge the commitment of the Civil Service and local authorities to encouraging women. Only last week, the Women in Public Life Awards were launched for this year; the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, has been a recipient in the past. I think that there was a series of stamps with women&#146;s heads on them indicating the success of some women in public life. The Cabinet Secretary puts time into this. We have seen some increase in the number of women councillors, while the voluntary sector is famous for its women leaders. And yet, and yet. Any glance at the numbers shows us that progress is painfully slow. There are fewer women as permanent secretaries than there were five years ago and, even in the voluntary sector, where huge numbers of women work, the number at the top, as chief executives or chairs, is very small.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000023"></a>We must conclude, as my noble friend has done, that the problem is more cultural than structural. That is what I will focus on in my brief time today. I shall highlight two aspects of culture, both of which can be found in women themselves and in wider societal attitudes. The first is the reluctance of women to put themselves forward. We all know&#151;do we not?&#151;that an ambitious man is tough, hard and focused on success, whereas an ambitious woman is strident, shrill and unfeminine. Of course that is not true, but those images are firmly embedded. Moreover, women are usually good at negotiation rather than confrontation and are often relaxed about letting someone else take the credit that is rightfully theirs. I see nods from noble Lords. Women know that that is the way to get things done, but it does not always get you noticed by those who can advance and promote you.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000024"></a>Moreover, the media focus on the personal is considerably more off-putting to women than to men. Whatever our personal views of Hillary Clinton or Sarah Palin, I doubt that any of us would condone the attention paid to the colour of the one&#146;s trouser suit or the shape of the other&#146;s spectacles. I do not remember the husband of a Prime Minister being pilloried or praised for the cut of his suit or the type of shoes that he wore to hear his wife&#146;s speech to a party conference. Is it any wonder that women may be reluctant to enter politics, when the Home Secretary is judged more by the shape of her neckline than by the quality of her argument?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000025"></a>The other area to which I want to draw your Lordships&#146; attention is how poor we are at acknowledging the transferability of skills and experience from one field of life into another. Women who have taken time off to bring up a family often report huge difficulty in convincing an employer that their time has been profitably spent and that it has developed, rather than stultified, their skills. Any woman who has run a household, managed a budget and organised after-school activities, while cooking the dinner and setting up a package of care for her elderly mother, has all the skills and more to be an efficient manager. That is leaving aside all the negotiation that she has done as a matter of course with the school, the surgery, the local authority and the Inland Revenue. Yet how often is that acknowledged, not least by women themselves, who do not know how to package up the skills so as to look good on the CV, or how to fill in the application form in a way that is sufficiently economical with the truth to get her an  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC35"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>interview, a skill at which most men are adept? Even when you are well established in public life, it is difficult to get anyone to see that skills learnt in one part of life are easily transferable to another. Many of us around this Table have had that experience.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000026"></a>Addressing such entrenched attitudes is the next stage of development in our crusade to get more women into public life. We must start early. I commend the Lord Speaker&#146;s programme and all colleagues who work with schools. We must develop the best possible role models and encourage women who are successful in public life to sponsor others&#151;our daughters, our granddaughters, our younger colleagues. We must be prepared to undertake what can be the most rewarding, as well as the most challenging, of occupations.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000027"></a>We should, of course, challenge sexist attitudes where we find them but, like most women, I have found the carrot rather more effective than the stick when it comes to culture change. The rewards of encouraging women into public service should always be emphasised, using the wealth of talent available and encouraging flexibility in the workforce&#151;I seek assurance from my noble friend the Leader of the House that the current economic situation will not discourage us from doing that. Above all, we must seek to develop the acknowledgement of the strength and relevance for the whole of our population of encouraging more women.</p>

<p><a name="08103038000030"></a>Today I shall focus on what has been done and is being done to interest girl children&#151;and boy children&#151;and encourage them to have the confidence, inspiration and information to get involved in public life when they are older, points touched on by my noble friends who have just spoken. In doing this I shall refer to two things: first, encouraging young people to visit Parliament and having parliamentarians visit schools; and, secondly, the importance of developing self-esteem in schoolchildren, helped by personal, social and health education.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000031"></a>I was excited last week by the launch of the parliamentary educational website. It is well worth a visit. I have it here in front me here&#151;not the website, the books. The Parliamentary Education Service has expanded enormously and is doing a great job of letting schools and young people know about its services. I was also excited last week by the fact that personal, social and health education is to be a compulsory part of the curriculum for all children at last. The aims of the Parliamentary Education Service are to inform young people about the role, work and history of Parliament; to engage young people in understanding  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC36"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the relevance of Parliament and democracy through active learning; and to empower young people to get involved by equipping them with the knowledge and skills to take part.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000032"></a>The DVD and booklet for schools are called <I>You</I><I>&#146;ve Got the Power</I>. What a splendid message for young people to receive about involvement in public life. Some of the areas covered are: using your vote; MPs and Lords; debating and voting in a parliamentary way; and influences on the UK Government. There is much more. The Parliamentary Education Service provides resources for schools, encourages visits to Parliament and organises student parliaments where schools can prepare a debate and carry it out in Westminster. There are 10 of these each year. Teacher training workshops in schools, videoconferencing and visits by Peers and MPs are also organised.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000033"></a>Why is all this important? Many young people, not just girls, are simply not aware of, and not interested in, government at a local or national level. Unless that attitude is addressed, they will grow up disaffected and may not participate, either by getting involved in government or public life or by voting. If we catch them early, that cycle may be broken. They, particularly girls, need to feel that Parliament and governance belong to them. When I take school groups around Parliament, which I do fairly frequently, I always stop at the statue of Viscount Falkland in St Stephen&#146;s Hall. That, of course, is where the suffragette, Marjory Hume, chained herself to Falkland&#146;s sword and was dragged off by the police, breaking the sword, which is now repaired but still shows the crack. What better reason for saying that every woman should vote? This always makes a great impression on children.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000034"></a>I move on to personal, social and health education, which will now be compulsory in schools and will have its own curriculum&#151;of course we already have citizenship education. PSHE is not about sex and drugs for five year-olds, as some media imply; rather, it is a serious attempt by the Government to give young people information at the appropriate age about their bodies and about relationships. But it is not just about information; it is also about exploring values and attitudes towards other people and encouraging honest and open relationships. I like what one young person said about their sex education:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08103038000116"></a>&#147;I understand the science side pretty well, but it seems a bit like a pencil&#151;I know it&#146;s made from wood and graphite that gets broken off, but does that tell me how to write?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08103038000111"></a>The analogy is clear. We have a duty to ensure that every young person is emotionally, socially and politically articulate and educated.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000035"></a>I have spoken briefly about two aspects of education that I think are important in developing the confidence and involvement of young people. Can my noble friend reassure us that the Government will continue to support such education for boys and girls?</p>

How are black women faring in the equality stakes in the two areas highlighted by the debate?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000037"></a>Before repeating the statistics that I have gleaned from the second <I>Sex and Power</I> report, which has already been quoted in the debate, I want to share a brief anecdote. When I was sitting in the Tube with two women colleagues recently, the conversation veered towards the discrimination against women still in existence. My colleagues concluded that women have a long way to go because men have so cleverly constructed a society for their own benefit and comfort. At that point I interjected, &#147;Consider yourselves lucky. You only have to deal with gender discrimination. In my case it is double discrimination, both race and gender&#148;. They looked at me and said, &#147;Well&#148;, and there ended the conversation.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000038"></a>That incident has prompted me to repeat some statistics from the 30-page <I>Sex and Power</I> report. On page 16, 11 lines are devoted to ethnic minority women. The report states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08103038000117"></a>&#147;The glass ceiling is low for most and lower for some&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08103038000112"></a>I also gleaned the following statistics. There are only two black women MPs, eight black women Peers, no black women AMs and no black women MSPs. Only eight black women are directors of FTSE 100 companies and we have one black woman High Court judge. Given that Britain is changing, it beggars belief how slowly the wheels are turning. Population statistics show that four-fifths of the growth in the working-age population in the UK comes from ethnic minorities. It appears that the workplace, company boards and Parliament have not kept up with the significant implications for the way in which Britain works. If there are not enough black women around the boardroom table or in Parliament, will there ever be change?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000039"></a>I believe that there has to be change. Britain must wake up and encourage more black women of talent to compete equitably for places in public life. It also begs the question: is Britain failing not only its black women but the whole of the black community? Can Britain afford the luxury of doing this, or is our country losing out?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000040"></a>I know that the Leader of the House is currently encouraging black women to be engaged in the system. Is she engaging the women who can really help? Unlearning racism is an art. Most very nice people are racist and do not even know it. To move the dialogue forward, we need to be careful when choosing the women who will advise&#151;women who have succeeded despite racism in the institutions and who are capable of moving others to realise what is actually happening and how subtle it is.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000041"></a>There is no place for discrimination of any kind in the 21st century. Several changes must take place. Dynamic women and men must embrace this time of recession visibly to encourage women, whatever their colour, to work in areas that seem to be held for men and to say no to the inflexible approach to work.</p>

I pay tribute to her tireless efforts in this area, but do so with fatigue and anger. Like many people around this Table, I have spent more than 30 years arguing and making precisely the points that are being made today. Progress has been dismally little. It is time for radical action. It is time for us to find the political will to make real and fundamental change, because we are wasting the resources of our country. Because of the innate sexism in our system, we are wasting the money that we spend on girls&#146; education and we are wasting the opportunities that we provide for them.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000043"></a>We will overcome this only by having a system of quotas that ensures that equal numbers of men and women participate. The Government, who have made all-women shortlists lawful, could quite easily say that there will be all-women shortlists in all public appointments, particularly for leadership positions, until there are equal numbers of men and women holding public appointments.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000044"></a>Our plcs should be required to have equal numbers of men and women on their boards. Until we become accustomed to seeing women in leadership positions, we will never achieve true equality. We have spent years touching around the edges, with training schemes and with opportunities here and opportunities there. It has not worked.</p>

<p><a name="08103038000045"></a>I do not intend to take up my whole four minutes. I simply want to make this point as forcefully as I can: it is time for real action, not simply the sort of thing that makes people feel good and feel as though they are doing something when what they are doing actually changes nothing. I donate my remaining two minutes to my colleagues.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000047"></a>I shall say something about the work that I am doing with the Government&#146;s task force and something about my own work. Having just come from America, I have become convinced that we need to shout more about the work that we do, because none of us knows enough about the work that many of our colleagues are doing to promote women&#146;s participation in every way.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000048"></a>I have not written a speech. Instead, I Googled &#147;British women&#148; an hour ago. The first thing that came up was about how American women are more attractive than British women. Then it says, &#147;British history&#148;; then it says something about British women and our opinions about Palin. The mind boggles at what &#163;150,000 could have done to my image with a little bit of attention from the British media. I will let you wonder, but I do not think that achieving equality is so simple. Then comes women suffragettes. I stopped there because I thought, &#147;This is going to be really depressing&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC39"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="08103038000049"></a>Then I Googled &#147;British Muslim women&#148;. What can I tell you? The results were about how single Muslim women are dating, about how attractive or not the girls are and about preventing extremism. There was nothing about power, representation or participation. Then there was something about Muslim voices. I say this because that is the position of women in the public arena; the position of minority women, in particular, is nowhere.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000050"></a>I am pleased to be able to chair the task force, which is encouraging women. It is a cross-party task force and I urge all my colleagues to support it. I have just come from a women&#146;s event where there were a number of women Ministers, but no reference was made to the work that the Labour Government are undertaking. It is a very successful cross-party effort; I am making my best efforts to ensure that we go beyond party politics and encourage all women.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000051"></a>About a week ago, we were in Birmingham, undertaking a successful event as part of encouraging more women to come forward. Often we hear that not enough ethnic minority women are interested in or capable of coming forward and taking part in public life. I have done work for the Government chairing various task forces and groups on women and women&#146;s position and I know that that is not true. I am really pleased that once again we are proving that there is no shortage of such women. There were more than 200 women saying, &#147;Yes, I want to be this&#148;, &#147;I want to be a magistrate&#148;, &#147;I want to be a Member of Parliament&#148;, and even, &#147;I want to be in the Lords&#148;. Despite the democratic deficit elsewhere, we have done quite a lot to make up for what is lacking in the democratic process.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000052"></a>I was really pleased with the ambition that many of those women demonstrated, but ambition is not enough, because of the lack of opportunities. I echo what my noble friend Lady Kingsmill just said: we must take radical action and acknowledge each other&#146;s work. Only by strengthening what we are doing can we come out of this quagmire, this devastating position. Even the Labour Government have become somewhat complacent, having achieved that remarkable progress back in 1997.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000053"></a>Is my noble friend Lady Royall satisfied with the changes that have been made? Does she recognise that many of us, including me, have been tireless in the campaign? What will she do to ensure that that is acknowledged in the public arena? How will she encourage minority women and make sure that opportunities are real, not just about a task force or profligate comments about how we are doing everything that we can? That is no longer good enough. Every ounce of our effort must be made to show that we mean what we say, which is that we believe in equality. I apologise for going over five minutes.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000055"></a>In spite of persistent pressure, anti-discrimination laws and the Labour Party&#146;s commitment, the representation of women in our public life remains deeply disappointing. Let me give the Committee some basic facts about not only politics but other areas of life. In politics, as we have already been told, 20 per cent of MPs are women; women make up 19.7 per cent of the House of Lords, although an outsider may be forgiven for thinking that the proportion is much larger, partly because, I am told, women tend to attend more often and for longer hours than men. Twenty-six per cent of Cabinet Ministers are women, as are 20 per cent of candidates in parliamentary elections. Of public appointments, 36 per cent go to women. Although I do not have exact statistics, I am told that about 30 per cent of higher honours in the honours list go to women. Women make up 9.26 per cent of High Court judges and 26 per cent of senior civil servants. Public life appointments speak for themselves.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000056"></a>In education, 8 per cent of vice-chancellors are women. There should be no discrimination in the appointment of deans and heads of department, but only about 19 per cent are women. In the economy, 11 per cent of directors of FTSE 100 companies are women and, of senior managers and people in high positions, about 18 per cent are women. In the media, women make up 16 per cent of senior editors and programme organisers and 30 per cent of senior columnists and journalists. I can think of hardly any walk of life, other than magistrates, where the proportion of women broadly corresponds to their proportion in the population.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000057"></a>The position is even bleaker in respect of ethnic minorities, who make up 0.3 per cent of MPs, 1.4 per cent of Peers and 0.9 per cent of councillors. This need not be. In other countries the figures are in some respects much better. In Sweden, the Netherlands and even South Africa the figures for the representation of women in Parliament are closer to the proportion in the population. But in universities and the media, the situation is just as disappointing. I cannot think of any country that sets an example to us in all walks of life.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000058"></a>The question is: what do we do? Different factors are responsible in different areas. It is no use trying to think of one answer that will work in all areas of life. Therefore, we will need different strategies for underrepresentation in politics, in academia, in the media and so on.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000059"></a>We need to think more carefully about two or three things. First, women are underrepresented partly because of their conditions of work, such as inflexible working hours, lack of childcare facilities, irregular hours of work and promotion policies that take no account of breaks in service.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000060"></a>Another factor concerns masculine culture and ethos. Just as I almost felt intimidated in the company of only female Peers, I can understand easily how women would feel in an all-male environment, as I can vouchsafe as a vice-chancellor and as a head of department. The ethos tends to be such that people feel intimidated.  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC41"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Thus there is a vicious circle. We need more women&#151;a critical mass&#151;to break the ethos, but we will not be able to do that unless there are more women in the first instance.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000061"></a>Finally, in public life, we need to bear in mind media stereotypes. As one of my colleagues said, the media are far more invasive and more personalised in their comments about women. I can easily understand why women would feel reluctant to expose themselves and their private lives to media scrutiny and allow their personal integrity to be violated by these kinds of aggressively invasive media, which seem to single out women far more than men.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000062"></a>A profound cultural revolution needs to take place. The law can take us only so far. History teaches us one lesson: it is easier to tackle all areas of discrimination in the first instance, when the Government enact the law, but, once law reaches its limits and cultural changes are required, things become more difficult.</p>

<p><a name="08103038000063"></a><a name="81030-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81030-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08103038000138"></a>Baroness Goudie:</b> I thank my noble friend Lady Gale for securing this debate. I will not go over the statistics or arguments put forward by some of my colleagues. Since 1997, we have had three Labour Governments, with two enlightened Prime Ministers, Prime Minister Blair and Prime Minister Brown, and an enlightened European Commission. Life has changed enormously for women in this country, although perhaps not as much as we would like.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000064"></a>I disagree on one point: the quota system. I have been very lucky never to have had to deal with the quota system. I was elected as a local authority councillor by an all-male union, the Post Office union, as it was then, and then I had other appointments. However, that was in the days when there was change.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000065"></a>People talk about quotas here and in other countries. There are quotas in countries that have been at war or where women have never stood for the parliament. To persuade those countries to have women standing for parliament, you had to have the quota system. The figures that are often quoted about high numbers of women in parliament following wars are for Afghanistan, Rwanda, other African countries and Northern Ireland. Those countries have quota systems because women there sat outside the peace talks&#151;they are doing it now in Darfur&#151;and they sat there until they were allowed to come to the peace table. Part of the deal with the UN and other countries involved in getting peace in those countries was that women became members of parliament there.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000066"></a>Figures are bandied about showing that there are more women in parliament in such countries, as is true, and that is because quotas were put in place to get women in parliament to make sure that peace was brokered and kept. When you have women at the brink of peace, they can stop a lot of what is happening. Women have stopped suicide bombers and women will continue to ensure that we have peace in this world. I feel strongly about quotas.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000067"></a>When you have women in power, as we have today, they can make a difference in three areas. By making a difference, we can bring other women into public life.  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>First, there is the economic situation; secondly, there is the political situation; and, thirdly, there is the human rights situation. We can make a positive difference in those areas if we encourage women by example and through education. We must ensure that teachers in teacher training colleges understand that women have the right to attain any position that they want. Wherever they come from, we should ensure that women are told at school and thereafter, &#147;You have a right&#148;. We have to change the political situation in the political parties. We should be saying to our colleagues in the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, the Liberal Democrats and other parties that they must change their system of how they elect people at every level.</p>

<p><a name="08103038000068"></a>In the same way, we should try to become part of every situation to elect or appoint women. Women are bad to women. Looking at the number of women in public life and at public appointments, we see that women do not select women. The same goes for women headhunters. They ring me up about positions and say, &#147;What about so and so?&#148;. When I ask whom they have on the shortlist, I find that they do not have a woman on it. We should be encouraging headhunters to have women on their shortlists. If they do not know about the women whom we are talking about, we should be saying to them, &#147;These are the women who should be brought to the table&#148;.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000069"></a>Women can also make a change in skills and training. That is why we should be on the skills and training boards and why we should be part of ensuring that women can attain these skills. We need women in engineering and in science, which have the lowest numbers of women training. Women have a right to be there.</p>

<p><a name="08103038000070"></a>If you invest in women, you invest in the rest of the world. The best thing that you can do with such money is to invest in women; they are the best workforce. In countries that invest in women, such as our country, the GDP goes up. When women in the workforce enjoy where they are working, they stay there and you do not have constant change. Working women can educate their sons to respect women and to be on equal terms.</p>

We all congratulate her on that and we all know of her huge contribution there.

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000072"></a>Years ago, I played a bit part in the then recently founded Liberal Democrats as the person organising the selection process for candidates in the English party, which is, of course, by far the biggest of the three parties making up our joint party. I became increasingly aware that the problem for women is not so much getting elected, because women tend to attract more voters than men overall, but getting selected. I was quite amazed by the number of excuses that could be made by the chairs of committees: &#147;Of course I am  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC43"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>absolutely in favour of more women in Parliament, but this constituency is too big, too small, too rich, too poor, too urban, too black, too white&#148;. Any reason that you could think of was a good reason for not promoting the woman who had to be on the shortlist&#151;we have, or we had in those days, a vague quota system.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000073"></a>Perhaps we should not be surprised that the current proportion of women in the House of Commons is only 20 per cent, but it is an absolute disgrace after 90 years of voting for women and women being allowed to become Members. Incidentally, in 1906, when Finland escaped from Russian control, it gave women the right to vote and the right to stand in its first parliament, to which women were indeed elected. We have a long way to go in some ways.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000074"></a>I was sad to note that the same sort of poor proportion applies in local government, albeit a little better than in the House of Commons&#151;30 per cent rather than 20 per cent. I have quite long experience in local government of various forms. In my experience, women have been brilliant chairs of committees, excellent leaders of councils and very good at heading hospital committees and school governing bodies. Where would school governing bodies be if there were no women? They would not be filled. Those are all important positions in public life.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000075"></a>Why do we care whether there are more women, fewer women or not enough women in Parliament? There are two reasons. Women are today at least as well educated as men; indeed, they are probably slightly better educated and more successful in the educational process than men. Why are we not profiting from the input that we have made as a society into women&#146;s improvement in education by ensuring that they are promoted in the right way? It is a real sadness that in big companies there are fewer women in the governing bodies than there were a few years ago. Things are not getting better in that field; they are getting worse.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000076"></a>Also, women&#146;s perspective on life is not the same as men&#146;s. They do things in a different way&#151;a way that men find unsympathetic. If you get five women together talking about something, they say, &#147;Oh, that&#146;s a good idea, we&#146;ll do that&#148;. Within 10 or 15 minutes, you have the beginning of a plan to address the problem. It is much less formal; it is much less about, &#147;He&#146;s the boss and I&#146;m his inferior&#148;. We do not think in that way, especially in this House, where, by definition, we are all equal.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000077"></a>Women could contribute to better legislation and better administration by bringing some of those feminine ways of doing things, based on good education, alongside the male way of doing things. If I could give the Government one word of advice&#151;I know that they will not accept it&#151;it would be to introduce proportional representation. Do not laugh. The best way of getting more women into elected bodies is to have proportional representation.</p>

I am especially pleased to speak, as I have spent 40 years championing the promotion of women. I have never been obsessed by equality of numbers. It is a useful tool but, like the noble Baroness, Lady Kingsmill, I have been motivated by thinking of the wealth of talent that the country is missing out on.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000079"></a>As has been said, this year marks the 90th anniversary of some women first being granted suffrage in this country. Like my colleague in another place, the shadow Minister for Women and Equalities, Theresa May, I firmly believe that we must use the anniversary of women&#146;s suffrage as an opportunity to promote further discussion on how to improve the role of women in politics in the UK and internationally.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000080"></a>It was not until 1918 that women aged 30 or older were allowed to vote and to stand for Parliament and not until 1928 that women had the vote on the same basis as men. The wheels of change grind slowly indeed and we must maintain our determination to see men and women equally represented in public life. I understand that the UK is ranked 51st equal in the world and 13th in the European Union&#151;not a happy place to be. The picture is only slightly better away from Westminster. The proportion of women in the Scottish Parliament is 33 per cent and the proportion in local government is about 29 per cent. Only in the National Assembly for Wales, as the noble Baroness pointed out, does the proportion of women Members come close to genuine parity&#151;it is just under half.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000081"></a>It is worth saying that the Government may wish to start a little closer to home before they begin preaching to public bodies through the equality Bill. It saddens me to say that they have failed to tackle the significant glass ceiling in the Civil Service. Across all departments, women fill only 31 per cent of senior Civil Service positions. In the worst-offending departments, such as the MoD, they fill as few as 13 per cent of senior positions. On top of this, the gender pay gap in government departments is significantly higher than the national average of 17.2 per cent. In the Treasury, the pay gap is a staggering 26 per cent. In the MoD, it is 22 per cent. Clearly this needs to be rectified. The Government need to get their own house in order to be credible.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000082"></a>We need not heed the words of those who say that there is no need for positive action to redress the balance when eight out of 10 Members of Parliament are men. We should not listen to those who argue that positive action invalidates the achievement of those who benefit from it. We completely disagree with these arguments. As the Leader of the Opposition, who has done so much to begin to usher in the necessary changes in the Conservative Party, has said, it is about political effectiveness. To create effective policy, we must involve those who are affected by it. We should all take notice of those words as we consider what can be done to increase the participation of women in public life. We must continue in our determination to reach our goal.</p>

I pay tribute to her especially for the way in which she changed the gender landscape in politics in Wales, because it is largely thanks to her that we have what we have in the Welsh Assembly.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000084"></a>I am also delighted that my noble friend Lord Parekh has spoken this afternoon; he is right to say that this becomes a ghettoised issue, when it is important for men as well as women in our society. We must deploy the talents of all society, not just 50 per cent of it.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000085"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, rightly told us that 2008 is a year of anniversaries for women. We have reached other milestones, too. My noble friend Lady Ashton is the first UK female Commissioner and, this year, Manjula Sood became the first Asian woman lord mayor in the UK. We celebrate these achievements, but progress is shamefully slow.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000086"></a>I share the anger and frustration at the fact that the glass ceiling is still there, albeit now cracked as a result in this country of many of the Government&#146;s policies. Women face too many barriers to entering public life and senior positions more generally. These barriers include caring responsibilities, the culture of institutions such as Parliament, and low confidence. However, as many noble Lords have said, changing the culture is critical. It is vital that we all work together to overcome these barriers.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000087"></a>One way to overcome the barriers is through education. Like my noble friend Lady Massey, I pay tribute to the educational outreach of this House. The teaching of citizenship is, of course, important, but the fact that more girls now go on to higher education gives me most hope that my daughter&#146;s generation and those that follow will succeed where we are failing. Education brings confidence and gives girls self-esteem. I wholeheartedly agree with the need for gender-neutral education.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000088"></a>Young people have many opportunities both at school and outside to engage in political activities, such as on school councils and the UK Youth Parliament. It is encouraging that, in 2006, 53 per cent of the UK Youth Parliament&#146;s members were female. My noble friend Lady Pitkeathley rightly said that we have to educate women in packaging their skills. I will write to her, and copy the letter to all noble Lords present, about some excellent examples.</p>

<p><a name="08103038000089"></a>We need women in key decision-making positions. We need them on public boards, in our institutions and on primary care trusts. We need them everywhere. What better way is there to ensure that the health needs of a whole community are met than by having women on PCT boards?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000090"></a>We know that democracy is stronger when it is fully representative. We have heard about the House of Lords and the House of Commons. It is shameful that we have only two black female MPs and that there has never been an Asian female MP. My noble friend Lady Howells was right to cite double discrimination. It is not acceptable. All women, including black and ethnic minority women, want to have a say in decisions made locally and nationally.</p>

<p><a name="08103038000091"></a>Many noble Lords have spoken about the shamefully snail&#146;s-pace progress outlined in the Equality and Human Rights Commission document. This Government are committed to increasing women&#146;s representation in political and public life. The Government have taken action&#151;I will have to circulate a lot of information on the action that they have taken. The equality Bill is coming up, which will be an important means of redressing some of the power balance. But, at this time of economic downturn, it is especially important that we continue to act on these issues. In the past, women have been hit disproportionately in economic downturns. We must not let that happen now.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000092"></a>Democracy must be nourished at its roots. It is vital to consider decision-making at a local level. In December 2007, the Councillors Commission published a report on the barriers and incentives to standing as a local councillor. It highlighted the need for a more diverse pool of people holding these roles. At the moment, women make up 29.3 per cent of local councillors, of whom only 1 per cent are black, Asian or from an ethnic minority. I am delighted that my noble friend Lady Uddin chairs the local task force about which she told us.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000093"></a>The Government are supporting many initiatives, such as the FTSE 100 cross-mentoring scheme, which aims to increase the pool of eligible senior female candidates for board positions. As noble Lords have said, it is good that many women now want to come forward, as seems to be the case in the task force, but we also have to provide the opportunities.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000094"></a>In this House, we have some extraordinary women who have overcome the barriers. In addition to being Peers, they run families and organisations. They are on the boards of companies, charities, voluntary organisations et cetera. Not only should we be proud of these women, but we should use them whenever and wherever possible as role models to nurture and foster change in our society, so that the full participation of women in public life becomes the norm rather than the exception. I believe that that is our duty. The challenge that we have discussed today is an issue not only for the present but also for future generations, who need to see role models in these positions so that they can be inspired to step forward.</p>

An estimated 10 per cent of people with asthma&#151;that is, 450,000 in England, including me&#151;have difficulty controlling asthma, which impacts significantly on their health, life chances and quality of life.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000099"></a>This Government have delivered some real improvements for people with asthma. In particular, the smoking ban allows us to work and socialise in smoke-free environments and will help to reduce the impact of asthma in the future. But we must not be complacent. Asthma UK has estimated that, with correct asthma management, up to 90 per cent of deaths from asthma, and up to 75 per cent of hospital admissions due to asthma attacks, could be prevented.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000100"></a>Today I want to highlight the fact that much more needs to be done and to urge the Government to focus on driving up standards of asthma care and treatment by introducing a national clinical strategy for asthma. Many people assume that asthma is not serious because it should be possible to control in most cases, and most people have little conception of what an asthma attack is like. But asthma is serious. On average, one person dies from asthma every seven hours in the UK. Hospital admissions for asthma are increasing, having previously declined. Too many people suffer in silence with symptoms that are bad enough to cause them difficulty sleeping and to interfere with their usual activities. An Asthma UK survey of more than 1,000 people with asthma found that 69 per cent of people did not have their asthma under control as defined by Royal College of Physicians standards.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000101"></a>Asthma UK&#146;s recent <I>Wish You Were Here?</I> report identified a postcode lottery in hospital admissions. Most shockingly, children living in Liverpool have an almost eight times higher chance of emergency hospital admission for asthma than children living in Richmond and Twickenham. Asthma is one of the top five causes of emergency hospital admissions among children in England. The knock-on effect can be severe, particularly if children have to miss school through asthma attacks and frequent appointments with specialists. Without adequate support, asthma damages their life chances.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000102"></a>The postcode lottery also applies to people of all ages living in neighbouring areas. There is almost a threefold difference in admissions between adjacent PCTs. Afro-Caribbeans are twice as likely, and south Asians three times as likely, as white people to end up in hospital with an asthma attack, despite small differences in the rates of asthma within these communities. Outcomes are worse in poorer areas, with 86 per cent of spearhead PCTs having higher than average emergency admissions for asthma.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000103"></a>An asthma attack is a frightening and distressing experience, not only for the patient but also for their family. A person&#146;s chances of accessing treatment good enough to put an end to the attack and keep them out of hospital should not depend largely on where they live. However, we should be optimistic about what, after improvements, the NHS could achieve through a sustained focus on asthma.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000104"></a>A survey showed that 20 per cent of nurses with lead responsibility for respiratory care have no accredited training in asthma. People with asthma say that the  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC48"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>lack of specialist nurses affects quality of care. A national strategy could address this. Only a quarter of people with asthma say that they have a written personal asthma action plan setting out the treatment plan that they have agreed with their doctor and telling them when to seek help. As patients are four times more likely to have an emergency admission without one, these plans need to be part of a clear set of national standards. Anecdotal evidence suggests that asthma reviews, as required by the Quality and Outcomes Framework, often take place without basic checks on peak flow and inhaler technique. Indeed, some GPs do not know the correct way to use an inhaler. Clearly, a stronger focus is needed on getting asthma care right.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000105"></a>An acute NHS health trust report highlighted difficulties both in identifying patients who are frequently admitted with asthma attacks and in following people up after hospital admissions. Healthcare professionals with a special interest in asthma and respiratory conditions report that the clinical asthma guidelines developed by the British Thoracic Society are still not widely used. They also say that asthma-specific recommendations in the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services, published four years ago, are not being widely implemented. This may help to explain why asthma is still one of the top five causes of emergency admissions among children.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000106"></a>Although there is clear need for improvement, there are also some fantastic initiatives that could make a huge difference if there was a national strategy to replicate them elsewhere. Following funding provided by Asthma UK, Liverpool PCT, which has the highest admissions for asthma in England, is developing a whole-systems approach involving all the relevant organisations, including the PCT, the local authority and the local education authority, to improve standards and quality of care for people with asthma. The approach aims to empower both people with asthma and healthcare professionals to manage asthma effectively and improve the quality of services provided, with the overall aim of reducing emergency hospital admissions for asthma in Liverpool. Neighbouring PCTs in Oldham and Knowsley have recently joined in this major initiative in the north-west of England.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000107"></a>It costs three and a half times as much to treat someone who has an asthma attack as it does to care for someone whose asthma is well managed. That is important. Surely the money wasted on preventable emergency admissions would be better spent getting asthma management right, quite apart from the distress to patients and their families, which can and should be avoided.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08103038000108"></a>Despite all the problems that I have spoken about today, I remain optimistic that we can drive up standards of asthma management to the level of the very best. Huge gains can be made, but that will happen only if the NHS makes asthma a sustained priority. This focus must include a national clinical strategy for asthma to drive up standards of asthma care, rather than the current patchwork of poorly implemented standards and guidelines.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000002"></a>I was privileged to sit with the noble Viscount on the Science and Technology Committee when we produced the report on allergy, which was published just over a year ago and debated in this House on 8 May this year. The report was useful and the Government&#146;s response has been encouraging, but the required action needs more time and more money.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000003"></a>I shall not repeat too many figures, but they are important. About 20 million children and adults in the UK suffer from a form of allergy. More than 5 million of them have asthma, of which 1.1 million are children. Between April 2006 and March 2007, there were 67,077 emergency hospital admissions for people experiencing an asthma attack, 40 per cent of whom were children under 15. A simple allergy can be an early step on the allergic march towards much more serious allergies. The critical impact of allergy on health and the quality of life and its potential to cause fatalities, usually in older children and adolescents, should not be ignored. The prospects of unexpected allergic catastrophe or anaphylactic death are real for many families and should not be underestimated.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000004"></a>Good health and the ability to fight off disease are a function of the immune system. We read references daily to how that can be improved. It has been suggested that pregnant women who lead a sedentary lifestyle increase the risk of asthma for their children. Recent studies have shown that levels of vitamin D, which is found in food such as oily fish and is boosted by natural sunlight, can influence the development of a child&#146;s lungs and immune system while in the womb. There is increasing evidence that an infection with gut parasites may protect against asthma and allergy. A recent study, funded by Asthma UK, showed that children born to mothers who had a low intake of vitamin E during pregnancy were five times more likely to have asthma than children whose mothers had eaten a diet high in vitamin E. There is also a possible link between asthma and obesity. The number of people with both problems has soared in recent decades. There are many more possible links between asthma, diet, rubbish collection and storage, pets, environmental issues, pollution and regional variations; I would need a whole hour to myself to cover them all, but they all carry an increased risk to the respiratory system.</p>

<p><a name="08103039000005"></a>In 2007, a person was admitted to hospital every eight minutes because of their asthma. A possibly defective gene has been blamed. Scientists have identified a cold-fighting protein that asthmatics lack. The common cold triggers about 85 per cent of asthma attacks in children and 60 per cent of those in adults. We need accurate data, so I repeat the Science and Technology Committee&#146;s recommendation to the Department of Health, which was that the systemised nomenclature of medicine system, supported by appropriate training, should ensure efficacy as a simple, consistent classification system to record allergic disease, monitor its prevalence and inform the commissioning of allergic services.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000006"></a>Patients and the public should be better informed about allergy and allergic asthma. The ability to make an accurate diagnosis should be improved and there should be better, more specialised training for healthcare professionals. Poor knowledge of allergic conditions stems from the lack of an integrated and holistic approach to treatments. People with multiple allergies tend to see multiple specialists for multiple treatments, rather than a single allergy specialist.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000007"></a>There is a clear need for more research into the causes of allergy and asthma and into the clinical effectiveness of different forms of treatment. Work is proceeding on the definition of susceptibility genes for asthma and related phenotypes by positioning cloning approaches and recognising that pharmacogenetic approaches may be beneficial in managing patients. More diagnostic testing is needed, and services in both primary and secondary care should be improved. Only then will people with asthma and allergic conditions get the treatment that they need. I hope that the noble Viscount keeps up the good work.</p>

He was in this country from Germany with me. He longed for a normal life and he did everything that he could to have one. I longed for access to specialist care and the certainty that I could reach it if he had an attack. There were no specialists where we were and the GP did not have specialist knowledge.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000009"></a>One priority is to ensure that people have the name of a GP who specialises in asthma care. I think that only 13 per cent of people have the comfort of knowing that that is available. A survey has shown that 20 per cent of asthma nurses, who are expected to diagnose asthma and to give follow-up treatment without medical input, have not had accredited training. People with asthma have told us that the recent decline in the number of specialist asthma nurses has affected the quality of care that they receive. This is at a time when the number of people suffering from asthma is increasing rapidly. I hope that the Government will do something to make this a priority in the very near future.</p>

I hope that he feels well now, but I begin to wonder about my presence in the Chamber and that of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton. Whenever we are together, someone seems to have a medical emergency. Perhaps we should talk about this at some time.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000011"></a>When I was a child, the only I person I knew who had asthma was my best friend. Every winter, I spent many weeks sitting by her bedside, rather as I sat by the noble Viscount a few minutes ago, watching her struggle for breath after contracting a cold that had precipitated her asthma. We spent many hours playing board games in her bedroom. I have to say that that was when we were not in my bedroom playing board games, because I was confined to bed with recurrent ear infections following colds. We both suffered, but I do not think that anything was quite as bad as asthma. I am well aware of what it must be like.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000012"></a>We have all seen the increase in asthma. In my childhood, my friend was the only person I knew who had bad asthma, but among my children&#146;s generation there seemed to be huge numbers of children with asthma. On holiday in Spain as a teenager, one of my daughter&#146;s friends died in an asthma attack because she could not get to a hospital in time. That was not very long ago.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000013"></a>Nowadays, as we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, schoolteachers seem to have many children with asthma in each class. They are well aware of it. Asthma has certainly been on the increase: we are told that there are now two or three times as many sufferers as there were 50 years ago. No one is really sure of the reason for that, although the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, dealt with those aspects very adequately. It was interesting to hear him speak.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000014"></a>The smoking ban will help, as air pollution was always a factor. When I was a junior doctor and a GP, the fashionable thinking was that asthma was due to house mites. The increase in the number of cases of asthma has flattened recently and I wonder whether that is linked to the fashion for wooden floors as opposed to thick carpets. That may have contributed to the flattening of the graph for asthma.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000015"></a>Some 4.5 million people in this country have asthma, which is a lot of people. It is one of the most common long-term conditions that doctors and nurses have to deal with. Ten per cent of those 4.5 million people have very severe difficulties and very bad asthma. People may have seen the Royal College of Physicians survey, which says that 69 per cent of people with asthma do not have their symptoms under proper control. Some 38 per cent reported difficulty sleeping in the past month and 33 per cent reported interference with their usual activities in the past month. It is a serious, life-disrupting disease, with which people must live all their lives.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000016"></a>There were 1,199 deaths from asthma in 2006. That is more than the number of deaths from cervical cancer and testicular cancer combined. There have been many initiatives and a lot of publicity about cervical cancer and we are fortunate that the Government have made great strides and that the health service is doing a lot about it, but there are more deaths from   


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>asthma. It is a huge cost to the NHS in work and money&#151;an estimated &#163;16 billion a year and over 65,000 hospital admissions a year.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000017"></a>As we heard from the noble Viscount, people from the worst areas of Liverpool are more likely to go into hospital than are people in my former constituency of Richmond, which in some table or other once was regarded as the most highly educated and most well-off constituency in England. The reason why people there have better control of asthma is probably that patients&#146; parents and relatives and the patients themselves are so much more demanding and expect so much more in preventive care from clinicians.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000018"></a>What are some of the things that we should be doing to help those people? First, we need a personal action plan. It is terribly important that a doctor sits down with an asthmatic patient and works out what is going to happen to them and what they need. The noble Viscount clearly demonstrated that he has a personal action plan. He knows what to do and he does not need anyone to interfere. He knows that, if he does the right things, it will get better. Many people do not have that, but they need it. However, if that is to be the case, we will need many more specialist GPs and nurses in the community. Please, please can we have more training for doctors and nurses? In particular&#151;the Minister will know about this because I am always beefing on about it&#151;we need more community nurses who can deal with and have specialist training in long-term conditions. Asthma is one of them.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000019"></a>Every patient should have access to a personal care plan and to specialist GPs and nurses. They should be able to see a doctor who knows about the condition, whether or not that doctor is in their own practice. We also need a dedicated national strategic framework; every other country in the British Isles has one, but England does not. I know that things have been laid down on asthma in the children, young people and maternity services framework, but asthma is such a common long-term condition that it needs a strategic framework of its own. In some ways, it is great to have targets and frameworks, but the conditions that are left out get left behind, because PCTs and clinicians concentrate on the ones for which figures are collected. We must be very careful to ensure that asthma is not left out.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000020"></a>I have some questions for the Minister. What national initiatives are planned for the treatment of asthmatics? How will the Government deal with the postcode lottery that the noble Viscount mentioned, comparing Liverpool and Richmond, for example? When will we have a national strategic framework for asthma, together with training for doctors and nurses, so that people up and down the country, children and adults, can deal with their asthma, as has the noble Viscount this afternoon, and not have to be unnecessarily admitted to hospital?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000022"></a>The rate of childhood asthma is higher in England than almost anywhere else in the world. We can and should draw attention to the prevalence statistics, but it is perhaps even more important to talk about the reality of living with asthma, which the noble Viscount was perhaps too stoical to refer to in any graphic detail, but which, as many of us will know from our families and friends, can be truly miserable and often an extremely frightening part of daily living.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000023"></a>Service provision is, I fear, a lottery; Asthma UK has published unequivocal data to demonstrate that. One of the main markers of that lottery is hospital admissions, where we see a vast disparity between different regions of the country, not least where it comes to children. The chances of a child being hospitalised for asthma as an emergency admission is more than twice as high in the north-west than it is in the east of England. In the east Midlands, on the other hand, the rate is 21 per cent below the average. Those disparities cannot simply be attributed to socio-economic factors; they must also reflect differences in service provision. Quite rightly, Asthma UK has been urging the Government and the NHS to do something about that.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000024"></a>Part of the problem&#151;in fact, a major part, as the noble Viscount mentioned&#151;is the absence of national standards. Without such standards, patients are missing out in a big way, but the NHS is also missing out on millions of pounds in potential savings. Asthma UK tells me that asthma-related emergency hospital admissions cost the NHS &#163;61 million a year and that three-quarters of those admissions are avoidable. Even if it has exaggerated the scope for financial saving&#151;I do not think that it has&#151;we are still talking about tens of millions of pounds of unnecessary cost. Once someone has a serious asthma attack, the cost of looking after him is three and a half times more than if the attack had been prevented. As we have heard, there are 4.5 million people with asthma in England. More than two-thirds of asthmatics who were surveyed by Asthma UK said that their symptoms were not under control.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000025"></a>An NSF or national clinical strategy would benefit an awful lot of people. I understand that we are the only western or developed country that has nothing of that nature. The last that we heard in a Lords Parliamentary Answer was that an NSF was not even in development. Why is that? Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own guidelines and the British Thoracic Society has issued guidelines, so it should not be too big a step to produce a national clinical strategy for England.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000026"></a>As a start, we need to look at basic things such as personal asthma action plans. We know that where someone has one of those plans, setting out what treatment regime is appropriate to them and exactly when they should seek help, they are four times less likely to be admitted to hospital as an emergency case. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, told us,  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC54"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>only about a quarter of asthma patients have such a plan. The scope to improve asthma care is clearly considerable. It is clear that existing guidelines are just not doing the job.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000027"></a>There are particular difficulties with people who have severe asthma or asthma that is difficult to control. Acute trusts have told Asthma UK that they find it hard to identify patients who have been admitted to hospital on a frequent basis, which seems extraordinary. They also find it difficult to follow those people up after they have been to hospital.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000028"></a>I would be glad if the Minister could say something about specialist training in asthma for GPs and nurses. For many patients, access to an asthma specialist is difficult to achieve. Only 13 per cent of people with asthma have been offered the name of a GP specialising in asthma in their area. Asthma UK tells me that it is particularly concerned that many healthcare professionals who treat asthma have not had adequate training. The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, referred to the 2006 study by Education for Health and Edinburgh University, which found that 20 per cent of asthma nurses have not had any accredited training. Again, that seems most surprising. On top of that, there has been a decline in their numbers, which, not surprisingly, patients say has affected the quality of care that they receive. That is also something that an NSF could address.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000029"></a>Last year, as we heard from my noble friend, your Lordships&#146; Science and Technology Committee reported on the topic of allergy. Its approach to the subject was a general one but it made a number of recommendations on issues that directly relate to asthma. One was that there should be at least one allergy centre led by a full-time allergy specialist in each strategic health authority. It would be the job of the allergy centre to diagnose a patient&#146;s allergy and to develop a treatment plan. Once that had happened, the patient&#146;s condition would be managed back in the primary care setting. In reply, the Government promised to consider establishing a lead SHA and, in August this year, the north-west was approved as the first SHA to have an allergy centre. That is good news, but will the Minister confirm that, provided that the centre proves its worth, we can expect more of the same in other parts of the country?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000030"></a>A number of the public health messages on asthma have a marked similarity to those on obesity. Of course, it is not uncommon for the two conditions to coexist in one individual. Taking exercise and eating plenty of fruit and vegetables both improve lung function. Smoking is a universally bad thing to do if you are asthmatic and if there are others in your house who suffer from asthma, especially children. For me, this is one of the big arguments in favour of banning smoking in public places. Smoking in the presence of a child or while pregnant increases the chances of the child developing asthma. The same applies to stress during pregnancy and allowing children to swim in chlorinated swimming pools. There is some tentative evidence that children should not be given paracetamol in the first year of life; it has been associated with a 46 per cent increase in the risk of asthma symptoms at age six to seven. We should be hearing more of those kinds of public health messages coming from the NHS. It should not only be Asthma UK that is left to promulgate them.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC55"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000031"></a>There can be some serious asthma hazards in the workplace. A whole range of respiratory sensitisers that can trigger asthma are found in a number of working environments. The Health and Safety Executive has been active in promoting good practice in factories and other places of work but, as my noble friend said, the key to the successful management of asthma, as with any chronic condition, is the informed patient.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000032"></a>I read an article in the <I>Lancet</I> the other day that set out three unanswered questions about asthma. What is asthma? Who gets asthma and why? Which factors enable us to predict how badly you will get asthma and how you will react to treatment? Those questions are more or less the only ones that matter. Beyond a certain very basic point, we do not know the answers. A good deal of research is going on in the UK and internationally to try to get closer to those issues, but we surely need to do more. We are still a long way from being able to prevent asthma and just as far away from being able to cure it. How can we better identify patients at an early stage who are at risk of a disease progression? On some of the specifics, can we do a randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis of a link between paracetamol and asthma, or between eating nuts during pregnancy and giving birth to a child who becomes asthmatic? Can any sort of finger be pointed at domestic cleaning products?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000033"></a>I wonder, incidentally, whether the Minister has seen recent reports in the press that appear to cast suspicion on the triple inoculation against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough as being a trigger for childhood asthma. It appears that researchers at the Manitoba Institute of Child Health found that, if the initial dose of the jab is delayed to when a child is at least four months old, the chance of the child developing asthma by the age of seven is less than half what it would be otherwise. That is a pretty dramatic finding. It would be helpful if the Minister could say whether the department is looking at it. The UK has the highest prevalence of asthma in children aged 13 and 14 in the world. We need to establish why that is. If the DTP inoculation looks as though it might be a contributory factor, I suggest that we need to confront the data head on.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08103039000034"></a>In general, progress in understanding asthma and how it works is slow. We cannot, and should not, be satisfied with that against the backdrop of facts and figures that the noble Viscount has cited. I hope that the Minister&#146;s reply will give us a sense of how importantly asthma is taken by the Government, in terms of service delivery as well as research, and that we can leave this debate with at least some measure of encouragement.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000005"></a>I am pleased to report that the prevalence of asthma has started to plateau, after decades of increase. There has been a fall in death rates and hospitalisations due to asthma, although clearly, as many noble Lords, including the noble Earl, pointed out, there is a great deal more to do. We want to ensure that the improvements that have led to that situation continue.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000006"></a>A lot of the credit for this must go to healthcare professionals for implementing and working to evidence-based guidelines and to organisations such as Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation for working as true partners of the NHS by providing information and tools to help people better to manage their condition, as mentioned by several noble Lords. We are supporting improvements in understanding asthma, its causes and how it should be treated by investing in research, as the noble Earl mentioned. He rightly listed the obvious questions. For example, we have invested &#163;4.75 million over five years in the Biomedical Research Centre at Guy&#146;s and St Thomas&#146;s to work on a range of aspects of asthma, including treatment for chronic asthma and prevention.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000007"></a>Research by the National Primary Care Research and Development Centre in November 2006 found that GPs in the UK are leading the world in the efficient management of chronic disease, the use of information technology and the uptake of financial incentives to improve the quality of services.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000008"></a>The Quality and Outcomes Framework for primary care has certainly helped to drive up performance in asthma care. Asthma UK&#146;s independent review, to which several noble Lords have referred, has shown the dramatic impact of good-performing primary care practices on reducing hospital admissions and deaths. We are keen that those lessons should be learnt and that those practices should become more widespread.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000009"></a>A number of new developments will have an impact on the provision of services to people with asthma. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, that the Department of Health has been leading the development of a breathlessness pathway for primary care trusts. Its main purpose is to set out the commissioning requirements for primary assessment of the patient through specialist and sub-specialist care, inclusive of diagnostic investigations, treatment interventions and follow-up arrangements for improving the care of people with breathlessness resulting from obstructive lung disease, including asthma. We hope to publish the pathway before the end of the year. I think that that is health service code for what the noble Baroness was referring to as regards patients needing to have a personal pathway available to them.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC57"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC57</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to highlight the areas in which lung health can be improved and specifically where improvement can be made to other respiratory conditions, particularly asthma. Officials are meeting the chief executive of Asthma UK shortly to discuss this further.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000012"></a>The other key to the management of asthma is appropriate support for those in the community. This approach to the management of all long-term conditions was reaffirmed in <I>High Quality Care </I><I>f</I><I>or All</I>, the recent review of the NHS carried out by my noble friend Lord Darzi. The review makes a commitment to ensure that practitioners have the necessary skills to provide effective care. For those professionals working in the field of asthma, this will build on the excellent programmes run for many years by the National Respiratory Training Centre. <I>High Quality Care for All</I> also sets out ambitious plans to offer personalised care plans to everyone with a long-term condition and to drive improvements in both primary and community-based services. These ambitions have been reflected in local plans developed in every strategic health authority in England.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000013"></a>We think that the best way for service providers to achieve the proactive management of long-term conditions such as asthma is through personalised, tailored packages of care with more regular review. To support this, we have developed disease management information toolkits to inform decision-making at both the regional and the local levels. The use of the toolkits helps to build up intelligence across health and social care by providing key data and guidance for every primary care trust in England. The toolkits support decision-makers, commissioners and front-line providers in gaining a better understanding of those long-term conditions that are having the greatest impact on local health populations in terms of the use of emergency day beds and other healthcare resources.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000014"></a>We know that self-care is absolutely vital, as several noble Lords said. Asthma was one of the first conditions to be included in the NHS Choices series of guides. The guides focus on advice about lifestyle, information about conditions and the treatments for them, and advice and support on living with a condition. In addition, we are making further investment in the Expert Patients programme to increase the capacity of course places available to offer patients from 12,000 to 100,000 a year by 2012.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000015"></a>On the specific questions raised by noble Lords, the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, and the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, both mentioned the importance of dealing with children with asthma. In September 2004, the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services publication included an exemplar patient journey on asthma, which I know Asthma UK has made a priority. I did some work with this organisation many years ago and indeed we were addressing the issue when I was talking to its representatives about how to get this into the hands of every teacher in the country. I am glad to see that progress has been made, because the patient journey on asthma in childhood exemplar forms part of the framework and its implementation is key.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000016"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, and others mentioned a national framework.  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC58"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Following on from the NHS next-stage review, the Department of Health is developing the COPD clinical strategy with NICE. The COPD programme board is considering including a chapter on asthma in the clinical strategy. We will meet Asthma UK soon to talk about what can be done on asthma in the COPD strategy. My noble friend Lord Darzi&#146;s report <I>High Quality Care for All</I> recommended the setting-up of a national quality board, the responsibilities of which would include deciding priorities for new work in the future on specific clinical conditions. We expect to consider the case for an asthma strategy over other candidates.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, and others raised the issue of health professionals being trained in the treatment of asthma. We will introduce modularised&#151;a terrible word&#151;accredited training packages and we will strengthen educational governance to ensure that all clinical staff have the opportunity to develop their skills throughout their careers. We regard asthma and chronic conditions as an important part of that.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000018"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, both mentioned allergies and allergic disease. The research at Guy&#146;s and St Thomas&#146;s will focus on a prevention that includes allergic aspects. Diagnostic investigation to support that focus, including allergic aspects, is outlined in the 18-week breathlessness pathway, which includes specialist bronchial challenge tests and a pathway test for immune function. The north-west SHA is taking forward this work in looking at improving allergy services, as has been mentioned.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, asked how we record asthma admissions to make it easier to monitor them. We record asthma admissions and finished consultant episodes associated with asthma in the hospital episode statistics, which are provided at all levels. The noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, mentioned the training of nurses in the community. In addition to the proposals outlined in <I>A High Quality Workforce</I> for all health professionals, <I>M</I><I>odernising </I><I>Nursing Careers</I> focuses on developing fit-for-purpose education on long-term conditions.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000020"></a>I shall deal with the other questions in writing, as I am conscious that my time is nearly up. Should we be worried about inoculating young babies with the DTP vaccine? We urge parents not to leave their children vulnerable to those serious illnesses because of an unproven claim that there is an extra risk. There is no substantive evidence, as far as the department is concerned, that the DTP inoculation puts babies at greater risk of asthma.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000021"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, that an assessment will need to be designed by the Care Quality Commission as part of the development of the independent performance assessment of providers and the effectiveness of PCT commissioning. We are quite familiar with that, as I recall.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000022"></a>I thank noble Lords for the many points that they have raised. There is no doubt that long-term conditions such as asthma present a massive challenge to health and social care, as well as to families and communities. I assure noble Lords that we will continue to support and encourage the NHS to ensure that people with asthma receive the care that they deserve.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000025"></a>The noble Lord said: At the conclusion of the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, to universal applause, John Maynard Keynes paid tribute to his colleagues, who he said had performed a task appropriate,</p>
<ul><a name="08103047000176"></a>&#147;to the prophet and the soothsayer&#148;.</ul>
<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000026"></a>I often speak of the wealth of talent and experience that exists in your Lordships&#146; House; however, I do not think that any of us today, in the limited time offered to us, will be claiming the title of &#147;prophet&#148; or &#147;soothsayer&#148;. What we can do, however, is look at the financial crisis that is upon us and ask what has happened, why it has happened and what must be done so that it does not happen again.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000027"></a>As many of your Lordships know, I have had this debate in the ballot for a number of months. Not only am I delighted that it is taking place at such an important and appropriate time, but I am grateful to those Peers speaking in the debate today, many of whom are recognised as world experts in this field. I welcome the Minister to this House. I congratulate him on his appointment, and we look forward to his response at the end of the debate.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000028"></a>If recent events have taught us anything, it is that the global institutions set up after the Second World War, such as the UN, the IMF and the World Bank, so appropriately created for that time, are now so out of step with our time. As reported in the <I>Times</I>, there are three kinds of organisations: those that make things happen, those that watch things happen and those that wonder what happened.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000029"></a>Take the IMF, an organisation of over 2,700 employees, with access to resources in excess of $363 billion. With all those resources, where was the IMF last year when this crisis started to unfold? Where were the IMF&#146;s warnings as the world sleepwalked into financial meltdown? And today, when we are in the grip of the crisis, where are the IMF&#146;s proposals on how to end it? The question we have to ask ourselves is: if the IMF is not mandated to fulfil that important function, why not? To its credit, the IMF&#146;s 2007 <I>Global Financial Stability Report </I>in fact recognised that the US housing market was slowing down. However, it said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08103047000177"></a>&#147;this weakness has been contained to certain portions of the subprime market ... and is not likely to pose a serious systemic threat&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08103047000166"></a>Ironically, the stress tests that formed the IMF's evidence base for this report were produced by none other than Lehmann Brothers.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000030"></a>A core function of the IMF is to act as the lender of last resort, but even there we have seen that it is not the lender of first choice. Take the Asian crisis of 1997, when South Korea ignored the advice of the IMF and came out the better for it. Today Iceland and Pakistan, for example, have both turned elsewhere first before approaching the IMF.</p>

<p><a name="08103047000031"></a>I want to make it clear that this is not a blame game. It is about finding a new mechanism that will enable the global community to work together. I heard President Clinton say that, whereas countries have historically always been interdependent on one another, today countries are integrated with one another. We have all heard the saying that when America sneezes, the world catches a cold; we can now see that we all catch that cold the very same day. Today we see the Indian stock market anticipating the actions of the US Secretary of State for the Treasury before they have been announced. Today we see India, a country still without a fully convertible currency, having to react swiftly to the challenges and opportunities presented by our integrated global economy.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000032"></a>The balance of economic power in the world is changing dramatically. The US, the European Union and Japan together contribute approximately 60 per cent of global GDP, and yet emerging countries with large surpluses are today investing huge sums of money in developed countries. These rising stars of the world economy need to be better integrated and represented in our global financial institutions. In short, the world&#146;s top table needs to change&#151;it needs more seats.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000033"></a>The world is returning to where it was some three centuries ago, with India and China once again set to emerge as the two dominant economic superpowers. Yet neither country has a place in the G7 or the G8, and India remains excluded to this day as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The chairmanship of the World Bank remains the gift of the President of the United States. For what reason? That America was once the bank&#146;s biggest funder by far. Today, however, it is just one of many. If the World Bank is to be for the world, surely its governance should reflect today&#146;s economic reality, not yesterday&#146;s. Similarly, does the managing director of the IMF need always to be European? Why not an American? Why not an Indian? Why not the best candidate for the job?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000034"></a>There is no question that America is by far the most powerful country in the world today, but, looking ahead just 20 years from now, when China and India are economic superpowers alongside the EU and America, will it, for example, seem appropriate for the headquarters of the IMF, the World Bank and the UN to all be located in one country?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000035"></a>Contrary to recent events, we should be proactive, not reactive, and look at what is right for the world as it is today and as it will be tomorrow, whether that be a reformed World Bank&#151;by the world, of the world, for the world&#151;or a reformed IMF that would be genuinely global in its funding and in its scope, acting as an economic firefighter but, more importantly, as the steward and guardian of the global financial system. We need a mechanism for global financial institutions that can promote free trade without hampering free trade. We need regulation that is neither light-touch nor heavy-handed but balanced to protect consumers globally; to promote transparency; to prevent; to predict; to lead by example; and to argue forcefully that trade is not a zero-sum game.</p>

<p><a name="08103047000037"></a>Today it is Britain that has shown leadership in the international community through the announcement of its &#163;500 billion rescue package for its financial sector, a sum that dwarfs America&#146;s $700 billion package even at today&#146;s exchange rates, and America&#146;s economy is more than six times larger than Britain&#146;s. In advance of the meeting of world leaders on 15 November, I urge the British Government to follow in the tradition of Keynes at Bretton Woods and to lead the way with boldness, confidence and authority in reforming our global financial institutions. Over 60 years ago those institutions were born out of the Second World War. Now they need to be reborn out of the global financial crisis as institutions that are fit for purpose for today and for tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="08103047000038"></a><a name="81030-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81030-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08103047000202"></a>Lord Desai:</b> We are all grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, for initiating the debate. He has said much with which I agree entirely, so I shall confine myself to what I can add to the debate. First, when President Nixon announced on 15 August 1971 that America would shrug off its role as a key currency in selling gold at $35 an ounce, the IMF died. It should have been given a decent burial immediately because it had no function to perform once the particular combination of a world of capital controls and fixed exchange rates was gone. It had been a vision created by John Maynard Keynes in Bretton Woods. It served its purpose extremely well between 1945 and 1971, but in subsequent meetings that had to decide on a regime of flexibility in rates, noble Lords will recall that it was individual countries themselves that took the initiative to fix, in a series of meetings, what the system of flexibility in rates would be, while Europe took a lead and set up the European Monetary System, and so on.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000039"></a>The IMF completely missed the petrodollar crisis, let the third world get into unsustainable debt, and in 1981 started bullying everyone about their macro-economic balances. The IMF had the wrong macro-economic model for developing countries and ruined many of them. Indeed, it performed a signally negative role throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Today the IMF is a moderately good macro-economic forecasting body, somewhat like the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, although it is not quite as good. I suggest that we should abolish the IMF at the first opportunity and merge its macro-economic forecasting unit with either the World Bank or the Bank for International Settlements, which is a glorious institution when compared with any of the others. One can be absolutely bloody-minded about the IMF, and I agree strongly with the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, that it did not do anything in either the current or any previous crises. Indeed, last March I was taking part in a BBC programme while the IMF was holding its spring meeting. I then managed to roundly abuse the institution and say that it should be abolished, so I am not saying anything on the spur of the moment.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000040"></a>Institutions that have outlived the function for which they were set up should be abolished forthwith, not  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC62"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reformed. There may be a need for an institution at the international level, but the first question to ask is this: what is the gap in the market that the institution is supposed to fill? If we have complete flexibility in rates and if, despite the financial crisis, we have good capital flows, what is the market failure that an institution designed like the IMF is supposed to correct? Indeed, would it not be better for countries in balance of payments difficulties to go to a consortium of private banks that would be less bullying and authoritarian than the IMF? The IMF sets conditions which a country receiving its help has to accept. What is most absurd is that the IMF makes countries request that it imposes conditions on them so it looks like it is not the IMF but the country itself that is asking to be whipped, put in chains and messed about.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000041"></a>I also concur with the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, about the governance of the IMF and the World Bank, and I do not want to add anything to what he said. Even the permanent secretaryship of the UN should be advertised and the best person elected, rather than let it be a case of Buggins&#146; turn, which is what we have. That sort of business almost always leads to a second-rate person being appointed.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000042"></a>I want to make one more point about the World Bank. Over the years it has improved a great deal, and to the extent that the IMF has performed functions related to aiding the third world, those activities should go to the World Bank. We also need to think more broadly about the functions performed by the World Bank. While there is need for such aid flows, we must ensure that they are given to where they are most needed and are not wasted on a number of rather peculiar experiments, especially, say, the dams experiment in which the World Bank got involved.</p>

The philosopher Nietzsche wrote that there are no such things as truths, only interpretations. Nietzsche was quite a problem to himself, but he has left us with this valuable insight.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000044"></a>Interpretations vary from yet another valuable insight to frankly partisan spin. How do we tease out the Government&#146;s interpretation of their assessment of the IMF? I shall refer to two short sentences in the Prime Minister&#146;s Statement on the European Council meetings. On the rebuilding of confidence, given the Prime Minister&#146;s view that as the crisis started in America, America is responsible, any interpretation of Northern Rock is left high and dry. The first sentence refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="08103047000178"></a>&#147;a new international architecture for the global financial sector&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08103047000167"></a>The second sentence refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="08103047000179"></a>&#147;reform of the International Monetary Fund and Financial Stability Forum, including the creation of an early warning system for the global economy&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/10/08; col. 22.]</ul>
<p><a name="08103047000168"></a>How does the noble Lord interpret &#147;a new international architecture&#148;? Is the whole of Bretton Woods to be felled? As we follow once again in the revolutionary  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC63"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC63</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>footsteps of Tom Paine, what will be built and when? We have no time for this fantasy when what we need, and encouragingly are seeing, is daily IMF action&#151;for example, Iceland, Hungary, Ukraine and Poland. Where next? This architecture sentence is firmly in the category of &#147;spin&#148;. What is the Government&#146;s interpretation?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000045"></a>The second sentence is more interesting. Three points need consideration. First, we need to consider reform of the IMF, which is 64 years-old with 185 members, 10 of whom have 55 per cent of the votes. With 11 years&#146; experience, the Prime Minister will be sitting on many a memorandum entitled something like &#147;Proposals for the reform of the IMF&#148;. Have any been published? I could not find one on the Treasury website.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000046"></a>Now I part company with the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, to whom we are all grateful this afternoon. The IMF has understandably long found it risky to give hard advice to the 10&#151;55 per cent&#151;members. Indeed, everyone finds it risky to give the Prime Minister hard advice. The fund has frequently been reminded that many identify the onset of irrelevance. When and if it has run scared, that has not been surprising. That is not so now when such critics are repenting or at least spinning their willingness to claim that they have always been determined supporters given unspecified reforms. However, the most recent IMF financial stability assessment of the UK was in 2003 and the United States will not have one.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000047"></a>The reform of the Financial Stability Forum is an entirely different matter, although it appears in the same sentence. The FSF is nine years-old. It is housed in the Bank for International Settlements with a seconded secretariat of seven. There is no structure, no professional staff or any legal status. As no threat to G7 leaders, or to their bureaucracies, it is a comfortable partner. How is it to be reformed? It is not an international institution as it is.</p>

<p><a name="08103047000048"></a>Finally, the early warning system is already the delegated responsibility of the IMF, but who paid due attention to the April 2007 global financial stability report&#151;perhaps punches were pulled, as the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, suggested, but they were running scared of the bullies&#151;or to the April 2008 report, which was closer to the mark than any rich-country Government? How do the Government assess the IMF&#151;as an interesting institution but not much use until reformed, or as an important and professional contributor to the solution of today&#146;s crisis? What is the answer?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000050"></a>I shall concentrate my brief remarks on the IMF. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Desai, with whom I rarely disagree, I do not want to abolish the IMF&#151;his suggestion that distressed borrowers come to private banks for loans is a remarkable expression of confidence in the private banking system at this moment of its performance&#151;I want to reform it.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC64"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000051"></a>My reform would be based on reminding us of what it stood for: to promote a stable system of exchange rates by preventing countries from manipulating their currencies to get unfair trade advantages. Various things went with that: the commission to devalue in exceptional circumstances, short-term loans, temporary balance-of-payments difficulties, and allowing countries to prohibit imports of goods through something which the noble Lord will know about but I do not know how many others do&#151;the never used scarce-currency clause. All this was designed to prevent the development of global imbalances of the kind that we have seen recently. It did not work out that way, however, because creditor countries such as Germany and France in the first phase of the Bretton Woods system found it more convenient to increase their dollar reserves than to revalue their currencies, and the United States could run increasing balance-of-trade deficits by printing Treasury bills.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000052"></a>The whole system fell down in 1971, and the main purpose of the IMF&#146;s requirement to preserve stable currencies was abolished in 1978. As we have just been told, we were on a non-system of flexible exchange rates, but this did not solve the problem of global imbalances, as it was supposed to. Since the 1980s, the problem has re-emerged in spades. China and the Far East now hold US Treasury bills in large quantities, which the United States pays out to finance its huge current account deficits of $500 billion a year, on average, for the past four or five years. This is called the savings glut in Asia, the counterpart of which is the consumption glut in the United States.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000053"></a>Exchange undervaluation by Asian countries has been a deliberate policy to carry out both the accumulation of reserves and their export drives. This is where we come to the connection between this world situation and our current financial crisis, because these excess Asian savings have been shovelled into the housing bubbles of both America and Britain: not directly, of course, but by enabling our Governments to pursue expansionary, monetary and fiscal policies that fuelled an unsustainable credit and housing boom. That has contributed directly to the current financial collapse.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000054"></a>For the past 10 years, America has in effect had no budget constraint. What is true of a country was true of lots of individuals, who piled up personal debt on the back of constantly inflating house and asset prices. The IMF, as the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, rightly said and as the noble Lord, Lord Desai, reiterated, has been completely marginalised in this process, because it has lost its central purpose: to prevent these huge imbalances from occurring in the first place. Any reform of the IMF must therefore start with seeing how we might reform the international payments system in order to promote a balance-of-payments adjustment. It seems obvious to me.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000055"></a>The clear first step is to attack the Asian fetish of building up huge reserves for crisis insurance. The best way to do that is to activate the IMF's power to create international fiat money by means of special drawing rights. The quantity of extra reserves would have to be very high, but we have been used to talking of hundreds of billions of dollars, and a few hundred billion more will not alarm us that much.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000056"></a>Secondly, we must find some method to prevent the pile-up of large creditor balances and their counterpart of persisting debtor balances. In other words, we need to revisit the whole question of exchange rate adjustment. A well known suggestion by the economist John Williamson is that the major countries should agree periodically on reference exchange rates which they intervene to push market exchange rates towards. That is a complicated suggestion, but it begins to address the problem of how we can keep our exchange rates more stable and prevent global imbalances building up. That would be a desirable new project for a Bretton Woods conference. We will come to that in the end. When we do, we should hold it at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, where Keynes and Harry Dextor White hammered out the original Bretton Woods system that served the world so well for 30 years.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000058"></a>We all agree that there is a need for a genuine and radical reform in the world's financial architecture. There is no shortage of suggestions. The question that we should ask is: what are the principles that should guide how a new financial architecture should be set? Those principles, in turn, will be determined by the goal and objective that we want the institutions to realise. Is the reform intended to stabilise capitalism? Is it intended to save capitalism from the folly and mischief of capitalists? Is it intended to perpetuate existing global inequalities? What is our goal?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000059"></a>There should be widespread consensus that our goal should be to create a just world in which globalisation works to the advantage of all. If that is our goal, certain principles follow from it. We should evaluate in the light of those principles whatever suggestions are offered. First, the institutions should increase our capacity to control the impersonal forces of the market and allow us to shape our economic destiny, rather than be governed by it. Secondly, the institutions should promote global well-being, as articulated, for example, in the millennium development goals, such as reduction in poverty, disease, hunger, and economic underdevelopment in general. Thirdly, the institutions should ensure democratic participation, so that all voices are heard and all legitimate interests are taken into account. The fourth and equally important principle that should guide our decision is that the institutions to be set up should be transparent and accountable.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000060"></a>If we judge by those four criteria, which are crucial, the existing institutions turn out to be extremely disappointing. For example, in the IMF, developed countries have 72 per cent of the votes, whereas Africa has only 5.6 per cent, Asia 10.4 per cent and Latin America 7.7 per cent. As the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, pointed out, the managing director of the IMF is by convention European and the president of the World Bank is American. Those posts are not advertised;  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC66"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they do not even necessarily go to the best people; they are political gifts. The mischief that that can cause we have seen over the years.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000061"></a>Those institutions have served the interests of developed societies rather than the rest of the world. The noble Lord, Lord Desai, rightly talked about the mischief that the IMF pursuing Washington consensus caused under Paul Wolfowitz. The IMF posed a neo-conservative agenda and gave money to those regimes of which it approved. In the 1990s, the IMF unleashed klepto-capitalism in the Soviet Union and its associates.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000062"></a>The question is that if all these institutions are inadequate, what should we be doing? I want to end with four or five suggestions that I think are quite important. First, the posts of managing director of the IMF and president of the World Bank should be widely advertised and open to all, as is that of the secretary-general of the United Nations. I am even tempted to suggest, given that the World Bank is intended to help poor countries, that the president must always come from one of the low-income or developing nations.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000063"></a>Secondly, the composition of the IMF and the World Bank should be adequately representative of all parts of the world. All kinds of criteria have been advocated and I shall not go into them for lack of time, but population, deposits, need and volatility of an economy are all criteria that can be taken into account. Thirdly, the policies followed by the IMF and the World Bank should be publicly debated and endorsed, and therefore both could do with a globally representative advisory committee. There should be a way to provide for regular consultation with those countries which have to turn to these institutions for help and consultation on their management.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000064"></a>Fourthly, an imaginative way must be found to increase the funds that are available to the IMF and the World Bank. It is extraordinary that the IMF is going to have to depend on China for funds when that country has no effective say in the running of the fund. Imaginative ways of raising funds might be by raising taxes on global commons or a version of the Tobin tax. Finally, we must think in terms of regulated mechanisms to monitor cross-border capital flows, to keep an eye on the lending practices of the big banks and in general to ensure the confidence of the international financial institutions.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000065"></a>If we think along these lines, perhaps a new version of the IMF rather than the institution as it is currently structured could take on these functions.</p>

I have tried to understand the present crisis through the prism of the needs of developing countries which inevitably are going to be the worst casualties. In Beijing the UN Secretary-General warned that the crisis could be the last straw for the world&#146;s poorest:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08103047000173"></a>&#147;It threatens to undermine all our achievements and all our progress&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08103047000169"></a>The president of the African Development Bank, Dr Donald Kaberuka, recently expressed similar concerns  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC67"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and said last week that on present trends, Africa can no longer reach the millennium development goals. Some 17 million people face starvation in the Horn of Africa alone, only partly because of conflict. The situation is being aggravated by the wider economic climate. The IMF itself has warned that rising prices and inflation are already undermining the improvements made in economic and social stability in the third world over the past two decades. Inflation in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to reach 12 per cent by next year. The president of the World Bank has made food prices a particular concern, and our Government have responded positively.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000067"></a>I will not repeat the stories of poverty and hunger that have been reported in the press over the past few weeks, but leaders of developing countries are naturally pessimistic not just about the state of the world economy, but the ability of the Bretton Woods institutions to cope with it any longer. There is a vigorous network of NGOs with a good deal of expertise nowadays in the workings of the IFIs, and they are arguing for a stronger voice for these countries at World Bank and IMF meetings. Even the Group of 20 meeting in Washington next month will have only South Africa to represent the entire continent of Africa. That is why 556 NGOs, 60 of them in Africa, have called for a Bretton Woods II, a global summit genuinely representing all UN members. Decisions will still have to come from the G8 plus two or three, and parity between borrowers and non-borrowers would be difficult to achieve, but in today&#146;s crisis with more developing countries becoming lenders, surely more account should be taken of them. Does the Minister agree that Africa should have a third seat at the World Bank, and will the UK support the case for wider third world representation?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000068"></a>More of the countries invited to Beijing should be included in IMF meetings. Incidentally, it was another Beijing summit two years ago which brought an African forum together and created a new momentum of Chinese aid and investment in Africa, which has caused considerable confusion in the western aid world. It becomes even more significant at a time when China has been asked to become one of the world&#146;s bankers.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000069"></a>In contrast to its image, Africa has enjoyed spectacular economic growth of about 7 per cent over the past decade, and progress has been made in health and education, but that has occurred in spite of the restraints imposed by the IFIs, as outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Desai. No one should be in doubt about the low reputation of the IMF and the World Bank in Africa. That was dramatically portrayed in Abderrahmane Sissako&#146;s 2006 film &#147;Bamako&#148;, when leaders of the two institutions were literally standing trial while Africans suffered from globalisation and harsh conditionality. What right, for example, did the IMF have to interfere in the details of wages of teachers in Malawi and Mozambique? The consequence, as recent research by ActionAid shows, is that untrained teachers are now being employed, lowering the quality of education. The IMF has not understood the principle of the poverty reduction strategy.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000070"></a>I know that my noble friend will join me in arguing that the IFIs should be much more accountable, and perhaps the Minister agrees with that. Can he forecast

That may be the first international meeting that represents the needs of the poorer world effectively. The Doha round must also be revived at all costs to rebalance world trade and recognise the legitimate demands of the LDCs. We have to look at the long term. The world must find a solution in which, as many economists since Keynes have argued and even more do today, fairer trade and steady social improvements in the poorest countries will in the end create a climate of economic stability for all of us.</p>

<p><a name="08103047000071"></a><a name="81030-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81030-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08103047000207"></a>Lord Newby:</b> Like other noble Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, on securing this debate. I have contended for a long time that one of the reasons why the world global institutions perform so badly is that they are accountable to no one. National parliaments take very little interest in them on a sustained basis, and I hope that the trend that the noble Lord has started today will continue.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000072"></a>I shall concentrate on the IMF. In good economic times the IMF plays a relatively quiescent role. It has an ongoing surveillance function, of dubious success. One of the thing I hope to pursue with the Minister on another occasion is the extent to which the IMF was looking at what was happening in Iceland earlier this year and the extent to which it was talking to its major member states about the inherent risks in that country. Surveillance is a job that someone needs to do; the IMF does it, but might do so a bit more robustly.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000073"></a>In times of currency crisis, however, the role of the IMF is much greater in helping stabilise increasingly unstable situations. In recent days we have seen countries from across the globe, from Pakistan to Iceland, lining up for IMF support. In some cases, at least, they are getting it. The criteria of the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, for the purpose of the IMF were noble, but a simplistic answer to the question, &#147;Why do you need the IMF?&#148; is, &#147;Frankly, if we didn&#146;t have one, at times like this we would have to invent it&#148;.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000074"></a>It is clear that there are major challenges to the IMF if it is going to fulfil successfully the role that so many countries look to it to provide. Central to those is that the IMF and the World Bank have been seen, and have acted, as advocates for a particular economic doctrine, and have been seen to be very much under the sway of the US and, to a lesser extent, of the EU. Over the years they have been pushing concepts like privatisation and liberalisation that in theory might work but, in practice, do not work everywhere all the time.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000075"></a>In the excellent biography of Keynes by the noble Lord, Lord Skidlesky, he describes Bretton Woods in tremendous detail and explains that the Chinese delegation, which I believe was quite small, suffered the disadvantage of not speaking a word of English, and because the whole thing had been done at short notice there were no translators. At the time, no one seemed to mind very much; the role of China was relative small and it did not really matter. It jolly well matters now. The current economic crisis clearly marks a sea change in economic power, which is moving from the US and Europe to China and India, the resource-rich countries of the Gulf and elsewhere.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC69"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC69</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000076"></a>The IMF completely fails to reflect that. Voting strengths are: China, 3.66; the US, 16.77 and the UK, 4.86. Although that changed earlier in the year, it needs to change more. The weakness of the IMF in terms of perceptions can be seen if you look at the way that Pakistan looked to get its support. It described getting support from the IMF as plan C. It tried China first and the Gulf second. The IMF was plan C. It should be looking to the IMF as plan A, because the IMF should be a trusted institution. There should be changes in the way that people are appointed and changes as regards transparency. It does not publish its minutes for 20 years after the executive committee meets, which is a joke. All these things need to happen if it is to be treated seriously by those countries which traditionally have played a small part.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000077"></a>Secondly, the IMF needs to have a lot more resources. People have bandied about the fact that it might need $2 trillion instead of $200 million, and the Prime Minister has talked about a bail-out fund. In the past week, every day there has been a major new development involving the IMF. Yesterday, it was looking at new rules to enable it to make grants to countries more quickly. Literally earlier today, China announced its willingness in principle to contribute to an enhanced international bail-out fund; the implication being that it would be administered by the IMF. So far from being a dead institution, it clearly is seen as an institution with a major role to play. I fear, however, that the meeting planned for 15 December will not lead to its reform. What we need is a long-term, thought-through series of meetings to get the real reform which will enable the IMF and the other international financial institutions to fulfil the purposes, if not quite those envisaged at Bretton Woods, which the world now sees they need to fulfil.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000079"></a>I am sure that the IMF and the World Bank did a fine job in helping the world economies to be rebuilt after the Second World War. Like the noble Lord, Lord Newby, I shall concentrate my remarks on the IMF, which has continued to support economies which have run into trouble, including, of course, our own during a period of Labour Government mismanagement of the economy in the 1970s, and we should not forget that. But, of course, a valuable history does not guarantee the IMF a place in the future. After the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, the IMF admitted that it had &#147;a lot to learn&#148; about preventing financial crises. As other noble Lords have said, it is fairly clear that it played no positive role in the current global financial crisis as it evolved. Therefore, we have to ask whether the IMF really has a role beyond that of clearing up after the event on an ex post basis.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000080"></a>The IMF spends a lot of time analysing countries and issues a lot of reports, but it seems to have no real influence unless it has a rescue package to which it can attach some levers. I give an example. In the 2006  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC70"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Article IV consultation on the UK&#146;s economy, the IMF warned about the UK&#146;s high household debt, its overpriced housing market and the high leveraging of our mortgage lenders. It concluded that the UK was particularly vulnerable to shocks in international markets. All of this has proved very accurate. We challenged the Government about it at the time, but it was all too easy for them to ignore the analysis.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000081"></a>There also have to be questions about the quality of the IMF&#146;s analysis. In 2203, the IMF completed a financial sector assessment of the UK, which described our financial stability policy framework in glowing terms. But that is the framework that included the FSA, which regulated Northern Rock appallingly badly, and the tripartite arrangements, which were a shambles when put to the test. What value does the IMF add, with reports that can be ignored or which, with the benefit of hindsight, flattered to deceive? Is the IMF simply too polite about countries such as the UK, whose support is important to its continuation?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000082"></a>As has been mentioned, there have been calls from the Prime Minister, certainly since 1998, for changes to the international financial architecture, and no one has been really sure what that has meant in practical terms. Indeed, there has been no tangible action in that period, though of course there are thousands of worthy words written on the subject by bodies such as the Financial Stability Forum. Yesterday, we heard from the Chancellor that there will be 30 colleges of regulators, but apart from that, we are still only promised more meetings on the subject. Is there any substance to the latest round of rhetoric? I hope that the Minister will be able to enlighten us.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000083"></a>Apart from grand plans to reform the international financial architecture, there are some short-term issues about funding which some noble Lords have already mentioned, given the queue of countries now waiting for some help. In 2006, the IMF sold off some of its gold to fund its operations and thereby ran down the resources that it had available. As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, pointed out, the Prime Minister called for hundreds of billions of extra dollars in a bail-out fund. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, is ahead of me in hearing that China has signed up. When I was researching this yesterday, there was deafening silence on whether anyone was going to put their hand up or indeed put their hand in their pocket. Maybe we will get some extra money into the IMF, and I am sure that will be helpful.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000084"></a>This week, we have seen that there are separate and partly competing EU, US, IMF and World Bank funding initiatives. Does the Minister think that this patchwork of different initiatives to support countries is the most efficient way of delivering support? Do the Government think that the IMF and the World Bank should be at the heart of those efforts, or are we witnessing a nail in the coffin of the positions of those bodies in the global economy?</p>

I have handed in my registration of interests, but it has not yet been processed. I assure the Committee that I have nothing relevant to declare, save that which we all have that is relevant to declare: a real interest in the truly extraordinary issues facing the world at the moment in terms of financial instability, the performance of the global economy and the needs and interests of those in the developing world.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000086"></a>Institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank have a key role in assisting countries hit by negative shocks, but recent events in financial markets have confirmed that the world economy has changed irrevocably. The noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, started with a quotation from Keynes. Having also recently read the book by the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, I shall take a quotation from Keynes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08103047000174"></a>&#147;The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08103047000170"></a>One of the challenges for us in our role in supporting the IMF, the World Bank and other institutions is recognising that in a changed environment they themselves must have changed roles, changed processes and changed cultures.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000087"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, reminded us of the critical interdependency between economies. These are not times when single national initiatives alone will suffice, although the initiatives taken by this country and others to support confidence in their own banking and financial institutions have clearly played a very valuable part. Contagion is a word that we now come to associate with global economics and global finance. The Government support the strengthening of the robustness of international controls. In particular, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has emphasised the important role that he sees for the Financial Stability Forum, which will certainly need more resource than it currently has, and to which the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, alerted us. We see a more assertive role for the Financial Stability Forum in accounting, rating agencies, and the regulation and transparency of the derivative markets&#151;in short, a role that meets the call of the noble Viscount for it to be proactive rather than reactive.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000088"></a>We support the expansion of the top table at the World Bank and the IMF through the extension of its membership, which the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, talked about. We have also publicly spoken about the unacceptability of the gentleman&#146;s agreement under which the leadership of the World Bank and the IMF is determined, and we have argued forcefully for an open and transparent process of appointment that leads to the best equipped people being appointed to those important roles.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000089"></a>In response to the observations of the noble Lords, Lord Bilimoria and Lord Parekh, about supporting the institutions and making them become more legitimate, I should say that we have agreed that the IMF quota reform in April 2008 was an important further step towards making the organisations stronger and more accountable. As I said, we support making them much more open and transparent about the performance of  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC72"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their duties. The UK has also been vocal in support of the IMFC chair coming from an emerging market economy.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000090"></a>My noble friend Lord Desai argued the case for abolishing the IMF. I am not persuaded at this point that substituting IMF support for support from a consortium of private banks is entirely the best approach. Indeed, some of the difficulties with which the IMF is now coping are a direct consequence of the need to substitute private bank-provided finance which has been used to support long-term capital investment and budget deficits in a number of countries. He made a more powerful point about the need to change the way in which the IMF works if it is to perform an effective function in the future.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000091"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, invited us to speculate that reference to architecture is spin rather than substance. I assure him that it is not. We are talking about putting our shoulder to the wheel to ensure that fundamental changes are made in the IMF and the World Bank to improve their efficiency and make them relevant to the needs of today. The noble Viscount also asked whether the reports from the IMF received as much attention as they should have done. That is an endemic problem. My former colleagues at the Bank of England would point to the fact that they alerted us to difficulties in the banking sector to which the sector itself seemed oblivious. I can think of ways in which the IMF and the World Bank could communicate their views more forcefully. Indeed, a report on the actions taken subsequent to their analysis and the publication of their views would be an important step forward. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has already argued in support of this.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000092"></a>I am indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, for his economic analysis and his focus on the absence of constraint and the persistence of imbalances, which are the fundamental source of the instability with which we are now coping. His remarks were trenchant, powerful and highly relevant.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000093"></a>The IMF and the World Bank are responding to the challenges. The IMF has made up to $250 billion available to support nations affected by the global financial turmoil, and the fund is already in discussions with several countries to provide advice and, where necessary, to bolster countries&#146; reserves. I am delighted to see that the call made by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to supplement the resources available to the IMF through the concept of a trust fund in which those countries that are in substantial balance were able to provide funds which would be invested alongside the IMF, has led to such a positive response from China, as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, told us today. We hope that the Prime Minister&#146;s visit this weekend to the Middle East will be a further step in advocating the case for putting more resources behind the IMF in the future. It is clear that demands on the IMF for resources are going to be considerable.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000094"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, made the case for stronger and more effective surveillance and asked questions in that respect about Iceland, a country about which I have become increasingly knowledgeable in recent days. I share his interest in what we will learn from that. He made the important point that the IMF  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC73"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>needs to improve and to become a trusted, accountable and effective institution. He said that if it did not exist, we would probably have to invent it. Rather than invent something, why should we not do what the Government are encouraging: promote an improvement in the culture and processes of the IMF and the World Bank?</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000095"></a>The current economic conditions may be such that significant additional resources are required, and we are taking steps along with other Governments to ensure that that is achieved. The World Bank has made contributions through its rapid finance facility which was established earlier this year to support countries affected by the food and fuel crisis. The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, reminded us of that there are great difficulties and poverty in many parts of the world which we must not overlook. Strengthening our economy and banking system is an important step to facilitating our ability to do that. We support a louder voice for countries from developing nations in the IMF and the World Bank, including countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The Prime Minister has been clear in his recommendations on that point.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000096"></a>The Government have an important role in mobilising the resources of the IMF, the World Bank, the G7, the G20 and ECOFIN. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, questioned whether competition is the right approach here. I would normally expect to hear support for competition from her Benches. There is a case for plurality and for mobilising as many institutions as possible, with the Government acting as a linking mechanism.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000097"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, for arranging this debate. I have personally found it extraordinarily helpful, and I am encouraged by the contributions from all sides of the Committee.</p>

<h5><a name="08103047000190"></a>5 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08103047000099"></a><a name="81030-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81030-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08103047000210"></a>Baroness Deech</b> asked Her Majesty&#146;s Government whether they propose to review the application of inheritance tax to cohabiting and dependent close family members.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000100"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am grateful to those who have come to discuss a topic which, I admit, I have raised earlier and on which many others have commented. I do so because of the unusual cross-party support that has been evident for what I propose. Thus, I urge the Government to implement it in the Finance Bill. I propose a small, humane change that will cost the nation nothing: that two close relatives who are living together at the time of death of one of them, who have lived together for seven years&#151;echoing the period during which one may transfer assets before death&#151;and who assert codependency should be entitled to defor the payment of inheritance tax until the death of the second.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000101"></a>It has often been said that there are problems of definition of who those people should be. I propose either parent/child and siblings, including half, step  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC74"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and adopted relationships or, more logically, all those relatives who fall within the prohibited degrees, which is quite a small category, because those are people who cannot get married and cannot form civil partnerships. So there is no real problem of definition.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000102"></a>What I suggest would cause no loss to the Treasury because the full amount of tax will be forthcoming eventually. Indeed, my proposal may save resources by avoiding the sale of a property to fund the tax, probably in the declining years of the survivor, which may result in the survivor going into a home. We know that the sale of a home is one of the traumatic events of older life, to precipitate a turn for the worse.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000103"></a>Just as important in this discussion is the establishment of the quality and common sense in inheritance tax law. That common sense has been lost since the death tax advantages that attached only to marriage were extended to same-sex civil partners by the 2004 Act, but were denied to relatives. That was because representatives of at least two parties and the Minister said that the Civil Partnerships Act was the wrong place in which to enact that relief; they did not say that they disagreed with it. On the contrary, an amendment by the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, was passed in this House but defeated in the other place. The principle was supported by, for example, the noble Lords, Lord Alli and Lord Goodhart, and the then Deputy Minister for Women and Equality, Jacqui Smith MP, who all said that the Civil Partnerships Act 2004 was not the place to achieve it.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000104"></a>I became interested in this topic because one of my most brilliant former students at Oxford was counsel for the two sisters in the case that I am about to describe. Not only was he my student, but he is to be introduced into your Lordships&#146; House in a few days time as a new Cross-Bencher, David Pannick, QC. He is wholeheartedly behind my proposal, and it is a matter of regret that it is too soon for him to join the debate.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000105"></a>The case to which I refer, and which is the best known in this field, is that of Miss Joyce and Miss Sybil Burden, sisters in their 80s who have lived together for 82 years. They remain single. They cared for their parents and two aunts to the end and did not allow them to go into a home. On the death of the first sister, inheritance tax is estimated to be around &#163;120,000. All this is in the public domain because of the judgment in which the sisters lost their case of discrimination before the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights. The Court held that marriage was different. With respect, the judgment is unsatisfactory not only because of the narrow defeat in the Court but for the lack of logic. The Government took down the barriers between marriage and other forms of association by enacting advantages for same-sex couples entering a civil partnership.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000106"></a>This dismantling of a centuries-old definition recently gave rise to more demands. It is now being demanded by some that cohabiting different-sex couples should enjoy the same rights as married and civil partnerships. I hasten to distance myself today from that proposal. My position is not connected with the debates about the breakdown of cohabiting different-sex couples where two people who could have married have fallen  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC75"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out. I would say in parentheses that if two people who are free to marry do not do so, it is a denial of their human rights to force on them the least satisfactory elements of marriage, the money laws, and to remove their freedom to make their own contracts. The definition of cohabitation between two people of different sexes is difficult and open to manipulation, unlike the proposal I am making today. Bringing marriage law to bear on cohabitants of different sexes may eat up in legal costs an amount as big as the resources in dispute. It will certainly open the door to harassment through the threat of action as a man and woman separate.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81030-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000107"></a>I have touched on the cohabitation proposals today because it is vital that the small amendment I am proposing is kept distinct from well-meaning but ultimately damaging attempts to create a full marital-type regime for heterosexual cohabiting couples. If that is combined with my proposal, it might sink it because of the deep resentment it causes in some quarters, I think for good reason. My case before your Lordships is for the mere deferral of inheritance tax payable on the death of a first sister in a relationship that is never ended except by death, where there is undoubted commitment and where one needs to avoid rehousing, and where it would be sensible to avoid the need to move house or borrow large sums of money at a vulnerable stage in life. This fits exactly the Government policy of keeping people housed, recognising the arrangements that people want for each other, and respecting the elderly. It would also recognise the invaluable service performed by carers, such as that performed by the daughter who gives up her independent life for an elderly parent living in the same house. After decades of devoted care the parent dies and the tax problem is incurred by the devoted carer, who should be recognised. I think it is the policy of this Government to assist carers who do a good job and relieve the state of such burdens.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000108"></a>If my suggestion is not adopted, I and possibly many noble Lords will be very puzzled. We will wonder whether it is not necessary to have a Royal Commission on the financial recognition that should be given to the whole variety of relationships that exist today.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000109"></a>I can see no case for giving generous treatment to civil partners and married people when it is not available to those who cannot enter a formal relationship, whose contracts may not be recognised by the courts, and who, as the sisters say, have tried every way to avoid the burden of the inheritance tax that is likely to fall on one of them. I would be very grateful to meet the Minister to discuss this. I take the liberty of urging him in the mean time to undertake to achieve this small, cost-free and kind deferral in the Finance Bill, which would be welcomed by so many in this House and by so many who have rendered valuable service to each other and to society.</p>

One of the glories of the parliamentary system is the opportunities that it provides, away from the big set-piece debates and away from the clash of party animosities, for issues of principle and injustices to be raised in a manner in which one can have a civilised and straightforward  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC76"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>dialogue with the Government of the day. The noble Baroness has drawn attention to one of those issues involving small numbers of people, with no great lobby to support them, who suffer a severe injustice.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000111"></a>It is very hard to say anything original on this subject after the speech made by the noble Baroness and after the exchanges that have taken place on the Floor of the House. The situation is very clear, and she has set it out very clearly. Basically, one is repeating many of the same arguments, which does not diminish either their force or the feeling behind them.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000112"></a>In my opinion, the establishment of civil partnerships has rightly given same-sex couples the same tax situation on death as married couples. In this respect&#151;I am speaking here of financial and secular matters&#151;marriage has lost its special status and an equality, which I support, has been established. It has been established, as I understand it, in the context of a belief on the part of the Government, and again I support this view, that it is right to promote stable, long-term family partnerships. If it is right to do so outside the framework of traditional marriage, I find it very difficult to see the objection to the proposal that the noble Baroness has put forward. Two members of the same family&#151;whether sisters, brothers, parent and child, or, as the noble Baroness said, wider&#151;can have as much co-dependence and as much of a supportive relationship as married couples and civil partners. Indeed, precisely because of the informality of the arrangement and the fact that there is no way of formalising it in law, the bonds can in some respects be deeper, longer-lasting and of a very particular order, based on supportiveness and caring one for the other.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000113"></a>It is very difficult to see an argument in principle against this, and it is equally difficult to see an argument in practice. The problems of definition, which at one time seemed rather difficult, were admirably dealt with by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech. It may be that the Government would wish to change them in some respect, but basically they seem to be very straightforward. Therefore, I can see no rational argument, nor even a financial argument, why the proposal should not be accepted. Therefore, I add my voice to that of the noble Baroness and others in pleading with the Government to right a wrong for a small number of people, which will get very little publicity and which probably will not make any difference to their poll ratings, but which will be an act of justice and which will be thoroughly worthwhile.</p>
<h5><a name="08103047000192"></a>5.14 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08103047000114"></a><a name="81030-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81030-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08103047000212"></a>Lord Turnbull:</b> I start from the premise that inheritance tax has a valid role to play in our tax system. First, in a society in which social mobility is recognised to be declining, it is reasonable to take some steps to even up life chances. Secondly, the argument that inheritance tax is taxing assets that have already been taxed is largely false, since most of the assets being taxed are housing, on which no tax has ever been paid. I rather regret the auction of promises that broke out about a year ago. In particular, I feel that raising the allowance to &#163;1 million, then doubling it and allowing that to be transferable, goes too far.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC77"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000115"></a>Even under the old system, two groups of people felt particularly disadvantaged; namely, siblings and surviving carers. In particular, these people are often asset-rich and income-poor. The disadvantages can be narrowed down to two; namely, a disadvantage in cash flow when the bill is paid and a disadvantage in how much is paid. HMRC makes some concessions on the cash flow: a tax bill can be paid in instalments over 10 years at a quite modest rate of interest. It is argued that equity release products are available from banks and insurance companies to enable people to borrow the money. But even before the credit conditions of the past few months arose, I do not think that there was a queue of banks and insurance companies wanting to lend 80 year-old ladies &#163;10,000 this year, another &#163;10,000 the next and more the following year. That is not a valid response.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000116"></a>The sense of grievance among these groups has increased for two reasons. Those who benefit from the spouse arrangements have been widened by the Civil Partnership Act and the arrangements have been made more generous by transferability. There are two levels of remedy. First, siblings and carers could still be regarded as individuals, but when the tax bill crystallises on the first death, that amount could be deferred with modest interest until the second death, as proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech. The second remedy would be for these groups to be given the same benefits of transferability that are now available to people in marriages and civil partnerships.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000117"></a>In my view, the Government should accept the first remedy immediately, which does not break new ground. If, instead of leaving her share in the family home, the first sister leaves an old master painting, a plantation of trees, a farm or a business, the tax could be deferred even more generously than the existing 10-year arrangement. If this is accepted, it would deal with the cash-flow problem.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000118"></a>There would still, however, be the problem of equity. Previously, apart from when the tax was paid, the difference between the amounts of tax paid was not huge. But now it has become enormous and there is a case for saying that inheritance tax is transferred between generations. Here, in effect, there would be two transfers within the same generation; that is, the second sister would pay tax on her share of the joint wealth, plus the money that has been left to her after the first sister&#146;s share has been subjected to tax. In effect, you have two rounds of tax coming one on top of the other. There is provision in the Inheritance Tax (Formerly Capital Transfer Tax) Act 1984 for &#147;quick succession relief&#148;. There may be a way to build on this, but I am told that at the moment it does not operate generously.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000119"></a>Clearly, in this case, money is not the issue. According to last autumn&#146;s pre-Budget documents, the benefit of allowing spouses to pass money to a surviving spouse was &#163;1.9 billion. The proposal put forward by the Government to allow the allowance to be transferred would be another &#163;1.2 billion. In these absolutely colossal sums, if anyone wanted to raise that as an issue, I am confident that money could be found to deal with the probably limited number of cases indicated by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000121"></a>I want to say at the outset that the main objection to inheritance tax is not double taxation, but that the very rich do not pay and the burden of the tax falls on middle England. That is what is so unfair about it. Quick succession relief is no assistance at all because it will bite on the second death, not the first, and it is the first death where the problem lies.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000122"></a>I was fortunate to have the opportunity of having two debates on inheritance tax, the first on 1 February last year and the second, which was on inheritance tax and capital gains tax, on 22 April this year. In the first debate I had a measure of success, because I advocated, among other things, transferability of nil-rate bands, and six months later the Government introduced that and made a modest increase in the nil-rate band. That was welcome.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000123"></a>I made a point in both debates of suggesting that siblings should be treated more fairly. There should be fair treatment, but it has to be narrowly defined. My view is that there should be a more generous relief between brothers and sisters, although it should not really go further than that. They cannot marry&#151;that is a very powerful argument&#151;and they cannot form civil partnerships.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000124"></a>If one alters the rules and makes them more generous so that it carries through the generations, though, you will have opportunities for tax avoidance. For example, if a mother dies, leaving her estate to her bachelor or married son&#151;that is an exempt transfer because of what has then been allowed, which I am sure will not be allowed by the Government&#151;the son then has a large estate. Say he is a bachelor when he inherits from his mother but then marries and leaves his entire estate to his widow; again, that will be exempt. This has to be rather carefully dealt with.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000125"></a>There is a powerful point regarding carers, which I mentioned in both my debates. Carers should have a more satisfactory, fairer and more sympathetic tax regime. I wonder if the Minister can talk to us a little about the possibility that commercial arrangements can be made along the Boden and Ralli principles&#151;two cases in New South Wales from the early 20th century that are powerful precedents in this country&#151;such as constructive trusts and so forth. For example, at the age of 70, Mrs Bloggs says to her daughter, &#147;Please look after me, and when I die this house is yours&#148;, and the daughter does exactly that and forsakes the opportunity of buying a house herself. There should be something along those lines. It is possible, I venture to suggest, and it will be interesting to hear what the officials have to say about this, that constructive law and commercial arrangements should be upheld in those circumstances. To the extent of that particular asset, it should pass as part of a commercial arrangement. I declare that I have an argument along these lines currently going with the Capital Taxes Office. So far, not so good, I am afraid.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000126"></a>There are these close family relationships between brothers and sisters. They rely on each other and live  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC79"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>together. Of course they should be given favourable tax treatment. They should have an opportunity to make an inheritance tax election nominating their exempt beneficiary for inheritance tax purposes. If such an election were made, they should be treated, in terms of benefits and other such matters, as a married couple.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000127"></a>There is a plus, and possibly a minus, to that. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, has made a very powerful case but, in my view, it should be limited to brothers and sisters. That would be far fairer. In those circumstances, I can see no reason why the Government will not give a very modest degree of help. It is not as if these people are isolated; there are a great many people of that sort, especially living in rural England. I hope that the Government will think again on that point. I say again how grateful I am to the noble Baroness for raising this very important point.</p>

She has highlighted and made a very strong case demonstrating flagrant discrimination against sisters and other family members who have often cohabited for a long period. I totally endorse what she said.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000129"></a>However, in hoping that the Government agree to deal with that very small change in legislative terms, in the longer term, for reasons of equality, parity and basic fairness, that could not be restricted to siblings alone. I want to emphasise the situation of long-term carers who are not related, but who may have spent 20 years together and devoted their lives to caring for someone, forfeiting their chance of a decent income from work and a subsequent pension and even of an adequate social life. In such cases, we are punishing a person for not having a sexual relationship, which is an anomaly which I am sure that your Lordships&#146; House would want addressed and which I hope that the Government will take very seriously.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000130"></a>This is not restricted to women; it often applies to men. In fact, in 1986, in the UK, 11 per cent of unmarried men aged under 60, and 13 per cent of unmarried women aged under 60, cohabited. Those proportions had roughly doubled by 2006. Many of those households consist of carers and cared-for people for a very long time. <I>Social Trends</I> reports that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08103047000175"></a>&#147;The number of households with two or more unrelated adults sharing private accommodation ... has remained stable at 3 per cent&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08103047000171"></a>since that work was undertaken. Sometimes, those are family members. <I>Focus on Families</I> reports that the sample sizes of cohabiting carers are too small always to differentiate between carers and cohabiting relatives. We must take long-term carers into account.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000131"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness that any change in the law could initially be limited to sisters or family members, but in the long term, those anomalies must be addressed as a matter of some urgency to help people who, when the person they loved and cared for over many years dies, are suddenly left with having to get rid of the family home. That cannot continue and must be addressed.</p>

As far as I know, it is the first time that we have had such a debate to urge on our colleagues in the Commons an amendment to the Finance Bill. As a general principle, we in your Lordships&#146; House have too little influence on Finance Bills, so that is a particular reason to welcome the debate.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000133"></a>I start from the same position as the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, in believing that there is value in inheritance tax in terms of equality. I do not seek to undermine inheritance tax as a tax in any way. I also start with a background in this. My formative professional years were spent in Customs and Excise, where anyone who suggested any tax relief rapidly became a pariah among their colleagues. This experience and recollection are always on my shoulders.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000134"></a>In this case, the arguments as they relate to siblings are absolutely straightforward. I see no argument of any substance for denying siblings the right to benefit in the way that the noble Baroness proposes today. She referred to our debate on the Civil Partnership Bill, to which the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, proposed a broadly similar amendment. We voted against that amendment, more because of the overall context of the debate than the specific issue of inheritance tax and siblings.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000135"></a>We need to be very clear about the definition of other family members. My mother lives next door to a family whose son was born in the house and has lived in the house until today. He is now broadly speaking my age: perhaps slightly younger. His mother and father lived in the house with him. His father died, his mother recently died, and he is now living alone in the house. It is not clear whether he was ever formally a carer. He looked after his mother to a certain extent, but he certainly did not give up a career to do it. He gave up no more than anyone would give up when looking after a relative as they got older. It is not clear to me that he should automatically benefit from this kind of relief. As it happens, the house is not above the inheritance tax threshold.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000136"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, related to people over a certain age who had lived together for a certain amount of time; I think she proposed 12 years. These are narrowing definitions, which I would support, rather than a simple blanket provision.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000137"></a>The broader proposal made by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, warrants further consideration, because the value of carers to society is clearly very great. I have seen the old and frail parents of family members and friends having to rely on the state, on their own resources or on third parties to look after them, and finding either that the provision is not very good or that the financial burden of getting in paid caring staff is considerable. It is therefore in the interests of the state to see how carers can be supported in tax-efficient ways. This may be one way of doing it. It is not a proposal that I had heard about before today, however, and I want to look at it further before formally committing myself to it. It certainly has a number of merits.</p>

<p><a name="08103047000138"></a>I very much hope that the Minister can be rather more generous-spirited than he was when we debated this earlier this year. His arguments had little or no merit, frankly. I know him to be a generous-spirited man, and I look forward to his reply.</p>
<h5><a name="08103047000196"></a>5.33 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08103047000139"></a><a name="81030-gc0007.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="81030-gc0007.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08103047000216"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I do not think that I will be echoing those sentiments. I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, on securing this debate. As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, has pointed out, we are not normally allowed to dabble in tax matters, and are certainly never allowed to propose amendments to a Finance Bill or, indeed, to propose tax law generally. We are not, fortunately, prohibited from debating the issues, and we have had many fine debates on inheritance tax, led most recently by the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, and have had another good debate today.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000140"></a>Inheritance tax is an unfair tax. As the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, pointed out, it tends to attack middle England, while the rich can use a number of mechanisms to avoid or minimise its impact. Middle England has increasingly been dragged into the inheritance tax net, principally because house prices outstripped the general inflation increases to the IHT thresholds.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000141"></a>In the 10 years from 1997, the proportion of estates paying inheritance tax doubled to just under 6 per cent, though the changes that the Government made in this year&#146;s Finance Act should reduce that by about a third. The inheritance tax yield is actually very low. The Government raise relatively little from it. But, of course, in these straitened circumstances, with the Government&#146;s cupboard being virtually bare, any amount raised in taxes is something they would find difficult to give up, though it has to be noted that it is also one of the most expensive taxes to raise, with costs being over 1 per cent of the yield. Therefore, it is not a particularly efficient tax.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000142"></a>Overall, my party is not a fan of inheritance tax. We believe that there are theoretical objections to it. I note the views of the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, but we see the element of double taxation, because it taxes wealth which has been accumulated from taxed income&#151;perhaps not entirely, but it certainly does do that to some extent&#151;as a very important issue. We also believe that it does nothing to encourage savings. Unlike the Government, we believe that savings are an important issue. The savings ratio has virtually disappeared in the past 10 years. We think that there should be incentives to save. Even Mr Stephen Byers, not normally seen as a right-wing thinker, described inheritance tax as a penalty on hard work, thrift and enterprise.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000143"></a>But statistics and theories mean absolutely nothing to ordinary families. For them it is the possibility of paying inheritance tax on modest wealth which is so distressing. That is why the subject has a political resonance which goes way beyond the bare statistics of yield and numbers of estates paying tax.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000144"></a>My party&#146;s policy is to increase the inheritance tax exemption to &#163;1 million and this would be transferable between spouses and civil partners, as is the Government&#146;s exemption. The Government often copy our policies. They knew that we had touched a chord in middle  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC82"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>England when we announced our &#163;1 million exemption. However, instead of copying our policy properly, they produced their own half-baked version of transferability of the existing exemption limits. It is because the Government were so timid in relation to IHT that it remains a big issue. It may have been partly neutralised as between married couples and civil partners, but the increased generosity for them was not matched by generosity for any others. That is why there continues to be a call for some of the remaining inequities to be dealt with. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, has well outlined the case for cohabiting and dependent close family members, but the issue can as easily be dealt with by raising the threshold. If it were increased to &#163;1 million, as is our policy, the case that she has put would fall away because relatively few estates would need additional relief.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000145"></a>As has already been said, when the Civil Partnership Act was considered in your Lordships&#146; House, my noble friend Lady O&#146;Cathain, whom I am glad to see is in her place, successfully moved an amendment which would have allowed close family relations who had lived together for a period to register a civil partnership. I believe that the motivation behind my noble friend&#146;s amendment was the inequity of inheritance tax, though, of course, civil partnership brings in other tax and benefit changes. The Government overturned the amendment in another place. This was an area where my party, unlike the other parties, had a free vote. I have to say&#151;I think that my noble friend already knows this&#151;that I supported the Government&#146;s position on that, not because I have no sympathy for the dependent relatives involved, but because I was concerned, like the Government to keep the concept of civil partnership relatively discrete.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000146"></a>I have much sympathy with the issues that the noble Baroness raised so well this evening, but I am far from convinced that the answer lies in creating special tax reliefs. Our approach to tax is driven by a desire for simplicity. If the noble Baroness&#146;s wishes were granted, I can guarantee that for every line of tax legislation which introduced the reliefs, there would be 20 or 30 lines of anti-avoidance provisions. The noble Lord, Lord Burnett, with his inventive mind on this subject, referred to the possibilities for avoidance. This is the path that the Government have consistently taken on tax legislation over the past 10 years and it is the very antithesis of the path that my party would want to see tax legislation taking.</p>

<p><a name="08103047000147"></a>I am sorry not to be able to pledge my wholehearted support for the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, in the specifics of her proposals, but I hope she sees that we would want to achieve substantially the same result by another route.</p>

I want to address the politics first. I heard what the noble Baroness said in a little knockabout regarding the virtues or otherwise of inheritance tax. However, these are changing  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC83"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column GC83</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>times and if she is going to have a dip at the Government that we are concerned to maintain revenues&#151;we certainly are&#151;is she prepared to see no value in inheritance tax so that the ill-gotten gains of those huge bonuses and resources that have gone to bankers will be free of taxation when they pass on? She is welcome to argue that case, but I will maintain the position of the Government, which is that inheritance tax is an important part of taxation, although as she and other noble Lords have rightly indicated, it raises a relatively small proportion of the total resources available to the nation.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000149"></a>I will be cast as the bad guy because I am not going to be able to accept the argument put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, and supported so well by other noble Lords who have spoken in the debate. However, I understand entirely the motivation behind her proposal and the concern that fairness should be observed for our fellow citizens. We all recognise that although the Burden case did not convince the European Court of Human Rights and was rejected, we have sympathy for the nature of the case and we know of others in a similar position. If we were not concerned about this issue, we would be lacking in basic humanity and unable to see the difficulties that people can face. However, I want to emphasis this: the reason why we cannot accept the premise behind the noble Baroness&#146;s case is that we need a basis in law.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000150"></a>Before the recent legislation on civil partnerships, the reason why inheritance tax exemptions related only to married couples was straightforward. It was a question of the law: marriage is a state entered into as a legal position, and a civil partnership now reflects that. The trouble with any definition that departs from the law flows from two considerations. First, there will always be hard luck stories. If it was said, for example, that the exemption should apply to siblings who have lived together for 20 years, what of the pair of siblings where one of them dies after 19 years? There would be concern about such a situation and the problem of the hard-luck case would not be solved. The second difficulty is obvious enough. The moment we move from the straight legal position that clearly defines who is entitled and who is not, the Revenue would become involved in investigations and intensive scrutiny in order to see whether the couple qualify by meeting the criteria.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000151"></a>We all have proper reservations about the extent to which the Inland Revenue carries out inquiries of that kind. There are real difficulties about a sensitive circumstance after a death where scrutiny would have to be applied to the nature of the relationship that obtained before the death had occurred.</p>

We are not talking about one of the major revenue taxes in the land, but that does not alter the fact that taxes have to be applied with fairness.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000154"></a>At present, it can be in the interests of those who secure the inheritance to emphasise the costs that they may sustain, which might even lead to the loss of the house in which they live, which is the most acute loss. However, the Revenue is not in the business of turfing people out of their houses. In those circumstances, it carries out the process of deferral, which has been identified, over a period as long as 10 years, and graduates the payments that need to be made. I may appear somewhat heartless on behalf of the Treasury in not accepting the full argument that has been presented today, but I would be selling the Inland Revenue very short if I did not emphasise the care that is taken in circumstances where real hardship might obtain, particularly the loss of a home, through the application of the inheritance tax.</p>

When I brought this suggestion up in the first place, we thought that the house was the major capital asset. Things have changed, however. It is fine for the Minister to say that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs could defer the payment, but if the house were actually falling in value&#151;we are now realising that houses are not always an appreciating asset&#151;what would be the situation then? There would be genuine hardship. People would be left homeless, because there would no way they could pay the deferred tax on an asset that they knew at the end would leave huge debts.</p>

We are in changed circumstances, and those very circumstances mean that the Treasury is scrupulous in defending the revenue to which it is entitled. I understand what the noble Baroness is saying, and there may be a greater number of cases than at present where the necessity for deferral and consideration by the Treasury is to be taken into account. The Government have already said to mortgage lenders that we expect there to be consideration of special circumstances in order to minimise repossession so far as we can&#151;we all recognise that the numbers are increasing. By the same token, it is to be anticipated that the Revenue, which is well used to using deferral procedures with regard to inheritance tax, will have to deploy them rather more extensively if property values decline substantially and over a period of time. Of course, we all hope that we are talking about a drop that is not too far and a time period that is not too long. I hear what the noble Baroness says, and I merely give an assurance about the Revenue&#146;s responses to that position.</p>

The great danger is that any change could affect human behaviour. If it were the case, in the most extreme circumstances, that siblings merely living together for a year would solve the inheritance problem, we would see long-lost love between siblings who had been apart for a long period of time being brought together when illness occurred. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, thinks that I am little far-fetched on this. There are big resources at stake in particular circumstances of inheritance tax, and it would not be right for us to be innocent about that.</p>

The noble Baroness will recognise the position of the Treasury&#146;s defence on this. We have a clear definition in law of those who are entitled, and we would need a very clear definition before there was any possibility of departure. I do not accept that there is no cost involved as far as the Treasury is concerned. She will forgive me if I emphasise that point. It may be marginal, and it may be suggested that there is a counterbalance because people&#146;s behaviour in caring for each other may save the state costs in other respects. That is an issue that I know we will debate in future, as we have debated it so often.</p>

<a name="81030-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08103047000163"></a>From the point of view of the Treasury, there is bound to be the question of legal definition, and a substantial case has to be put against it&#151;at this time of all times&#151;of what the advantage would be against the inevitable cost in terms of lost revenue.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, also mentioned the possibility of some modest interest. After that initial 10 years, the fall-in to the Treasury of the total sum due would be exactly the same as now. The cost is so marginal that you can barely count it.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08103033000006"></a><a name="81030-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="81030-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08103033000043"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Bridget Prentice) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08103033000007"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence and I wish to make the following Statement to the House about the inquests of service personnel who have died overseas.  All deaths of members of our Armed Forces continue be a source of profound regret.  We sympathise deeply with their families. Our service men and women show the highest courage and professionalism as they work to protect the United Kingdom&#146;s interests and help to build strong, stable, democratic nations.  We cannot praise enough the job that they do, or pay high enough tribute to the ultimate sacrifice which some of them have made. </p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08103033000008"></a>Today, we are announcing the progress that has been made since the Written Ministerial Statement on 16 July 2008 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 28WS) with information about the conduct of inquests by the Oxfordshire, Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners.  This Statement gives the position at 23 October but does not reflect the 15 October death on operations in Afghanistan of Trooper Munday, as the inquest had not yet been opened. </p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08103033000009"></a>The tables which accompany this Statement again include information about those ongoing cases which involve a board of inquiry.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08103033000010"></a><I>Progress with inquests</I></p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08103033000011"></a>At the time of the last Statement, our departments reported that since additional funding had been provided by the Government to assist the Oxfordshire coroner, 180 inquests had been held&#151;166 into the overseas deaths of service personnel and 14 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08103033000012"></a>Since July, a further 29  inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel who died in operations overseas whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham.  This makes a total of 209 inquests held since June 2006. </p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08103033000013"></a>Since operations commenced there have been a total of 231 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including two servicemen who died in the UK of their injuries.  In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident. </p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08103033000014"></a>We are grateful for the efforts of all the coroners involved in conducting these inquests, and our two departments remain firmly committed in their support of the independent coronial system.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08103033000017"></a>The Statement in July reported that there were nine inquests to be held into the deaths of service personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton prior to 31 March 2007.  As at 20 October, there are three such inquests.  The Oxfordshire coroner has retained jurisdiction in two of these cases; the third has been transferred to the North Lincolnshire coroner. Hearing dates have been set in all three cases.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08103033000018"></a>The inquests for the 10 crew members who died together in the crash of Hercules XV179 on 30 January 2005 concluded on 22 October.  </p>
<I>Post-1 April 2007 Fatalities</I>
<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08103033000019"></a>Since October 2007, additional resources have been provided by the Government to ensure that a backlog of inquests will not build up in the Wiltshire and Swindon jurisdiction, now that fatalities are repatriated via RAF Lyneham.  The coroner, Mr Masters, is continuing the practice of transferring inquests for service personnel to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08103033000020"></a>There are 56 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel who died in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated after 1 April 2007.  Of these, Mr Masters has retained 28 inquests, whilst 28 inquests are being conducted by coroners closer to the next of kin.  Inquest hearing dates have been set in six of these cases.  Twenty-five of these inquests relate to deaths of service personnel who have died over the past six months.</p>
<I>Inquests into the deaths of service personnel who returned home injured</I>
<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08103033000021"></a>There remain four inquests to be held of service personnel who returned home injured and subsequently died of their injuries.  Inquest hearing dates have been set in two of these cases.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08103033000022"></a>We shall continue to keep the House informed on a quarterly basis about progress with the remaining inquests.  I have placed tables in the Library of the House which outline the status of all cases and date of death of each case.  Copies are also available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08103033000024"></a>It is of the greatest importance that the next of kin have full information about the progress of the inquest of their loved one.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08103033000025"></a>We remain committed to providing better support to bereaved service families.  The Written Ministerial Statement issued on 7 June 2007 by my right honourable friend the then Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) gave details of the support which was then being provided.  Since then, we have increased the number of family members who can travel and stay overnight if necessary, at public expense, to attend the repatriation ceremony; and two family members may attend any pre-inquest hearings, as well as the inquest itself, again at public expense.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08103033000026"></a>Visiting officers&#151;who are appointed to provide liaison between families and the services&#151;fulfil a crucial role, and we continue to give close attention to their selection and training. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08103033000027"></a>The Defence Inquests Unit, which was established by the Ministry of Defence on 1 May, now acts as the focal point for all coroners&#146; inquests into the deaths of service personnel and Ministry of Defence civilian personnel who die on or as a result of injuries sustained while on operations; and those who die as a result of training activity. The unit&#146;s key role is to assist coroners so that they can complete inquests satisfactorily and as quickly as possible. It reflects a firm commitment to the proper support of coroners and bereaved families and to learning the lessons of the process.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="08103033000028"></a><a name="81030-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="81030-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08103033000044"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> The Justice and Home Affairs Council was held on 24 October 2008 in Luxembourg. My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Jack Straw), my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Meg Hillier), the Scottish Minister for Community Safety (Fergus Ewing) and I attended on behalf of the United Kingdom. The following items were discussed.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08103033000029"></a>The morning of the council focused on interior items and commenced with the Mixed Committee, which included Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. The legal migration texts on the second-generation Schengen information system (SIS II) were adopted. The Commission noted that testing on the central system had been suspended due to technical difficulties, but that tests should recommence on 5 November. The Commission stated that the stability of the central system and minimising the impact on timetabling were a priority. On the Schengen information system network (SISNET), the council secretariat reported that migration had progressed well and was scheduled to finish on 25 October.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08103033000030"></a>Cybercrime was the first item discussed on the main agenda. The council conclusions were agreed and the presidency stated that the new EU platform hosted by Europol would enable the EU to combat cybercrime. The incoming Czech presidency announced that it would be holding a ministerial conference entitled &#147;Safer Internet for Children&#148; on 28 April 2009 in Prague.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08103033000031"></a>Next the council conclusions on the principle of convergence were agreed. The presidency explained how convergence consisted of the need to be pragmatic and concrete, and to find specific areas where the EU could work more closely together in an atmosphere of trust. Hungary made a short presentation on the work of the Salzburg forum, an example of regional co-operation.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08103033000032"></a>In the discussion on west African drug trafficking, the presidency stressed the strategic importance of tackling the emerging issue of trafficking at an early stage. The UK welcomed the presidency's initiative, emphasising the dramatic trends which had been seen in drug trafficking from west Africa. The experience of the maritime analysis operations centre (MAOC) demonstrated what could be achieved with concerted EU action. The UK welcomed the Czech and Swedish  


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS102"></a><b>30 Oct 2008 : Column WS102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>presidencies' priority on this issue, and supported the French presidency's proposal that west Africa should be a priority region in the next EU drugs strategy.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08103033000033"></a>During a discussion on passenger name records (PNR), the UK welcomed progress made during the French presidency, highlighting the beneficial experience that the UK had with using passenger name records to date. The UK thought there should be progress by the time of the European elections next June, and that the final instrument should allow member states to focus on those flights which were thought to present the greatest risk, rather than obliging them to collect data on all flights. The Czech presidency invited the UK to help organise a road show on the benefits of a PNR system. The current presidency concluded that they would provide a report to the JHA Council in November.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08103033000034"></a>Over lunch, the presidency pushed the case for a guaranteed minimum availability of civil protection resources at EU level&#151;a system of European mutual assistance. The UK, together with other member states, shared strong concerns about the proposed standby rota system. The presidency stressed that this did not mean assets would be left idle, and emphasised that member states would have the right to reserve assets in the case of a national emergency.  The key element of the proposed system was the ability to know what assets were available and to be able to plan on that basis.  The Commission supported the presidency's analysis and welcomed the proposed system of European mutual assistance.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08103033000035"></a>Also over lunch, the Commission called for Ministers to consider the potential role of security technology in the post-Hague programme, to see what potential there was for new technologies to contribute to policy priorities, and to support the private sector in developing such technology.  The Czech Republic noted that this issue would be among its presidency priorities.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08103033000036"></a>In the afternoon the council reached political agreement on the council decision on the European criminal records information system (ECRIS). The UK welcomed agreement of an important measure to protect the public, and hoped that it would be possible to build on this in the future to cover monitoring of offenders, especially sex offenders. The Commission welcomed the rapid agreement and looked forward to implementation. It outlined the technical and financial assistance that was available to member states. The presidency thanked all member states for their co-operation and welcomed the political agreement reached.</p>

<a name="81030-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08103033000037"></a>The council reached political agreement on the text of the proposal for a council regulation on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and co-operation in matters relating to maintenance obligations. The UK has not opted into this proposal. The UK thanked the presidency, Commission and other member states for their positive work to find a solution to the UK&#146;s concerns about the use of rules of applicable law in family cases. We explained that the matter remained subject to parliamentary scrutiny in the UK, but hoped to be in a position to indicate the UK&#146;s wish to accept the measure after it had been adopted, under the terms of our protocol.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08103033000038"></a>The council approved the conclusions on the situation of vulnerable adults and their cross-border legal protection. The guidelines encourage member states that have not yet acceded to the Hague convention of 13 January 2000 on the international protection of vulnerable adults to sign and/or ratify it as soon as possible. The UK has already ratified this convention in respect of Scotland, and work is in hand to extend such ratification to the rest of the UK. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08103033000039"></a>The council agreed a resolution of the council and representatives of the Governments of member states for a set of non-binding guidelines on judicial training, designed to encourage the bodies responsible for training of judges and prosecutors to improve training in European law, and promote understanding of other member states&#146; legal systems.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="08103035000011"></a>New varieties of crops, more productive and better able to withstand drought, have increased the yields of staple crops grown in arid and semi-arid areas, For example, drought-tolerant varieties of maize, developed with DfID support, increase farmers&#146; yields by 25-30 per cent and are being grown on more than 1 million hectares in Africa. Sorghum varieties have been developed and released which increase farmers&#146; yields by over 50 per cent. In total over 400 new varieties of drought-tolerant and more productive crops have been developed and released in Africa by international agriculture research centres.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a><a name="08103035000022"></a>The western Orissa rural livelihoods project, with a budget of &#163;32.75 million, focuses on improving opportunities for very poor people to earn a decent living. The project aims to benefit 400,000 poor people from four districts including 140,000 people from scheduled tribes and 60,000 from scheduled castes. The project commenced in 2000 and will run over a period of 10 years. A recent review found that good progress was being made, with income levels in the target communities rising steadily.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a><a name="08103035000023"></a>The Orissa tribal empowerment and livelihoods programme is jointly supported by DfID, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Government of Orissa and the programme beneficiaries. DfID's contribution is &#163;9.76 million over six years, from 2004 to 2010, and is intended to improve incomes, water and sanitation and reduce malnutrition in very poor tribal areas. The programme aims to benefit poor people from eight districts with a total population of 1.7 million people. 75,000 households are being directly targeted, including 315,000 people from scheduled tribes and 37,500 from scheduled castes.</p>
