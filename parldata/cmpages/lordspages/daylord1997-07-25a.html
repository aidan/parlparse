<P>
<A NAME="70725-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para0"></a>I hope I may be permitted to say a few words on a matter not directly related to the Bill. I understand that today was the last occasion when we were led in our prayers by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool. I believe that your Lordships would wish to place on record our deep appreciation of his contributions to our proceedings over many years. His wisdom, his experience and, perhaps above all, his compassion for those who are underprivileged or vulnerable have offered us guidance which has been appreciated in every part of the House. I am old enough to remember his impressive feats in a different capacity. It is not given to everyone to achieve the highest distinction in two careers, and to that he has added a capacity for friendship which many of us have been privileged to share. I am sure he will take with him the affectionate recollection of every Member of your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para1"></a>This Bill is intended primarily to address a problem which is almost universally recognised. Attempts to diagnose the reasons for the problem and to suggest remedies have not always attracted quite the same degree of unanimity. However, the process of consultation and discussion since at least the end of 1994 has brought about something akin to a consensus. Even on matters of detail I believe that the differences between us are narrowing.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para2"></a>Industrial tribunals were established by the Industrial Training Act of 1964. Since then their jurisdiction has been increased year by year and statute by statute. Originally at least, they represented the confluence of two processes. First, there was some feeling among those representing employees that the judiciary prior to the 1960s had sometimes failed to understand, still less to share, their perceptions of what was just and they looked for a way of resolving employment disputes which depended less on the courts. Secondly, there was at one time a mistrust of tribunals, exemplified in the book by Lord Hewart, then Lord Chief Justice, called The New Despotism and published in 1929. It was still influential in some circles when I was a student, although I hasten to add that that was nearly 50 years ago.
<P>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1578</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para3"></a>That mistrust was evaporating by the 1960s. It has been accepted, at least since the Franks Report in 1957, that tribunals are a constituent part of the rule of law, and that they offer a number of advantages for a range of issues. They are less formal and rather more expeditious than the courts exercising more traditional jurisdictions; their members can offer an expertise and an experience in a specific field which it is difficult for the traditional courts to match; and the pattern of a legally qualified chairman and two members with experience and knowledge of the background against which disputes arise generates much confidence in those who appear before them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para4"></a>The Donovan Report in 1968 recommended a substantial expansion in the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals to include all the disputes which were distributed then among a variety of jurisdictions, to provide,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an easily accessible, speedy, informal and inexpensive procedure", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para5"></a>for the settlement of disputes. Indeed, my noble friend Lord Wedderburn had already made a similar plea in his book The Worker and the Law. He may be cheered to learn that I have a well thumbed copy on my shelves.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para6"></a>Since then the nature and the quantity of cases coming before industrial tribunals have expanded until, in 1996-97, the number of applications was 88,910 and the forecast for the year 2000 is over 109,000. Their standards are high. The service which they provide is one of which they can be proud. Perhaps this may be the moment to declare at least a potential interest. I am privileged to chair the Council on Tribunals. Among the 70 tribunal systems which are within our supervision are the industrial tribunals. In a succession of annual reports we have commented on issues that have arisen in relation to them as to other tribunals. But I see and I hear of them in practice. The public receives a most commendable service in return for the resources invested. I wish to pay tribute to the leadership and hard work of the president, Judge Timothy Lawrence, which I see at first hand, and to all those who form part of the system, whether judicial or administrative.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para7"></a>Nevertheless, the expansion of their workload has led to delays in the hearing of cases. Those responsible for the administration of industrial tribunals have made serious efforts to respond. In 1991 an internal efficiency scrutiny made recommendations to address the problem relating to listing practice, the numbers of sitting days for full-time chairmen, and training for administrators. In its annual report for 1995 the Council on Tribunals referred to a number of initiatives by the president, Judge Lawrence, such as standard procedures where there are late entries of appearance, or where applicants cannot be traced. The proportion of cases reaching a hearing within 26 weeks has risen from 56 per cent. in 1993-94 to over 78 per cent. in 1996-97.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para8"></a>But the problem persists, and is particularly worrying since one of the advantages usually associated with tribunals is their expedition. A further concern is that, owing to the increasing complexity of some of the legislation which industrial tribunals have to administer, their claim to informality, which is sometimes equated with an absence of legalism, is under some pressure.
<P>


<a name="column_1579"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1579</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para9"></a>In December 1994, the Department of Employment, as it then was, published a Green Paper entitled Resolving Employment Rights Disputes--Options for Reform. It evoked some 200 responses. Virtually all of them agreed on the need to address the problems; most of them agreed in substance with the proposed direction of the Green Paper, although some discerned dangers in a number of the proposals and were concerned to suggest safeguards--including the Council on Tribunals.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para10"></a>In November 1995 the then Government brought together those proposals from the Green Paper which had secured substantial support, and published a draft Bill. It reflected many of the comments and qualifications that had been received. In July 1996 the draft Bill was circulated for further consultation. In response to that exercise, the department--now the Department of Trade and Industry--received 95 responses, mostly supportive, but some making further suggestions for safeguards.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para11"></a>The matter proceeded no further because the election intervened and the former government were no longer in a position to proceed. But the proposals were not by then greatly controversial, and the incoming Government considered the situation, made some amendments to the draft to reflect the comments that had been received in the course of the further consultations, and prepared a new Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para12"></a>At this stage I should explain my symbiotic relationship with the Government in relation to the Bill. The Government would be pleased to see it on the statute book. So would I, and many others. But the Government, as your Lordships are already discovering, are faced with a heavy legislative programme. When I learnt that the Government did not intend to include the Bill in their programme for this Session but were prepared to make the text available to me, I ventured to introduce it, so that this House would not be denied an opportunity of considering it and, if it finds favour, of passing it for transmission to another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para13"></a>Time was not available to me for further consultations, nor for such redrafting as I might have been tempted to undertake. But I may say at once that I am not necessarily wedded to every jot and tittle in the Bill. I look forward today to hearing the contributions of those noble Lords who propose to participate, and naturally I shall then consider carefully what is said. Some noble Lords were kind enough to advise me in advance of suggestions that they may make during the course of our debates. There are a number of noble Lords whose expertise in this field probably always exceeded mine, and is now certainly more up-to-date than mine. I shall welcome any advice that they may tender.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para14"></a>But I hope I may be forgiven if, in order to keep expectations within realistic bounds, I make three provisos. First, there may be procedural limitations on the amendments or additions to the Bill. Secondly, the Bill has emerged from a long process of consultation and I feel inhibited in introducing major revisions without consulting those whose interests are most likely <P>


<a name="column_1580"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1580</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be affected. Thirdly, the Bill's prospects of completing its pilgrimage successfully are substantially improved by the fact that it enjoys the good will of the Government. If I were to do anything which might endanger that good will, the prospects of survival for the whole Bill would be substantially reduced. On a number of matters which many of us would like to see enacted, the Government have already embarked on quite separate consultative processes, and if my noble friend Lord Haskel were to indicate that some proposals should be the subject of separate legislation, I would respect that. Subject to those comments, my mind is open and welcoming.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para15"></a>I turn now to the proposals in the Bill. Essentially they fall into two categories. Part I is designed to improve procedures in order to make better use of the tribunals' time and resources so as to assist them in coping with the workload. Parts II and III are intended to provide alternative means of resolving certain disputes, both in order to reduce the workload confronting tribunals and because in some cases they may prove to be a more satisfactory method of resolving the issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para16"></a>If I were to embark on an exposition of all the provisions in the Bill, I doubt whether I should earn your Lordships' gratitude. I hope I may be permitted simply to indicate the more important of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-01_para17"></a>Clause 2 empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations permitting tribunals in certain circumstances to determine proceedings without a full hearing. The first such circumstance is where the parties have given their consent in writing. One matter which has exercised my mind is whether it will be possible to ensure that the consent will operate only if each party had first received adequate advice.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   Hear, hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   I fully understand my noble friend's concern and I think it is something which he and I may have a number of discussions about as the Bill proceeds. I hope he will not be disappointed if I say that I have reached the conclusion, at least provisionally, that it would not be appropriate to write that condition into the Bill, for two reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para0"></a>First, I think we should be reluctant in principle to compel a party to take advice if he or she does not wish to do so. There is a right not to be advised if that is the individual's choice. That is the objection of principle. The more practical objection is that, if the Bill were to provide that consent would be ineffective in the absence of advice, it would be necessary for the tribunal and other parties to the proceedings to ascertain in advance of proceedings what advice had been given and taken, by whom and with what qualifications, since otherwise the determination would be invalidated. That would entail either an unacceptable administrative burden on all concerned or a continuing uncertainty as to whether or not the determination was valid. But, while for those reasons I would not seek to include in the Bill a provision about advice, it does not follow that I would not wish to see parties strongly encouraged to seek competent advice before consenting.
<P>


<a name="column_1581"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1581</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para1"></a>The second situation in which provision is made for a determination without a full hearing is where the respondent has taken no steps to contest the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para2"></a>The third situation is where the applicant is seeking relief to which he or she is clearly not entitled, either because it is of a kind which the tribunal has no power to give or because it is clear on the face of the application that there is no entitlement--for example, if the applicant has not been in the respondent's employment for the requisite length of time.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para3"></a>The fourth situation is where the tribunal is bound by the decision of a superior court on the undisputed facts to dismiss the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para4"></a>It is thus hoped to minimise hearings which are simply wasted and to clear the lists for genuinely contested cases. In each of these situations existing rights of appeal or rights to apply to the tribunal for a review of the determination are, of course, preserved.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para5"></a>The fifth situation is where the proceedings relate to a preliminary issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para6"></a>In all these situations, what is proposed is that tribunals may be empowered in suitable cases to determine proceedings without a full hearing. It is not proposed to make that procedure mandatory; it would be for the tribunal to decide whether it was suitable in a particular case.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para7"></a>Clause 3 extends the situations in which a decision may be made by a chairman sitting alone. Perhaps I may interject here that, although in some of the circles in which I move the term "chairman" is now out of fashion, since it is used in statutes and in the Bill I propose to use it on this occasion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-02_spnew2"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear, hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, I am among those who believe that a tribunal of three persons brings strengths and advantages to proceedings relating to employment rights and I hope that the tribunal will continue normally to be constituted in that way.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para8"></a>The Green Paper suggested that in certain cases it should be mandatory for a chairman to sit alone. That proposal is not in the Bill. It would still be open to a chairman to sit in a tribunal of three if he or she thinks it appropriate in a specific case.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para9"></a>Clause 3 specifies a number of additional situations where it will be open to a chairman to sit alone. They relate to cases where it is unlikely that there will be major disputes of fact or arguments about what is fair or reasonable. Perhaps the most important relates to redundancy payments, where the dispute is normally over the application of a formula or sometimes simply where there has been a failure to pay money which is clearly due.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para10"></a>I turn now to the provisions relating to alternative methods of resolving disputes. Clause 7 empowers ACAS to prepare a scheme providing for arbitration in claims for unfair dismissal. At present it has no power to concern itself with arbitration in disputes between individual employees and employers. It will then be for the Secretary of State, if she approves the scheme, to <P>


<a name="column_1582"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1582</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>make an order bringing it into effect. If that is done, the parties may, if they wish, agree in writing to submit their dispute to arbitration under that scheme and, if they do so, that will be an alternative to resolving the dispute by proceedings before the tribunal. They will in effect have agreed to exclude the jurisdiction of a tribunal.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para11"></a>I stress that no one will be compelled to submit their dispute to arbitration. This procedure depends on the voluntary agreement of the parties and the jurisdiction of the tribunal will be excluded only if the agreement comes about in the course of action by a conciliation officer or if it is done by way of a valid compromise agreement after independent advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para12"></a>I should also stress that the parties are not precluded, if they wish to do so, from submitting their dispute to a private arbitration not within the ACAS scheme as they may now; but, if they do so, the jurisdiction of the tribunal will not be excluded. This represents an important change from the proposals in the consultation paper. It was then proposed to enable parties to exclude the jurisdiction of the tribunal by referring the dispute to any form of arbitration. That proposal is now confined to arbitration within the ACAS scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para13"></a>It is intended in the first instance to confine the subject matter of this provision to claims for unfair dismissal. As at present drafted, the Bill proposes to empower the Secretary of State to extend the provision to other forms of dispute and she would do so by an order subject to the negative form of parliamentary control.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para14"></a>It appears to me that there are two objections to that. The first is one of principle. The Council on Tribunals has long taken the view that a new jurisdiction should be created, where possible by primary legislation, and failing that by order subject to the affirmative procedure. What is proposed in Clause 7 is the creation of further jurisdiction.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para15"></a>Secondly, while your Lordships may think that arbitration may be eminently suitable to resolve some disputes relating to unfair dismissal, often more informally and more expeditiously than would be possible with industrial tribunals, that is not true of all types of dispute, where sometimes the legislative provisions are complex. A proposal to extend the option to other jurisdictions should be subject to full parliamentary control. Accordingly, I propose to move an amendment in Committee providing that any such order should be subject to the affirmative procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para16"></a>One other provision, designed among other purposes to reduce the workload of tribunals, is found in Clause 13. It provides that in unfair dismissal cases, if an employee fails to avail himself of an internal procedure for appealing against dismissal, or if an employer prevents an employee from availing himself of such a procedure, that may be taken into account by the tribunal in deciding the compensatory award.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para17"></a>The purpose of that provision is to encourage parties to resolve the dispute at its source, where possible, in preference to complaining to the tribunal. That is a general principle which runs through many systems of jurisprudence. The question is asked, "Have you availed yourself of the more immediate remedies?"
<P>


<a name="column_1583"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1583</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para18"></a>But there are three safeguards in the Bill: first, the amount of any reduction or supplementary award is limited to two weeks' pay; secondly, the provision operates against an employee only if he has been notified in writing of the existence of the internal procedure; and, thirdly, the tribunal has a general discretion to take into account all the circumstances of the case. The tribunal will, of course, take into account the ACAS code of practice on disciplinary practice and procedures, as required by Section 207 of the 1992 Act. That code declares it good practice to give notice of disciplinary action in writing and the employee should at the same time be told of any right of appeal. It also indicates that management should seek to secure the involvement of employees at all levels in introducing or changing new disciplinary procedures.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para19"></a>Your Lordships will be pleased to hear that I mention only one other provision. I apologise for the length of time that I have delayed your Lordships but it is a somewhat lengthy Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para20"></a>Clause 1 of the Bill proposes to rename industrial tribunals as employment tribunals because that term conveys more clearly what their function is intended to be. Some of your Lordships may remember that in 1968 the Donovan Commission suggested a change of name to "labour tribunals" but their suggestion was never implemented. This appears to be a suitable opportunity to address the question.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para21"></a>One has only to glance at the provisions which now form the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals to see how far we have come since the 1960s. There are rights for which some of us in this Chamber were campaigning for many years. The pendulum has swung backwards and forwards but in many ways we are a more just community than we were 30 years ago. Yet, justice depends on the effectiveness of its procedures and the price of effective procedures is eternal vigilance. The Bill is designed to tighten some procedural nuts and bolts. I commend it to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para22"></a>Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.--(Lord Archer of Sandwell.)

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble and learned friend on bringing forward this important measure and hope that the Government will find ample time for its examination. It is more than a privilege to follow him so directly in the batting. It had been suggested to me that, although this was a Friday, I might find myself placed further down the list as some kind of nightwatchman. But there is no need for time to allow more coverage of the many points which he has explained to your Lordships. I understand that the Bill has found a certain degree of broad consent from the TUC and the CBI, subject to certain caveats. Of course, nobody is perfect, as my noble friend would be the first to say. It is, of course, our task to detect and correct any defects.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para23"></a>The structural origins, as my noble and learned friend made clear, lie in the Conservative Government's Green Paper of 1994 and in the Bill of 1996, which has to <P>


<a name="column_1584"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1584</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>some degree a similar structure to the present Bill. But it must be said that parts of that Bill had the look of a cost-cutting exercise. In my view, my noble and learned friend is to be congratulated on deleting some parts of the Bill which were also rather unfair in terms of the costs that they put upon applicants.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para24"></a>However, it will be necessary when we come to Committee to look very carefully at the proposals for chairman-only hearings or, in one case, chairman plus one wing member instead of the full three. The presidents of the tribunals have highlighted, as key to the system, the tripartite nature of the tribunals. Perhaps I may interpose a comment on the statistics. My noble and learned friend is correct in saying that the number of cases has gone up sharply. But studies of the tribunals suggest that the increase in the number of cases owes as much, if not more, to the increase in the nature of the jurisdictions which have been added--especially, of course, the Wages Act--as well as to social reasons, when certain types of case are likely to emerge from social change, such as redundancy. In that respect, it seems to be more than arguable that the tribunals are dealing with the average unfair dismissal case today with level pricing, a charge for the tribunals' account, as it were, which is slightly less than it used to be 10 or 15 years ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para25"></a>The last major research exercise on the tribunals was the work of Professor Linda Dickens at Warwick in 1985. I shall come back to that in a moment. But the Bill is being introduced at a time when the Department of Trade and Industry itself has commissioned research in Manchester, at UMIST, under Professor Goodman on the relationship between the tribunals and in-house procedure clauses on unfair dismissal, the outcome of which could be extremely important to Clause 13. I sent the Minister a note about one or two matters but I am afraid that at the time I was too full of antibiotics to expand on that. If we could have his response on the position of the Manchester research sometime before Committee, it would be more than welcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para26"></a>We must remember that, since their creation in 1964, the tribunals have become what the Ministry of Labour then predicted one year later; a nucleus of labour courts for individual protection rights. In parenthesis, perhaps I may say how sad it is that we are the only jurisdiction among comparable countries that does not have a ministry or department of employment or of labour which focuses national attention upon employment and industrial relations as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para27"></a>The rights of the weaker parties in employment law now depend significantly on the maintenance of the integrity of those tripartite tribunals. In understanding this Bill, one special difficulty--I put this point to my noble and learned friend as a matter to be thought about before Committee--is that the memorandum which accompanied the Conservative Bill in 1996 gave all kinds of illustrations about matters which on the face of the Bill itself are obscure. The best example is the creation of a new kind of judge called "a legal officer" who will decide interlocutory issues. I believe that was first discussed by the Justice report in 1987. I am sure that your Lordships will know that interlocutory issues are frequently crucial in litigation.
<P>


<a name="column_1585"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1585</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para28"></a>Because the Bill tells us nothing about the qualification or nature of those legal officers, although the schedule says that they are to be paid, it is rather difficult to know how to discuss them. Can we discuss them with reference to the 1996 memorandum or not? The text is the same as in the Bill but, for the rest, they are mysterious figures, hidden away, their wellbeing as uncertain as the health of Schrodinger's cat.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-02_para29"></a>There is also a special problem in relation to the proposal, which is surely the central and major proposal of the Bill, for alternative dispute resolution of unfair dismissal cases with the assent of both parties by way of arbitration under an ACAS scheme having binding effect. The 1996 memorandum on that contained an annex outline--rather an unsatisfactory outline--of a scheme. But, naturally, the Bill does not hold any such assistance for us. Perhaps we may have a similar scheme from the department before Committee. It would be useful because, first, a number of trade unions and some employers have objections to extending the new procedure of arbitration to discrimination cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord would allow me to interrupt him. We are all in a difficulty over this because the scheme will be prepared by ACAS and not by the Department of Trade and Industry. Until ACAS is empowered to prepare the scheme, it is very difficult to predict what scheme it will prepare. Although I fully understand my noble friend's point, we are probably all in the same difficulty here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Yes, I did not want to make the difficulties even more difficult, but I shall do so. The problem in 1996 was that the scheme appeared to be outlined by the Government with the approval of ACAS, although it was not explicitly said to be the case. I understand that the Government may not wish to do that. I am asking for some informal, non-binding, tripartite document which suggests vaguely, better than the legal officers, some idea of what the scheme would look like. I put it to my noble and learned friend (who knows it very well as he helped to draft the Bill) that the 1996 scheme is based upon a text in the Bill which is not so different from the present one. I simply ask whether we are to look at that as a possibility or are we to be told, "No, that is out; it is something else and we shall tell you when the time comes"? I will be frank with my noble and learned friend: when we come to this matter in Committee, I shall suggest that there should be consultations with the department of state and ACAS at rather different and additional times to those required by the clauses.

<A NAME = "70725-03_para0"></a>It is fashionable and to a great extent true that "legalism" has overcome the tribunals. I do not believe that that has much to do with the introduction of lawyers--I must speak carefully because I am a lawyer. We all know plenty of legalistic barrack-room lawyers who are not lawyers, and we all know many lawyers whose great ability has been to put legalism aside and find a commonsense answer. One only needs to think of Lord Goodman, whose expertise in that direction was incomparable.

<A NAME = "70725-03_para1"></a>To reverse the trend towards undue legalism research suggests that reform in procedure must be matched by reform in substantive law. Unfair dismissal is one area where we may put the lawyers out of the door; we may bring arbitration in; but we shall make little difference if we do not change the substantive law of what is the definition of an "unfair dismissal". The history of the French tribunals--the Conseils de Prud'hommes--suggests the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para2"></a>That is why I wonder about those who believe so strongly in the new arbitration scheme. I am not against it. It is rather like sliced bread. It is impossible to be against it in the form in which it stands in the present Bill. Experience of wholly voluntary arbitration which ousts the tribunals altogether (as Professor Dickens suggested in her work) is not a firm guide for a scheme which is, as in the Bill, legally-based arbitration. I mean by that arbitration which is within a structure, within a statute, based not merely upon the consent of the two parties. Legally-based arbitration is subject to the High Court by way of judicial review, if not in other ways. It may be necessary to ensure that the interpretation of the law by arbitrators--especially if it is open only to judicial review--does not diverge to the assumptions or interpretations of the law for those cases which have chosen to go the parallel route.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para3"></a>Although the arbitrator will concentrate upon the facts, nevertheless, no determination by an arbitrator can avoid a finding of the legal base of his or her arbitration award. In other words, we have two legally-based channels for disputes. A certain finesse must now be introduced if we are not to wait until we find that there is a clash between the two channels and depend merely upon judicial review. I do not have an answer. It may be worth spending the summer finding an answer to the possible clashes between the two legally-based ways of solving employment disputes.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para4"></a>Perhaps I may put forward two final points. First, the position of the employee as the weaker party is the constant care of legislation--that must be so--in relation to tribunals. But that makes even more important so-called compromise agreements where employees are allowed to abandon their rights in agreements with other parties. That is quite a new phenomenon; it did not exist before 1993 as compromise agreements. The Bill extends the notion of qualified compromise agreements, largely by removing the restriction on the advice which must be given being advice given by a qualified independent lawyer.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para5"></a>Most people will respond positively to that--they like ejecting lawyers from things. The trouble with the Bill is that it just leaves it at that. So long as the person giving the advice is properly insured under a contract of insurance or an indemnity provided for by members of a professional body (against his or her negligence, obviously) it seems that anyone can now give independent advice. I have made inquiries, and not only would that cover a suitable arrangement with union officials, which I take to be the object of this clause--it is sensible, if there is proper insurance, to have union officials who are very much experts in this subject giving advice--but it would also cover accountants, dentists and osteopaths being able to give independent <P>


<a name="column_1587"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1587</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>advice. The prowess of dentists and osteopaths on points of employment law is not noted, at any rate so far as concerns the books on points of employment law. That is the first important area of compromise agreements.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para6"></a>Secondly, we find that deductions from compensation for unfair dismissal may be made when an employee has failed to make use of an in-house procedure. My noble friend has managed to shorten the clause by saying that a maximum of two weeks' compensation will be involved. But that may occur where an in-house procedure has been provided by the employer and the employee has not made use of it. When we come to Committee, I shall propose that that part of the Bill is unfair to employees. Except for a general jurisdiction of the tribunals, the test of whether it is a proper in-house procedure is merely the choice of the employer. The Bill says "provided by the employer". It should be the case that such in-house procedure agreements on unfair dismissal, if they are to be a ground for diminishing the compensation of an employee, should be negotiated with an independent trade union or there be in place some equivalent manner of testing its propriety.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para7"></a>Because of the special character and importance of my noble friend's Bill, I have dwelt on parts of it. I wished to give some idea of the points we should look at in Committee, but none of those remarks leaves me in any doubt but that your Lordships will wish to give the Bill unanimous approval on this, its Second Reading.

<P>
<A NAME="70725-03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the intentions behind the Bill so ably introduced by my noble and learned friend Lord Archer. Of course, it is necessary that unfair dismissal claims should be processed more speedily than at present. As we heard, there is already a large backlog of cases waiting to be heard by industrial tribunals and the situation in regard to cases going to appeal is even worse.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para8"></a>There are reasons for that heavy load of cases. We are living through an era of destabilised employment. Unemployment figures may be reducing, but the lack of security for those in employment remains as great as ever. That is not only a product of globalisation and technology, although they play a part. The previous government made a virtue of so-called "flexibility". It may have been right for employers, at least in the short term, but not for employees. Constant downsizing was bound to lead to increases in the number of people who felt that they had been dismissed unfairly.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para9"></a>I do not subscribe to the view that there is now no alternative to the instability that is a feature of many working environments. It is socially unacceptable since it is hardly possible to create the conditions for stable family life without stable employment. Those are issues which the new Government will have to tackle--from a quite different philosophical standpoint, one hopes, than that of their predecessors. The Conservative Party does not yet realise the part that lack of job security played in their downfall; it had begun to affect people who hitherto regarded themselves as being in safe employment and who were largely Conservative supporters.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para10"></a>Pending discussion of these vital issues, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, is right to urge that something must be done to deal with the cases which have accumulated and to press for alternative procedures. The radical proposal is that unfair dismissal cases should be dealt with by a system of arbitration. As we have heard, industrial tribunals, when first established, were intended to be informal courts where individuals did not need to incur the cost of legal representation. However, as everyone knows--this was referred to by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn--the situation has rapidly changed and has become much more legalistic. Although, in my union, we preferred to have members represented by trade union officials who understood the working environment and the union agreements covering their terms and conditions, most employers chose legal representation. Many union officials, including myself, who represented members before industrial tribunals felt that we did very well because we understood the conditions which governed the way in which our members worked and the agreements we had negotiated.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para11"></a>Arbitration may be a better way of dealing with some cases of unfair dismissal. Certainly it should be speedier. The length of time, in most instances, spent awaiting hearings at industrial tribunals makes a mockery of the provisions in legislation for reinstatement. After a gap in time--even longer, of course, if the case goes to appeal--reinstatement simply ceases to be a realistic option even though it is within the powers of the IT and the EAT to award it. I was once a member of the Central Arbitration Committee. We did not consider individual unfair dismissals, but we did deal with a range of other disputes--I think effectively. However, the CAC was ultimately written out of most of the relevant legislation by the previous government who did not really like arbitration and favoured unrestrained employer power.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para12"></a>I understand the TUC believes that the simple arbitration process suggested in the Bill is suitable for straightforward unfair dismissal cases only. However, as we have heard, the Bill makes provision for extending by order the arbitration scheme to include sex, race and disability discrimination. Those can be very complicated matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para13"></a>I recently raised on a Question in the House the whole matter of the law relating to sex discrimination cases, particularly as it affects equal pay for work of equal value. There is a case for looking closely at the procedures in conjunction with the Equal Opportunities Commission. The Government have already indicated that they are prepared to do that. Race and disability discrimination may also present problems. I am therefore glad to hear that my noble and learned friend Lord Archer is seized of the difficulties here and is considering introducing his own amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para14"></a>Clause 3 of the Bill appears to extend provision for chairmen to sit alone on cases. I am not too happy about that. The wing members not only bring to the consideration of cases a great deal of experience of industrial relations--that is why they are chosen--but make what I believe is an important contribution to the perceived fairness of the proceedings. I hope that what is proposed will receive careful consideration.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para15"></a>I have some concern about internal appeal procedures. Some internal procedures have been unilaterally imposed by employers. They may not even be known to the employee until the employer seeks to claim that they should have been utilised. Or the employee may mistrust the procedures because he or she was not involved in their original negotiation and may regard the procedures as a piece of window dressing by employers, having no real validity. Employees could have their compensation reduced on the basis of an appeals procedure in which they had no real trust. I would like appeal procedures agreed with an independent trade union. It also seems fair that the employer should have to set out the appeal procedure in writing to the employee when issuing the dismissal notice, advising the employee of the legal consequences of failing to use the procedure. It would simplify matters if a statutory form of words could be used.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para16"></a>While on the matter of compensation, is it not time that we looked at the limits? The current ceiling of &#163;6,300 for the basic award and &#163;11,300 for the compensatory award means that the higher paid, long-serving employee may suffer extensive financial loss. Compensation for pensions alone could reach quite substantial sums. If there has been unfairness in dismissing an employee, the burden of that wrongful act should fall on the employer and not on the employee, particularly when the employee concerned may be in the older age bracket, perhaps with a long history of service, and unable to find alternative employment very quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para17"></a>I agree with what has been said about the extension of compromise agreements. One of the unions has pointed out to me that it has some reservations about how the process works now and that it is very fearful of the emergence of freelance operators who present themselves as experts in this area.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para18"></a>The Bill could profit from amendment. On the other hand, I commend my noble and learned friend Lord Archer for bringing it forward. It is clear that something has to be done to deal with a long waiting list, a situation which is unfair to all concerned. I am glad that we are to have the opportunity to debate the Bill in Committee. We are fortunate that in this House there are many noble Lords who have great expertise. In particular, we shall, I am sure, benefit from the advice of my noble friend Lord Wedderburn, who is pre-eminent in this area. I welcome the Bill and look forward to having the opportunity to discuss it further in Committee.

<P>
<A NAME="70725-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Gladwin of Clee: </B>   My Lords, I must first declare an interest. I am a member of an industrial tribunal. I am also a member of the Employment Appeal Tribunal.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para19"></a>The right of an employee not to be unfairly dismissed was first introduced in 1971. The tribunals were seen to be the method whereby employees who felt they had been unfairly treated could get swift, informal and effective determination of their complaints. The primary remedy that we saw--I say "we" because as a trade union official I represented members before industrial tribunals--was the power of the tribunal to order the <P>


<a name="column_1590"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1590</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reinstatement of a worker who had been unfairly dismissed. As has been said, the reality today is very different. Informality has gone and there is a widespread use of lawyers. My experience is that employers still use lawyers when, frankly, the personnel director could do just as well. There is constant reference to case law made by superior courts--the Employment Appeal Tribunal, the Court of Appeal, the House of Lords and the European Court of Justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para20"></a>The main problem today is delay with regard to the length of time that can elapse between the registration of a complaint of unfair dismissal and its determination. Months can go by before a case comes before a tribunal. If the losing party decides to appeal, much more time elapses. Therefore, reinstatement is no longer an effective remedy. That is why it is used only in 1 per cent. of the cases that come before industrial tribunals.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para21"></a>Reinstatement or re-engagement--they have the same value--is an effective remedy only if it is awarded four to six weeks after the employee has been unfairly dismissed. It has to be done when the employment relationship is still warm. If it has gone cold and time has elapsed, it is no longer an effective remedy.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para22"></a>We are all familiar with the reasons for the delay. The workload has increased and it is still increasing. It is due to the widened jurisdiction. We now deal with sex, race and disability discrimination cases. Also there is the growing number of small businesses which seem to be unaware of employee rights and the need to have internal discipline and grievance procedures. I am bound to say that there is the unwillingness of governments adequately to provide the necessary resources to meet the growing caseload. Therefore, I welcome the Bill introduced by my noble and learned friend Lord Archer because it seeks to reduce the caseload.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para23"></a>I also welcome it because it could be the first step to reducing what I regard as the quite unfair and unjust requirement that a worker must have two years' employment before he can exercise his employment rights. We once had a commitment to those rights being established at day one. That is perhaps impractical, but we really ought to move to where we started, which was, after six months' employment, rights then become effective. I hope that the Front Bench will take note of that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para24"></a>As I said, I welcome the Bill, but there are a number of concerns, some of which have already been expressed. I welcome the proposal that ACAS should provide voluntary, binding arbitration to the parties to an unfair dismissal dispute as an alternative to going to an industrial tribunal. But I question--even with my noble friend's amendment which we shall see at Committee stage--whether at this stage or ever racial, sexual and disability discrimination cases are suitable for ACAS arbitration. I am not sure.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para25"></a>As I indicated, the remedies that are open to industrial tribunals are reinstatement, re-engagement and compensation. Reinstatement is going back to where you were the day before you were unfairly dismissed. Re-engagement has the same value as that award. I have had the experience where one has decided that there has <P>


<a name="column_1591"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1591</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been unfair dismissal, but to say to the employer that he must take the employee back in the position he was in was impractical. So the alternative is re-engagement, which, as I say, may be with an associated company or in a different place of work. But it has the same value as reinstatement.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para26"></a>However, in the Bill we have what seems to be a third remedy--or perhaps a fourth remedy--"or otherwise re-employed". If that is designed to give the arbitrator flexibility when making his award, I submit that re-engagement should suffice. It is dangerous to move away from the well understood remedies which are provided by the Employment Rights Act. I believe that those words should be taken out of the Bill. But we shall come to that at Committee stage. It is dangerous to drift away. The fear is that there will be an alternative remedy which could act to the detriment of the employee who has been unfairly dismissed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para27"></a>My third concern relates to Part III, Clause 13 of the Bill. It is what I call the "fines and bonuses" clause. We have heard of it already in this debate. It gives the tribunals the power to penalise employees who have been unfairly dismissed by reducing the compensation by not more than two weeks' pay if they have not used the employer's procedure for appealing against unfair dismissal. That is the fine. Similarly, if the employer has prevented the employee from using his procedure, the tribunal can make a supplementary award to the employee of up to two weeks' pay. That is the bonus.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para28"></a>In my opinion this is a minefield. It will be most unwelcome to industrial tribunals. It will prove to be a nightmare for them. For example, what is "procedure"? All the evidence will need to be assembled to argue the case whether they went through the procedure or whether the employer prevented the employee from going through the procedure. There is already enough evidence that has to be amassed to deal with the argument about mitigating the loss where a compensation award is being made to an employee who has been unfairly dismissed. To extend that to an argument about whether he was prevented from using an internal procedure--all for two weeks' pay--is not worth the candle.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para29"></a>I believe that that provision should come out of the Bill. It does not address the problem. Many cases of unfair dismissal come before industrial tribunals because employers have no internal appeals procedure. This clause is silent on that. It relates only to circumstances where, allegedly, there is in place an appeal procedure. What is the penalty for employers where there is none? What is needed is encouragement for (or even a requirement that) all employers to have an internal appeal procedure which conforms to an ACAS code of practice. That needs to be looked at again.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para30"></a>My final concern is Clause 3 in Part I of the Bill which extends the categories of cases where the chairman should sit alone--that is to say, without the two lay members. In my experience chairmen welcome and benefit from the presence and participation of, as they are sometimes called, "the industrial members". Disputes over redundancy payments and the transfer of <P>


<a name="column_1592"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1592</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>undertakings regulations should be heard by a full tribunal. These are issues which are best settled with the industrial members present because their knowledge and experience are vital. Chairmen should not be under pressure, as they are now, to sit alone in order to improve the throughput figures of tribunals.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para31"></a>I repeat my welcome for the Bill. I hope that before Committee stage discussions can take place on some of the issues that have been raised to make a good Bill even better.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, I also welcome this Bill on three counts. First, it is a good and commonsensical Bill. It tries to improve the speedy, effective disposal of disputes and, if it works, it will save public money. That makes a significant contrast to the Bills on industrial and labour relations that we have had over many previous years. That is my second reason. I hope that it marks the end of the dismal parade of anti-worker Bills, which I always called "The eight brides of Frankenstein", the best parts of which were for the most part dictated by European directives which the government did not want to introduce.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para32"></a>The third reason why I welcome the Bill is that for the first time since I have been a Member of this House I have a chance to declare an interest. I have always wanted to declare an interest. I cannot say that I am a lawyer, but I am an arbitrator and therefore I have an interest. If I say hard or difficult things about arbitrators, that comes from experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para33"></a>I have a number of questions which I shall fire at the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, and the noble Lord, Lord Haskel. I do not expect them to answer them all today. But I hope that they will think about them and that they might get in touch with some of us about them. I hope that they will tell us whether they find the questions acceptable in general terms in order to give us some idea of the sort of amendments that we might profitably move in Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para34"></a>My first query is to indicate surprise that there is nothing in the Bill about the procedure for encouraging exemptions. The procedure goes back to the 1978 Bill. It is still there and yet, as we all know, only in one case involving the Joint Industry Board for the electrical contracting industry does the exemption procedure operate. I do not know why the Government do not put in the Bill or say in this House that they support the notion of the exemption procedure. It may be it is to be improved in various ways. But in a way it is a matter of common agreement between all sides of the House, because in the previous government's green paper, which has been frequently quoted, on page 25 they talked about the possibility of encouraging exemptions. They stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Another possibility is whether any change should be made to the arrangements (in Section 65 of the 1978 Act) under which dismissals procedures may by agreement be 'opted out' of the statutory provisions on unfair dismissal. Exemption from the unfair dismissals legislation currently requires the making of a designation order by the Secretary of State; and is subject to several safeguards". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para35"></a>The safeguards are then listed. Paragraph 4.29 then states--and this is absolutely true--that the performance standards (in the exempted procedures),

<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para36"></a>That is what the previous Conservative Government said. The quotation continues
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Government suggests that the voluntary exemption procedure should be considered more widely by employers and trade unions. The Government has always taken the view that industrial disputes are best resolved by the parties concerned, without the intervention of the state. The evident success of the JIB voluntary procedure sets an example which, if adopted more widely, might produce considerable benefits". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-03_para37"></a>That is unanswerable. I have operated within the context of the JIB voluntary procedure. It is standard form, if necessary, to award reinstatement and re-employment because there is speed and efficiency and because the people who operate that procedure know it very well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, has my noble friend considered Clause 12 which, unless I have misunderstood the position, takes some of the points that he is making?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   Yes, my Lords, it does take some of those points and if we had more time--we may consider this in Committee--I could list the ways in which I regard the exemption procedure as superior to Clause 12. It is much more professional and allows for the problems to be tackled in a much more specified and detailed way. It can result in the establishment of standing tribunals. It does not deal with only one case if one employee wants to use it; it is an overall agreement. That is why I regard it as an advance on anything in the present Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para0"></a>I should like the Government to tell me--today if they can but, if not, subsequently--their attitude towards attempting to encourage the exemption procedure. We are talking about caseload. The Government are bothered about the caseload and it has been estimated that between 30 and 35 per cent. of the caseload comes from the public sector. If, as a result of government encouragement, employers in the public sector were to offer exemption procedures to the unions in the public sector, we might be able at a stroke to remove 35 per cent. of the caseload. We cannot do that with Clause 12.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para1"></a>I come to my second question which relates to inducements for workers to contract out under the present Bill. What are the inducements for workers? We all know about the inducements for employers. They do not have to appear at the tribunal. If the case goes against the employer, that will not become public and will not appear in the local newspapers. So, what are the inducements for workers to enter the new system proposed in the Bill? We can imagine what they might think, so I am asking the Government and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, whether it might be possible in Committee to introduce some specific inducements into the legislation. Could we say that if you enter an arbitration procedure--could it not be part of the eventual ACAS procedure?--the matter is resolved within a specified time? Why could we not have time limits? Could we say that re-employment and reinstatement might be built into the procedure? Could we say that the provisions will apply to those who have been employed for less than two years? We could say <P>


<a name="column_1594"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1594</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>lots of things to induce workers to move into the procedure, because if we do not, they will not do so. Unless we can convince workers that the new system will be better and quicker, the only workers who will move into the new procedure will be those who are put under pressure to do so by their employers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para2"></a>That brings me to my next question. How are we going to ensure that pressure is not put on people to move into the new procedure? The  noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, has already discussed this so I shall not do so at length. If I understood him correctly, he said that he would like to do something on that point but is worried about whether we can say that someone must have advice. What qualified advice could someone have? Could they have a lawyer or could they demand the right to go to a free, law advice centre? If they can, I should like the Government to say today that they recognise that there is a problem and that workers could be suborned or pressurised to enter this procedure which is to the very obvious advantage of employers. I hope that in Committee the Government will be able to put something on the face of the Bill to help to defend workers against the pressure that they might be placed under. That is my third point.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para3"></a>I come now to my fourth question. If we are moving into arbitration--I should declare a double interest here--who will the arbitrators be? Will they be those from the ACAS list? Here I must declare a non-interest because I do not want these arbitrators to be from the ACAS list because we are not lawyers. I believe that the arbitrators must be experienced arbitrators and that they must have some legal competence. They must know what the law is. Indeed, I would not mind if they were legally qualified arbitrators as long as they were also experienced. I can think of many lawyers with industrial experience who operate within the system. I should like the arbitrators to have certain qualifications. There is nothing unusual about that with regard to the unfair dismissal procedure; for example, outside arbitration--that is, in industrial tribunals--people have to have special qualifications to be able to serve on tribunals dealing with race and sex discrimination cases. We can pick and choose the arbitrators that we have. Do the Government agree that that is right?
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para4"></a>My fifth question is more complicated. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, was also concerned on this point. The great advantage of arbitration--its abiding glory--is that it is essentially hugger-mugger. No one knows what you did or why you did it for the most part and you do not even have to give your reasons. It is quiet, confidential and private. If we are successful in moving from legal regulation to arbitration, do we want virtually all unfair dismissal cases to be dealt with hugger-mugger? That would mean that there would never be any principles and that we would never find out why the arbitrators did what they did. That is what happens in arbitration. Even more dangerously, do we want that to happen with race, sex or disability cases? What about those cases involving future European Union directives on workers' rights? They would normally go to industrial tribunals, but are they all to go now to arbitration? If so, that would mean that we would never know about them.

<A NAME = "70725-04_para5"></a>In the past we have had a whole series of cases where the decisions of tribunals, of the EAT or occasionally even the ECJ, have been given maximum publicity--and that has been a very good thing. I shall not list them, but there has been a whole range of cases in which lawyers have said things which all other lawyers said that they would not say. There have been enormous and significant advances in workers' rights relating to, for example, sex discrimination in the Marshall cases. I would not want such decisions in future to be hugger-mugger. I want them to be proclaimed because we are creating new standards. How far do we want to go in shifting, in the interests of expediency, swiftness, reinstatement and re-employment, from a public system where everybody knows what has happened to a new basis of jurisdiction which is hugger-mugger? I should like the Government to try to answer me on that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, we might have judicial review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord may say that, but, with respect, it is not as effective and it takes a lot longer.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para6"></a>Finally, I should like to ask about the cheapness of the new scheme. I have looked at the previous government's Green Paper and I can see only one reliable figure, but, as I shall show, it is not reliable at all. Page 16 of the Green Paper states that the cost per case of industrial tribunals is &#163;966 and that the cost per case of an ACAS cleared dispute is &#163;263, which means that the latter is about four times as cheap. It will not do, because ACAS does not provide arbitration in most of these cases. What ACAS says is four times as cheap as conciliation. Of course conciliation is cheaper, but we are talking here about a new system. I hope that under the new system which will provide the worker with the right to obtain some advice there will be a legal chairman. If you have a legal chairman you must pay more money. I hope to provide incentives and inducements to workers to enter this system. We have absolutely no experience of what it will cost to operate an arbitration system for unfair dismissal or anything else. Those figures do not stand up. Perhaps the Government can try to provide more up-to-date figures in order that we can compare the relative cheapness of the two systems.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para7"></a>I support the Bill, but I want to see it improved. We do not want to see figures that demonstrate that we do not want the Bill at all because arbitration turns out to be more expensive. I do not think that it need be. We need to be more realistic. With those qualifications, I commend the Bill to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Phillimore: </B>   My Lords, as a practising barrister I welcome this opportunity to make a few comments on the Bill. I therefore also declare an interest. I welcome the proposed change of name from industrial tribunals to employment tribunals, since that is clearly more consonant with the work done by them. Clause 2 appears to propose a substantive change, providing for the determination of disputes without an oral hearing. <P>


<a name="column_1596"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1596</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I have reservations as to whether in practice that will streamline cases. Furthermore, I do not consider it an appropriate form of hearing in cases where facts are often in dispute and the evaluation of witnesses is necessary and important, as in unfair dismissal and discrimination cases. It may be more appropriate for determining jurisdiction and preliminary points. However, even those are often better resolved with some oral evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para8"></a>Where the person against whom proceedings are brought does nothing to contest the proceedings, the proposal seems to lead to a decision on the merits. The requisite material for such a decision is unlikely to be contained in the originating application. That would be the only material before the tribunal. However, I welcome a procedure that is akin to judgment in default of a notice of appearance, provided that the time limit for filing a notice of appearance is extended from 14 to 28 days. I suggest that that is particularly necessary in complex discrimination cases where complaints may go back over a number of years and involve several different managers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para9"></a>In relation to preliminary hearings I respectfully suggest that the Bill may provide an opportunity to clarify paragraph 6 of the first schedule to the Industrial Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations 1993 and what is meant by,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"entitlement of any party to bring or contest the proceedings to which the originating application relates". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para10"></a>A further point in relation to preliminary hearings arises from the proposal in Clause 5 to use a legal officer to deal with such matters. I share the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, about the proposal. It is a vital part of efficient case management that a preliminary hearing be dealt with by a legally qualified chairman with or without lay members. As for the proposal in Clause 3 to extend the categories in which a chairman sits alone, I suggest that cases under Section 11 of the Employment Rights Act 1996--which concerns references as to what should be included in the written statement of terms of employment to be provided by the employer at the request of the employee--should be excluded since often they involve complex questions of construction of agreements and the determination of factual issues where the assistance of lay members would be particularly helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para11"></a>As for the arbitration proposals, I suggest the following: that the parties and arbitrators agree the terms of reference; that arbitrators decline jurisdiction in cases of substantial factual and/or legal dispute; that arbitrators should have power to remit a case to an industrial or new employment tribunal at any time; that there be no right of appeal but a right to complain about failure to comply with the outcome of the arbitration to an industrial/new employment tribunal; and that the administrating of oaths or affirmations should be permitted at the discretion of the arbitrator in each case.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para12"></a>I am concerned about the proposal in Clause 9 that "independent legal advice from a qualified lawyer" should be replaced by "independent advice" since this appears to remove the need for such person to have any qualifications at all. I suggest that that would be highly undesirable. I therefore share the concerns of other <P>


<a name="column_1597"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1597</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lords. I am worried too by Clause 13 and the proposed reduction in compensation for failure to use internal procedures. The reasons for that concern were eloquently expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwin. Subject to those comments, I commend the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_time1"></A><H5>12.26 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, I join in congratulating the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, on bringing forward this very important Bill. From these Benches I give it a cautious welcome. I have never ventured into the field of employment law without making a deep study of the collected works of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn. I do not profess to have his expertise but, just as the noble Lords, Lord McCarthy and Lord Phillimore, have declared interests, I have appeared for applicants and respondent local authorities and statutory bodies before industrial tribunals and employment appeal tribunals. Wearing another hat as chairman of a radio broadcasting company, I have summarily dismissed executive directors and found myself defending those decisions as a witness in industrial tribunal proceedings.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para13"></a>When I see the word "streamline" in the explanatory memorandum to this Bill my suspicions are aroused. The danger that always attends the reform of forensic procedures is that it may be inspired by a desire to make things easier for the tribunal to get through its workload. That was put succinctly by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwin, who said that it might be designed to improve the throughput figures. He also welcomed the Bill on the basis that it would reduce his workload, so he looked at it from both points of view. Reform must always be approached from the point of view of the user of the system. As the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, rightly emphasised, in these types of proceedings the applicant is always in a weaker position.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para14"></a>The question to be addressed is whether the proposals make matters speedier and easier for the applicant to obtain justice. With that in mind, I consider that these proposals can be improved, as many noble Lords have said. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, himself commented that he was not wedded to every jot and tittle. That conjured up a rather interesting picture of this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para15"></a>Clause 2 proposes to introduce amendments to permit regulations to be passed so that a tribunal can determine cases without a hearing, or a full hearing. The first example of that is that the tribunal can act without a hearing on written evidence alone where both parties have given their consent. As a practitioner, it is hard for me to envisage where such a procedure would be appropriate if there was any dispute either as to fact or to law, possibly with calculations of compensation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para16"></a>But one wonders what else the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, has in mind in putting forward that example. Contrary to the view that he expressed, the Employment Lawyers Association is concerned that consent to such a procedure should be informed consent so that an applicant does not waive his right to a full public hearing without being fully aware of the consequences of so doing. I would argue that consent <P>


<a name="column_1598"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1598</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>must be conditional on the party concerned obtaining independent legal advice. I do not understand why in new subsection (3A) in Section 7 of the Employment Tribunals Act there should be a provision that the consent, once given, could not at any subsequent stage be withdrawn and a full hearing sought. I can envisage circumstances which might well arise where consent to a decision without a hearing having been given at one stage, that consent should be withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para17"></a>There is also a provision in new subsection (3B)(b)for no hearing where it appears that the applicant is not entitled to the relief that he is claiming. Whether or not the applicant is entitled to the relief that he is claiming may well be the subject of considerable argument in a complex case. It may be the very issue. It is not enough for the tribunal to decide that the applicant is not entitled to the relief that he is claiming. The noble and learned Lord should narrow that provision to the first part of the subsection as drafted, as indeed he indicated when he introduced this provision. The drafting may need to be looked at.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para18"></a>The third matter to which I would refer where there is no hearing is where a superior court has decided to the contrary. If the tribunal were to dismiss a case because there was a decision, for example, of the Employment Appeal Tribunal which seemed to be against the applicant, that would deny the new applicant the opportunity ever to challenge the decision of the superior court. Normally, the applicant would go through the first stage, accept that he was bound by the decision of the superior court, ask for findings of fact and then take the matter forward in an attempt to challenge the issue at the highest possible court. Summary dismissal of his claim without a hearing in which such factual findings are not made might well be a cause of injustice.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para19"></a>In Clause 5 there is a reference to the appointment of legal officers--mysterious figures, as the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, described them. They have powers under Clause 5 to carry out anything and everything that a chairman is allowed to do. That is where I suspect that the motivation is to relieve the pressure on the chairmen of industrial tribunals and to take things away from them rather than looking at it from the applicant's point of view. It introduces the concept of the interlocutory judge--the master or district judge, with whom we are so familiar in ordinary civil proceedings. Once we do that we necessarily have to introduce a body of rules and appeals. That involves delay and expense for the applicant and for the respondents--that delay was so rightly deplored by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwin. With my experience of civil proceedings, it would give rise to the possibility of tactics on one side or another; delays on one side or another; putting pressure upon applicants; and unless the provision is much more clearly explained I would oppose the concept of the legal officer.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para20"></a>The nature of the appointment does not suggest a level of remuneration which would attract the most experienced and mature judicial minds to that task. A better approach to the problem of dealing with such matters might be case management, as set out in the Woolf Report--case management controlled by the chairman of the industrial tribunal. That is what he is <P>


<a name="column_1599"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1599</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>paid for. The Government should not try to save money by not appointing enough industrial tribunal chairmen or by the appointment of a much more lowly "mysterious" judicial figure.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para21"></a>I come to Clause 7. The concept of an arbitration scheme is, on the face of it, attractive, but we do not know what is in the mind of the noble and learned Lord in putting that forward. The arbitrator is a decision maker, acting, as the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, pointed out, within a framework of legality. He has to apply the law as he understands it. He has to act within the legal procedures. His decision is subject to judicial review.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para22"></a>If competing cases are to be presented for a decision by a decision maker, it is far better that it be done in public; that there be orderly presentation of well prepared cases, conducted by qualified and experienced advocates, whether they be lawyers or experienced trade union officials. It should be done professionally. A row behind closed doors is not an effective substitute for a public hearing. As the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, pointed out, secrecy is usually in the interest of the employer, who may well be happy to have the proceedings behind closed doors.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para23"></a>Of course the negotiated settlement of an unfair dismissal case under the auspices of ACAS and with the assistance of a skilled conciliation officer is an entirely different matter. There is existing legislation to make provision for just that. It is helpful for parties to come together with a skilled conciliator, and for them to have face-to-face discussions. That is different from going to an arbitrator who is being called upon to make a decision that is binding upon the parties.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para24"></a>I should like to be assured that the motivation behind the whole proposal for arbitration is not just to reduce the workload of the industrial tribunal or to avoid the appointment of additional tribunal members. It would be undesirable were an applicant to be persuaded to take his case into a private room, with an arbitrator appointed for the day, merely on the promise that his case would be heard more cheaply and more quickly. Justice: the arrival at a fair and correct decision in the particular case is much more important than speed and low cost. One of the most difficult positions for a legal practitioner to be in is to have a client who feels that the judge has interrupted him, has cut him short, that his evidence has been rushed, that his submissions have not been heard, and he has lost without having had his full and fair day in court. Speed and low cost are not necessarily the concomitants of justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para25"></a>The proposal in Clause 8 is to extend arbitration proceedings beyond unfair dismissal cases. Many noble Lords have expressed the TUC's view that it would be undesirable for such arbitration to take place in sex, race and disability discrimination cases because they raise complex questions of law. If there is to be arbitration along the lines in the Bill, I take issue with the TUC which has suggested that the use of lawyers in arbitration proceedings should be discouraged as far as possible. Some noble Lords have echoed those sentiments today.
<P>


<a name="column_1600"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1600</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para26"></a>It is fashionable to denigrate lawyers and their fees. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, I do not speak carefully on this issue. Lawyers are not part of the entertainment industry. Their words float away in the air. They do not leave behind them any great artistic legacy, any body of literature, or any monument or building. Sometimes I wish that I had built the bridge on the M.6 along which I shall pass tonight as I drive to Scotland. If its design were the sole achievement of my life, I would be a happy man. Lawyers leave little behind. However, there is no comparable body of equal expertise and integrity charged with the responsibility of assisting people in trouble and of asserting their rights. If lawyers are no more than mechanics who keep the wheels of the various court and tribunal procedures turning, their skills have a vital effect on people's lives.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para27"></a>I was gratified to hear the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, refer to the great advances--surprising as they appear to be to him--that lawyers have made in the employment field. For that reason, I entirely oppose the proposals set out in Clause 9 which would entitle anyone, qualified or not, who could acquire an insurance policy to set himself up as an independent adviser for the purpose of advising on compromise agreements. Considerable disquiet is already felt in the legal profession about the burgeoning ambulance chasing of so-called loss adjusters who advertise their services to injured persons to pursue and negotiate the settlement of their personal injury claims with insurance companies. In my view, these proposals would create a similar class of people who, since their whole raison d'etre would be to broker deals between applicants and respondents, would undoubtedly lack the independence of solicitors or counsel, whose practices do not depend upon a narrow area of work.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para28"></a>Your Lordships should not be moved by stories of fat cat lawyers--a phrase regrettably used by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor--into creating a sub-profession of alley cats; people who do not have the necessary qualifications to give proper advice. If any amendments are to be made to this provision, the advisers who give advice to applicants should be specified either as lawyers or recognised trade union or professional representatives.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para29"></a>My noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill wrote to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, spelling out two particular problems which he believes should be addressed. The noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, has already underlined the point that the present procedures for dealing with equal pay claims for different work of equal value are tortuous and unworkable. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has practical experience of such problems and I have no doubt that he will take the opportunity to bring forward suitable amendments, provided that they are within the Long Title of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para30"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has pointed to the clogging up of lists by the applications in which the same point of principle arises. It may be that many of the 88,000 rising to 109,000 cases are caused by a system which demands that individuals file individual applications in particular, for example, in sex discrimination in pay cases. It ought to be possible to <P>


<a name="column_1601"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1601</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bring representative proceedings or the equivalent of class actions. Where, for example, there has been a ruling in the European Court on a material issue, a representative action would assist in clarifying its effect on UK law. This is an ideal opportunity to make a necessary procedural reform which ought greatly to relieve the pressure on the tribunals by reducing the mirror, repetitive cases into one representative case.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para31"></a>I know that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, will take on board the comments that I have made. We on these Benches will endeavour to work with him on the practicality of my suggestions and we will endeavour to co-operate to the best of our ability to ensure that the Bill reaches the statute book.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_time2"></A><H5>12.44 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, although the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool is no longer in his place, on behalf of these Benches I wish to second the good wishes expressed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell. I do so with great pleasure.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para32"></a>I, too, congratulate the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, on bringing the Bill forward. We welcome it with more than the cautious welcome it has received from certain other noble Lords. The Bill would have made my life a good deal easier in the years when much of my time was spent in industrial relations, a great deal of it sitting and waiting around in bleak rooms at ACAS, even if not normally for unfair dismissal cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para33"></a>I am sorry that much of today's debate has been spent most professionally by noble Lords experienced in the trades union movement. I should have liked to have heard Members of my own Benches--perhaps it is my fault that they are not here--expressing their views from their experience in management. Furthermore, I should have liked to have heard the noble Lord, Lord Marsh, who was in the Chamber at the beginning of the debate, speaking from his great experience of the Newspaper Publishers Association.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para34"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, can regard himself as the godfather of the Bill. It has a distinguished parentage and its gestation period comfortably exceeds that of an elephant. The Green Paper which was its progenitor was published in 1994 and in November 1995 my right honourable friend the then President of the Board of the Trade announced the Conservative Government's intention to implement the proposals. The draft Bill was published a year ago last week. It seems to have undergone a few changes during that two-and-a-half years and I have no doubt that we shall look for some refinement before it leaves this House with our blessing.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para35"></a>There is undoubtedly a need for it or for something similar. It cannot be right that with between 20,000 to 25,000 cases a year going to arbitration, 50 per cent. took more than 26 weeks to be heard, even though that figure has been reduced. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, that justice and speed are not incompatible. The noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, spoke of a possible inducement for employees. Undoubtedly, speed is such an inducement. An employee who has <P>


<a name="column_1602"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1602</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been dismissed needs to obtain new employment fast and will find it difficult to do so with the problems of his previous employment and the end thereof hanging over him. The issue of re-engagement or reinstatement, whatever one calls it, must remain in the Bill, but none of us has any doubt that it is not a practical solution in other than a small proportion of cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para36"></a>The enactment of the Bill must lead to shorter waiting times. Those who are responsible for the Bill are to be congratulated on that. I hope that tribunals will be tough in setting realistic deadlines. I suspect that there is never a real delay in getting to ACAS and if the case can be settled there, there is less cause for complaint. It is the log jam of cases waiting for the arbitration that causes the delay.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para37"></a>A change that has come about since the days of the White Paper--a change which I believe is to be regretted--is the dropping of the proposal that employees shall be barred from tribunals unless they can show that they have already tried to settle their dispute with their employers. Such a clause would have prevented too precipitate a charge in the arbitration maelstrom and reduced the necessary consideration of many hopeless cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para38"></a>When the Green Paper was published, the local government management board expressed concern that the changes which allowed the chairman of the tribunal to sit alone in the majority of cases would undermine the belief that tribunals were impartial and effective. Almost all noble Lords who have spoken have touched on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para39"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Turner, who is no longer in her place, made some very good points about the support which the "sidesman" would give to a chairman. But I do not believe that there is any justification for the argument that a chairman sitting alone would undermine the belief that the tribunals were impartial and effective. I do not believe that I am being too cynical in saying that that change to one man sitting alone--and I talk about men in the sense of members of the human race--will serve only to save time. In my experience, the two lay members--one an employer's nominee and one a trade union nominee--tend to cancel each other out and in any event, the settlement reached is based largely on the opinion of the professional chairman. There must be concern if the chairman is relatively inexperienced, but that would not seem to be a serious danger.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para40"></a>Some thought should be given to the question of whether widening the qualifications necessary for a chairman is contradictory to the requirement that he carry insurance. Somebody who is not a professional would find it difficult to obtain the necessary insurance. But I do not believe that would be a problem, although that matter must be considered in Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para41"></a>The change to allow ACAS to prepare a scheme for arbitration in unfair dismissal cases is particularly to be applauded. In industrial disputes, my experience is that the ACAS conciliation officer seems generally to act in the capacity of a eunuch: he can offer professional advice but is unable to get the job done himself. Under the Bill he will be able either to recommend a settlement <P>


<a name="column_1603"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1603</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which the parties may accept without going to arbitration or failing that, will prepare and polish the case which is to be presented to the arbitrator.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para42"></a>It is foolish to think that cases which either employees or managements bring to the tribunal are put together with the same care and professionalism as speeches in your Lordships' House. Whether the case is to be presented in writing (and adjudicated upon), as it will now be able to be, or be taken to a tribunal by the appellant in person, the work of the ACAS conciliator must greatly shorten the time it all takes. Having prepared a scheme under Clause 7, it should be possible for ACAS to proceed smoothly. At a later stage it will be possible for the scheme to be extended to other classes of disputes. That would be extremely helpful for the process of industrial negotiations, even though the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, questioned that. But it would seem to be a satisfactory fallback.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para43"></a>Clause 13 is particularly welcome. This will penalise either party for not taking advantage of the internal or external procedures open to it. By failing to use any procedure set up for appeals against dismissal, an employee's compensatory award may be reduced; and if the employer prevents in any way the proper use of such procedure, the payment may be increased. The Bill contains a worrying amount of common sense.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para44"></a>I should like to comment on Clause 1 in that context whereby the name is changed from industrial tribunals to employment tribunals. It is ironic that that comes at a time when the charge of the Bill moves from the Department for Education and Employment to the Department of Trade and Industry. However, I accept that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para45"></a>I note that when the Green Paper was published in 1994, there was a suggestion in the Guardian that employees and unions might be disadvantaged by the Bill (which was then unpublished). In a letter to the paper, Mr. John Monks, the General Secretary of the TUC, expressed himself content and was in particular unworried about the lack of a right of appeal from the judgment of a tribunal. He is probably correct in this because as he says that even if there is no right of appeal, either party could seek judicial review if it was felt the arbitrator had taken a decision which was legally wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para46"></a>I am interested that Mr. Monks at that time confirmed that it is rare in unfair dismissal cases for new precedents to be set. As he says, the vast majority of claims are uncomplicated and routine. Arbitrators have heard it all before. I am sure all those who have been involved would accept that. So much is this so that it might in the future be possible to settle all claims by computer! However, I hope not.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para47"></a>I have expressed some form of a eulogy for the Bill which, as I say, we very much welcome. There are changes which are desirable and which will be discussed in Committee. One point that I should like to raise, which has not been raised by other noble Lords although the noble Lord, Lord Gladwin, took the matter from another angle--that is, using the procedure for small firms with a very small number of employees. Many <P>


<a name="column_1604"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1604</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>firms have fewer than 10 employees, and many companies with employment problems are newly set up and, at the time of conflict, still relatively disorganised. It may well not be appropriate for those companies to enter the full panoply of the provisions of the Bill. Although I consider this to be an excellent procedure, I question whether it is appropriate for all organisations or whether there should be an easier, very simple procedure for small companies. In almost every case, they should be able to find a method of settling the dispute by a simple heart-to-heart with an adviser who is sympathetic to both parties.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para48"></a>I therefore ask the Minister to look at the Bill to see whether in Committee there is any way of making the procedure even simpler for the simple employer and the simple, if aggrieved, employee. We shall do the same. Employees in such businesses are unlikely to have the protection offered by the trade unions where larger numbers are employed and such employers may well not have a trade organisation at their back. It is still necessary for justice to be done and to be seen to be done but in these cases it is as important that the procedure should be simple and easy.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para49"></a>That seems to be the only major problem, but is an important one and should be addressed if the Bill is to achieve its aim of quick, easy and universal justice. Having said that, I would give it the full blessing from these Benches and wish it well on its way.

<A NAME="70725-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, first I congratulate my noble and learned friend Lord Archer of Sandwell on bringing forward this Bill. It relates to a subject in which he has considerable expertise and knowledge, as he has demonstrated to us by his remarks this morning. Other noble Lords have spoken and they too have given us the benefit of their experience and knowledge. I thank those noble Lords who had the courtesy of informing me of their concerns beforehand. In particular, I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Burnham, for his welcome for the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para50"></a>The previous government started work on the Bill, as we have been told. It was the subject of two consultation procedures and, as my noble and learned friend Lord Archer told us, it has received support from a wide variety of sources, including employers organisations and the trade unions. We welcome this and look forward to further examples of social partners working together with government and producing practical and workable solutions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para51"></a>We support the Bill. The Government welcome the initiative of my noble and learned friend in bringing the Bill forward. I am grateful for the opportunity to outline our reaction to the Bill, to welcome the changes made to it since it was published last year, and to say how the measures contained in it are to be taken forward. I shall try to answer some of the questions put to the Government. I know that my noble and learned friend will respond to the points made to him. However, as regards those points which fall in between, I am sure that we will deal with them by letter.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para52"></a>This is a Bill about the resolution of disputes and it aims to improve relations in the workplace. Where there are disputes, it is in the interests of all concerned that they should be resolved speedily. I should tell the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, that justice delayed is justice denied. The Bill will achieve the speed-up of justice in a number of ways. It will streamline certain tribunal procedures; for example, by allowing chairmen to determine certain issues without the need for a full hearing. It will also promote alternative forms of dispute resolution, such as arbitration, and encourage the use of internal appeals procedures.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para53"></a>Some noble Lords expressed concern about the effect of those changes on the users--that is, on the employees in particular. The changes will bring benefits to those who find themselves in the unfortunate position of being involved in a dispute: this will benefit both employers, especially small firms, and employees alike--the users of the system.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para54"></a>Central to dispute resolution is the role of ACAS. I should like to pay tribute to ACAS and the work that it carries out both in collective disputes and the less high profile, but equally important, role of attempting to settle individual employment rights disputes through conciliation. ACAS has an admirable track record in the area. Indeed, for employers and employees alike, the intervention of ACAS is often a welcome means of trying to resolve their differences. My noble and learned friend's Bill will give ACAS new responsibilities in this regard, both in terms of providing an arbitration scheme for unfair dismissal disputes and extending the conciliation officer's duties to include redundancy payments cases; for example, where employers have not paid their former employees what they are statutorily entitled to receive.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para55"></a>Certainly the proposal that ACAS should provide an arbitration scheme is a new development in the area of dispute resolution. Yet this will be another positive step towards helping people solve their disputes. The Bill does not contain the detail of the scheme. Instead, it outlines the general framework under which the scheme will operate. This will allow ACAS the flexibility to design a scheme which will be voluntary, informal, non-legalistic, private and binding on the parties. We look forward to receiving ACAS's proposals in due course.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para56"></a>My noble friends Lady Turner and Lord Wedderburn expressed concern on the matter; indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Phillimore, made some suggestions about the ACAS scheme. I am sure that those points will be taken on board. It occurred to me during today's debate that it might be helpful if the Government were to ask ACAS whether it could produce a memorandum illustrating what such a scheme might look like. I believe that that might help noble Lords in Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para57"></a>Other noble Lords have asked who the arbitrators will be. ACAS will appoint arbitrators to the scheme, but they will not be ACAS employees or officers. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, and other speakers wanted the results of the arbitration to be public because such decisions may have an important effect on the rights of employees. I would say that arbitration is probably not <P>


<a name="column_1606"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1606</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suitable for such important cases. Those cases will go to industrial tribunals which are held in public and, therefore, the public will be aware of tribunal decisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para58"></a>The ACAS scheme will cover unfair dismissal disputes. My noble and learned friend has already pointed out that the Bill contains a power for the Secretary of State to enable ACAS to prepare arbitration schemes in other jurisdictions. Noble Lords expressed concern about that provision. I should like to assure the House that the Government have no plans at present for additional schemes to be introduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para59"></a>The introduction of an arbitration scheme for unfair dismissal disputes is, as I have said, a new development. We have an open mind about it. If it is successful, that will be because parties involved in disputes have found it to be a useful means of resolving their disputes. If it is successful, we may take views as to whether arbitration might be a suitable method of resolving disputes in other areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para60"></a>My noble friends Lord Gladwin and Lady Turner expressed their concern about extending the area of arbitration. I should point out to them that, if we are to contemplate arbitration being available for other jurisdictions, we would ensure that the relevant representative organisations, such as employers and trade unions, were consulted. And, where appropriate--for example, if it were contemplated that arbitration might be suitable for disputes involving discrimination--we would consult the EOC, CRE and other bodies. My noble and learned friend has also signalled that he wishes to make an amendment to ensure that any orders made by the Secretary of State to approve new jurisdictions will be subject to the affirmative procedure. I can confirm that the Government will support such an amendment. I hope that that will reassure those noble Lords who were worried about that aspect of the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para61"></a>The ACAS scheme will, of course, be an alternative to an industrial tribunal hearing, but it is not a replacement for the tribunals. The Government are fully committed to the important role that the industrial tribunals play in the industrial relations field. I should like to put on record our high regard for the work of such tribunals and, in particular, for the lay members, who often hold down full-time jobs. Indeed, the tribunals benefit from their experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para62"></a>There are proposals in this Bill to extend the circumstances in which a chairman will sit alone without lay members on certain technical cases. My noble friends Lord Gladwin and Lord Wedderburn and the noble Lord, Lord Phillimore, were worried about chairmen sitting alone. I should stress that this is not a step towards doing away with lay members altogether. The Government are committed to the use of lay members. Their practical experience of relations in the workplace is very valuable in the majority of tribunal cases. The proposals in the Bill will extend "sit alone" for full hearings to a number of more straightforward technical types of case in which the input of lay members may be less valuable. Other hearings will continue to be conducted by a three-person tribunal. <P>


<a name="column_1607"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1607</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Even in the sit-alone cases, the chairman will have the discretion to call for a tribunal of three if that is believed to be desirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para63"></a>The administrative support to the tribunals is provided by civil servants. They created a next steps agency--the Employment Tribunals Service--in April 1997. Despite substantial increases in their caseload, the tribunals have made substantial improvements in recent years in efficiency. My noble and learned friend Lord Archer gave us the figures and outlined the size of the problem regarding the caseload in the pipeline. Despite improvements in efficiency, there is always further room for improvement. To achieve that, my noble and learned friend's Bill aims to give the tribunals additional tools to streamline procedures which should be welcome to both employer and employee alike. No one wants to waste time unnecessarily at an industrial tribunal hearing if it can be avoided. The Bill will ensure that proceeding are dispatched efficiently and effectively in accordance with the interests of justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para64"></a>Some noble Lords were concerned about the internal procedures. The Bill will give the tribunal the discretion to consider all of the circumstances of a case and in particular the likelihood of success of an appeal. This will allow tribunals to take account of procedures which were forced upon employees and which were not even-handed. The tribunal will also take account, as it is required to do by the 1992 Act, of the ACAS code of practice. The code states that it is good practice to give details of disciplinary action in writing and at the same time the employee should be told of any right of appeal, how to make it and to whom.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-04_para65"></a>My noble friend Lord McCarthy was concerned about dismissal procedures agreements. Clause 12 is about dismissal procedures agreements. It seems to me that it does exactly what the noble Lord is asking for. It makes the legislation more flexible. This Bill was prepared by the previous government and we are happy to support it. However, the previous government appeared to want to remove rights from employees in small firms. The noble Lord, Lord Burnham, raised that point. In our business manifesto Equipping Britain for the Future we stated that small firms were the bedrock of a successful enterprise economy and that we would give small firms the backing they deserve. We also stated that we believe in fairness at work. This Bill deals with both those aspects.

<P>
<A NAME="70725-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for giving way. I was in no way suggesting that small firms should not be subject to the same considerations. I refer to their ability to handle this procedure. If there were a simpler method, that would be more satisfactory.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the noble Lord's remarks will be taken into account by ACAS when preparing its scheme for arbitration and simple procedure. Fundamentally this Bill does not affect the rights of employees but it tries to improve the system for resolving disputes at work. We stand for trust, partnership and co-operation and not confrontation. My noble friend Lady Turner was concerned about <P>


<a name="column_1608"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1608</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>flexibility and effects on family life. We believe in real flexibility in the workplace and in trying to make it easier to resolve disputes, not make it easier to sack people. This Bill makes a positive contribution to the resolution of disputes. I hope that it will gain the support that it deserves from your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_time0"></A><H5>1.12 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, it is customary at this stage in a debate to thank all noble Lords who have participated. That I do with complete sincerity. I am most grateful for the suggestions which have been made and for the general and generous support which the Bill has received. I am particularly reassured by the support it has received from the Front Benches on the part of the three noble Lords who have spoken from that position.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para0"></a>As my noble friend Lord Wedderburn said, I never claimed that the Bill is perfect. That is an easy renunciation on my part because I do not claim credit for drafting it. I therefore escape any of the blame which may arise.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para1"></a>I commend the Bill for the reasons which some of your Lordships have given. I refer in particular to the backlog spoken of by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn, who said that it arose largely from the proliferation of new rights which had been given for all the right reasons. One of the spin-offs, necessarily, is a burden on tribunals and, consequently, a backlog. My noble friend Lady Turner spoke of a period of destabilised employment giving rise to more claims. However, my noble friend Lord Gladwin emphasised that the purpose of the Bill is to get rid of the backlog, which must be in the interests of all who use industrial tribunals.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para2"></a>I have been warned of the wrath to come in Committee. I suspect that it will be wrath of a fairly gentle nature. I do not think that it helps if I try to anticipate all our Committee debates. I was asked about the arbitration proposals. My noble friend Lord McCarthy asked why there should be arbitration at all. That point was echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas. Is it not better to do the whole thing in public? Surely, wherever possible, our system of justice should hold its proceedings in public so we can all see what is happening and we have a system of precedents which we can consult. Normally I would agree with that. But, as my noble friend Lord Haskel said, it is not proposed that industrial tribunals should be abolished and replaced totally by arbitration. That will be one other option in what the parties consider to be appropriate cases. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, said that what was being suggested was intended only to divert cases from industrial tribunals. That is exactly the case. Why that should be regarded as a condemnation of the proposal escapes me for the moment. No doubt in our subsequent debates the argument will be developed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para3"></a>It may be possible to frame arbitration in such a way that one eliminates those issues which--because we have printed forms--necessarily confront industrial tribunals. That may save a lot of time. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Burnham, that speed in itself is not a <P>


<a name="column_1609"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1609</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disadvantage; it is a positive advantage for the parties. When one is asked--it was a question put by my noble friend Lord McCarthy--what is the inducement for employees to adopt this procedure, the obvious answer is speed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, surprised me as he almost suggested that speed was to be deplored and that leisurely proceedings should be embraced for their own sake. He drew a picture of leisurely cross-examination at great length by fat cat lawyers or whoever, as though this was--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, I never believe in lengthy cross-examination. I do not even believe in fat cat lawyers, if it comes to that. I do not think that the noble and learned Lord quite understood what I was trying to say. I am not suggesting that the proceedings should not be as speedy as possible, but that there should be full consideration. I am concerned that too much haste means that a person feels he does not have his day in court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, I say at once that I would never dream of suggesting that the noble Lord practises unduly lengthy cross-examination. I know from his reputation that that would be totally false. However, I gained the impression at one stage that he rather thought that leisurely proceedings were to be embraced for their own sake. Of course proceedings should take the time which is required for justice. However, if that can be done by arbitration in a suitable case I should have thought that might commend itself to employees.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, I never said that there should not be arbitration, and I never said that there should not be speed. What I am trying to get the noble and learned Lord to say--and what I have tried to get the Government to say, without success--is whether some additional incentives will be included to improve arbitration so that we obtain more than speed; we obtain justice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords my noble friend has anticipated what would have been my next sentence. I was going to pick up the point which he made; namely, the more incentives we can include, the better. I wholly support that idea. If the noble Lord has any proposals to make, as far as I am concerned at least, there will be an open ear. I gather that there will also be an open ear on the part of my noble friend Lord Haskel.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para5"></a>My noble friend Lord McCarthy then asked the converse question: what happens if people are pressured to adopt arbitration? That is a question which can be asked in relation to almost any option which one gives. What happens if undue pressure is put upon people to take one course rather than another? I am not sure that one can ever say that any course is pressure proof. However, if we can think of ways of resisting pressure that can lead only to improvements in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para6"></a>I was asked by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn about a situation where there are divergent <P>


<a name="column_1610"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1610</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>interpretations by arbitrators on the one hand and by tribunals on the other. As he said, part of the safeguard will be judicial review. I wholly accept that that is not a total safeguard. I am not sure what legislative provisions will avert that. However, as my noble friend said, it may be that all of us during our idle hours in the summer can reflect on the matter from time to time and return in the autumn with some ideas.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para7"></a>My noble friend Lord McCarthy asked who the arbitrators would be. To a great extent, my noble friend Lord Haskel answered that question. The Bill does not prepare a scheme; the scheme will be prepared by ACAS. If ACAS can prepare a draft scheme and give us some ideas, incorporating those suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Phillimore, that might greatly aid our debates in the autumn.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para8"></a>My noble friend Lord Gladwin raised the question of the words "or otherwise re-employed" in Clause 7. He was kind enough to warn me that he might raise the matter. My noble friend is right. The reason for those words is that they offer arbitrators greater flexibility. It may very well be that one of the attractions of arbitration is its greater flexibility. However, I take my noble friend's point that we must be careful not to change the substantive law and the well understood remedies by what is a side-wind. Again, I should be happy to continue our discussions in the autumn.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, raised the matter of determinations without a full hearing. He rather gave the impression that there cannot be many occasions when that is appropriate. I am not sure. I believe that there are such occasions and that, if asked, any experienced chairman of tribunals would agree. The noble Lord then said that if people were to be asked to consent to that, they should have accessible legal advice. I gave my reasons for not wanting to write that provision into the Bill in my introduction. I can see how desirable it would be if there were some other way of ensuring that; I hope that we may find ways of encouraging people to take such advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para10"></a>The noble Lord also said that he was not very happy with the provision that, once the advice had been given, it was not possible to withdraw it. That has to do with administration. If someone, having given consent and the whole proceedings having then gone ahead on that basis, says, "I've had second thoughts about this; I'm going to change my mind. We shall have to go right back to the beginning and start again", it would impose intolerable burdens on the administration. Again, if there are ways of compromising on that point, perhaps we can do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillimore, was unhappy with compromise agreements, particularly because, as matters stand, if we are not to have qualified lawyers giving the advice, it could be someone without any qualifications at all. The safeguard against that is that one has to have indemnity cover. Obtaining such cover, as the noble Lord, Lord Burnham, said, is not an easy matter in any case. In fact, one of the problems is that it will be almost impossible for many perfectly well qualified people to obtain it. Most of us could give examples of the kind of people who might give very <P>


<a name="column_1611"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1611</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>good and sensible advice and who are not lawyers. Whether we can list them in the Bill is a rather more difficult question. Again, it is a matter for discussion in the autumn, but I am not sure.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para12"></a>I turn to in-house procedures. My noble friends Lord Wedderburn, Lady Turner and Lord Gladwin were troubled that in-house procedures mean that the last word rests with the employers. I would point out, as did my noble friend Lord Haskel, that tribunals already take account of ACAS guidance which states that employees should be brought into the consultations. I know that my noble friend Lord Wedderburn has his reservations about that. The matter should be discussed further. I see the dangers. However, I hope that he will understand what are the reasons for encouraging people not to go to tribunals if the matter can be resolved more easily at an early stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para13"></a>My noble friend Lord Wedderburn and the noble Lord, Lord Phillimore, asked about legal officers. I anticipate that they will probably be people who are barristers and solicitors of a certain seniority. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, is right. The concept is that of an interlocutory judge. Almost by definition, an interlocutory judge will not necessarily have the qualifications and training of a more senior judge. So it is in a sense a way of saving on the time of chairmen. I should not have thought that the proposal is any the worse for that; in fact, that is one of the purposes of the Bill. Again, we shall hear more in due course as to who they will be.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para14"></a>A number of proposals came within what I tried to formulate in my introduction as matters that might be better left to other legislation. My noble friends Lord Wedderburn and Lord Gladwin spoke about the need for an improvement in the substantive law in this area. They are pushing at an open door so far as I am concerned. I am not sure, however, that this is the Bill under which that can be achieved. My noble friend Lord Gladwin mentioned in particular the two-year rule, and I could not agree more.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Burnham, suggested some kind of exemption for small firms. He may be pushing at a rather more closed door in my case in that respect. But our debates may have to be in relation to other legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, mentioned that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, was kind enough to write to me about the two proposals mentioned by the noble Lord. Both are matters in relation to which the Government are presently involved in working groups. It may be more sensible to wait to see what those groups produce. Again, it is a matter for discussion later.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para17"></a>I am very grateful for the general welcome given to the Bill. I look forward to our further debates with great interest, and not a little apprehension. I commend the Bill to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-05_para18"></a>On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.

<A NAME="70725-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Baroness Hayman) </B>  rose to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 26th June be approved [5th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in our manifesto we promised to restore a proper safety net for families and vulnerable individuals who are made homeless through no fault of their own. These regulations are the first step towards fulfilling that undertaking. The provisions in Parts VI and VII of the Housing Act 1996, which limit the protection that could be given to homeless households, were a matter of grave concern in your Lordships' House when they were introduced in 1996. These regulations would ensure that households owed a homelessness duty receive proper priority for rehousing in long-term social housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para1"></a>The policy framework we are now putting in place to deal with homelessness consists of three elements. One is the introduction of new resources. We covered that in the debate in this House this week on the Local Government Finance (Supplementary Credit Approvals) Bill. The second is the fostering of partnerships between all organisations that deal with the homeless. The initiative that we are taking to deal with the problem of rough sleepers is an example of the partnerships that we are trying to foster. The third is genuine and regular consultation. That consultation preceded the regulations that are before us today.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para2"></a>These regulations are necessary because, under Part VII of the 1996 Act, a local housing authority may be obliged to secure suitable accommodation for a homeless household, but only for a period of two years. When that period ends, the authority may, in certain circumstances, decide to continue to secure accommodation for the household, although it cannot use its own stock for more than two years out of any three-year period.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para3"></a>This principal homelessness duty, limited as it is, does not even apply where an authority is satisfied that there is other suitable private sector accommodation available in the district. In those circumstances, an authority's only duty is to provide advice and assistance. We have, to some extent, addressed this lack of security by making an order under Section 210 of the Act which provides that other accommodation shall not be regarded as suitable unless the authority is satisfied that it is available for occupation by the household for at least two years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para4"></a>The overall effect of these arrangements would nevertheless be to leave a homeless household in a continuing state of uncertainty. That adds to the considerable disruption and misery that they would already have experienced. That is why it is necessary that these regulations are made.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para5"></a>The existing position is that under Part VI of the Housing Act 1996 there is a single route into long-term social housing through an authority's housing register. <P>


<a name="column_1613"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1613</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Section 167 of the Act sets out certain categories of household to whom "reasonable preference" must be given within an allocation scheme. These are households in overcrowded, insanitary, temporary or insecure accommodation; persons with a particular need for settled accommodation on medical, welfare, social or economic grounds; and households including a pregnant woman or dependent children. There is no place in the list for households defined as owed a principal homelessness duty. In including these households in these categories receiving preference, the Government is making very clear to local authorities the importance that they attach to the experience of homelessness in determining priorities for long-term, stable housing allocation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para6"></a>The regulations add to the list in Section 167 various new categories that cover everyone who is unintentionally homeless and in priority need. They include those people to whom the main duty is owed both under the existing and the earlier homelessness legislation and people who have within the previous two years been referred to other suitable accommodation in the private sector in discharge of the homelessness duty. Households owed a homelessness duty would thus be rehoused more quickly, reducing the often heavy financial burden on authorities of having to secure and finance temporary accommodation for them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para7"></a>There is one other point I should bring to the attention of the House. The regulations also remedy an oversight in Section 167 as drafted. 'Additional preference' is to be given to households which consist of or include someone with a particular need for settled accommodation on medical or welfare grounds where they cannot reasonably be expected to find settled accommodation in the foreseeable future. As currently expressed, the entitlement applies only to individuals. Regulation 3 extends the entitlement to all households falling within the medical category which cannot be expected to find settled accommodation. This would enable authorities to take account of other cases in this group--for example, where the household includes a carer who has to provide around-the-clock care for the person in his or her charge.

<A NAME="70725-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I do not propose at this time on a Friday to rehearse the many arguments we had across the Dispatch Boxes on this subject so very recently. I think we had an honourable disagreement of principle as to whether it was right to include homelessness in the Bill--as the noble Baroness now proposes to do in effect--and thereby to continue, as we saw it, the iniquities of queue-jumping or whether it was better to do as the noble Baroness now proposes and have it as an added factor which can be taken into account. We have to accept that the Government are going to try it their way.

<A NAME = "70725-06_para10"></a>However, I should be very grateful if the noble Baroness could write to me and say how she proposes to measure the success of the policy change. What statistics does she wish to see improved and in what way in the future? I do not expect an answer now but I would appreciate a letter.

<P>
<A NAME="70725-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I will certainly undertake to write to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and I might even be tempted to tell him how wrong he is to think that this measure will encourage queue-jumping. I hope that we shall not see the number of homeless families in this country increase during the lifetime of this Administration as they did--to more than double--during the lifetime of the previous administration.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para11"></a>We believe that the housing needs of individuals and households who will have been found by local authorities to have become homeless through no fault of their own and to be in priority need--I agree with the noble Lord that we had a disagreement in principle on this issue--will be as severe and as genuine as those of any other household on the housing register and it is right that their needs should be addressed by local authorities through this measure. I commend the regulations to the House.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman </B>   rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 7th July 1997 be approved [7th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the draft order before the House today will, if approved, effect a modest, but nonetheless useful, amendment to a previous order. As such, it should not, I hope, be controversial.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para14"></a>The House will doubtless find it helpful if I explain something of the background to, and purpose of, the order. The Transport and Works Act 1992 (TWA for short) replaced private Bills with ministerial orders as the means by which new railways, tramways and other forms of guided transport are authorised in England and Wales. (It also covered inland waterways and works interfering with rights of navigation, but that need not concern the House today.) The Act came into force on 1st January 1993.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para15"></a>The order-making procedures are set out in Part I of the Act. Section 1 enables the Secretary of State to make an order for the construction of railways, tramways, trolley vehicle systems and guided transport systems using modes prescribed by order made under Section 2. The legislation was framed in this way to ensure that the powers were sufficiently flexible to enable the order-making procedure to extend to novel or unusual forms of transport by affirmative orders. If the types of guided transport had been set out on the face of the Act, non-conventional forms of guided transport which had <P>


<a name="column_1615"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1615</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not been foreseen at the time would only have been capable of being authorised by means of a private Bill or by amendment of the TWA itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para16"></a>The first Section 2 order--the Transport and Works (Guided Transport Modes) Order 1992--prescribed eight modes of guided transport. These are summarised in the explanatory note. While the range of potential guided systems has proved--so far as we can judge--to be sufficiently comprehensive, the 1992 order restricted their application to, in effect, passenger carrying systems. The reason for this is not entirely clear, although it may have been assumed that guided transport systems were unlikely to have a freight carrying application.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para17"></a>However, the previous administration agreed that a public consultation exercise should be undertaken with a view to removing the restriction. This took place earlier this year. Very few responses were received but those who did respond either welcomed the proposed change or had no comments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para18"></a>It is in response to the public consultation that the order is being introduced now. The timing has been prompted by a proposal, still in its formative stage, by a private sector and Royal Mail consortium to make use of the existing Royal Mail tunnels under London to develop a new automatic freight distribution system called Metrofreight. This would use rubber-tyred, battery-driven, driverless vehicles to supply goods to major goods outlets in the Oxford Street area from a central distribution centre in Willesden. The project would involve additional tunnelling, for which TWA powers would be required. It is claimed that this project has the potential significantly to reduce lorry deliveries in central London and hence bring welcome relief from congestion and other environmental benefits.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para19"></a>I should stress that the making of this order today would not necessarily mean that the Secretary of State would approve that scheme. It would be considered only in the context of an application made under Section 1 of the Act. But such an application would be made possible by this amendment order.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-06_para20"></a>I should explain that broadening the prescription of guided transport to include the carriage of goods is not designed to increase regulation in relation to these types of work or to cover any guided freight systems which do not currently require TWA powers. The order will simply enable promoters of guided freight systems who require such powers to apply for them through the Transport and Works Act process rather than to have to petition Parliament by a private Bill. This is wholly consistent with the purposes of the 1996 Act. I beg to move.

<A NAME="70725-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, I rise briefly to welcome this order. It is obviously desirable not to put any legislative difficulties in the way of increased carriage of freight off the road. The proposal for Metrofreight to serve Oxford Street sounds like an <P>


<a name="column_1616"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1616</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>excellent example of what might be encouraged by this order. It also occurs to me that the viability of some guided rail systems might be increased if they were able to carry freight as well as passengers. I think that in all respects this is an excellent order.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-07_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   I rise briefly to thank the Minister for her succinct explanation of the order. It is clearly beneficial to be able to use the TWA for goods and freight. I shall be interested to follow the exciting Royal Mail-Metrofreight development. We are entirely content with the order.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-07_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   My Lords, I have only one query. Magnetic levitation is shown as prescribed mode 2(c) in the 1992 order. In the few weeks preceding the recent election we sometimes saw the Natural Law Party doing their yogic dancing, bouncing up and down, backwards and forwards. I ask the noble Baroness, albeit with tongue in cheek, whether they should have been added to the list of prescribed modes. Is not that some form of magnetic levitation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-07_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I should not wish to stray into the realms of the party political in your Lordships' House in that way. However, I must say that yogic bouncing seems to me at least to be a very green form of transport, and we have to encourage that. I am sure that under the magnetic levitation provisions of the Transport and Works Act, it would be well included.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para0"></a>I am grateful for the support that we have received. As I said, this is a minor measure but it is one which may help use transport freight in an environmentally acceptable way.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kenilworth: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para2"></a>First, I welcome all noble Lords who intend to speak in this debate and in particular the noble Lords, Lord Hoyle and Lord Newton, for whom the debate will mark their maiden speech in this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para3"></a>The purpose of the Bill is to relieve the Hailsham Cattle Market Company of any duty imposed by the Hailsham Cattle Market Act 1871 to continue and maintain a market. The Bill is also intended to provide the company with the power to sell or otherwise dispose of the market site in Hailsham, which is currently in its ownership. The Bill is promoted jointly by the Hailsham Cattle Market Company and Carter Commercial Developments Limited, the latter being a company which hopes to play a part in the eventual redevelopment of the market site.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para4"></a>The Hailsham Cattle Market Act 1871, which this Bill seeks to amend, was part of a 19th century trend aimed at ending the widespread practice of trading livestock on the streets of market towns. That Act turned the Hailsham Cattle Market Company into a statutory <P>


<a name="column_1617"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1617</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>company with powers to establish and maintain a market in the parish of Hailsham. The purpose of the 1871 Act was to bring to an end the practice of trading livestock in the streets. Needless to say, that was a 19th century problem and in that respect the 1871 Act is now redundant.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para5"></a>The present day position of the company is that 210 shares in the company are owned by members of two families and have been owned by members of the same families in the same proportion since 1946. The company has not in living memory run the market although various shareholders have been involved with the market in other capacities over the years. Rather, the company has leased the site to firms and individuals, always on the condition that they operate a cattle market on the site. Equally, the company does not carry on any activities other than those related to the market. The company's only asset is the market site and its only activity is the collection of rent from the site.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para6"></a>Therefore, the 1871 Act has created a situation in which private individuals are burdened with a statutory duty to provide a particular service in a particular location without being able to have regard to the changes in demand for that service or to their ability to provide the service. Changes in the UK livestock business in recent years mean that the operation of markets such as Hailsham is no longer a viable commercial proposition. For that reason the current tenant of Hailsham market, South East Marts Limited, intends to vacate the premises upon the expiry of its lease in the year 2001, if not before.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para7"></a>In recent years, there have been five major changes in the UK livestock business which have contributed to the decline of the traditional town centre cattle market. First, the Government's announcement on 20th March 1996 of a possible link between BSE in cattle and CJD in humans and the subsequent export ban imposed by the European Commission on 24th March 1996 have reduced the demand for British beef generally and thus the number of cattle required by abattoirs and supermarkets. In addition, 1.5 million animals have been removed permanently from the food chain by the cull ordered under the over-30 month scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para8"></a>The second point is that, even before the BSE crisis, supermarkets were expressing a preference for stock sourced directly from the farm, thus eliminating livestock markets from the supply chain. With the onset of the BSE crisis, supermarkets began, and are continuing, to intervene in terms of inspection of the supply chain both on farms and at the abattoirs. Many large abattoirs have forced a stop-purchase for livestock markets altogether, thus reducing the volume of business for such markets nationwide.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para9"></a>Thirdly, new methods of marketing livestock have developed which do not include the traditional livestock market. For example, electronic livestock marketing, that is sales between farmers and abattoirs over a computer system and is preferred by many farmers as it involves animals being transported directly from the farm to the abattoir. In contrast, finished animals that are marketed through livestock markets have to be transported from the farm to the market and from the <P>


<a name="column_1618"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1618</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>market to the abattoir. In some cases, stock is purchased by intermediary traders before eventually being purchased by the abattoir.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para10"></a>Fourthly, the abattoir industry in the UK is contracting. The Meat and Livestock Commission is currently working with the Government to devise a scheme to reduce the over-capacity in the abattoir industry (estimated at 40 per cent.) by mothballing many of the remaining non-viable plants. Such a move will have a major impact upon transport times to and from livestock markets (and therefore, upon transport costs), making markets with poor access to abattoirs, such as Hailsham, unviable. At present, most buyers in the south-east have to pass through Guildford or Ashford on their way to major abattoirs, giving those markets a significant location advantage over Hailsham.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para11"></a>The contraction in the abattoir industry cannot be ascribed to BSE alone. Sheep throughput is also in decline. Using Hailsham as an example, sheep throughput fell by over 6,000 in 1995, and by 6,500 in 1996. The decline in sheep sales figures over the period 1991 to 1996 has also been experienced by Ashford and Guildford markets.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para12"></a>Finally, increased regulation of the livestock industry, much of which emanates from the European Union, is placing increasingly heavy burdens upon livestock markets. A recent example is the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997, which came into force on 1st July 1997. The order imposes a basic eight-hour limit upon the time in which an animal may be in transit in one day. That means that many animals travelling from livestock markets to abattoirs will need to be kept at the market overnight, which is known as lairage. Suitable lairage facilities are found only at large livestock markets, such as Guildford and Ashford. Hailsham market immediately adjoins a residential area and simply does not have the space or facility to accommodate that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para13"></a>In view of the shift of the UK livestock business away from the traditional livestock market, no livestock market can achieve an adequate return on capital on the basis of the livestock sales alone. In order to survive, cattle markets must diversify. The successful cattle market of the future will have to operate as a property company with many different activities apart from the sale of cattle. The successful markets of Guildford and Ashford supplement livestock activities by renting space to retail outlets, running non-livestock auctions, providing farm services and running stall markets--car sales and so forth.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para14"></a>South East Marts has attempted such diversification at Hailsham market by introducing a Friday stalls market. That is profitable on a very small scale but it or activities like it would need to take place at the present level on at least five days a week in order to bring the market as a whole into substantial profit.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para15"></a>The limitations of the site itself restrict the scope of management initiatives aimed at expanding operations. There is no space available for physical expansion to provide, for example, better vehicle access, overnight lairage and ancillary services. Furthermore, intensification of activities would lead to an <P>


<a name="column_1619"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1619</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>environmental health problem in view of the market's location--adjacent to a residential area--and planning restrictions upon intensification of commercial use in the Hailsham town centre contained in the local plan.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para16"></a>Hailsham market is not of a size or location that satisfies the needs of large livestock farmers and buyers. Even if the market could be made profitable in the short term as a result of initiatives such as the establishment of stalls markets, once major capital investment is required either by a failure of the present infrastructure or through statutory requirements, the market would cease to be viable and would not be able to generate enough income to justify major capital injection. That point is almost certain to be reached at some time in the next five years. In the present market conditions Hailsham market, at three acres, is thought to be too small to be profitable and environmentally sound.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para17"></a>The market has not yielded a return on the company's 1990 capital investment of &#163;350,000. Furthermore, capital investment in site is out of the question as the market cannot generate the level of profit necessary to justify such outlay. That is why there have been no major improvements in the market facilities since 1990.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para18"></a>Having examined the markets throughput figures in the years 1992 through 1996, it is clear to the accountants--Deloitte & Touche--that the volume of fat cattle passing through the market has fallen in each of those years. That drop is typical of markets in the south-east. According to the Meat and Livestock Commission figures published in Farmers' Weekly, Hailsham, Guildford and Ashford markets have all seen significant reductions in fat cattle throughput during 1996, ranging from a 30 per cent. fall for Ashford to a 45 per cent. fall at Guildford. Hailsham is in between, reducing by 38 per cent. over the same period. Even the volume of store cattle--cattle sold from one farm to another and not intended for immediate slaughter--dropped over the past three years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para19"></a>As many noble Lords will know, there are various objectors in principle to this Bill, including the National Farmers Union, Somerfield Stores and Wealden District Council. Somerfield's objection that development as a supermarket is planned for the site and that Hailsham does not need another supermarket in view of there being a Somerfield outlet in the town centre, is clearly an anti-competitive one. However, the promoters of the Bill acknowledge that the objection from the local farming community merits serious consideration. I know that many of your Lordships agree with that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para20"></a>The farming objection is based on the fact that the seasonal store market at Hailsham market is used by many local farmers. Indeed, those uses make up the vast majority of petitioners against the Bill. The promoters have, in recent months, been working towards a compromise proposal which will go a long way towards addressing those concerns. The Hailsham Cattle Market Company is willing to continue to provide a store cattle market in the Hailsham vicinity; indeed, a site has already been found at a distance of approximately two miles from the town and the proposal has been put to the petitioners.
<P>


<a name="column_1620"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1620</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para21"></a>One of the petitioners--the National Farmers Union--is currently putting that proposal to interested members. Another petitioner--the Hailsham Market Action Group--has responded through its solicitors setting out a number of anxieties which I should like briefly to address. First, the action group points out that 59 per cent. of the Hailsham market's 1996 turnover was accounted for by trade in store cattle. The action group clearly wishes to underline the importance and volume of that aspect of the market's activities. The promoters are well aware that the store market is the best used of its services at Hailsham. It is for precisely those reasons that the alternative store market is proposed. The alternative market would provide capacity for at least the equivalent of Hailsham's current store cattle throughput.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para22"></a>Secondly, the action group points out that the store cattle market is presently held fortnightly all year round. The promoters' proposal, on the other hand, is that the market should be held only during the store seasons--that is, March through June and October and November. The sales in other months are minimal.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para23"></a>Thirdly, comment is made as to the inadequacy of Blackbarn Farm in its present condition in terms of facilities for office accommodation, parking and access. In response to that, I am informed that it is not the promoters' intention to carry on a market on that site in its present state. It is prepared to sign an undertaking to the effect that, in the event of the Bill being enacted, adequate facilities in terms of parking, access, staff and buildings will be provided. I understand that that can be done within the existing planning constraints.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para24"></a>The action group is concerned that assurances from the promoters might not be honoured or that the existing store market might close before the new market opens. Those concerns can be dealt with in the promoters' undertaking which could be made either to this House or to the local authority. The details of the arrangement would of course be for a committee to decide.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para25"></a>The petitioners' concerns are very much reflected in the Instructions to be moved by my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton and Lord Wrenbury. I should like to speak on those Instructions. Beginning with the Instruction to be moved by my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton that the committee should consider the relationship between the joint promoters, the market tenant and third parties, the promoters inform me that they have no objection whatever to disclosing those relationships to the committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para26"></a>The second Instruction is also entirely acceptable to the promoters. Some dialogue has already taken place in that regard and no doubt the committee will wish to inform itself on the subject. In respect of the third Instruction that the committee should consider alternative arrangements sufficient for the needs of other market users as well as local farmers, I confirm that the reference to "other market users" is meant to indicate other livestock users such as butchers and not non-livestock users--notably, stall holders at the weekly "tat" sales. While consideration should certainly be given to non-livestock uses, possibly for their relocation, <P>


<a name="column_1621"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1621</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it should be borne in mind that the promoters' statutory responsibilities under the 1871 Act do not extend to the provision of those non-livestock activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para27"></a>As regards the Instruction to be moved by the noble Lord, Lord Wrenbury, the promoters assure me that a representative of South East Marts Limited will be available for questioning by the committee on the subjects mentioned. It appears to me that all of the petitioners' concerns are matters on which some agreement could be reached. I am further encouraged by the fact that a dialogue between the parties is already established.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para28"></a>In summary, the duty imposed on the Hailsham Cattle Market Company by the Hailsham Cattle Market Act 1871 is incompatible with the market economy and principles of supply and demand. It is unjust that the shareholders of the statutory company, who for the most part have inherited their shares, should be burdened with the responsibility to carry on a commercial enterprise which is demonstrably doomed to failure. The Bill will also enable a more appropriate use to be made of a prime town site in Hailsham.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para29"></a>Some of your Lordships have expressed reservations about this Bill on the grounds that the promoters should not be permitted to free themselves of a statutory obligation, albeit one that is 126 years old, without making some form of return to the community in exchange. The point that I should like to make to those noble Lords preparing to object to the Bill is that the promoters are demonstrating a flexibility of approach which should enable a solution acceptable both to the promoters and to the majority of petitioners to be reached in Committee. I think that the good faith of all parties concerned in their genuine desire to come to an agreement can be relied upon in this case for the simple reason that if the Bill does not become law the promoters will be unable to provide a cattle market on this site due to the financial impracticabilities of doing so but will, equally, be unable to sell the site. I fear that the result may well be a derelict site in Hailsham town centre and a complete loss of market facilities in the vicinity. That is of course an unattractive prospect to all concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para30"></a>There is enough common ground between the promoters and petitioners so that your Lordships need not fear a situation in which the House's time is wasted by the ultimate failure of the promoters to accept the results of your Lordships' deliberations in Committee. I would urge then that the House should follow its usual practice and allow the Bill to proceed to a Committee where a detailed debate can take place. I beg to move.

I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Kenilworth, on accepting them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para34"></a>Although I am totally opposed to the Bill, I understand that the proposers have a case in wishing the arguments about it to be considered in rather more detail than is possible in a Second Reading debate. I would not want them to be able to come back to your Lordships' House at a later stage and say that they were muzzled the first time round. One must weigh that against the fact that the proposers for the most part must be considered to be rich and that some of the most important, in my eyes, of the petitioners are extremely poor and it will be a strain on their resources to maintain their petitions. Nevertheless, I am persuaded that enough of the petitioners have resources that it would probably be of benefit to everyone to have all the arguments out into the open at a Committee stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para35"></a>I was first alerted to the Bill by an admirable article in the Sunday Telegraph by Adam Nicolson. That prompted me, as spokesman for conservation of the countryside for the party on whose Benches I sit, to contact the local Liberal Democrat councillors. I was considerably helped by Councillor Michael Skinner, who was at that time the prospective parliamentary candidate for Wealden and is still a local councillor.

<A NAME = "70725-07_para36"></a>There are a number of marginal arguments for and against the Bill and, doubtless, as a result of the Instructions which the House is going to give, they will be fully argued out. But I shall devote my short speech, in the spirit of the swingeing Motion I have put down, to a fairly swingeing attack on the principle involved. I start from the principle that the burden of proof is clearly on any party trying to set aside an Act of Parliament to prove why, considering all things, this should be done, and that burden is not discharged by merely saying or even proving that it makes economic sense to do so. It must make social sense as well and it is indeed all things which must be considered and not just economic things.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para37"></a>Markets are, or certainly were, part of the countryside. They are an important part of the countryside. Just recently we have seen a great rally in Hyde Park on behalf of the countryside. It was very impressive. One did not have to be a defender of hunting, which I am not, to know that there is a very real sense in which the countryside in the sense in which many of us knew it 50 years ago has been sidelined by modern life.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para38"></a>The local cattle market is part of that countryside. Many of us know it from personal experience as well as from the writings of such splendid chroniclers of the rural scene as Adrian Bell, whose distinguished son won <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>such a resounding victory to become a Member of another place at the last election. They are important places for members of the farming community to meet regularly. They are of more than passing importance at a time when the rate of suicide among farmers is extremely high. They minimise the distance that animals have to travel, a point which has just been brought up. They are an important factor in trying to limit the distress which animals destined for our table have to endure. They are an irreplaceable source of fresh, locally produced meat for local butchers. In this case we are fortunate that there is located very near to the market an abattoir, so one of the arguments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Kenilworth, is negated by the fact that the farmers can take their beasts to the market and they can go straight to the abattoir without further trouble.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para39"></a>Markets are especially needed in districts such as those around Hailsham where the nature of the soil and of the farming is such that in any system of sane, extensive farming, grazing is the main form of agriculture. A lot of the farms are small, mixed farms of exactly the kind that I believe we should go out of our way to encourage to survive.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para40"></a>Also to be considered in the present debate is preserving a healthy diversity in the centres of market towns. Hailsham is almost a textbook case and is the better for having at its centre both a cattle market and a supermarket. It would not contribute to that diversity to do away with that market and to have another supermarket. There is no presumption that just because the previous Secretary of State for the Environment took an overdue and admirable stand against out-of-town supermarkets--a stand which the present Government continue and my party supports--any supermarket that wishes has a pre-emptive right to find a site in the middle of a town. Supermarkets are all very well in their way--I use them myself, although as little as I can--but they are not essential to the life of a town. A healthy town centre with diversity of planning is essential.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para41"></a>Great play is made of the fact that the present market is in economic decline. There must, I am afraid, be reason to doubt whether it has been managed as well as it should have been, and even, I am afraid, as to whether the heart of the present management is in managing it well. It has been said on the very best authority that where your treasure is, there will your heart be also, and there is a lot of treasure involved in allowing the market to decline and then promoting a Bill like this.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para42"></a>It is possible that there will come a time when the economic and social factors are such that a supermarket is more wanted by the local community than a cattle market in Hailsham. Then it might be right (though even then I would probably doubt it) to revoke the actions of our ancestors and pass such a Bill as this.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para43"></a>But this has not yet occurred and your Lordships will bear in mind that the proponents of this Bill stand to gain a large amount of money from the passing of the Bill, while the bill (in the other sense of the word) will be paid by the farming, and indeed the whole rural community, of the area. I beg to move.

<A NAME="70725-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hoyle: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to intrude on your Lordships' time to make my maiden speech, particularly as it is getting rather late on a Friday afternoon for the House to be sitting. Nevertheless, I must say a few words in relation to the Bill and about myself. It might be at first considered that I am rather unusual in speaking in an agricultural debate, particularly as in another place I represented two urban areas; namely, Nelson and Colne, which was famed for its textiles, and Warrington, in which I saw the change from declining industries such as steel and engineering to new technologies and the industries of the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para45"></a>However, as we say about many things, all is not what one sees at first when looking at something. I claim that I am specially privileged to be able to speak on agriculture in this respect. I make the point that I have never lived in a town. I spent all my life in a village; namely, the village of Adlington, which is on the Pennines, where there is a large number of farmers, particularly farmers with store cattle, and that is what we are referring to today. Also my first constituency was Clitheroe, which is well known for agriculture and in which I had to gain quite a lot of knowledge about agriculture itself. Even as regards Nelson and Colne and Warrington, while they are industrial, there are many farmers, in particular in Warrington, which is surrounded by the plains of Cheshire in which farmers proliferate.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para46"></a>One of the aspects that I remember about my time at Clitheroe is that in 1992 I not only spoke on agriculture but I was often called on by the regional party to speak on agriculture in other places. On one occasion I was called on to address the Bolton and District Farmers. Unfortunately, for some mysterious reason the two prospective candidates suddenly found that they could not be there.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para47"></a>The other spokesperson at the meeting was the late Alderman Edwin Taylor, who had won a by-election to be the Member of Parliament for Bolton, East. You could say that Alderman Taylor was a card. Indeed, in the north-west we would say that he was a character. As he had a confectioner's shop, he was known locally as "The Pie-man". I did not know what to expect when he went along to the meeting. When I got there, I said, "Alderman, it's your constituency, after you", but he said, "Don't bother about that, lad, you go first". So, off I went. There was quite a large audience. Although people listened with interest and asked a number of questions I could see that they had not come to hear me; they had really come to see the local champion, the alderman. I was like a rabbit being pursued by a stoat and I could not help but look at the huge pile of papers that was in front of Alderman Taylor. I could see that they were all about agriculture. I stared and stared at the papers.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para48"></a>When I sat down to loud applause, up got Alderman Taylor. He got hold of the pile of papers, threw them on the floor and said, "These were sent to me by Central Office. As you know I am a busy man and I haven't had the time to read any of them. I say this to you: if you don't believe in subsidies, I don't; and if you have a query, please write to me at my office", and he sat down. I do not know who was the more startled--the audience or myself. It is a pity sometimes that we do not have Alderman Taylor in this House. I am sure that we would have shorter speeches.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para49"></a>I return to the Hailsham Cattle Market Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Kenilworth, who spoke on behalf of the promoters to move the Bill, said that throughput is failing, partly because many of the cattle now go direct to an abattoir or are bought by supermarkets. For a period the closure of Haywards Heath market in 1990 improved the input, but it has now been in decline since 1992. As we have heard, although efforts have been made to make the cattle market viable, it has not proved possible and the decline still continues. Unless the Bill is carried, the company will not want to continue with the lease after 2001.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para50"></a>On the other hand, as we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, the other side of the argument is that we must bear in mind that there has been a Hailsham cattle market since the 13th century. If it closes, there will be no other live cattle market in Sussex. As East Sussex is not suitable for other forms of farming, apart from store cattle for which it is ideally suited, cattle from those farms would have to travel long distances on poor roads. That would be bad for the health of the animals and would increase costs for farmers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para51"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, commented, it is not believed that the present owners have really tried hard to make the market viable. Indeed, it is said that they are more interested in its closure so the site could be used for a supermarket, as has been mentioned. Although an alternative site has been offered (at Blackbarn Farm, two miles outside Hailsham), many of the local objectors do not believe that it is suitable for the purpose for which it is being presented. Indeed, they do not think that planning consent would be given.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para52"></a>For all of those reasons--we shall no doubt hear more from both sides during this debate--I rise to put forward the Government's position. The Government are neutral on private Bills unless those Bills conflict with government policy. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that on this occasion the Bill does not conflict with government policy and that the Government's position is one of complete neutrality.

I hope therefore that we shall continue to receive his wise counsel for a long time.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para53"></a>I should like to thank my noble friend Lord Kenilworth for accepting the instruction that I tabled. He deserves the thanks of the House for giving noble Lords at long last the opportunity to give this Bill a Second Reading. Rather a long time has elapsed since the Bill was read a first time.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para54"></a>I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, for his somewhat drastic amendment to the Motion that this Bill be read a second time. I suspect that that was the catalyst that prompted my noble friend Lord Kenilworth to accept the instruction that I tabled. Now that has happened, I believe that on balance it is best that the Bill, together with both instructions that have been tabled, should go to the Select Committee on the ground that it will provide the surest decision most quickly. I say "on balance" because I am concerned about the finances of some of the petitioners. As the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, has already said, the House should bear in mind that this imposes a serious burden upon them.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para55"></a>At this stage I declare an interest. As a dairy farmer, I use the market. I live at Lewes, which is 18 miles from Hailsham. My family also owns land on the Pevensey Marsh. The market is of very great importance to the marsh. It is wet marsh that can do little else but fatten cattle, which it has always done very well. I am biased. I live in hope that the Select Committee will give this Bill short shrift in short time. I am of opinion that the promoters are spreading unnecessary doom and gloom among other things. Perhaps they protest too much.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para56"></a>As instructions can relate only to matters not covered by petitions--there are already 10 petitions against the Bill--before I speak to the instruction that I have tabled I should like to make a few general remarks about the Bill. Its purpose is simply to close Hailsham Market and develop the site. That will make a material difference to livestock farm economics in East Sussex in general and Pevensey Marsh in particular. Fifty years ago there were too many live auction markets; now we are rapidly reaching the stage where there are too few. For a long time the process has been left to market forces. In the past, regulation was found to be necessary. This applied for a very long time. One must bear in mind that Henry III granted the first Royal charter to Hailsham Market. That was amended in 1871 to get cattle off the street. As a matter of principle, I do not believe that now is the time to repeal any more of this old legislation. We may otherwise lose markets that we should not lose. This should be done only after the most thorough consideration. Markets have been closed down not because they are unviable but because of steeply rising property values. What is happening to live auction markets apart from Hailsham should be brought to the attention of this House. I make no apology for doing so.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para57"></a>To return to Hailsham, there is abundant evidence that the town wishes to keep its market and to remain a real market town. The shopkeepers and the town council say so. Farmers from a wide area around say so. The most important petitioner is Wealden District Council, the planning authority. Significantly it voted 51 to nil in opposing the Bill. I am glad that my noble friend Lord <P>


<a name="column_1627"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1627</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Newton is to make his maiden speech. He has been on Wealden Council for the past 10 years. So I shall say no more about that and leave it to him.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para58"></a>The House will find a great difference between what Wealden District Council says about planning and what the promoters say in the Bill's preamble. I stress the need to keep the market in Hailsham. It is a significant part of the town's historic identity. I am sorry that Lewes lost its market. Hailsham should try not to. The shareholders in the cattle market company should not expect Hailsham to surrender the cattle market against its will.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para59"></a>The Bill's preamble indicates a brave new world without live auction marts. In that connection I spoke to my noble friend Lord Wade of Chorlton, who cannot be here to speak today. He said that it is the live auctions which form the true markets and which set the prices. I had that confirmed by my contacts in the Meat and Livestock Commission. Live auctions are not yet dead. I shall leave that matter to my noble friend Lady Cumberlege, because it is a subject upon which she has something to say.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para60"></a>I understand that South East Marts and Anglo Dutch Meats are both subsidiaries of a company called Cyberfoods. Anglo Dutch Meats is a substantial owner of abattoirs, operating on dead weight and grade. I am not alone in taking the view that that group favours dead weight and grade. Hence its desire to close markets. That is why it closed Haywards Heath, is currently closing Thame market in Oxfordshire, and is trying to close Hailsham.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para61"></a>I believe that I may now start talking to my instruction. The Bill's preamble states that the Hailsham Cattle Market Company, the owner of the market which leases it to South East Marts, has an agreement with Carter Commercial Developments Limited, who as I understand it are specialists in supermarket developments, to develop the market site. Little light has been thrown on the terms, who would benefit, and to what extent. Does that agreement preempt any serious attempt to look for alternative bodies to run the market?
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para62"></a>The petitioners have evidence that the market could be made more profitable, certainly post-BSE; that other market traders would be interested and likely to pay the proprietors better rent than they have been receiving. That is in contrast to the gloom expressed in the Bill's preamble. The promoters appears to have conceded the need for a continuation of some sort of market by the last minute suggestion which came from their parliamentary agents to a few noble Lords, and which has not been referred to the petitioners, that a seasonal store market in some farm buildings in a nearby parish would be a sufficient answer. We have already gathered that the local farmers do not regard this as a satisfactory replacement. All kinds of difficulties relating to this unresearched proposition have suddenly burst upon us.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para63"></a>When South East Marts closed Haywards Heath market, it promised a satisfactory alternative market, which was to be off the London/Brighton Road. That market never materialised; the area remains as green a field as ever. Hence, promises from South East Marts <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>have been trusted no further by farmers in Sussex. As regards the Hailsham Cattle Market, should not the promoters be obliged to find a satisfactory alternative and to have it up and running before they ask Parliament for permission to close the present market? If they go down that road, they must give a copper-bottomed assurance and provide truly adequate facilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para64"></a>If the Bill is read a second time, and I understand that it will be, I urge your Lordships to support my Motion for an instruction and the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Wrenbury, particularly as they have already been accepted by the promoters. This is by no means the time to consider closing Hailsham Cattle Market.

<P>
<A NAME="70725-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Newton: </B>   My Lords, I should declare an interest in that I sell cattle at Hailsham Market and, as my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton said, I am a member of Wealden District Council, which is one of the petitioners against the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para65"></a>I am convinced that there is a need for some live market facilities to be retained. Although I do not trade in stores, many of my farming neighbours do. For that trade there is no satisfactory alternative to a live cattle market and it would be unacceptable to have to transport stock to distant markets beyond the county boundary.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para66"></a>An alternative site at Blackbarn Farm, Lower Dicker, has been proposed. I know the site extremely well-- I used to own it. Even 10 years ago, it was highly dangerous to emerge from the farm. At that point the A.22 is much busier today. As a result, it is hard to believe that the local planning authority will grant planning permission for a cattle market on the site.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para67"></a>The planning policy of Wealden District Council, as expressed in its deposit local plan, is that the Hailsham Cattle Market is not subject to a specific allocation, nor does it lie within the town's main shopping area. Consequently, if new shopping facilities were proposed the applicants would need to present a particularly strong case and to satisfy a number of criteria, the most important being that the requirement for the site can be demonstrated. As a result of the presence of two supermarkets close by, there must be some doubt whether such a need can be established. I also know that there would be concerns about the impact of a new shopping development on the amenities of local residents, the local highway network and the designated conservation area.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para68"></a>It is argued that an alternative use of the town centre site would be of advantage and that the amenities of the neighbouring residential properties would be improved. When permission for the housing developments was granted, account was taken of the existence of the cattle market. According to the records kept by the district council, in the four years ended February 1997 there were on average only three or four minor complaints per year about the market. They were on the grounds of smell, flies from manure storage, noise from washing lorries, tannoy and music, and in one case a bonfire. In each case the response of the council was no more than what is euphemistically called an "informal referral to operator".

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para69"></a>It is difficult to believe that the use of the site as a supermarket would be a better neighbour. Moreover, it is likely that lorries servicing a supermarket would cause just as much inconvenience to residents as the cattle lorries do at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para70"></a>If the market were to close, many residents of Hailsham believe that that would have an adverse impact on the prosperity of the town and the surrounding area. It is felt that the market is an asset in promoting town revitalisation and attracts visitors from a wide area. It is difficult to see any advantage to the people of Hailsham or the surrounding area from the closure of the market. Indeed, many local organisations, including the town council, oppose it. I hope that I am not being controversial or excessively self-interested when I say that I should deeply regret its closure.

<A NAME="70725-07_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Wrenbury: </B>   My Lords, it is a particular pleasure for me to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Newton, on his maiden speech. That is partly because I have never done such a thing before and partly because I find that we share the same school and the same profession, so he must obviously be a thoroughly good chap. I hope that we shall not have to wait as long to hear from him again because I understand that he succeeded to the title some five years ago. No doubt he delayed addressing your Lordships while getting to know the procedures of the House. The noble Lord made a very interesting speech with important points put forward forcefully and well, as I can testify because I was hoping to make some of them myself. I am sure that we all look forward to hearing from him in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para71"></a>I begin by making one extraordinarily obvious point; so obvious, in fact, that we may lose sight of it. It is that we are engaged in a democratic process and not a judicial process. When there are solicitors and counsel briefed to represent the interested parties before the Select Committee and sums are spent running into hundreds of thousands of pounds--I know one interested party has reserved &#163;100,000 for this alone--when people talk about an estimated three-week hearing and when, quite properly, the formal documentation requires approval by the Private Bill Office, it is hardly surprising that the affair takes on the appearance of a trial.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para72"></a>But, in fact, we are engaged in a democratic process. Your Lordships will readily agree that that means listening to the will of the people. In the present case, I have noticed a reluctance on the part of some of those with the greatest personal interest in the outcome--by that I mean in particular the local farming community--to consider appearing before the Select Committee because they feel that they have neither the resources nor the expertise to do so. That seems to me a thoroughly unhealthy development. In my view, it would be much healthier if spokesmen were forbidden and that expense were cut out. Indeed, it defeats the very purpose for which the Select Committee procedures are devised and leads to too great a professionalism in democratic affairs.

<A NAME = "70725-07_para73"></a>I do not believe that I have any financial interest in the matter, apart from living in the area and having tenant farmers who do. However, I remember vividly meeting my litigation clerk one day who told me that he had been serving writs in my part of the world; in fact, in the same village. I remarked that it was an extraordinary coincidence. He replied, "Yes, we refer to it as the bankrupt belt." The reason is that it is really very bad grade III farming land and, on the whole, people are not very well off.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para74"></a>The provisions of the Bill are actively opposed by 235 local farmers and landowners, 20 independent butchers, a number of market traders, two trade associations, 30 retailers, and 1,640 members of the public who have actually taken the trouble to sign petitions, not to mention the NFU, the CLA, the district council and the town council. Moreover, those who have houses near the cattle market have expressed themselves as being in favour of its continuance.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para75"></a>On the other hand, those promoting the Bill consist of seven shareholders in the Hailsham Cattle Market Company who wish to maximise the value of their investment and the developers to whom they wish to sell. There is no popular support for the Bill. If we are concerned with the will of the people, as I contend we should be, then it should fail at the first fence. I am personally sorry that my noble friend and relation Lord Beaumont of Whitley should have indicated that he may withdraw his Motion. I hope that he will rethink that decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para76"></a>I have heard it suggested that referral of the matter to the Select Committee is thought desirable in some quarters because it allows everyone to have their say and, therefore, is overtly democratic. But where is the difference between that and the well-known principle that every man should be allowed his day in court? There is absolutely nothing wrong with that principle; but we are not in court. It is the wrong principle to apply in this instance. We are not here to determine the rights of the parties. Moreover, this is not some kind of planning appeal, or public inquiry. We are hear to listen to the will of the people and they have spoken out conclusively against the Bill. They say that it is something which they most emphatically do not want. Who are we to wish it upon them?
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para77"></a>The issue is quite simple: are we charged with looking at the merits of the proposals on an abstract basis and in a judicial manner, as though we were a sort of committee of inquiry, or are we concerned to discover the will of the majority of the people most affected by them? I maintain most strongly that we are here in a democratic and not a judicial capacity, and, indeed, not in a fact finding capacity. I maintain that what the majority of the people want they should have so long as it does no harm to anyone else, and there has been no suggestion of that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para78"></a>However, in deference to noble Lords who hold a contrary opinion, I shall now go on to consider the objective merits of the Bill, which I am bound to say seem to me to be pretty slender. In the first place, as noble Lords have heard, Hailsham is the only cattle market between Guildford and Ashford. The effect of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>closing it down, so far as concerns farmers, is not unlike telling a housewife that she will have to travel four or five times as far to the shops in future than she has been used to travelling. In the context of a housewife, you can easily see that if the shops are more than a certain distance away, her life ceases to be viable. Precisely the same principle operates in farming. You cannot get your jobs done if you have to spend too much time on the road. To put the market out of reach in terms of convenient accessibility is to place an enormous and totally avoidable burden on those concerned. A friend of mine who bred Charollais cattle assures me that people came down from Scotland to buy his beef. However, those are pedigree herds; that is not our concern in East Sussex. We are concerned with the very opposite.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para79"></a>Farming in East Sussex is difficult enough without making it any harder. In our part of the world we are not dealing with a robust industry which can accommodate knocks; we are dealing with what has traditionally been a high effort, low return kind of business, the charm of which depended entirely on the quality of life which it offered. However, under present conditions the rewards have become even lower and the charm has almost disappeared. Many farmers are coming to the conclusion that the game is not worth the candle. In my case all my land is about to come in hand, and that is partly due to disenchantment. The reasons include the following: the frustration of trying to deal with endless paperwork generated by the bureaucrats in Brussels who never use the same form for two years together and whose wide-ranging demands impose an insupportable on-cost both in time and money; the difficulty of continuing to run dairy cattle caused by the reluctance of the transport companies to collect milk in the sort of quantities which small farms produce, and the fact that they have changed to new and enormous tankers which are simply unable to get up some of our lanes; and the extremely important fact that the price of milk is de facto determined by the supermarkets because of their unequal bargaining power and not by the producer which therefore makes small-scale production uneconomic.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para80"></a>This has led many farmers to convert to beef or sheep farming only to be caught out by the BSE epidemic. The Government told the farmers what beasts had to be killed and the slaughterhouses told them how much they were prepared to pay. The result was that the farmer was squeezed in the middle. No mention is made in the promoters' briefing note of the fact that increased sales to abattoirs have to a large extent been involuntary for the reasons I have mentioned. It would be wrong to regard farming as a healthy industry in this part of the world; it would be a great deal nearer the mark to describe it as holding on by the skin of its teeth. One of the most important matters that the Select Committee will have to consider, if the matter is ever placed before it, is alternative land use. If farming ceases to be financially viable for the small farmer, what is the land to be used for? Forestry is a dead duck; set aside can hardly be termed a land use; and amalgamation into larger units is not an option unless you are prepared to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>see hedgerows dug out and larger fields created. That brings us face to face with some serious social and environmental issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para81"></a>East Sussex is one of the most beautiful of the English counties and I believe it is the most wooded one. But, like all ecologies, the component parts are finely balanced and the Bill envisages taking away one of the main supporting structures. You cannot take away the pendulum without stopping the clock. If farmland is turned into wasteland, planning procedures cannot reverse the process; all they can do is to prevent things happening and the opportunity for that is now.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para82"></a>I turn to the narrower canvas of the town of Hailsham itself. It already has two supermarkets, the Co-op and Somerfield's--some would say three, if you count Spar. The town has a population of only 17,500 and therefore has absolutely no need of a third supermarket. That is a point worth emphasising since, as we all know, the underlying philosophy of the market-place is to undersell competitors, drive them out of business and then hold customers to ransom for the benefit of the directors and shareholders. I can see no long-term benefit to the inhabitants of Hailsham in setting the scene for a test of strength of that sort.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para83"></a>At the moment public consciousness has not woken up to the fact that supermarkets create undesirable environmental and economic change by their very existence. That is especially true in a market town with some pretensions to being a place of beauty. First, their architecture is out of scale with surrounding buildings and totally unmistakable. Secondly, they bring their own atmosphere with them; it is one of bulk trading, entirely incompatible with the small trader ambience of a market town. Thirdly, they require regular supplying by outsize articulated vehicles which nobody with any regard for the agreeableness and amenities of life in a small town would think of allowing within a built-up area. Fourthly, they deal in food which has often travelled vast distances and which discriminates against fresh food produced locally. Fifthly, they harm the businesses of local traders and local suppliers--they harm the first because they can afford to undercut them until they are driven out of business and the second because, as a result of unequal bargaining power, they distort the normal operation of the market by setting the price at the point of distribution instead of the point of supply. We have not yet woken up to the unfriendly consequences of asking superstores to come and live among us. They could teach the cuckoo a trick or two.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para84"></a>Your Lordships may well ask what are thought to be the supposed benefits of closing down the market. The answer, in a nutshell, is money. The shareholders of the Hailsham Cattle Market Company stand to make a great deal of money if the market ceases to function. It is alleged in the preamble to the Bill that the market is uneconomic; but that hardly squares with the facts. The market company itself appears to make &#163;24,000 rent per annum as freeholder, and at leaseholder level those who are petitioning against the Bill have already established that there is no shortage, as the noble Lord, Lord Monk Bretton, said, of firms ready to take over the lease as <P>


<a name="column_1633"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1633</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>market operator. If the present shareholders cannot arrange for the economic running of the market, then let them sell to other people who can.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para85"></a>Contrary to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kenilworth, the obligation is not upon the shareholders to run this market. They are not the people for whom we should feel sorry. The obligation is on the company. If people do not like owning a company which has that obligation, then they should sell the shares to other people who are only too anxious to buy them and continue running the market. There is no validity in the idea that the promoters of the Bill are in some way hard done by as a result of having the obligation to run a market. It is fundamentally unsatisfactory that such an important concern as Hailsham market should be run by people who have financial interest in seeing it decline. The sooner a change in ownership occurs, the better.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para86"></a>I dealt with the financial consequences to the farmer. I should also mention the social dimension, the importance of which cannot be exaggerated. A market is a friendly place. You meet your friends there. You "chew the cud". You have a drink--at least you do if the market is in Hailsham. You most certainly do not if it is moved two miles outside to Lower Dicker, where there are no pubs. A drink is important. You enjoy bangers and mash in the refreshment booths. You catch up on prices and are able to see what you are buying and what you could get if you were thinking of selling. Local gossip is exchanged. Old friends meet one another. Problems and complaints are aired. Know-how is exchanged. Crop performance and cattle prices are discussed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para87"></a>And that is only half the story. The wife is happy. She is taken into town to do her shopping. The local traders are delighted to see her and she meets her friends. Indeed, for some wives it is the only form of outing they get. One farmer wrote to me saying that being a farmer these days is a very lonely occupation because he has had to dispense with his farm-hands. We should not forget the stall-keepers and all those who have subsidiary market activities, such as selling veterinary services, and so on. There is a great deal more to a market than an accountant ever realises. It throbs with life and interest. Yet these are the very things that the Bill will do away with.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para88"></a>As noble Lords will see, I put down an Instruction to the Select Committee, which I gather may find favour with your Lordships. I have done so because rumour reaches me of a proposal to relocate the market at Black Barn Farm, Lower Dicker, a proposal, incidentally, which ignores the fairly substantial sums which have recently been spent on improving the facilities at Hailsham market.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para89"></a>I agree with everything said by the noble Lord, Lord Monk Bretton, about the necessity, if Hailsham market is closed, of ensuring that the promoters of the Bill are financially obliged to have an alternative site up and running, as he put it, before the old one is allowed to close. In outline, what happened in the case of Haywards Heath was that an undertaking was given, and no doubt that undertaking might have been honoured had the Department of Transport not been altering the <P>


<a name="column_1634"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1634</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>roads at the time, which made it impossible to provide access to the new site while the old market was still running. Whether that is a correct summing-up of the situation, I do not know, but it was a total disaster as far as the farmers using Haywards Heath market were concerned and it must not be allowed to happen again.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para90"></a>My second reason for the Instruction relates to the argument put forward by the promoters of the Bill that farmers can just as easily go to Guildford market, which is run by the same people, South East Marts. But for how long? Rumour says that the continuance of that market is not guaranteed: the local authority has its eyes on it for some quite different use. It seems to me that the Select Committee would want to ensure that it is given the full facts because no useful purpose is served by building on sand. I therefore hope that noble Lords will support the Instruction.

<A NAME="70725-07_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I know that the collective noun for girls is a "giggle", but I am not quite sure of the collective noun for maidens--at least in your Lordships' House. I shall not attempt one this afternoon. But I should like to congratulate two very distinguished Peers on their amusing, powerful and authoritative speeches. I look forward to hearing more of them in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para91"></a>I start by declaring two interests. The first is that Hailsham market is our local market and the estate that my husband runs uses it. In fact, only this Tuesday I went with him to the market where he was selling some barren cows. My second interest is, I suppose, vicarious in that my butcher uses the market. He is one of the best butchers in Sussex. But it occurred to me when I went to the market that with the recent E.coli outbreaks all the emphasis has been on traceability. But from my point of view, traceability is a non-issue. My butcher can tell me exactly on which pastures my Sunday roast was reared. So I have no problems with that. That perhaps is quite a lesson for the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para92"></a>We know that the vast majority of towns now are dominated by their supermarkets. But market towns are different. They are dominated by their markets. Cattle markets are situated in the heart of towns, on prime sites, sites which are coveted by supermarkets. It is no secret that they not only want the sites for development, but also want to see an end to the traditional cattle market, because they are the source of meat for independent butchers. Cutting off that source of supply hastens their demise and helps the supermarkets to monopolise the trade.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para93"></a>A few weeks ago Stourminster Newton market closed. That was not just another small market but the largest calf and cow market in Europe. Why? It was in order to make way for a supermarket. South East Marts, the operators of Hailsham market, has no compunction when it comes to asset stripping. We have heard already this afternoon that it sold Haywards Heath market to Sainsbury's. Thame and Guildford markets, I understand, are also under threat. But Hailsham?--Hailsham is protected by us, by Parliament.
<P>


<a name="column_1635"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para94"></a>As my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton said, it is the free market established by cattle markets that determines the price of meat. Destroying the cattle markets leaves price determination to supermarkets and their closely controlled suppliers. They seek to control both the price of milk and the price of meat. There is no regulator to ensure competition. So that falls to us.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para95"></a>Islington man may deplore subsidies for farmers and consider the countryside to be a public convenience. But there is a small simple step that we can take and that is to maintain competition and ensure that farmers get a fair price for their produce. It does no harm that supermarkets from time to time should have to buy in the open market and to be the highest bidder. Markets are public places, open to anybody's scrutiny. It would be good for the public to see what supermarkets buy and whether their "best British" is in fact the best.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para96"></a>I am not scaremongering. I quote directly from a welfare code dictated by supermarket buyers to our local dairy, a code of welfare which, although admirable in parts and very much welcomed by farmers, conceals the agenda to remove the open market from the farmers' options:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Whilst the welfare of stock after leaving the farm may not be under the control of the farmer, stock for slaughter may not be sent to a slaughterhouse conforming to relevant UK and EU legislation ... evidence must be provided". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para97"></a>The point to note is that the markets are not mentioned. Of course, it is right that animals should be humanely killed and all abattoirs should conform to regulations. But this is another prong in the attack against the free market. That code prohibits a farmer from sending his cattle to market. If he refuses, his milk will be rejected. It requires him to send his cattle to a slaughterhouse, where the supermarkets have control of conditions and price. The supermarket then buys the cattle market to exclude any free option and replaces it with one of its superstores.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para98"></a>Islington man gravitates towards Terence Conran at the Pont de la Tour for his &#163;50 luncheon. He and his smart friends have no empathy with the farmer, who gravitates towards the market with his two quid all-day breakfast. Farmers may be a tiny minority but they produce the majority of food for ordinary people, if not for Terence Conran. Around Hailsham, they maintain that area of astonishing scenic beauty, the Weald of Sussex.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para99"></a>Hailsham market has thrived for 750 years. I am sure that, if it were a stately home, it would be fiercely protected. But because it is an institution, it, like the ways of country life, has no protection against the determined assaults of urban man, except in ancient law, of which we, as parliamentarians, are the guardians.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para100"></a>We are also traditionally the guardians of the countryside. As the noble Lord, Lord Wrenbury, said, Hailsham sits in the heartland of some of the most beautiful landscape in the British Isles; landscape which is predominantly pasture. The land-use census figures compiled by MAFF confirm that. But it is the quality of the landscape which is so impressive.
<P>


<a name="column_1636"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1636</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para101"></a>Within the catchment area for the Hailsham market is the South Downs environmentally sensitive area; the High Weald, which is designated to be of outstanding natural beauty; the Pevensey Levels, which are of special scientific interest; and the areas of the Low Weald, Wealden Green Sand and the Romney Marshes. It is of course the farmers who are directly responsible for maintaining that heritage. They in turn require a local market in order to carry out their business. They are not going to subject their livestock to a 100-mile round trip in order to maintain their commercial activities, and the temptation to plough will be very great.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para102"></a>The loss of the market therefore threatens not only the way of life of the farming community, but the appearance of the landscape and the ecology in one of the most beautiful parts of Britain. I urge your Lordships to support the instructions put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Wrenbury, and my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton, for when this Bill goes before a Select Committee of your Lordships' House, as I suspect it will, we will want the committee to know the strength of feeling among your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para103"></a>Lastly, when the Bill goes before the Select Committee, if it does, costly evidence will have to be put forward by the petitioners--the NFU, the Country Landowners' Association, the district and town councils, local commercial interests, including independent butchers and, of course, the Hailsham Market Action Group--representing a wide range of interests of the local people. Those interests are very strong. They are fighting extremely hard against losing the market. Like the noble Lords, Lord Beaumont of Whitley and Lord Wrenbury, and my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton, I wish it were possible to spare them that huge expense. It will probably be inevitable, because this is the only way to deal with the Bill. However, I wish them every success in their endeavours and I hope that the battle to maintain the cattle market in Hailsham is handsomely won.

<P>
<A NAME="70725-07_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, the strength of feeling that this Private Bill has engendered is well illustrated by the list of distinguished speakers who have put down their names to take part in the Bill's Second Reading. I must say to the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, how much I enjoyed his speech. I should also like to tell him that I had the great honour of opening Clitheroe's new cattle market. While doing so I was approached by some photographers. "Come and have your photograph taken with me", I said to a group of farmers. "Oh no, we couldn't possibly do that", they said; "We haven't got our teeth in". One nearly always gets the truth from farmers. That cattle market too is in danger.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para104"></a>I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, with great interest, particularly his remarks about the lack of enthusiasm of the present proprietors. His amendment, attractive though it is, will not--I suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Wrenbury--rid us of this obnoxious Bill; it will merely delay it. I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, has agreed to withdraw his amendment. I am also extremely grateful that my noble friend <P>


<a name="column_1637"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1637</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Kenilworth has said that he will accept both the instructions in the names of my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton and my noble friend Lord Wrenbury.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para105"></a>My reasons for supporting the instructions are as follows. My noble friend Lord Kenilworth, on behalf of the promoters, virtually maintains that the present market is dying on its feet. I believe that with proper management there is a need for the present market to take place throughout the year, not just on a seasonal basis, for the foreseeable future. As other people have said, Hailsham market is the last live market in Sussex. There is already one supermarket in Hailsham. As a fervent supporter of small shops, my immediate reaction to yet another supermarket in the town is a feeling that its creation would mean leaving blanks where little shops used to be, no doubt including the butcher of my noble friend Lady Cumberlege.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para106"></a>I add my congratulations to my noble friend Lord Newton on his very informative speech. I share many of his sentiments. My main contention as regards the Bill concerns the promoters' offers of alternative accommodation. First of all, I ask myself, if they think the present market is not viable, why have they bothered to offer an alternative site? Secondly, I understand, for a variety of very good reasons such as bad buildings, no adequate car parking, no proper washing facilities, no proper safety precautions regulated by MAFF and the local authority, and no proper effluent disposal arrangements, that the Blackbarn Farm site is totally unsuitable.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para107"></a>Furthermore, I understand that the situation with regard to the A.22 is far from satisfactory. A new access would need to be created with permanent hard standing for parking. Planning permission would be required both for the access and the proposed change of use and for any new buildings to be erected on the site. There is no certainty that this could be obtained.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para108"></a>Lastly, at the time of the closure of the market previously operated by South East Marts Limited at Haywards Heath, assurances were given that a new market site would be built at Hickstead, but, despite the closure of Haywards Heath market some years ago, no new market has been built. I really do feel that no further market should be allowed to close in reliance upon an assurance to provide an alternative market site until the alternative site is operating, thereby ensuring the smooth transfer of the market operation as a going concern.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para109"></a>When you get a united front from the farmers who use the present market, the Wealden District Council, the NFU and others, all of whom are against the promoters of the Bill, it is time to take a stand and support their view that the termination of a cattle market facility in the Hailsham area would be damaging to local agriculture, the associated countryside and the rural economy of the area. I very much hope that the Bill will not proceed to the statute book.

<a name="column_1638"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1638</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>moved by my noble cousin Lord Monk Bretton and the noble Lord, Lord Wrenbury, I thought it would be rather impertinent of me to speak without ever having set foot in the Hailsham market. So I set off yesterday to have a look at it. I drove in and out of Hailsham three or four times, being unable to find the market. There were signs for the public library, public conveniences, an amenity centre and the industrial estate. There was even one for something called the Cuckoo Trail. But there was no sign for the market. However, I did in the end find it and spent some 10 minutes walking around and peering into the auctioneer's den. I can well understand why the person in Hailsham responsible for trying to attract tourism into Hailsham does not festoon the A.27 with large signs saying "Ye Olde 13th Century Market Place".
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para110"></a>However, we are not here to discuss architectural merit or the fact that a more profitable use for the site could be found. That is self-evident. We are here to try to stop a way of rural life being destroyed, which would happen if this market ceased.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para111"></a>I have no livestock and so have no direct interest in the market. My family estate does, however, own some 5,000 acres of farmland, partly in the Downs near Lewes and partly in the Weald near Mayfield. It is the farms around Mayfield, being in the area covered by the Wealden District Council, which also covers Hailsham, as we heard from my noble friend and neighbour Lord Newton, that I wish to discuss. I want to give the House some idea of the kind of farms that operate in the Weald.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para112"></a>We start at a small farm of 120 acres. The farmer also directly owns another 50 acres. He is a sheep farmer and came to the farm when he was six months old. He is now well into his late 60s and was widowed suddenly earlier this year. When I saw him yesterday he told me that he was still sorely missing his wife, but he had had some fantastic support from the farming community around. Indeed, one farmer telephoned him two days after his wife's death and said, "You're coming to dinner one night per week from now on". I cannot stress how important this rural mutual support is. Some three years ago I went to a meeting representing the Sussex branch of the Country Landowners' Association for a conference chaired by the Bishop of Lewes and Hastings on stress in the countryside. One of the farmers in the same area of Mayfield told us of the stress caused by loneliness experienced by farmers as one by one small farms were sold up and amalgamated. The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, touched on that in his speech and the noble Lord, Lord Wrenbury, also mentioned that fact.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para113"></a>The next farm that we called on is larger, a dairy farm farmed by a man, his wife and two sons, so in that case continuity is assured. He too has been there a long time. He was telling me yesterday that when he first arrived they still burnt charcoal down in the wood below the house. As part of the community spirit, for many years his wife has provided Sussex cream teas in a farm barn for handicapped people who come out in a special coach. That is another example of community in a rural area.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para114"></a>The next is another dairy farm with a son following his father. I had difficulty in finding him yesterday, but the smell of new-mown hay led me to where he was. <P>


<a name="column_1639"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1639</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I told him why I was coming up to your Lordships' House this afternoon. He said, "I rely absolutely on Hailsham market for my beef enterprise. You must do everything you can to keep the market open". Those are not my words, but those of a young man struggling to make a living in the Weald. I must stress that making a living is all we are talking about because no one makes any money in the Weald. The noble Lord, Lord Wrenbury, also confirmed that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para115"></a>At the top of the hill is another small farm of 67 acres. If I said that this farm was actively farmed I might be exaggerating. The farmer is over 85 years of age and he has been there since 1942. He always greets me standing in his garden pumping water from a well. "Morning, master", he says. He always calls me "master" which is a brilliant ploy as it so disarms me that I forget that I have come to talk about a rent increase. "Just getting some water to flush out the privy", he said. He nods towards the outside lavatory as if suggesting that I might do something about it. If there is anything more idyllic than spending a pleasant, fine afternoon leaning on a five-bar gate at the top of the Rother Valley, listening to an old man reminiscing about the old days, I cannot think of it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para116"></a>The last farm we shall visit in this sort of walkabout is a farmhouse which does not have any water at all. However, the farmer who operates the farm lives in a cottage nearby. In fact, he delivers water to the house in a kind of bucket on the back of his farm trailer. He told me that he does not do it very often because the occupant of the farmhouse does not like to dilute his whisky too much. This particular farmer who delivers the water farms 50 acres of his own and 50 acres of my land, as his father did, and lives in a thatched cottage which used to belong to my family. Just before the war it was lived in by an author who gave my predecessor a copy of a book with the inscription,

<A NAME = "70725-07_para117"></a>The book is called Mary Poppins. I believe that Mary Poppins country is very much what this delightful Rother Valley is. I thought it important to take noble Lords on this walkabout to show the kind of people who farm in the Weald and how important this market is to them.

If he is successful that will inevitably lead to the cessation of the traditional weekly practice of holding cattle markets down at Hailsham, Sussex. In my opinion the demise of this market will be a sad loss to the farming community and I declare an interest as a local farmer. It will lead to a number of undesirable consequences. In general, it would mean the further erosion of traditional rural farming practices and the replacement of local with national and commercial concerns. The potential ensuing loss and damage to the environment in its broadest sense has been eloquently put forward by my noble friend Lady Cumberlege.

<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para118"></a>But I would like to deal with the more specific matter of the difficulties of replacing an established and ancient market system, one first established in the 13th century, and the practical effects of such a change in the farming and peripheral trades.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para119"></a>The Act of 1871 was naturally concerned with promoting commercial profitability and improving trading practices, but its emphasis lay, according to the needs of the time, on allowing small farmers and breeders an outlet for their trade and a forum for exchanging goods across a broader spectrum. Its concern was to promote social justice and equity among all the participants. Livestock trading has now of course achieved a national dimension, but both for practical and social reasons this should complement, not replace, the older, local system.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para120"></a>Hailsham market is a centre which brings together a number of interrelated small businesses and country trades. Without the market as a focal point, they may experience serious difficulty in continuing profitably. For example, local butchers who buy direct from the market would not be able to compete with the larger chain stores which buy nationally; hauliers who specialise in local stock movements would find difficulty in competing with established long-distance specialists and local traders would lose the outside trade that is generated by the attractions of market day. It would be iniquitous if the dedicated traditional careers of so many were to be sacrificed to the commercial interests of outside parties.

<A NAME = "70725-07_para121"></a>Local stock farmers would obviously be the worst affected, particularly those with mixed livestock and smaller herds. The loss of a local outlet would mean for many a change in farming practice. It is simply not viable to transport animals considerable distances to market. It has been said that it would cost &#163;14 per head of cattle for transportation to Guildford and &#163;10 per head to the nearest other market at Ashford. Although some cost is involved in getting the same beast to Hailsham market, obviously the other costs would be two or three times greater.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para122"></a>I am sure that all noble Lords are aware that the issue of live animal transport has generated considerable concern in recent years--and rightly so. To risk encouraging the need for the long-distance transportation of often immature farm animals would be detrimental to good farming practice. Alternative ways of marketing livestock have been instituted in recent years, but with only limited success, as they do not answer the needs of the smaller farmers. For store cattle, the sales of which make up a large percentage of the trade of Hailsham market, there is simply no alternative.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para123"></a>The Bill, which seeks to repeal the 1871 Act, is promoted by the Hailsham Cattle Market Company and Carter Commercial Developments Limited. They have produced a document to support their contention that Hailsham cattle market in its current form is not a viable concern and should either be abandoned or replaced on another site with an alternative, modernised market more suited to contemporary needs. The existing site would therefore become available for alternative commercial development and we can only speculate as to who would stand to gain from this opportunity.

<A NAME = "70725-07_para124"></a>Hailsham market is the last live animal market still operating in East or West Sussex, apart from an occasional sheep market held at Rye. These markets often occupied sites situated in the centre of country towns and therefore potentially are of considerable commercial value to developers, as is the case in Hailsham. An alternative use for the land may produce a greater capital value, but this does not in itself mean that a cattle market is not a viable use for the land. The townspeople and local farmers believe that there is a need for a local market and that it encourages business, while the local residents do not object to its continuation. The market would benefit from improved management and promotion and this would seem to remain a realistic and desirable option--preferable to the disruption and inconvenience concomitant on its demise. The retention of the market is consistent with present-day government policies for the environment, transport and economy and with the original spirit of the Act of 1871. I hope that that Act remains in force.

<A NAME="70725-07_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Cadman: </B>   My Lords, this is a most unwelcome Bill not only because we have to be here to discuss it on a Friday afternoon, but because it involves relieving the present market operator at Hailsham of the responsibility of running a cattle auction there, with the subsequent loss of such a facility to a very large number of farmers. It seems that redevelopment as a supermarket site is involved. I have nothing against supermarkets--in fact, I rather enjoy shopping in them--but a recent quick visit to Hailsham revealed that there are already two supermarkets in the town and that the arrival of a third would do nothing to enhance the desirability of Hailsham as a shopping centre. We have heard that this is the reason why the local authorities are petitioning against the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para125"></a>One of my interests is railways. The redevelopment of supposedly surplus railway land into supermarkets is becoming highly controversial, especially with regard to need. It is the policy of the new Government to encourage the use of this mode of transport. My farming experience over many of my earlier years was gained around what has now become Milton Keynes. I managed to escape from there early enough to be able to farm on my own behalf about as far north in Buckinghamshire as I could get. Indeed, half the farm lay in Northamptonshire.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para126"></a>In my time I kept many different kinds of livestock, and marketing them to the best advantage was a problem. It soon became apparent that the local auction mart was the best solution. As Northampton was but eight miles away it was there that I went. It should be remembered that a farmer not only has to sell but to buy. This covers not only livestock but an enormous variety of other things. Incidentally, a farmer also must be able to operate all kinds of extremely complicated mechanical equipment safely and keep it properly maintained, and he has to apply and handle many different types of chemicals, some quite hazardous. It is a bit of a tall order, which is perhaps why farmers are not very well understood by the rest of society.

<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para127"></a>Farmers are also the custodians of the countryside and as such their position in society must be safeguarded. In that connection I associate myself with similar remarks made by other noble Lords. The local cattle market provides a place where one can not only buy and sell livestock in complete confidence, and get paid, but can trade arable crops and in many cases machinery and normally find someone to help with and discuss almost anything, socially or otherwise.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para128"></a>The facility at Northampton has succumbed to redevelopment even--it must be said--in part to a supermarket. But in this case a 13-acre industrial site has been purchased outside the town and properly equipped as a modern livestock market, with associated overnight truck stop facilities for the transport fraternity. There is a licensed cafe and excellent access just off the eastern bypass road. All of that cost the best part of &#163;1 1/3  million. Much of the funding has come from local agricultural interests, including auctioneers and local livestock traders. It seems strange that much the same kind of thing has not or will not happen in Sussex.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para129"></a>There is a lot of competition around Northampton. Banbury is not too far away. There is a good market at Rugby and there are others in the vicinity. In Sussex there appears to be no such competition. Looking at the Order Paper, unbelievably it appears that there is some risk to Guildford. The market operators do not appear to be interested. They are not serving the agricultural community or the town of Hailsham as they should, and for that I do not believe that the Bill should proceed in its present form.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para130"></a>During my time spent farming in North Bucks one of my neighbours, who derived much of his income from livestock trading, was a regular attender at Haywards Heath. Cattle that he purchased there would be passed on to other graziers, kept at home or possibly sold on in local markets such as Northampton. Another family who farmed in the area were, and still are, heavily involved in this activity, sourcing cattle in Guildford and Salisbury. Until its closure Haywards Heath was another source. Eventually this firm takes some of the cattle traded at Hailsham store market, although it does not attend personally. This demonstrates that there is a ready market for cattle raised in Sussex and the south of England to be further grazed and finished on the perhaps traditionally more fertile pastures of the Midlands.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para131"></a>As an occasional customer of these traders I may well have had on my farm stock born and bred in Sussex, and they have never given me any cause for concern. Cattle often benefit from a change of scene, and the removal of a point of sale under the circumstances of this Bill must be highly undesirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para132"></a>The one good thing about this debate is that it enables us to take a hard look at how the loss of similar cattle markets to various forms of development has affected the agricultural scene in general. This particular site is enshrined in parliamentary legislation, but many are in the hands of local authorities which have found themselves charged with providing a place where the very necessary business of agricultural trade can take place. For various reasons--I have already spoken of <P>


<a name="column_1643"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1643</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one--many authorities have found it necessary to redevelop their market sites and move the facility out of the town. Why cannot the same thing take place here?
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para133"></a>If the Bill receives a Second Reading this afternoon, and I hope that it will, it will go before a Select Committee, to which, it seems, adequate instruction will be given. Select Committees of the House have an excellent reputation for deliberating on knotty problems. I have had the privilege of serving on two of them. The petitioners can rest assured that their concerns will be well addressed. So I hope that we give the Bill a Second Reading so that the Select Committee, having been well instructed by other noble Lords, can ensure that in no way will the Bill survive in its present form.

<P>
<A NAME="70725-07_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lord Kenilworth on bringing forward the Bill. He has displayed great courage in doing so and has proved to be an admirable devil's advocate in promoting what most other speakers and I feel is a Bill which should not have been brought forward. In his excellent maiden speech, the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, was fair in his assessments. He weighed matters weightily in one hand, then the other, and came down firmly in the middle. Freed of the responsibilities of government, I shall not follow along that course. On the other hand, I shall not be tempted into too great a discussion on the individual merits of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para134"></a>The first question we have is whether the Bill should be given a Second Reading or whether it should be delayed for six months. Had the Bill remained in the form it was when it first came before us, and with the advocacy that then accompanied it, I have no doubt that we should have refused it a Second Reading. I know that I shall be in trouble with the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, for saying this, but it is not often that we do that although I voted for the voting down, as it were, of the Usk Bay Barrage Bill where at the end there was an equality of votes.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para135"></a>It is a simple matter. If the principle of the Bill is so objectionable that it should not be allowed to waste our time or the objectors' money, we have a duty to vote it down on Second Reading, and for that to be an end to it. Having listened to my noble friend Lord Kenilworth and everything else said today, I believe that the promoters have made sufficient motion to allow the matter to be discussed with enough good sense and clarity, and with the possibility of compromise, that we should let it go forward to the next stage. But it should be on the clear understanding that what the Bill's promoters are asking for is a concession from us.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para136"></a>The promoters do not have an asset; they have an obligation to run a market. They should not regard the money which might come from the site as theirs to do what they want with, subject to shelling out a few pennies to people who might be affected by the <P>


<a name="column_1644"></a>

<B>25 Jul 1997 : Column 1644</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill. This is a market. They have to show that it should no longer be run, and that the the consequences of that, which, in principle, would be a large sum of money, will be fairly and equitably dealt with. That is what I hope will be considered by the committee. That is the judgment that we trust to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para137"></a>The promoters have, as has been said, offered an alternative market site. My noble kinsman Lord Newton, in what was another excellent maiden speech, made clear why it was unacceptable to have a market at Dicker, although dicker would be an acceptable thing to do at a market. I hope that that is a view and an understanding that will be shared by the committee. We can leave it to the committee with added confidence, because, should that process go wrong and it returns a verdict so at odds with the evidence that it has received that it is objectionable to us, we of course retain the right to reject the Bill on Third Reading. All things considered, we should support the general sense of the House today, give the Bill its Second Reading, subject to the Instructions which have been proposed, and see what proceeds thereafter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70725-07_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Tordoff: </B>   My Lords, as the Chairman of Committees is temporarily indisposed it has been suggested that I should stand in his place to say the few words that he would have spoken at this stage in the debate. It is not his responsibility nor is it mine to take part in discussions on the merits of the Bill. However, as a Motion has been tabled which would reject the Bill on Second Reading, it is proper that I should intervene briefly to remind the House--not that it necessarily needs reminding--about some of the procedural implications of the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Beaumont of Whitley, even though he has indicated his intention to withdraw it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para138"></a>There is no doubt that the House can reject a Private Bill on Second Reading, although it has not done so since 1937. That is probably a longer time than the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, was thinking of--in fact, it is probably longer than the noble Lord, Lord Lucas! I am sure that the House will want to bear in mind the effect of giving a Private Bill a Second Reading. In contrast with the Second Reading of a Public Bill, the Second Reading of a Private Bill does not amount to the House giving its approval of its general principle. From what we have heard today, noble Lords will be grateful for that reassurance.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725-07_para139"></a>If the House agreed to the Second Reading of the Bill the effect would simply be to agree that the Bill should be considered by a Select Committee. It is the Select Committee to which the Bill is committed which decides on its general principle. The Select Committee has the right to reject the Bill if it sees fit. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is correct in saying that after it is accepted by the Select Committee, if it is, it will come back to this House for further consideration.

<P>
<A NAME="70725w01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   A total of 313 delegates attended the Anti-Smoking Summit on 14 July. At least 50 of the organisations represented by those attending are likely to be in receipt of central or local authority support. Further detail could only be available at disproportionate cost. The cost of the event was &#163;55,748.00 (excluding value added tax). The Office of National Statistics findings (ONS (97) 182) show that 69 per cent. of current smokers say that they would like to stop smoking. The summit was held to examine options for reducing smoking, controlling tobacco consumption and helping those who want to stop smoking to do so. A wide range of interests were represented at the summit--from the media, business, the arts, and sport, to the medical professions and health charities. Also present were representatives of interests likely to be affected by the Government's manifesto commitment to ban tobacco advertising. In addition, national and international experts in tobacco control were asked to examine in detail the options for reducing smoking by pooling their knowledge and experience on what strategies work in practice. The conclusions of the summit will inform the development of a White Paper, to be published later in the year. The White Paper will set out in full the Government's plans for <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the United Kingdom at the meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers held in Brussels on July 22. He was accompanied at the meeting by the Lord Dubs, Under-Secretary of State in the Northern Ireland Office.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725w02_para0"></a>The principal business of this Council was to consider the Commission's proposal introducing, as a measure to protect public health, an EU-wide prohibition on the use of specified risk materials from cattle, sheep or goats. The Council was called upon to consider this proposal since it had failed to secure a qualified majority at the Standing Veterinary Committee held on 16 July. Following prolonged negotiations in the Council, the Luxembourg Presidency was able to establish that a simple majority of member states supported the Commission's proposal: those member states were Sweden, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Finland, Ireland, France and the United Kingdom. The way is now open for the Commission to act on its own competence and give effect to this measure, which will come into force on 1 January 1998. We very much welcome the fact that a majority of member states was able to support a measure which will bring the EU broadly into line with UK practice in respect of the removal of specified risk materials from bovine carcasses, and extend that practice also to sheep and goats.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725w02_para1"></a>The Commissioner gave a full report to the Council on the recent discovery of illegal exports of beef from the United Kingdom to other EU member states. My right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food emphasised to the Council the importance which the United Kingdom attaches to the prevention of fraud and to maintaining strict controls within slaughterhouses and meat plants.
<P>

<A NAME = "70725w02_para2"></a>The Agriculture Council also heard Commissioner Fischler give a full account of the recently published approach to further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in the framework of the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals. The Commissioner emphasised the importance of proceeding urgently with changes to the arable, dairy and beef sectors in particular, as well as certain Mediterranean products, in order to prepare the EU for the next round of WTO agricultural negotiations and to facilitate the enlargement of the EU. My right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food welcomed the Commission's initiative and urged the Council to engage in detailed discussions as quickly as possible. The Council will revert to this important subject in the early autumn.
<P>
