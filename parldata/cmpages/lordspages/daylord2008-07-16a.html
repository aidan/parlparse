<ul><a name="08071684000271"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What steps are being taken to measure and reduce the carbon footprint of Members and staff of the House of Lords travelling on parliamentary business.</p>

Payments are made into the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund, which funds projects to reduce emissions in the developing world. A high proportion of European Select Committee travel is undertaken by rail rather than air because many of the destinations, such as Brussels, are easily accessible by train.</p>

He will be aware that CO2 emissions for plane journeys to Glasgow amount to 95.4 kilograms, compared with 21.3 kilograms for train journeys. On journeys to Brussels and Paris, the advantage in favour of Eurostar is 10:1. Does he agree that the House could do rather more to encourage everyone to travel by means that are cost-effective and environmentally friendly? Is there some way in which Members of the House could have the carbon footprint of their journeys identified and pointed out to them?</p>

Does the Chairman of Committees therefore agree that, ultimately, the total carbon footprints created by the livestock and transport industries are about the same size? Should the Government penalise the farmer and the parliamentarian motorist at the same level of green taxation? Would we then not all be obliged to reduce our individual carbon footprint, following the inspirational lead of the right honourable gentleman the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, by becoming a nation of vegetarian bicyclists?</p>

Although police officers have the discretion to ask people not to take photographs for public safety or security reasons, the taking of photographs in a public place is not subject to any rules or statute. There are no legal restrictions on photography in a public place and no presumption of privacy for individuals in a public place. There are no current plans to review this policy.</p>

Photographers are sometimes filmed themselves; they are told to move on or asked for their name and address. They feel that they are being harassed. Although that development no doubt relates to the changed security situation, will my noble friend seek discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers and other interested parties with a view to establishing clearer guidelines to be consistently applied and a mutually acceptable balance between security needs and the legal right to take photographs in public places?</p>

Does the Minister agree that at the census content workshop in March, representatives of the Gypsies and Travellers, and of the CRE, were unanimous in asking for two separate categories to be included; namely, Gypsy and Irish Traveller? The only reason given by the ONS for not doing so was lack of space on the form. Will the Minister ask the ONS to divide the available space into two, using a smaller typeface if necessary, so that the two separate categories can be accommodated and local authorities will have the data that they need for their local development frameworks, in which Gypsies and Travellers have to be provided with separate land?</p>

However, we cannot be complacent. Women tell us that they want more choice in their maternity care. That is why, to make that happen, among other things, we announced in January an additional &#163;330 million of funding for maternity care, and in February action to recruit an additional 4,000 midwives by 2012.</p>

Does she agree that it is unacceptable for women to feel pressurised into considering a home birth, as the Healthcare Commission reported last week, particularly if home birth is regarded as a default choice by women who are worried about understaffed or badly equipped labour wards but who might then expose themselves and their babies to danger should they need the emergency transfer service, which itself might be underfunded and unable to cope?</p>

Current evidence supports the fact that when healthy women are offered the option of home birth, there is every indication of success. However, the noble Baroness is correct: it is not, as she put it, a default position. The key to ensuring a safe childbirth is an early assessment of the mother&#146;s and baby&#146;s needs. We are trying to ensure that PCTs will be judged on whether they can increase the number of women who access maternity care by the twelfth week of pregnancy. This early access enables a healthcare professional to assess the mother&#146;s and baby&#146;s needs and, indeed, whether the pregnancy is high-risk. At that stage the mother will be advised about the risks of a home birth. Clearly, part of this equation is that, when things go wrong, PCTs need to have planned the right response to ensure the safety of mother and baby.</p>

Does the Minister agree that what is critical is not more government policy but implementing present policy and matching the increase in the number of births, which rose by 90,000 in the past six years, with the number of training places?

It provides that all obstetric units must have a lead obstetrician and a labour ward manager, as well as a minimum of 40 hours&#146; consultation presence, with 60 hours in larger units. At least twice a day, and during the weekend and bank holidays, there should be a physical round made by the consultant. We are pursuing that standard with great energy.</p>

We did not support this suggestion, for two reasons, as set out in the report. First, we consider it very important to uphold the principle that ad hoc committees are appointed for a specific purpose and for a specific and finite length of time. The appointment of an ad hoc<I></I>committee on an open-ended basis goes against this principle. Secondly, we are not convinced that the mechanism of an ad hoc committee with the terms of reference of the intergovernmental organisations committee is the right way to address the sorts of issue which the noble Lord, Lord Soley, has suggested as potential future subjects of inquiry. If the noble Lord wishes to pursue this, we suggest that he might reconsider how best to achieve it.</p>

The Leader of the House has now reported back to us that she has not been able to persuade her colleagues in the Commons of the merits of this idea.

<a name="80716-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08071684000085"></a>Obviously, I could not be a member of a committee to review my own formula. I wish the committee well&#151;unless it is thought that I should be a member. I should be happy to be but it would be wrong to review my own formula. That should be done by others and I am happy to leave it in their most capable hands. I strongly support the recommendation of the Liaison Committee and recommend it to the House.</p>

I place on record that I of course originally asked for a sessional committee. I share the Liaison Committee&#146;s view that an Intergovernmental Organisations Select Committee should not be ad hoc but sessional. All members of the committee and other Members of this House who have discussed this with me believe there is a need for such a sessional committee. We will return to the Liaison Committee with such an application.</p>

<a name="80716-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08071684000087"></a>I have a couple of other points in relation to this. First, it would have helped if the report that will come out next Monday on the control of globally transmitted infectious diseases had been before the committee in time. It was not because&#151;as I know the noble Lord fully accepts&#151;the two Ministers could not give evidence on the date originally agreed at the beginning of June and had to delay until the end of June. It would have been wrong to produce the report without having the Ministers&#146; comments before the committee. The report will now be out next Monday.</p>

<a name="80716-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08071684000088"></a>When the noble Lord looks at the report&#151;I hope that other Members of this House will do so&#151;he will find that it meets the aims discussed at the last Liaison Committee and published in House of Lords Paper 118, which suggested a more thematic approach to this. By addressing the profoundly important question of infectious diseases we were able to focus not on the governance of intergovernmental organisations&#151;I have always been clear that a committee of this or any House should not do that&#151;but on the way British taxpayers&#146; money is used and how government departments focus on and use the decisions and functions of intergovernmental organisations.</p>

<a name="80716-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08071684000089"></a>The report on infectious diseases makes important recommendations. I make this point as clearly as I can. Members will see when they look at the report the welcome response we got from those who gave evidence to us; it came not only from people in this country&#151;the British Government welcomed it&#151;but also from the World Health Organisation and a number of other organisations. In view of the first Question this afternoon, I emphasise we had to go abroad only twice: once to Geneva and once to Paris. We took the rest of the evidence through video links. I hope to use the Skype system should we be able to continue our work in future.</p>

<a name="80716-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08071684000090"></a>In doing that, I again emphasise that many of the intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations involved in the spread of infective diseases told us how important this was and that they wished other Parliaments were doing it. Indeed, in the case of the United States, we not only took evidence via a video link but two people from separate organisations came over to see us, one of whom came entirely at the expense of the institution for which they worked. That is an indication of the seriousness and importance of the issue.</p>

<a name="80716-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08071684000091"></a>I share the view that it should not be an ad hoc committee. I say that again because that was my original application. However, the importance of the  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1251"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1251</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>intergovernmental organisations is enormous, not only in what is happening in global governance but in terms of the money that goes in from the British taxpayer. For example, the committee was concerned about the proposal by one of our members to look at a peacekeeping operation. Regardless of whether or not the British are involved in a peacekeeping operation, we have to pay between 5 or 6 per cent of it. That is an important matter for the taxpayer and I ask the chairman of the committee to consider this when we come back to him in the next Session.</p>

I am grateful to the Leader of the House, who sought to persuade her opposite number in another place that this was a good idea, and I regret that she was unable to prevail. The fact that it has taken nearly six months between the decision of the Liaison Committee and the communication she reported to it last week is not, I hope, a reflection of the attitude of another place towards this House. It is a sad moment but we will hear more of this because my right honourable friends in another place have said that they support us and I hope the Houses may be able to revisit the issue in a couple of years&#146; time.</p>

It may not appear from the rather polite minute just how much indignation there was in the committee at the actions of the other place in refusing to set up a Joint Committee. I remember that when the Bill went through this House much of the support for the concept of a scrutiny committee was on the basis that in this House there was particular and specific expertise. The noble Lord, Lord Moser, who is in his place, is one example of those who would have contributed to the work of such a Joint Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08071684000094"></a>I hope the other place will think again about this issue, otherwise my solution&#151;having learnt the hard way about how the other place will deal with it&#151;is that we write more specifically into such Bills an insistence that when we are talking about parliamentary scrutiny the other place cannot then redefine that as House of Commons scrutiny. I was very clear when this Bill went through this House that when we talked about parliamentary scrutiny we meant scrutiny by experts in both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08071684000096"></a>I shall explain why I regard it as a serious setback for the Government&#146;s intentions behind this legislation. From the beginning it was made clear that the new Statistics Authority&#151;it was then called a &#147;board&#148;&#151;would have Parliament as its ultimate master, rather than Ministers. That was the whole point that led the then

Ministers would be replaced in this crucial authority by Parliament. That meant much more than occasional questions or reports; it meant that there would be serious parliamentary monitoring, year after year, of what the authority did. That has now been rejected by the authorities in the other place, for what I regard as rather pathetic reasons&#151;at least, the reasons that I have been told. It is a setback, first, for the Government in their original intentions; secondly, for the working of the new authority; and, thirdly, for government statistics generally. It is a serious matter in all those respects.</p>

It was expected to last only one, two or maybe three years. The situation has changed but the formula has lasted 30 years, which was quite unexpected.

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08071684000100"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, on the persistence with which he has gone about this. I suspect that it is a bit like the Schleswig-Holstein question, but in this case the noble Lord is very much alive and understands it. Not many people, especially those who pontificate on it in the press and elsewhere, understand it, but it is vital. I have no idea how these things are done, but I suggest that the noble Lord should not be allowed to be a First World War general and say, &#147;Over the top, lads! By God, I wish I was going with you&#148;, but should be very much a part of the ad hoc committee, if for no other reason than that he understands it and its implications.</p>

Following the debate in this House on Monday evening, my ministerial colleagues and I reflected on the thoughtful contributions made by the noble Lords, Lord Lucas and Lord Oakeshott, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. I was in particular struck by the constructive approach taken by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott. He has acknowledged  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1254"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1254</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the risks are great and that we are in uncharted territory, so something has to be done. He has also urged the Government to put more detail of his attentions in the Bill, to give clarity to the industry and to ensure that a workable arrangement is reached between the industry and the Pensions Regulator on this important issue.</p>

<a name="80716-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08071684000113"></a>In our consultation, we requested responses on our proposed legislative approach. In that document, we suggested taking a broad amending power in primary legislation to follow with the specific detail of the changes in regulations. We did this for a number of reasons. First, we wish to give this House sufficient notice of our intent, which an introduction at Report stage would not do. There was insufficient time following consultation for an alternative legislative approach at Committee. Secondly, we wished to be thorough in consultation, and, having consulted widely on our policy intentions, to follow with a second consultation on the details in secondary legislation. This would help to mitigate the undesirable consequences of regulation, to which the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, referred this week. Thirdly, we believe that, as the DWP does not have a pensions Bill every year&#151;thankfully&#151;the need to react to future unforeseen issues in pensions avoidance might be best served in this way.</p>

<a name="80716-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08071684000114"></a>As we have consistently demonstrated, our intention is to work with our stakeholders closely, both on the draft legislation and on the regulatory guidance that would detail the specific requirements on schemes and their sponsors. However, it is clear from this week&#146;s discussions, that noble Lords would prefer a greater amount of this legislation in the Bill, to ensure that the regulator&#146;s powers are constrained by primary legislation.</p>

<a name="80716-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08071684000115"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, felt that we were asking for a blank cheque to be given to secondary legislation. While this has never been our intent, this view has been reflected in some feedback received from key stakeholders. We agree with the principle. The slippage of our anticipated date of Royal Assent from July to later this year, gives us the opportunity to put more detail in the Bill. I am confident that we will find an appropriate way forward which addresses those concerns.</p>

<a name="80716-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08071684000116"></a>I am happy to assure noble Lords that our intention remains to work closely with them and stakeholders over the summer and to return in the autumn with more of the proposed detail included in this amendment. We have discussed the potential for setting up a working group in this area with the CBI. It is supportive of the need to extend the regulator&#146;s powers to deal with new market developments, but shares the noble Lords&#146; concern that more detail should be place in primary legislation. Alongside this we will work with the Pensions Regulator as it develops guidance to ensure that that guidance is clear and gives appropriate reassurance to business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08071684000117"></a>It is therefore right that we work through the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, some of which we can agree with in principle, so that I can be as clear as possible on the Government's position on the points raised. However, I should be clear that nothing in this

We are grateful to him for putting that on the record. However, it does not change the fact that the Government are choosing to press ahead with the amendment notwithstanding the fact that it has not been properly consulted on. They did not expose Amendment No. 130EW to consultation. They received a large number of responses to their different consultation, many of which disagreed with the drift of what the Government were trying to do, but within days of the consultation ending they published their draft amendment, indicating that they had no intention of taking account of the consultation itself. We believe that it would be right for further discussion to take place on the basis of the Government having an open mind. But the Government have chosen not to have an open mind. We will therefore progress with our amendments on the Marshalled List, because it is important that the arguments put to us are properly recorded in <I>Hansard</I> alongside any consideration of the Government's own amendment.</p>

<ul><a name="08071684000256"></a>&#147;... if it created serious new risks. I should like to reassure noble Lords that it is not our intention that by introducing provisions we materially increase such risks&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/7/08; col. 1086.]</ul>
<p><a name="08071684000238"></a>Those are very fine sentiments, but that is not what the new clause in Amendment No. 130EW proposes. That new clause focuses on producing regulations as if there are material risks either to the benefits of members of pension schemes or of compensation being payable to the PPF. We believe that it is quite possible that the regulations will increase both those risks and, therefore, that they should be properly considered in those terms before regulations are produced.</p>

<a name="80716-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08071684000122"></a>Let us consider the risk to benefits of members of pension schemes. The CBI, for example, has pointed out to us that if further clearance applications are a result&#151;and many believe that that will be the case if Amendment No. 130EW is in the legislation&#151;there will be a considerably increased cost imposed on business to deal with them. The CBI estimates that each clearance costs between &#163;50,000 and &#163;100,000 as a result of the many advisers and valuation fees involved in putting together those applications. That will inevitably lead

It is a question not of causing a decline in defined benefit schemes&#151;they are in terminal decline&#151;but of what the rate of decline will be.</p>

<a name="80716-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08071684000123"></a>We have also had comments from people who are aware of how turnaround situations work. They say that these new powers potentially make turnarounds more difficult and will possibly hasten businesses being placed into insolvency. That obviously poses a risk to the benefits of members because the PPF levels of compensation fall well short of those within a defined benefit scheme. As I stated previously in Committee, while it is often said that the PPF gives 90 per cent cover, that is often down as far as 60 per cent and it is around 80 per cent on average.</p>

<a name="80716-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08071684000124"></a>There is also the question of whether this power will help the retention of DB schemes, because the regulations might be used to impose additional liabilities on those who are able to lend financial support to employers struggling with DB schemes, merely through being connected with those employers. Employers with an attached DB scheme will find themselves unsaleable and unattractive investment targets. If that is the case, they will find it more difficult to find investment partners and, inevitably, the employer covenant reduces.</p>

<a name="80716-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08071684000125"></a>As to the risk to the benefits of members of pension schemes, there is also a risk to the compensation being payable from the PPF. Again, those involved in turnarounds say that turnarounds and recovery will be more difficult because it will become more difficult to obtain new investment or to sell assets to pay off secure debt without being at risk under what are potentially the new rules. Clearance is not an answer in the turnaround situation because of time criticality. For example, you need to obtain refinancing in order to meet payroll obligations. We do not have an insolvency or turnaround regime which allows a lot of time for decisions to be made. If clearances are not pursued, further financing is just as likely not to be available and likely to accelerate the move of the employers into insolvency which, of course, will thereby increase the risk to the PPF of compensation becoming payable.</p>

<a name="80716-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08071684000126"></a>The point I am trying to make is that it is entirely foreseeable that the new rules that have been postulated by the Government will increase the risks&#151;both to members of pension schemes and of compensation becoming payable to the PPF. The only point of Amendment No. 130EW is that the Secretary of State should take into account those risks before issuing any regulations. That is what our amendment seeks to do. I beg to move.</p>

However, the Government have obviously taken their decision.</p>

<a name="80716-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08071684000128"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, for the kind words and considerable amount of re-playing of my speech in the statement. I could say to him that flattery will get you almost anywhere. But it would have been a lot more helpful if his boss, the Minister for pension reform, had taken the trouble to read my speech. Perhaps he might have spent a little more time reading it and a little less time making increasingly frenzied phone calls to my colleagues in the Commons yesterday. I think he made three calls to our present spokesman and one to our former spokesman. But he did not favour me with a call, so I spent most of my time hearing the things that he was saying about what I had said which indicated clearly that he had not read my speech. I thought&#151;and I thank the Minister for this&#151;that my speech was reasonably balanced and constructive; I certainly did not recognise any of it in the calls that &#147;Macho Mike&#148; was making on Tuesday.</p>

<a name="80716-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08071684000129"></a>I am pleased to say that the tone has suddenly changed overnight. I have in my pocket four messages asking me to ring Mike O&#146;Brien, so I am glad that we are suddenly all friends again. Seriously, however, this is not the way to go about things at this early stage of scrutiny on a Bill and wastes quite a lot of time. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, will remember that, as I have said, we had a similar situation in 2004; but we have probably had six, seven or eight Ministers in Mr O&#146;Brien&#146;s position since then, all called different things. Just a little checking of what happened, or even taking some notice of his noble friend Lord McKenzie, would have been sensible. We should learn a lesson from this. It was not a constructive way to go about things, and I am glad that people have now, I hope, read my speech. I put a lot of thought into it, and we have been here before.</p>

<a name="80716-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08071684000130"></a>This is not a party political issue. As we did in 2004, we are all of us trying to get the right Bill that will work for an important and serious issue. I welcome a more constructive approach. I do not think that a meeting, although Mr O&#146;Brien has now kindly offered one, would be appropriate at the moment. The right way to do it would be for the Government to consult properly over the summer, not just with the CBI, the BVCA, the TUC and anyone with a legitimate and substantial interest in these matters. When the Government have completed those consultations and worked out what they want to do, and have some draft amendments, I would very much welcome the opportunity to meet Mr O&#146;Brien and the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie; I hope that that will be taken up. Indeed, if the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, came as well, it would be wonderful to get government amendments to which we could all put our names.</p>

<a name="80716-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08071684000131"></a>However, Mr O&#146;Brien must remember that we on these Benches are legislators, not stakeholders. We will ultimately need to decide, but I suggest that that is the right way to go about it. Again, I put on the record my serious concern over the dangers for British pension funds from what is going on in the buy-out industry. We are in uncharted waters. The covenant of some of these companies that are offering buy-outs is not

Speaking as someone who has been managing pension funds for 30 years and who ran the Courtaulds pension fund for five years, I would not be happy to have my pension fund taken away for the sponsoring employer behind it and sold off to one of these companies. These &#147;zombie funds&#148; are an accident waiting to happen. One can foresee many private-equity-backed companies going into receivership over the next year or two with serious consequences for their pension funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08071684000132"></a>I am totally with the Government on what they are trying to achieve. I support what the Pensions Regulator is trying to do. However, there is a right way to go about these things, properly taking into account the views expressed by people with a legitimate interest. I hope that that process will happen over the summer.</p>

Back in 2004, I was rightly persuaded by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that there was a real issue of moral hazard in that Bill; and that, in establishing the TPR to avoid Maxwell-type rip-offs, we might tip over into preventing mergers, acquisitions and restructuring of companies. Those things would be highly desirable, both for the employees whose jobs might otherwise be at risk and for the health of British industry. The question then, as now, was how we assessed the balance between those risks and ensured that restructurings in good faith were not subsequently undermined by any rigid appliance of compliance rules by the TPR.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08071684000134"></a>With the help of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and other Members of your Lordships&#146; House, including the noble Lords, Lord Oakeshott, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Higgins, we devised flexible and relatively informal clearance arrangements, which I understand&#151;despite the cost which the noble Baroness suggested&#151;have worked well, have not been abused and are welcomed as a way of offering comparative flexibility in a fast-moving scene, as well as appropriate scrutiny by TPR and security for scheme members. There are, of course, three objectives here.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08071684000135"></a>The point of this amendment is the process, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott; namely, how we did it. As far as I can judge, the Government&#146;s proposed procedure, as outlined by my noble friend, is broadly similar to the one we adopted in 2004, which all parties say worked well. There was a framework proposal in the Bill, reflected in Amendment No. 130EW, together with draft regulations that we worked on over that summer, on which there was extensive co-operation from your Lordships and extensive consultation with the industry. They were published and made available for formal scrutiny by this House. If necessary, we were willing to make further adjustment in the Bill, as my noble friend indicated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08071684000136"></a>It is the case now as then&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, was spot on on this&#151;that new forms of pension activity, from bulk buy-outs to some of the

Some nasty scenarios could emerge that we cannot yet predict or foresee. What Maxwell taught us&#151;and the work of TPR, PPF and FAS has surely confirmed this&#151;is that as far as possible we need to see around the corner, and if we cannot do that, we need at least to fence the precipice and not always rely on sending in ambulances after the event.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08071684000137"></a>TPR powers as they stand are not adequate to cover some of these emerging risks and address the new mark 2 version of emerging moral hazard issues. My noble friend will correct me if I have misunderstood this, but until recently there was broad consensus about how we move forward and general support for the Government&#146;s draft regulations on which we are consulting. I am not sure why that broad consensus seems to have broken down in the past few weeks, although I suppose that some bodies, for example venture capital bodies, might find some aspects of the regulations irksome in a fast-moving world. I can see why they might argue that, but when set against the proper interests of scheme members and the like, one should not assume that they have the monopoly of the best interests of all stakeholders and players. Government and TPR, not any particular interest, always have to hold the ring between entirely legitimate but conflicting and competing concerns.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08071684000138"></a>The assumptions behind some of the comments by noble Lords in Committee on Monday therefore surprised me. They appeared to suggest that the Government were behaving unscrupulously and that they needed to be watched because they might introduce retrospective and unreasonable requirements. I thought that was an odd and unreasonable charge to make, because the Government are acting for all of us, especially the employees whose pension savings could be at risk. I believe the charge of bad faith should not be levelled at the Government, but at the occasional company or organisation that&#151;I know: we were burnt by it&#151;does not always behave with full probity and seeks to cut corners. Government are continually scrutinised, and rightly so. Emerging forms of pension structure, however, are not so scrutinised. For its regulation to be adaptive and flexible, TPR needs that head space of additional powers&#151;that is what we are talking about&#151;without being sure in what precise way they might be applied. It is no use waiting for future primary legislation. The old adage about closing the stable doors comes to mind, because, from my experience in 1995, in pensions legislation we are always one step behind. We need TPR to have generic powers that are properly scrutinised, following proper consultation of regulations, to cope with the unforeseen. Those regulations must have broad support.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08071684000139"></a>Since 1995, when I was first engaged in pensions legislation, we have always been fighting the previous war. Remember how long MFR lasted and how robust it turned out to be? Remember the unsuccessful efforts of some of us to get a central funding scheme, with the result that we had to invent the PPF five years down the line? If we had got the PPF when we called for it, it could have resolved the problems that FAS had to be invented to adjust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08071684000140"></a>Governments of all persuasions, my own included, too often have been leaden-footed on pensions when crises emerge, because they do not have the head space of regulatory powers entrusted with an organisation such as TPR&#151;it did not exist in 2004&#151;to scrutinise in the public interest, on behalf of all of us, and to strike the right balance.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08071684000141"></a>My noble friend has listened. He has moved during these debates, for example on qualifying earnings, where sensible discussions are now taking place. I hope that those discussions will bring us to an amicable result. The amendments strike the right balance and are proportionate. I am perfectly comfortable with any assurances that my noble friend may wish to give tonight about retrospectivity, which I agree can be uncomfortable territory to occupy; clearance schemes; the offer to put further wording in the Bill, and the like.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08071684000142"></a>In pensions, the scenario, as the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, rightly said, is changing fast, and TPR does not have the head space in its regulatory powers at the moment to address those issues as and when they might arise. I urge the Committee not to follow the example of the Bourbons, who, I am sure noble Lords are aware, allegedly learnt nothing and forgot nothing. We know what happened to them.</p>

I always find her persuasive, and she was particularly so on this occasion. She set out all our common objectives very well. Perhaps I put a little more emphasis on trying to amend Amendment No. 130EW, merely to set out the Government&#146;s stated intentions more clearly in the Bill&#151;that is perhaps a kind way of putting it&#151;and to make clear the limits of the power.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08071684000144"></a>I entirely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, that the Pensions Regulator needs the flexibility to deal with the attempts that will be made, particularly in difficult economic circumstances, to sidestep the pension fund liability. By and large, I do not think that Governments proceed with malevolence towards companies running pension funds, but I do think that they are guilty of serial idiocy. Certainly, I would convict us of that, in our 1995 Bill, in not realising how things would play out. I picked up an echo of that from what the Minister said when last we met. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08071684000248"></a>&#147;On the fair value point touched on by the noble Lord, it is not the Government&#146;s intention that a transaction, whereby a person purchases assets or securities at fair value, would normally trigger the regulator&#146;s use of its anti-avoidance powers, provided that, as part of the transaction, the pension scheme was properly considered and adequately addressed. However, the fact that a person had purchased assets or securities at fair value would not necessarily provide the reassurances needed. That would be only the first step in ensuring that capital was available to mitigate the risks to the scheme; it does not of itself get the capital to the scheme&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/7/08; col. 1089.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08071684000145"></a>There we are seeing part of a process&#151;which, I agree, we started and which has carried on since&#151;which is making the pension fund gradually into some sort of super-creditor, giving it rights over and beyond that of an ordinary, unsecured creditor, moving it ever more into a position where it has additional, superior  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1261"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1261</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rights. We see echoes of that in other parts of the amendment. My difficulty is that we are pushing companies in the direction of receivership, because it is the forum under which these conflicts are most clearly dealt with. I hope that we all agree with the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, that receivership is not the best option. The best option is for a pension fund to continue to be looked after by a company that recognises its obligations. In that way you can, over the long term, get much more for the pensioners than you ever can from receivership, particularly in difficult circumstances. To do that we must recognise that the pension fund is taking a risk, making a commercial decision and entering into a partnership with the company. We should also recognise that the company is using money that the pension fund might otherwise try to lay its hands on. We have to allow for that commercial relationship to proceed without the possibility of a great backwash retrospectively against what seemed sensible decisions at the time.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08071684000146"></a>As my noble friend Lady Noakes has said, clearance has grown into a great industry. There are professional clearance advisers who do nothing else and make a great deal of money. We may push companies into a position whereby every decision might be viewed as depriving the pensioners of access to assets, such as paying a dividend, selling an operation, or, in relation to the terms of trade with some associated overseas company, entering into a big contract, which has sunk many companies. If all those decisions are to be questioned and there is personal liability for the directors as a result, it will become extremely difficult to run companies with defined benefit schemes of any magnitude. We must think very carefully if we are going to threaten or enact regulations that push companies in the direction of receivership.</p>

Perhaps the only contribution that I want to make to this debate is for the Minister. In many respects I have been down this road before. The one thing that I always tried to avoid during the many years that I was a Minister was pressure from within the department, particularly from my fellow Ministers&#151;usually from the Treasury and the committees that look after legislation&#151;to legislate in a rush.

We will almost certainly need further time and there is, therefore, a wonderful opportunity for the Minister. I say this from the Back Benches. There is much more discussion still to be had on this Bill. He would be very popular if he were now to say to the House, &#147;We just need time to reflect&#148;.

Surely that is a good thing. As the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said, a number of organisations should participate in the discussions as well as those on the Front Benches.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08071684000151"></a>What about consensus? We heard a great deal about consensus at the start of proceedings on the Bill. There are grounds to hope that this legislation will endure for generations to come; and that there will be a real, radical change in the amount of money being put aside for pensions and a substantial increase in the number of people who embark on proper levels of saving. We all hope that. I do not know about all these telephone conversations with somebody called Macho Mike. If it is Mr O'Brien, I have to say that I do not recognise the description. I have had many dealings with Mr O'Brien and that is not a phrase that comes readily to mind. If we are to develop a consensus and entrench a scheme that will last for generations to come, we have to get the detail right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08071684000152"></a>Without going down the road that my noble friend Lord Lucas and other speakers went down, my plea to the Minister is that there is now a great argument to pause and think, to sit down with key stakeholders in the industry and elsewhere to make sure that we are giving the right powers to the right bodies to meet the main objective of the Bill, which is substantially to increase pensions savings. Surely on that there is substantial consensus. I plead with the Minister: do not let us lose any consensus by moving too quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08071684000154"></a>That is how we wish to proceed, especially because we do not want the message to get out to those who, we know, do not want these changes to regulatory power that there is a process by which they can prevent them. I know that that is not the position of the overwhelming majority of stakeholders, but we know there are some out there, especially in the venture capital world, who do not want these powers. That is absolutely clear and we must be careful not to give any succour to them.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08071684000155"></a>Frankly, it would be nice if we could conclude the Committee stage this side of the Recess, just because it might make the summer holidays a little more bearable. The important thing is that we spend the time that we need to get this right. If we do spill over, I am sure that the Whips will be on to me, but we need to get this right. I still hope that, with the time that we have available, we can conclude, but it is not entirely within my hands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08071684000156"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, talked about super-creditors and whether we are changing the status of pension funds. I do not think that anything in the Government&#146;s proposals would suggest that that is the case. I accept entirely the need to build reassurance in respect of those issues. The noble Lord used the phrase, &#147;a great backwash retrospectively&#148;. I know that he is concerned about retrospection. We will come to an amendment on which I hope that I can give him further reassurance.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08071684000157"></a>My noble friend Lady Hollis is right. The current flexible clearance system has worked well. Before my time and before I was engaged in this legislation, there were fears about it. I am grateful for her support and for her input on the lessons of history. It comes back to innovation. There are new forms of pension activity out there, which are difficult prospectively to define in a way that means that we do not need to have some discretion in our powers.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08071684000158"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, berated my colleague the Minister for Pensions. In defence of my honourable friend, I should explain that he was concerned that we might lose the government amendment, not because there was no recognition that we needed and were keen to work together over the next few months to build on it, but because of the impression that it might create. We need to be firm about that. I believe that he tried to reach the noble Lord. Ultimately, we hope that we have been able to communicate in a satisfactory way.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08071684000159"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, is right. We are trying to get to the same place, although we might have a little bit of a spat about the journey and how we reach that place. However, this is important and comes back to consensus. At the end of the day, it will be quite difficult, with all the engagement that we will have, to write something as specific as some Members of the Committee want. If we have to have discretion in powers at the margins, it is important for people to understand why. They can gain that understanding from engagement with us as stakeholders or as legislators. There is a clear commitment to liaise with the Committee to make sure that noble Lords have a chance for input into the process before we return on Report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08071684000160"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said that no account had been taken of consultation. With respect, I do not believe that that is the situation. The legislative approach was to enable consultation responses to be considered in drafting regulations. As I have said previously, the consultation document indicated that we would bring forward a broad enabling power.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08071684000161"></a>The thrust of one point was whether companies are unsaleable if they have DB schemes. We do not believe that to be the case. Clearances are still available. Just this or last week a significant legal firm wrote in <I>Pensions Week</I> that it certainly is not advising against investing in firms with DB schemes.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08071684000162"></a>We need to ensure that, as part of the objectives of the Pensions Regulator, employers do not sidestep their pension obligations and that the regulator has a number of powers to enable it to deal with that. In considering whether, without regulations, there is a material risk to the security of members&#146; benefits or to the PPF, the Secretary of State will have to form a judgment after getting the views of the Pensions Regulator and other stakeholders. It clearly would not be appropriate to exercise the power if it did not reduce the existing material risks or, indeed, if it created serious new risks. I reassure noble Lords that it is not our intention, by introducing these provisions, to increase such risks.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08071684000163"></a>The Government&#146;s new clause includes safeguards covering the power to amend provisions, including the requirement to consult the regulator and other key stakeholders. We will be dealing with an amendment that specifically broadens the range of people whom we are required to consult. We have sympathy with that. It will ensure scrutiny by relevant parties, who will be alert to&#151;and will actively seek to prevent&#151;material increases in such risks. The consultation process should identify any unintended consequences that could increase these risks.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08071684000164"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment touches on the wider issue of ensuring an appropriate level of regulation. I agree that it is essential that we strive to achieve the difficult balance required, by enabling the regulator to meet statutory objectives while avoiding placing undue burdens on the sponsors of defined benefit schemes. It has been a fundamental principle that the regulator should act reasonably and take a risk-based approach. We now have a number of years&#146; operational experience, which serves to demonstrate the efficacy of that approach. I reassure the noble Baroness that it is not the Government&#146;s intention to use the new power to change this fundamental approach; we simply intend to ensure flexibility in the face of an increasingly sophisticated and fast-moving market.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08071684000165"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, talked about making pension schemes higher priority creditors. We do not believe that these proposals would increase the priority of pension schemes, which must be treated fairly alongside creditors of equal priority. I am sure that we agree on that. Ros Altmann has pointed out that some organisations are thought to make money out of the jettisoning of pension obligations. I am sure that noble Lords across the Committee consider that behaviour unacceptable.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08071684000166"></a>The noble Baroness touched on the burdens of clearance. This is voluntary. TPR has published detailed guidance on when and where it is appropriate. The  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1265"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1265</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulator has always, where reasonable, met the commercial needs of applicants within their deadlines. I suggest that clearance is generally a small additional cost in the global cost of a transaction and that it is part of standard due diligence.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08071684000167"></a>I hope to persuade the noble Baroness not to press her amendment. I think, from all the contributions and indeed from our discussions on Monday, that we are on the same page. We need to stay there and move ahead together to end up in a good place.</p>

Much of it has been more like a Second Reading debate than a Committee debate on the amendments before us. However, there is no harm in that, because the issues are important.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08071684000169"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, that this is not a party-political issue. I have heard that the Government have been trying to portray this as a party-political spat, so I place it on record that I never intended to raise these issues in a party-political manner. I hope that the Government will not continue to spread that claim.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80716-0005.htm"/>


<a name="80716-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08071684000170"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, that it would be helpful, after the Government have had further discussions with those affected, for us all to get together again in September. I also agree with the noble Lord that it is not enough just to talk to the CBI. The Government need to engage with all groups. I heard the code in what the Minister said about wanting this in the Bill so that those who did not want powers could be told that there would be powers. That unfairly characterises the position of some who are involved in turnaround and private equity. I am not in the camp that despises private equity. It has been a great force for good in our economy; it has achieved great efficiencies in many industries and has created employment. We should not regard anything that comes from the private equity industry as being necessarily bad. The industry does not seek simply to rape and plunder pension schemes; that is absolutely not what it is about. I hope that the Minister will go back to his department and tell it that it also needs to engage with bodies with which it may be less comfortable, because they have legitimate concerns that are important to the UK economy and that need to be taken into account.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08071684000171"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, talked about the parallel with the 2004 Act, in which I was not involved to the same degree of detail. She said that the things that were being discussed were in the Bill. The difference in this case is that the subject of Amendment No. 130EW was not in the Bill when it was considered in another place and is still not in the Bill. The Government are seeking to put something into the Bill without proper consultation. It is appropriate to pause at this point. It is not as though the Government have a permanent right to recreate the Bill that they would have introduced if they had thought of things further back. Otherwise, the parallels are good because, as I understand it, people discussed the issues seriously  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1266"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1266</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>during that summer and came back with workable amendments, to the satisfaction of everyone involved. I hope that we can get to that stage.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08071684000172"></a>The noble Baroness asserts that the regulator&#146;s powers are not adequate. There is some doubt about that, but those outside the Government who believe that some changes need to be made to the powers are also sure that those powers need to be more constrained. That is the likely difference. The question is not whether new powers are required but whether they need to be constrained in other ways.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08071684000173"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Hunt, I hope that the Government will always bear in mind the fact that stifling innovation is seriously harmful. If they try to take powers that would allow them to respond to any conceivable innovation that they deemed to be malign, they could end up circumscribing the way in which ordinary commercial transactions occur and harming the economy. That is clearly undesirable and something in which I am sure the Minister does not want to become involved.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08071684000174"></a>My noble friend Lord Lucas raised some important issues, but we will return to retrospection, fair value and the new super-creditor, which, in many respects and despite the Minister&#146;s assurances, it looks as though the Bill is on the road to creating. These are important matters, which we need to discuss for longer.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08071684000175"></a>My Amendment No. 130EY was discussed briefly in the context of the previous 45-minute debate, in which the Minister repeated that the Government do not intend to introduce regulations that do not deal with risks, particularly if the risks increase. My only point is that this is not reflected in the Bill. I hope that he will reflect further on whether the Bill properly reflects the balanced consideration that needs to be taken into account. This is not simply a question of whether the rights of members of a pension protection fund need to be protected. There should be a positive obligation on the Secretary of State to consider whether his actions will make matters worse in some respects. That is the point of the amendment. I will not press the amendment to a vote today, as the Minister asked, but I hope that this is one of the things that he will consider further during the summer. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08071684000179"></a>When the Pensions Act 2004 was passed, the Companies Act 2006 was still only a gleam in the eye of the then Department for Trade and Industry. At that time, directors&#146; duties were defined only by common law and could be summarised broadly as directors needing to act in the interests of the company. However,  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1267"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1267</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when the Government introduced what is now the Companies Act 2006, which I know the Minister remembers because we spent many happy weeks debating it in Committee and on Report, they deliberately chose to enact Section 172 of that Act, which restated the duties of directors of a company to line up with what the Government described as enlightened shareholder value. That section states that the duty of the directors is to act in the interests of,</p>
<ul><a name="08071684000257"></a>&#147;the success of the company for the benefit of the members as a whole&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071684000239"></a>It goes on to list matters to which the directors must have regard. That list is not exclusive, but it was intended at the time to reflect those major matters which the Government believed directors should have in mind when making decisions. That list refers to employees; that has been the law since 1987. It does not refer to former employees or to employees in their capacity as members of a pension scheme. Indeed, pension schemes are not mentioned at all in connection with the duties of directors.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08071684000180"></a>There is a concern that the proposed new powers of the regulator will skew what directors have to consider away from their core statutory duties, as set out in Section 172. Any changes to the current rules for the regulator&#146;s powers will&#151;as we have partly argued to date, and will argue during the rest of our consideration of the detailed amendments&#151;be likely to lead to an increase in clearances, to which a lot of attention is being paid. They raise a danger for directors. Changes in the rules for contribution notices are much more likely to leave directors in the firing line. We will debate later whether the contribution notice should attach to individuals.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08071684000181"></a>It is inevitable that, if directors are sitting in the boardroom, trying to make decisions, and know that they will be in the firing line for contribution notices, which is a very serious issue in relation to transactions&#151;which, under the proposed regulations, will be more broadly defined, and will shift from the current understanding&#151;their core duties will become difficult to reconcile with what they have to take into account to meet this new environment. The Government will try to create this new environment if they get new regulation powers and pass regulations as they have broadly described them in their consultation document. The conventional advice that lawyers give to directors is that if they act in good faith, using their skills diligently, and ensure that they pay regard to the matters in Section 172, they will satisfy company law. When we come to the new powers and the use of the new powers proposed by Amendment No. 130EW, the Government have said that they wish to whisk away the defence of good faith. We are starting to see a bifurcation between how directors are told they should behave in order to satisfy company law, as enshrined in the Companies Act 2006, and what the regulator may require of them.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08071684000182"></a>As my noble friend Lord Lucas said in the context of the previous amendment, the liability of employers to pension schemes is becoming ever more like a super-preferential creditor. This has not been done via the Companies Act or the Insolvency Acts. It is, in effect, being done by the back door of pensions legislation. Is it the Government&#146;s intention that the Pensions Act  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1268"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should override what is found in company legislation, especially company legislation that has been so recently enacted, without specific reference to pension schemes? Are they proposing giving pension schemes an order of protection that is different from that conferred generally by the rest of company law on the liabilities of creditors?</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08071684000183"></a>On this subject, there is a slightly worrying misunderstanding about the nature of companies and company law which is linked and why I should like to raise it today. In the Government&#146;s consultation document about the regulator&#146;s powers, it states at paragraph 1.6:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08071684000251"></a>&#147;The Government also seeks to ensure that there is fairness between members and shareholders and other investors: if shareholders and investors would benefit when investments perform well, it is right for them to stand behind members&#146; benefits when times are harder&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071684000240"></a>This shows an astonishing lack of understanding of the difference between investors in a company and the company itself. It is the company itself that is typically the employer and to which all the powers of the Pensions Act relate, not the investors or members of that company. In the world of publicly listed companies, those listed on stock exchanges, there is no way that, say, an investor in year one who makes a profit and moves on would transfer some notional obligation of standing behind to an investor several transactions later in year five. Perhaps the Minister will explain what kind of &#147;standing behind&#148; referred to in the Government consultation was trying to get at. It seems to me that the Government are coming close to trying to lift the corporate veil with no thought of what impact that would have on capital markets. This is one of the areas in which those coming to the consultation document become concerned about the Government&#146;s approach to corporate life in general.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08071684000184"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 134ZBC, which amends Section 100 of the Pensions Act 2004 to ensure that the regulator has regard to the interests of employers and associated parties when it exercises its regulatory powers. It seems that the Government intend to use the proposed new powers created by Amendment No. 130EW to enable the regulator to intervene in many more situations, either because a course of conduct is involved rather than individual acts or because a wider range of bodies can be considered for financial support, directions or contribution notices. It is therefore right that the regulator considers the widest possible effects of the exercise of its powers. If the regulator may be able to issue notices in a wider range of circumstances and to more people, there must be a quid pro quo that the regulator considers the effect of its actions on those affected. While these might appear to be covered by the statement in Section 100(2)(b) that,</p>
<ul><a name="08071684000258"></a>&#147;such persons as appear to the Regulator to be directly affected&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08071684000241"></a>it is not absolutely clear that the regulator must include within that employers and associated parties.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08071684000185"></a>To date, the regulator has issued few notices and directions, but concerns have been expressed about the direction of travel indicated by the regulator. For example, the regulator&#146;s consultation document on the clearance process issued last year took a number of positions which caused grave concern to employers. Having to have,</p>
<ul><a name="08071684000259"></a>&#147;regard to the effect on employers and others associated with the employer&#148;,</ul>

<p><a name="08071684000242"></a>would be a useful safeguard and an important signal from the Government that they believe that employers are important in their own right and are not simply a chequebook to support pension schemes.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08071684000186"></a>I have raised a number of concerns about the interaction between pensions legislation and company law which are crystallised, although not entirely created, by what the Government are trying to do in Amendment No. 130EW. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="08071684000187"></a><a name="80716-0005.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80716-0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08071684000362"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I appreciate the concerns of the noble Baroness about the interests of employers and directors&#146; duties under company law. The interaction between pensions and company law is an important consideration, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss it. The regulator already has a duty under existing legislation to consider the interests of directly affected parties, and when considering whether to issue a contribution notice or a financial support direction, the regulator is required to have regard to matters when deciding if it is reasonable for employers to make payments to the scheme or to put support in place. We recognise that it is important that legitimate business is not hampered by these changes and that employers have a degree of certainty that if they properly consider and address the issues of their pension scheme, they are unlikely to be subject to these new powers. It is equally important that the regulator&#146;s powers are sufficiently robust to respond to new risks in an evolving market.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08071684000188"></a>The interaction of pensions and company law is important. The Government&#146;s intention is that the duties in these two sets of legislation should rightly sit alongside each other. The noble Baroness may be concerned that directors who otherwise act in accordance with duties under the Companies Act should not be liable to regulatory action. Directors have certain duties to current employees but under pensions legislation they also have duties to scheme members&#146; interests. It is of course a matter for directors to balance these duties along with their other responsibilities. These situations are not unusual.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08071684000189"></a>I reassure the noble Baroness that it is not the Government&#146;s or the regulator&#146;s intention that in the normal course of their duties directors should be subject to regulatory action where their actions have no materially detrimental effect on scheme members&#146; benefits. The 2004 Act already places requirements on the regulator to consider whether it would be reasonable to use its anti-avoidance powers. It must have regard, where relevant, to all the facts of the case. For example, it must have regard to the degree of involvement in the Act and the involvement that the person has had with the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08071684000190"></a>To directly address these concerns, our intention is to strengthen these constraints to require that the regulator must have regard, where relevant, to the reasonableness of the person&#146;s actions&#151;for example, a director in light of his duties in that capacity&#151;and the value of benefits the person received from the company sponsor or the scheme. I highlight the regulator&#146;s existing duties. Under existing legislation, the regulator must consider the interests of members and those

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08071684000191"></a>The noble Baroness touched again on removing &#147;good faith&#148;. I know we are going to come on to this. It applies to only one of the tests: that of preventing debts becoming due. This means it is relevant for only certain other events directly related to the pension scheme&#151;for example, compromising debts due to schemes. This is not typical activity regulated under the Companies Act. The ordinary director functions such as paying dividends are considered under limb one of the tests in the Act: preventing recovery of a debt. This has never been prefaced by good faith. We are not aware of any problems that that has created.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08071684000192"></a>On standing-behind schemes, we believe it is right in this country that employers have flexibility in supporting pension schemes. Insurance levels of insolvency would be disproportionate but this means the employer must make contributions where appropriate, with a clear impact on likely returns to shareholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08071684000199"></a>I thank the Minister for his response; I shall consider carefully what he said. I am not 100 per cent convinced that he has addressed the issue. Here we have a newly minted version of the directors&#146; duties, which have only just come into force, but with no reference to pensions. Alongside that, some tough potential regulatory powers are coming in which will have an impact on the way directors behave. I presume that that impact is sufficiently aligned with what the Government intended. Many of us were less than convinced that restating the directors&#146; duties was the right thing to do but the Government were very clear in their own mind that it needed to be done. Weeks after those duties came into effect, however, the Government are effectively creating something which is potentially in conflict. Given the different standards, working out that conflict may be difficult for directors.</p>

<a name="80716-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08071684000200"></a>This applies to the issue of good faith, for example. If you asked any corporate lawyer what he would say to directors to make sure that they stayed within Section 172, good faith would be at the top of the list, as it always has been. Yet good faith will not be necessarily taken into account in future if the Government use the powers in Amendment No. 130EW as they claim they want to.</p>

My contention in this amendment is that under those circumstances it would be unfair to pursue individuals. If something goes wrong and the circumstances of a company change, it may well be necessary to revisit, say, the payment of a dividend or some other transaction which was made not with the intent of reducing the money available for a pension fund but certainly with that effect. For example, the dividends that house builders have paid over the past five years have certainly had that effect, because they now find themselves with very little market capitalisation and very large pension fund deficits. Why would it be right, under those circumstances, to pin that liability on relatively rich individuals who happen to be directors of those companies? Perhaps they are non-executive directors who have come to give their expertise to the

Why should that money then be available when it is not questioned that the decision to pay the dividend was taken with no intent to do down the pension fund&#151;indeed, when life seemed pretty good and the sailing was plain?</p>

<a name="80716-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08071684000205"></a>I understand the motivation behind the Government&#146;s wish to change, but to extend that effect to individuals, particularly directors, will over time destabilise companies with defined benefit funds. If an individual is pursued for something they did with good intent, the knock-on consequences could be extremely severe. I beg to move.</p>

Considerable concern has been expressed that the way in which the Government will use the powers could significantly increase the likelihood that individuals would come within the scope. That has not been the case to date because of the way the tests have been working. If that is the case in future, however, it could have significant implications for whether individuals want to be directors of companies with defined benefit schemes. It would be harmful to those schemes if good quality directors were not prepared to do that, so it is important to get a sense of the size of the potential risk.</p>

We need to seek to ensure that that is not the outcome. I agree that that is not where we want to be.</p>

<a name="80716-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08071684000208"></a>There are assurances in the existing legislation on the use of the powers, and I will take this opportunity to outline them. I would also like to clarify that current legislation allows for personal liability in respect of contribution notices and financial support directions. Under public law, the regulator must act proportionately and only where reasonable. That intrinsic requirement is augmented by the current legislation that provides for the safeguards.</p>

<a name="80716-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08071684000209"></a>It is already possible, under Sections 38 and 43 of the 2004 Act, for the regulator to issue a contribution notice and financial support direction to individuals, but those powers are subject to the checks and balances that I will try to outline. I particularly draw noble Lords&#146; attention to the reasonableness tests of Sections 38(7) and 43(7), which list the reasonableness factors.</p>

<a name="80716-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08071684000210"></a>The regulator is required to have regard to relevant factors to establish whether it is reasonable to act. That includes consideration of whether it is reasonable to impose liability on an individual. Among other factors, the regulator could consider the individual&#146;s conduct, their financial circumstances and, under Section 38(7)(e), the purpose of an act or a failure to act. Further protection is afforded through the determinations panel. If, following detailed consideration of the case and reasonableness factors, the regulator wishes to proceed, a case must be made to the panel, which will hear both sides of the case. It may proceed only if the panel determines it may do so.</p>

<a name="80716-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08071684000211"></a>In addition to the existing safeguards, as I mentioned earlier, the Government have consulted on additional reasonableness factors: the reasonableness of the person&#146;s actions in the circumstances and the value of any benefits that they had received directly or indirectly from the employer or scheme. That was specifically to address concerns such as those highlighted. Part and parcel of the new factors will be due consideration of the individual&#146;s legal duties, for example, as a director. In most, but not all, cases, it will not be reasonable for the regulator to pursue individuals, given their financial circumstances. In the majority of cases, the appropriate entity pursued will be corporate&#151;the company or corporate shareholders. There will be rare cases where the regulator may need individuals to be the target of a contribution notice, for example where the employer is an individual or a major and influential shareholder. This exposure to personal liability is not new in respect of the regulator&#146;s powers and is paralleled in company law. Trustees in their capacity as trustees should not be at risk from contribution notices if they perform their role properly.</p>

<a name="80716-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08071684000212"></a>There are further protections for individuals in relation to the exercise of the regulator&#146;s financial support direction power. This power only applies if the individual is the employer or is connected to that individual. The potential individual liability is important in ensuring that the powers are sufficiently flexible, while remaining subject to the reasonableness factor. The regulator has also stressed that, in accordance with its public law obligations, it will use its anti-avoidance powers only proportionately and only where reasonable.</p>

<a name="80716-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08071684000213"></a>Within that consideration, the concept raised, I think, by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, of a dividend being paid quite properly at the time through due process and consideration by the board, will be revisited several years down the track. It seems  that it could not flow from the legislation, looking  at the reasonableness powers and the issues of retrospection. However, again, during the course of the next couple of months, if those are real fears out there, we need to be clear and get the reassurance either specifically in the Bill, if possible, or, in regulation and guidance, so that directors can be comforted in going about their normal business, including the declaration of dividends, subject to the usual Companies Acts requirements. I hope that that has provided some reassurance, but, again, recognise that genuine concerns have been expressed and we need to be sure that we meet them fully.</p>

However, would the Minister explain what is meant by looking at the &#147;financial circumstances&#148; of an individual? That comes close, I think, to saying that the regulator would go after those with deep pockets and not on a matter of principle. The Minister also mentioned conduct but he separately mentioned financial circumstances, which seemed a little worrying. Would the Minister expand on that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08071684000223"></a>The Government agree that practitioners acting competently and clearly in line with their duties should not fear later sanctions. Although we recognise that in turnaround and insolvency situations there are hard choices to make, it would be wrong to enable parties to satisfy their other unsecured creditors by avoiding their obligations to pension schemes. However, it would also be wrong for regulations aimed at protecting pension schemes to stymie sensible transactions that treat all parties fairly and equitably. That is why the current legislation already provides a specific safeguard for insolvency practitioners. This protection was established in the 2004 Act as insolvency practitioners have a statutory duty to ensure that they treat all creditors fairly and equitably.</p>

<a name="80716-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08071684000224"></a>No such duty is placed on company doctors, who do not normally owe any duty to creditors. They are not defined in law and it is not clear who might claim protection under this provision. I must add that there is no evidence that the current regulatory regime inhibits turnaround specialists, and we do not intend that our proposals in Amendment No. 130EW would change that. We certainly do not intend to remove the current specific safeguard for insolvency practitioners.</p>

<a name="80716-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08071684000225"></a>Furthermore, there are already a number of important safeguards in existing legislation that apply to the regulator&#146;s use of its anti-avoidance powers. These work well and provide protection for those involved in turnaround situations. As a public body, the regulator is required to act reasonably. In addition, there are specific requirements in statute, to which we referred when discussing earlier amendments. Significantly, decisions to use the power to issue a contribution notice are made not by the regulator&#146;s investigating arm but by its determinations panel&#151;a body that is separate from the investigating team. The panel will review evidence and provide opportunity for representations from relevant parties.</p>

<a name="80716-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08071684000226"></a>I hope that those remarks will offer the noble Lord some reassurance. As I said, clearance procedures are available in turnaround situations as well. I recognise that there are speed issues in some of these situations, but I am not aware that that has been an issue in preventing people getting clearances where appropriate. I think that the issue is the lack of a definition of who would be included and differentiating those from insolvency practitioners, who have clear statutory duties in how they treat creditors. That is why there is protection for them and why we think it would be wrong to widen that in an undefined way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08071684000228"></a>The Minister mentioned clearance procedures, but I think that he answered the point himself, in that clearance procedures do not work when you are trying to deal with these fast-moving actions of turning businesses around.

For example, they may well say that the right thing to do is to get rid of failing business X in order to keep business Y within a group, or a company, going. In doing so, assets leave the group and, it could be construed with the benefit of hindsight&#151;we will come on to that later&#151;that that has had a detrimental effect on the interests of members.

I fully understand, and agree with, the need to provide protection to those who act competently and with good intentions to protect members&#146; benefits. However, I do not agree that a good faith test is necessarily the best way in which to provide this protection. It may be helpful if I begin by outlining why I hold that view.</p>

<a name="80716-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="080716100000006"></a>At first sight, a good faith test seems inherently reasonable and attractive. It appears perfectly fair that a contribution notice should not be issued against somebody who is seeking to do the right thing. However, the issues can be more complicated. The concern is that the legal application of good faith serves to set such a high evidential burden that it can be circumvented by those at whom regulation is targeted. It places the regulator in a position in which it would have to prove bad faith, which in law comes close to dishonesty. By its nature, such activity and intent is something that would be kept well disguised, with little evidential proof for the regulator to identify.</p>

<a name="80716-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="080716100000007"></a>In addition to constructing a high hurdle, good faith also provides for a very wide and general protection. The effect of this generality is to safeguard both those who should be protected and those whose activities are rightly the target of the regulator. Furthermore, there is a risk that applying a good faith test as set out in the amendment would exclude the possibility that the regulator could issue a contribution notice if there was detriment to a pension scheme as a result of incompetence and recklessness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="080716100000008"></a>The Government consulted on adding the effect of an act being materially detrimental to scheme benefits. The consultation document sets out a number of safeguards for using these grounds, such as listing the circumstances under which this alternative approach would be used and a test of material detriment. A good faith test would preclude any test based on material detriment. That said, the proposed removal of the good faith test in situations where a party&#146;s actions have prevented a debt from becoming due has generated considerable comment in the consultation exercise and a number of alternative approaches have been put forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="080716100000009"></a>I shall take away the points made by the noble Lord in our earlier debates and consider them alongside the consultation responses, to ensure that the approach that we put forward in draft regulations in due course is both effective and proportionate.

I take the already cited example of the payment of a dividend. Last year a company might have been healthy and profitable, paying dividends. It might have engaged in share buy-backs or paid special dividends if it had made a big profit. A year on, however, the credit crunch hits, the market falls away, losses ensue and the company cannot pay a dividend. In the mean time, the employer covenant is significantly weakened. If you look back, it is clear that it could reasonably have been foreseen that the dividend paid when times were good would have a detrimental effect, because resources left the group. When resources leave the group at any point, that has a potential detrimental effect on the pension scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="080716100000011"></a>One comes back to the question of what is reasonably foreseeable and to what extent hindsight will be used. If we go back a year, some companies&#151;for example, building companies&#151;predicted that the housing market would go under because it had been so frothy for such a long time. I do not think that many people would have predicted the precise set of circumstances involved in the credit crunch and its acceleration, but many people predicted that the good times for building companies and commercial property companies would come to an end. Therefore, on one reading it is entirely foreseeable, and reasonably so, that payments of special dividends or share buy-backs would have a detrimental effect given the ordinary course of a cycle. We should remember that we have not abolished cycles. Whatever the Chancellor used to try to pretend that he had done, he has not abolished cycles, and we are seeing the effect of it at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="080716100000012"></a>I am concerned that, when analysed with the benefit of hindsight&#151;and not very much hindsight, as it happens&#151;ordinary transactions could be seen to have had the reasonably foreseeable consequence of having a material detrimental impact on a pension scheme. Those issues are causing people a lot of concern. I do not think that the Minister has yet addressed that. There seems to be an assertion that dividends will not be a problem. However, dividends are the biggest

As I mentioned, special dividends might be paid and capital might be returned. There might be share buy-backs and the repayment of unsubordinated debt&#151;all things that appear to be normal in the circumstances of the time. However, you do not have to roll forward for long to see what the impact will be. The Minister has not explained what impact the Government think these new regulations will have on ordinary transactions. I should be grateful to hear his comments.</p>

The important thing to bear in mind is that it is not envisaged that any of the tests will be ones of hindsight. The tests will be applied in the circumstances of the scheme and the employer at the time of the act. Therefore, when the powers are considered, it will be crucial to understand what was known, or should have been known, at the time the act was undertaken and at the time the dividend was declared.</p>

<a name="80716-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="080716100000014"></a>I am always cautious about putting on the record off-the-cuff remarks that somebody might point to as establishing precedent. However, it would be difficult to blame people where the economic climate changed after the directors of a company had declared a dividend that was based on the current and projected financial situation of the company and which took account of the scheme covenant. As I say, it is not a hindsight test. That should cover these concerns.</p>

I think that hindsight will inevitably be used because it is difficult to escape from it and place yourself entirely in contemporaneous circumstances. When looking at what is reasonably foreseeable, people judge things by what has actually happened. I go back to the example that I gave where it could have been foreseen&#151;and many people would have foreseen&#151;that certain markets would deteriorate over a relatively short timescale. There is not necessarily agreement that the timescale will be the following 12 months or the following two years, but it is reasonably foreseeable that the cycle will result in some financial problems coming over the horizon. You do not need hindsight to get the test of what is reasonably foreseeable; all kinds of things are perfectly reasonably foreseeable and do not require huge feats of imagination. The question is how, as most things are reasonably foreseeable in business life, the Government will differentiate them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="080716100000019"></a>Let us take the example of retail. A year ago, retail businesses might have been having some difficulties, but none of them would have predicted the kind of retail environment in which they are now operating. Many household names are doing profit forecasts and are reporting losses, not just reduced profitability. In a relatively short period, financial circumstances can change. That change in financial circumstances could easily be construed as being something that was foreseeable. The concern is that, while the Minister says that ordinary transactions will not be judged with the benefit of hindsight, particular judgments of what is foreseeable will come to much the same thing. I am not sure that the Minister is really grasping the rapidity with which things move in the commercial world.</p>

<a name="80716-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="080716100000020"></a>Linked to that is the question of what directors are going to have to get clearance on. If there is any concern&#151;there is concern because of the way in which the test is shifting through detrimental effect and the way in which the Government want to include a course of actions, rather than single acts or omissions&#151;increasingly directors will be driven by their lawyers to queueing up for clearances all the time, or ordinary transactions will be inhibited. That is the nature of the concern, which I am not sure that the Minister has yet grasped.</p>

A number of the consultation responses suggested that the likelihood, as well as the possibility, of detriment might be considered, which may alleviate some of the concerns. We see some attraction in that, but we perhaps need to consider it further. We need to make sure that we do not inhibit the routine judgments that the boards must make about the general finances of their company and the ability to pay dividends. I really do not see why additional concerns should come from these proposals, but I acknowledge that we need to clarify these things as we proceed over the next couple of months, because we do not want to inhibit the routine, normal activity of directors. However, I hang on to the point that the sorts of judgments that have to be made in declaring the dividends of a company relate not only to the pension scheme but to a whole raft of issues concerning the finances and the future of an enterprise. Therefore, I say with respect that there is nothing particularly new about this issue.</p>

This is a serious point and I should like to share in more detail how we intend this power to operate.</p>

<a name="80716-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="080716100000030"></a>The power operates in accordance with the general law and, in particular, can be exercised only in a way that is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. This means that the Government, or future Governments, could make retrospective provision only if they had already announced their plans, in the way that we did in April this year. The power, therefore, is not as wide as it might first appear. It provides for retrospection, but only in relation to novel situations of material risk, and consultation would be required before the power could be used to introduce changes.</p>

<a name="80716-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="080716100000031"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would mean that, should it be necessary to amend or correct the original regulations for whatever reason, that could not be done from 14 April 2008, which would create the very risk that, in our view, should be mitigated. That would compromise our ability to ensure that we get the balance right between adequate protection and not hindering legitimate business activity. I hope that that clarifies matters for the noble Lord, because I acknowledge that he is concerned about the issue.</p>

<a name="080716100000038"></a><a name="80716-0007.htm_spnew28"></a><b><a name="80716-0007.htm_spnew29"></a><a name="080716100000173"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Clearance is the voluntary process for obtaining from the Pensions Regulator a clearance statement, which gives an assurance that the regulator will not use its anti-avoidance powers in relation to the event in the application. That assurance would remain in place but, quite properly, the regulator would not be bound by such a statement if the circumstances were materially different from the content of the application. There are already safeguards in Sections 42 and 46 of the Pensions Act 2004, and I can assure the noble Lord that we have no plans to change the clearance process.</p>

<a name="80716-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="080716100000039"></a>I agree with the implication by the noble Lord&#146;s amendment that clearance has been a successful process. It has been a key element in providing clarity and certainty for the industry. It has enabled the delivery of good regulation, with minimum intervention and use of powers, as well as the promotion of good behaviour and practice. The regulator has operated this system effectively since its inception, and has received positive feedback from its industry stakeholders. There is no intention to change that. I trust that the noble Lord takes reassurance from that expressed intent.</p>

<a name="80716-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="080716100000040"></a>The amendment may inadvertently endanger that element of legislation. It gives new conditions under which a clearance statement would fall away or not bind the regulator, different from those conditions already set out in the 2004 Act. Adding new conditions that would apply only to those provisions newly inserted by regulations made under the power could create confusion.</p>

<a name="80716-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="080716100000041"></a>In addition, given that under the amendment the protection of clearance will stand where there is material inaccuracy in the information submitted, and will fall away only when there is some form of intent behind the inaccuracy, the purpose of clearance is significantly undermined. In terms of behavioural impact, the amendment may discourage diligence by the applicant in providing information, leading to further time-consuming investigations by the regulator and costs to business.</p>

<a name="80716-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="080716100000042"></a>I reassure the noble Lord as strongly as I can that we need to make it as clear as possible that clearance given on the basis of full and proper facts cannot be reopened; that is sacrosanct.</p>

<a name="80716-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="080716100000046"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 130FE explores the sort of arrangement which seems to be possible under the proposals put forward by the Government. For example, a group with, in part of it, a defined benefit scheme, may sell an element of that group, perhaps a young, successful company, which it can no longer afford to finance. It wants, among other things, to provide resources for the pension fund. As it turns out, the remaining businesses in the group do not prosper and the company which was sold prospers exceedingly. Under the Government&#146;s proposal, it would be possible for the Pensions Regulator, several years later, to say to the new owners of the successful company, &#147;We wish to have from you additional money to fund the old defined benefit scheme in the group that this company used to belong to&#148;, and to overturn an open-market transaction for fair value. That is not the right way to go about things. Therefore, I have put down this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="080716100000047"></a><a name="80716-0007.htm_spnew34"></a><b><a name="80716-0007.htm_spnew35"></a><a name="080716100000176"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> The Minister already has referred to fair value in terms that I simply have not understood. All kinds of transactions are done for fair value and they should be judged at that time. But the Minister has suggested that they have to be judged by reference to some later events and circumstances. Lots of circumstances have been put to us. For example, a group of companies may buy a business and merge it with an existing company with a defined benefit scheme. The transaction is for fair value, but it does not work out. Somehow, with the benefit of hindsight, we come back to seeing that it has had a detrimental impact. If the new business had not been merged with the defined benefit scheme business, the covenant would not have been weakened. The Minister will know that lots of mergers fail for all kinds of reasons, so this is quite a significant business risk. But the original transaction of putting the businesses together is a fair value transaction; that is, buying the other business and putting them together.</p>

<a name="80716-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="080716100000048"></a>The concern is that these sorts of transactions will fall foul of the provision that is coming up. It is important for the Minister to be more explicit about the problems that the Government have with fair value transactions, because he has not been unequivocal about them to date.</p>

<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="080716100000049"></a><a name="80716-0007.htm_spnew36"></a><b><a name="80716-0007.htm_spnew37"></a><a name="080716100000177"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Again, I appreciate the concern of Members of the Committee that I should make clear our intentions under these proposals. It is not the Government&#146;s intention that a transaction whereby a person purchases assets or securities at fair value would normally trigger the regulator&#146;s use of its anti-avoidance powers, provided that as part of the transaction the pension scheme was properly considered and adequately addressed.</p>

<a name="80716-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="080716100000050"></a>The fact that a person had purchased assets or securities at fair value would not alone necessarily provide the assurances needed. That would be only the first step in ensuring capital was available to mitigate the risks to the scheme; it does not of itself get the capital to the scheme. Earlier, the noble Lord quoted my comments from Monday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="080716100000051"></a>Normal arm&#146;s-length, fair value transactions should swap an asset for cash or another asset and therefore have nil effect on scheme security; that is, there would

However, the noble Lord&#146;s amendment would turn this on its head and make it a defence. The regulator is not in the business of arguing about whether something is fair value; that is a different area of law. The regulator would look at the effect on the scheme. Current guidance from the regulator states that normal commercial transactions, at arm&#146;s length and fair value, would not be caught by the legislation, and corporates should be able to go about normal business.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80716-0008.htm"/>


<a name="80716-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="080716100000052"></a>I assure the noble Lord that normal, arm&#146;s-length, fair value transactions that swap an asset for cash or another asset and have, or are likely to have, no materially detrimental effect on scheme security, are not a target of the regulator&#146;s activity. However, I draw attention to the fundamental issue of the mitigation of material risks to the security of scheme members&#146; benefits, to the Pension Protection Fund and to those responsible employers who pay the Pension Protection Fund&#146;s levy.</p>

<a name="80716-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="080716100000053"></a>Current powers enable the regulator to take action where, for example, business and asset sales from the employer or the wider employer group are realised, particularly where the transaction is not at arm&#146;s length or fair value, or the sale proceeds are not retained; or where part of the operating business is sold at fair value for the assets, but all the pension scheme liabilities are transferred to a weaker covenant with the sold part of the company. Therefore, in a situation where companies from a group are sold, the regulator&#146;s powers currently are&#151;and need to remain&#151;such that they permit action if pensions liabilities were avoided through the sale. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would change this and make fair value a defence. I do not think that that was the intent. This would place the regulator in the inappropriate position of arguing about whether something was fair value or not. The regulator&#146;s proper focus should be on the effect on the scheme. I hope that I have clarified the issue.</p>

When these transactions take place, as long as the position of the scheme is considered and properly protected, the fact that the beneficial effect conceived for the merger does not result should not be the subject of action by the regulator. We have to look at what happens when the merger is put together. The fact that subsequently it may fail is a separate issue.</p>

It enables me to reiterate one or two arguments that we rehearsed at an earlier stage of the Bill. It also gives me the opportunity to thank him and his colleagues&#151;and colleagues on the Liberal Democrat Benches&#151;for the spirit of co-operation and support that the Government have enjoyed throughout the deliberations on the Bill in your Lordships&#146; House. It has been a model. Since the noble Viscount, Lord Colville of Culross, is here, I thank him for his very helpful engagement with the Bill during the special Select Committee procedure. I have no doubt that it resolved many problems and difficulties that people encountered with the Bill, and discussions were conducted in a spirit of constructive amity&#151;that is perhaps the nicest way to put it. My heartfelt thanks go to him and to all colleagues who have been involved in this. It has been a very useful process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="080716100000074"></a>Amendment No. 1 is moved with good spirit. Clause 23 would require the Office of Rail Regulation to produce a report on what it has done or proposes to do to meet its new Crossrail construction-related objective, as provided by new Clause 22, and on how it has exercised or proposes to exercise any of its functions in relation to the operation of Crossrail services. The ORR must do this from time to time, when it considers it to be appropriate. I assume that the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is intended to require the ORR to produce reports no less frequently than annually. However, the amendment as I read it would not achieve this. It says that it must,</p>
<ul><a name="080716100000148"></a>&#147;publish every 12 months or from time to time&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1288"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="080716100000135"></a>My guess is that the rail regulator could carry on producing reports from time to time. It would not have to do so within a 12-month period, so the amendment is defective in its intent. Whether that was deliberate on the noble Lord&#146;s part, I do not know, but I might give him the benefit of the doubt, particularly as I am in a generous mood.</p>

<a name="80716-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="080716100000075"></a>The purpose of the clause is to make transparent how the ORR exercises its functions in relation to Crossrail. Clearly, reports need to be sufficiently frequent to fulfil this purpose. The frequency may sensibly vary depending on the stage of the project to reflect the peaks and troughs in decisions that the ORR needs to take. As I said in Grand Committee, I doubt whether a report produced less frequently than annually would be satisfactory, at least until the Crossrail services are running at the required frequency and, importantly, punctuality.</p>

<a name="80716-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="080716100000076"></a>The clause already contains the safeguard that the Secretary of State can at any time require the ORR to produce a report. She might exercise this, for example, if there was a particular issue on which she wished to ensure that the ORR will publish a timely report. However, she could equally well use the power if she felt that the frequency chosen by the ORR was inadequate, and she could proactively ensure a particular frequency of reports. Therefore the clause provides the necessary flexibility to ensure that the timing of reports can be tailored to what is most useful for the particular stage of the project; yet it has the necessary safeguard against the frequency dropping too low.</p>

<a name="80716-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="080716100000077"></a>I share the wish of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, to see sufficiently timely reports from the ORR, but the clause will achieve this objective. We, like him, want to see timely information in the right place at the right time. It should be produced in a form that people can understand and to a specification that is transparent, so that people are well advised and understand the nature of the project and its progress, and the right elements of financial accounting and audit are properly in place. We think that we achieve that in the legislation. Although I think the noble Lord shares that aspiration, I rather suspect that his amendment does not achieve it.</p>

The phrase &#147;from time to time&#148; is very ambiguous. I am sorry if the wording of my amendment is not exactly right, but everyone knows that I want to make certain that we get at least an annual report. Could not the wording be slightly firmer? We all agree that we want the information. There is no disagreement about this or about the policy or philosophy behind it; there is simply a difference as to whether or not it will happen. Could not the Government make certain that that happened?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="080716100000083"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment would require the Secretary of State to ensure that Crossrail is subject to the disability equality duties in the Disability Discrimination Acts and associated regulations, in particular the duty to have a disability equality scheme in place that involves disabled people in its preparation. Proposed subsection (2) would in particular require Crossrail to consult DPTAC&#151;the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee&#151;and persons representing disabled people from the areas covered by the scheduled works.</p>

<a name="80716-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="080716100000084"></a>Crossrail is a splendid project. As a result of the building and rebuilding works it necessitated, many stations will become properly accessible to disabled people for the first time, and disabled people will benefit tremendously from the project overall. However, we need clear and committed leadership to ensure that things happen as they should and that, during the construction phase, people with mobility difficulties are not disadvantaged. That is what the amendment seeks.</p>

<a name="80716-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="080716100000085"></a>I know from my own experience that confidence is vital to the mobility of blind and partially sighted people, as it is to the mobility of disabled people generally if they are to go out and about in their area, let alone further afield. For some people, especially older people, blindness can amount to house imprisonment. The impact on confidence is real, as is the danger from constructions sites that suddenly appear or practised routes being cut off; blind people are even often injured by carelessly placed obstructions on the highway.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1290"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1290</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80716-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="080716100000086"></a>If Crossrail is not to bring years of such problems, a number of things must be in place. First, problems need to be thought through in advance. Secondly, adequate information needs to be available. Thirdly, alternative routes and mobility support need to be available where necessary. It is not always obvious in the Bill that they will be available. Schedule 3, for example, permits the closure of highways at very short notice. In a four-week consultation period, blind people will often not be able to get the information that they need about these works in advance and in an accessible form that they can read. Schedule 7 permits ancillary developments but has a high threshold for refusing permission and no provision for considering the impact on disabled people.</p>

<a name="80716-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="080716100000087"></a>I had a helpful meeting with Crossrail, which subsequently met the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association at my request. I am absolutely sure that Crossrail is sincere about trying to solve these problems, but it would be helpful to have in place a written plan, which is what a disability equality scheme amounts to, which is devised in conjunction with disabled people, particularly from the localities affected by Crossrail construction, so that the issues can be thought through before they arise.</p>

<a name="80716-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="080716100000088"></a>I note that the Department for Transport equality scheme deals with policy issues rather than the practical problems to which I have referred, so I am not sure that the scheme is really the answer to the issues that I am raising. Work already done on the construction code of practice and the planning memorandum will obviously be helpful, but the greatest benefits for disabled people would come from a disability equality scheme which has at its heart the involvement of local disabled people in its preparation. A recent survey of government departments was conducted to see what the impact of disability equality schemes introduced in December 2006 had been. These have now been in operation for about 18 months. Already, within the first year, government departments reported how helpful they had found disability equality schemes to be in focusing people&#146;s minds on the issues that needed to be addressed. The aspect of disability equality schemes that they found most valuable was the involvement of disabled people, those likely to be affected, in their preparation.</p>

<a name="80716-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="080716100000089"></a>I believe that there is a precedent for such a scheme in a similar case, that of the Olympic Delivery Authority. It has a disability equality scheme and a senior person working on these issues. If the Minister is not able to go all the way to accepting the amendment as drafted, it would be good to have an assurance that the Government will consult further with the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association and others in drafting the documents that I have referred to, namely the planning memorandum and the construction code of practice. If we could have an assurance that that would happen, it would go some way towards meeting the need that this amendment seeks to address. The greatest benefit would accrue if the need for a disability equality scheme could be written into the Bill.</p>

<a name="80716-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="080716100000090"></a>Generally, it is vital that a senior officer of Crossrail should be responsible for making sure that the necessary steps are taken as the project goes on, thinking through

Disabled people, too, have lives to lead, jobs to go to and friends to visit. The barrier created by closing a local station will be much greater for them than it would be for ordinary members of the public. We owe it to them to make sure that they do not suffer disproportionately from all the Crossrail works that will take place over the next&#151;I think&#151;nine years. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me that Crossrail will have strong leadership in place to deal with the questions that I raise.</p>

I have raised several times the amount of disruption that the years of construction will cause everyone, both on rail and road. Everyone needs to be given adequate notice. I moved an amendment along those lines in Committee. Obviously, disabled people will suffer far more. They need adequate notice and a lot of planning is needed for this enormous project, which will take some years, as the noble Lord said. I hope the Minister can give some assurances and help to everyone, particularly disabled people, on this subject. This is along the lines of the amendment that I moved in Committee.

We were convinced in many instances, almost against out better judgment, that we had to give way on a number of issues. In particular, we vigorously pressed the promoters to contemplate introducing lifts at Manor Park. We then discovered that that would require building virtually a whole new platform and that for many months trains would have to be redirected. The total cost of introducing such changes ran into millions of pounds. The likelihood was that, if this happened in one or two other places, overall there would be a substantial additional cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="080716100000094"></a>The other side of the coin is that Crossrail will deliver many benefits for people with disabilities. In many areas there will be brand new stations and brand new, easier access, with no problem of having to step up in order to board trains. I think we are all&#151;certainly in this House&#151;of the view that it is vital to move forward and try to get this legislation in place so that the real business can begin fairly soon after Royal Assent. I do not know the intricacies of this, or the consequences of this legislation for the Crossrail project. Is there any chance that it would mean further delays or further requirements for consultation, and possibly

Ultimately, I would hope that, one way or another, we could spend that money, but in the short term there is a finite amount of money available for the development of Crossrail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="080716100000095"></a>With all that has been happening lately, including the credit crunch and so on, many of us who are keen to see Crossrail go ahead must, increasingly, as each week goes by, worry a little more about whether the money will be there to see this project become reality. I would like to ascertain, before taking a decision on this, whether there is any possibility of delays in enacting the legislation and, in turn, delivering the benefits in many other areas for disabled people that Crossrail will produce. That apart, if a mechanism can be found to enhance and increase consultation between representatives of people with disabilities, the promoters and the department, I would be happy&#151;as I am sure would other members of the Select Committee&#151;to add all the weight I can in support of that.</p>

He and his colleagues sitting behind him, who were valuable members of the Select Committee, listened to a good deal of evidence about this. I do not know what the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, will say about formally including provisions of this sort in the Bill. In Select Committee we discussed the involvement of local groups, which would discuss all the time how people would be affected as these matters proceeded, particularly during construction, which is what my noble friend Lord Low was talking about. That will be one of the most critical issues. Some local groups will be there, and are there already. I only hope that the Government and the promoters of this legislation will encourage other areas to set up functioning local groups to do exactly the sort of thing that my noble friend has been talking about: give notice of what is going to happen, and advise on how to get around obstacles and all the other problems that might arise from a temporary construction that may not be all that temporary. If the Government give a little encouragement to the setting-up and maintenance of local groups that involve themselves in these issues, it might almost be a better answer for my noble friend than anything in his amendment.</p>

With that in mind, this is a timely issue to draw out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="080716100000099"></a>My response will take a little time, as it should, because I want to go through how disability issues will be resolved during the process of the Crossrail development and I want to provide the sort of reassurance that I know the noble Lord, Lord Low, seeks. As he says, things should happen in a way that helps those who are most vulnerable and disabled both in the construction of the project and in terms of the services that it will provide. Historically, people with physical disabilities have not necessarily been best served by sub-surface rail lines. I suppose that the Jubilee line extension, as the most recent addition to our Underground network, is probably better designed than most. Much has been learnt from that experience, which will count for a lot in the way in which Crossrail develops.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="080716100000100"></a>The noble Lord made several other points that bear careful thought: the importance of disability equality schemes; the continuing importance of consultation with organisations such as Guide Dogs; and the need to appoint project managers who have a direct role in dealing with disability issues as and when they arise during the project development. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, asked that all reasonable steps be taken, which is an important point. My noble friend Lord Brooke told us that, when the Select Committee looked at the detail of the project, it spent some considerable time rehearsing many of the disability issues, which has greatly aided us.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="080716100000101"></a>The amendment would ensure that the Crossrail nominated undertaker&#151;the body to be appointed under the Crossrail Act for the purpose of constructing and maintaining the Crossrail system&#151;is subject to the general duty imposed on public authorities that was inserted in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005. The purpose of Section 49A(1) is to ensure that bodies that exercise public functions promote disability rights issues when exercising those functions. The amendment would also ensure that the nominated undertaker produces a disability equality scheme under the Disability Discrimination (Public Authorities) (Statutory Duties) Regulations 2005, which is predominantly a statement of how the public authorities listed in the 2005 regulations are satisfying their Section 49A(1) duty. No one could disagree with the commendable purpose of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, but in fact it is unnecessary. I shall explain carefully why that is by addressing both elements in turn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="080716100000102"></a>It is currently envisaged that Cross London Rail Links will be appointed as the nominated undertaker for the majority of the works.

That is one of the purposes behind the amendment of the noble Lord. He has made an important point by stressing that that post must be used to ensure that there is effective connection and liaison with local groups; the point was also made by the noble Viscount, Lord Colville. I echo that wholeheartedly and agree that it is essential.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="080716100000103"></a>What has impressed me most about this project, certainly during the time that I have been involved with it, has been the enthusiasm and commitment demonstrated by the Crossrail project team to work at issues raised by local groups and organisations. Many came before the Select Committee to make their case. The Mayfair Residents&#146; Association is one that comes to mind, as does the residents&#146; organisation in Spitalfields. The project team should be congratulated on spending the time that it did on trying to resolve the issues that such groups brought before it. I have every confidence that that process will continue through the project development and on to construction. It is essential, and noble Lords have been wise to address the issue.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="080716100000104"></a>CLRL is not a listed public authority under the 2005 regulations. However, the Secretary of State for Transport and Transport for London are both listed in the regulations and both produce their own disability equality schemes, which have previously covered CLRL and the Crossrail project. Once CLRL becomes a fully owned subsidiary of TfL, it is expected that it will continue to be covered by TfL&#146;s disability equality scheme in the same manner as any other TfL Group company, such as London Underground. It is therefore unnecessary and potentially inappropriate for CLRL to be required to produce a separate disability equality scheme in the terms sought in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. Indeed, in December 2006, CLRL undertook a disability impact assessment of its policies and procedures, which formed part of the Department for Transport&#146;s disability equality scheme in January of last year.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="080716100000105"></a>The disability impact assessment was an assessment of CLRL&#146;s policies and procedures as a company. Impacts of the Crossrail project, including construction, were identified in the Crossrail equality impact assessment, which was published in January 2006. The EqIA considered seven priority groups, which included disabled people with mobility or sensory impairments, learning difficulties or mental health problems, and proposed mitigation to adverse impacts on these priority groups at policy level. As the project develops and progresses towards the design stage, it is anticipated that an update of the EqIA will take place. I can therefore assure the noble Lord that disability and equality assessment, monitoring and review will continue throughout the design, construction and early operational life of the project and that mitigation will continue to be developed. This will be done in consultation with relevant groups, including Guide Dogs and others as appropriate. Of course, some will be more appropriate at different stages, particularly once CLRL has a suitable level of design and detail to consult on. CLRL has also confirmed that it will indeed be working with the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, as the amendment anticipates.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1295"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1295</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="080716100000106"></a>I am aware that the noble Lord has particular concerns about the impacts of construction of the project on disabled people and I hope that I can offer some further reassurance on this issue. As set out in the Crossrail construction code, the nominated undertaker will, where reasonably practicable, ensure that people with reduced mobility and other forms of disability as specified in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 will continue to have access to services and buildings where such access and services are temporarily disrupted during the Crossrail construction works. Where the normal means of access has to be diverted or blocked off, alternative safe routes for people with reduced mobility will be identified, taking into account existing hazards and obstructions such as pavement kerbs and street lighting poles.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="080716100000107"></a>The first draft of the Crossrail construction code and the planning memorandum were published by CLRL in December 2005. A number of bodies, in particular local authorities that have a duty to ensure that the issues of disabled people are promoted, have raised matters that are addressed in these documents. The terms of these documents are now agreed with local authorities and have valuably been finalised.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="080716100000108"></a>Under Schedule 7 to the Bill, the nominated undertaker will have to obtain the approval of a local authority for specific construction arrangements. When considering such requests for the approval of construction arrangements, the authority will be able to take account of the effects that the proposals would have on people with reduced mobility. During construction, the nominated undertaker and contractors will be required to provide community relations personnel to communicate to all those who may potentially be affected. They will be focused on engaging with the wider community to provide appropriate information and will be the first line of response to resolve issues of continued concern. The nominated undertaker will seek to engage with residents of ethnic minority backgrounds, residents with disabilities or other priority groups that may be differentially affected at different times by construction.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="080716100000109"></a>In summary, the Department for Transport is committed to working closely with TfL and CLRL to ensure that Crossrail is in a stronger position to develop its design, construction and operational planning, both to meet statutory requirements and to deliver a railway fit for the purpose of serving the needs of the whole community. I hope that that answers the main points offered.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="080716100000110"></a>CLRL met Guide Dogs in January of this year. Guide Dogs raised many of the issues that have been raised in your Lordships&#146; House this evening. It did not express at that stage any dissatisfaction with the answers that it received, particularly as there was a commitment to continued dialogue. It will of course have the opportunity to comment on the Crossrail construction code, the planning memorandum and documents such as the equality impact assessment.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="080716100000111"></a>Finally, there will be a local group for every area. I understand that the Paddington group and the Tottenham Court Road group are already up and running. The Bond Street and Whitechapel groups are to be set up and run from next month. The anticipation is that all areas will be covered by the end of the year. The focus

I am grateful to all those who are party to that.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="080716100000112"></a>I hope that I have answered and given reassurance on the main points. I certainly understand the spirit in which the amendment was moved. Crossrail stands ready to receive other approaches as are necessary to ensure that this project, which is important for the mobility of everyone in the capital but particularly those who suffer a disability, is greatly enhanced in the future and that we have an addition to our railway network that provides better access than any other part of the network has done hitherto. I am sure that your Lordships&#146; House will want to hear more on this in due course. I undertake to do all that I can to ensure that people are kept informed and up to date as is necessary on the way in which this project develops. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Low, for this opportunity to offer the reassurances that I have been able to give this evening.</p>

I am most grateful to all other noble Lords who have spoken, who all made relevant points.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="080716100000114"></a>I should say unambiguously, as I hope I did in my earlier remarks, that I am in absolutely no doubt about the great benefits that will accrue to disabled people as a result of the construction of Crossrail. As I hope will have been clear, my amendment was in no sense moved in a spirit that this is a bad-news development. Overall is it good news for disabled people if we can just handle it in the right way. The Minister has gone out of his way to reassure me that that will be the case. I certainly hope that making appropriate provision for disabled people will not cause any undue delay to the project; indeed, I hope that it will not cause any delay at all. It is obviously to the public good that the project should go ahead with all due dispatch.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="080716100000115"></a>On works undertaken to meet the needs of disabled people, any legal requirement would require only that reasonable adjustments be made. No undertaking would be expected to go to unreasonable expense. I hope that there are no continuing worries on that score. I express my gratitude to the Select Committee for the depth with which it probed these issues and the concern that it showed for them.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="080716100000116"></a>As I said, the Minister responded extremely fully. I am most grateful to him for that. He covered all the bases and went out of his way to explain how the needs of disabled people would be covered without a disability equality scheme. CLRL has a disability equality duty, as its activities are covered under parent schemes. That point is covered. I was grateful to hear the Minister say that there is an expectation that the arrangements will need to be reviewed and updated. We can all take comfort from the Minister&#146;s reassurance that that review and updating, and indeed the examination of everything as the project goes along, will be done in full consultation with relevant groups&#151;not just Guide Dogs, which the Minister kindly mentioned, but other

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="080716100000120"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, criminal injuries compensation is part of the Government&#146;s wider commitment to put victims at the heart of the criminal justice system. We have transformed the way that victims of crime are supported. Victims now have a legal right, for the first time ever, to a high quality of service from the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts. We have introduced 165 witness care units across England and Wales to support victims and witnesses to attend court. At court itself we have introduced special measures such as giving evidence by videolink or with the support of an intermediary to ensure that victims who are vulnerable or intimidated can give their best evidence.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="080716100000121"></a>The criminal injuries compensation scheme is another part of our strategy to support and protect victims of crime. It provides payment at public expense to innocent victims of violent crime in Great Britain. Compensation is based on a tariff, or scale, of awards for injuries of comparable severity. There are 25 tariff bands ranging from &#163;1,000 to &#163;250,000. More seriously injured victims can get additional compensation for loss of earnings and special expenses, subject to an overall ceiling of &#163;500,000 in respect of any one claim or any one death.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="080716100000122"></a>Last year the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority paid out &#163;235 million in compensation, and since the scheme&#146;s inception in 1964 it has paid out more than &#163;4 billion to more than 1 million victims of violent crime. Ours is the most generous scheme within the European Union and one of the most generous in the world. For example, in 2007, the United States of America paid out &#163;221,783,000; in the same year, the Great Britain scheme paid out &#163;183,900,000. Considering that the population of the United States is five times greater than ours, the House will acknowledge how generous our scheme is.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="080716100000123"></a>In September 2005 we consulted on whether to refocus the scheme on victims of the most serious crime while also improving the practical and emotional support available to victims. Many respondents to the consultation wanted the practical and emotional support it proposed. We have taken this forward through the victim support plus model, where Victim Support contacts the victim within 48 hours of referral from the police and a thorough needs assessment is carried  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1298"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out identifying the individual support needed. But respondents also commented that these direct services should not be at the expense of awards for less serious injuries. We agree. We will not, therefore, be refocusing the scheme and have funded Victim Support to roll out its model of practical and emotional help across the country.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="080716100000124"></a>Criminal injuries compensation does not exist in a vacuum. It is intimately linked to the other support, protection and information that victims of crime receive from the criminal justice system. When we started the <I>Rebuilding Lives</I> consultation we were at the start of a major period of reform&#151;for example, the introduction of witness care units and the victims&#146; code of practice. We wanted to be clear on the results of these reforms before making any changes to the scheme; in particular, we were keen to see the results of Victim Support&#146;s new victim support plus scheme. In these pilots, 88 per cent of victims said that they felt their needs were completely met, and 92 per cent of victims judged the quality of service to be excellent or good. So the success of its pilots influenced our decision to roll out that initiative across the country, just as it influenced our decision not to refocus the scheme but to instead look at making its administration more efficient and more victim-focused.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="080716100000125"></a>As a result, the main changes we are bringing before the House relate to the appeals provisions of the scheme. These have become necessary as a consequence of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. The provisions that we are inviting noble Lords to approve today are therefore mainly focused on these changes, and the basic structure and rules of the existing scheme will remain much as before.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="080716100000126"></a>The criminal injuries compensation scheme currently in operation incorporates the functions of both the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel. The main reason for bringing these changes before the House is the 2007 Act, which creates a two-tier tribunal structure, the first-tier tribunal and the upper tribunal, and requires that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel, along with a number of other government tribunals, will be absorbed in the first-tier tribunal on 3 November this year. From that date, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel will cease to exist as a separate body and therefore cannot remain part of the criminal injuries compensation scheme. From the same date, the appeals rules and procedures of the first-tier tribunal will be set out within the relevant tribunal procedure rules, which have yet to be laid before the House. That is why the coming into force date of this draft scheme is 3 November.</p>

<a name="80716-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="080716100000127"></a>As opportunities to amend the scheme arise so rarely, we also want to make a number of other changes. These have become necessary with the passage of time since the scheme was last changed in 2001 and in the light of operational experience. In the main, they are needed to clarify meaning or intent where there is doubt or ambiguity, to provide greater clarity, to restore the original intention of the scheme where court judgments or operational experience suggest that the previous wording was not doing the job, and to help streamline some scheme processes. All the

The changes are all clearly shown as &#147;tracked&#148; changes, and I shall briefly mention some of the more significant ones.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80716-0010.htm"/>


<a name="80716-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="080716100000128"></a>Perhaps most importantly, we have substantially recast the paragraphs dealing with additional compensation for loss of earnings and future earning capacity; the payment of awards in fatal cases; and the reduction of compensation on the grounds of benefits received from other sources. Our aim was to modernise the rules to make them simpler and more logical, and to avoid cases of claimants getting double payment from the state in some circumstances.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="080716100000129"></a>As to other changes, we have made it clear in paragraph 8 that not only must the injury have been sustained in Great Britain but it must have been directly attributable to an act occurring in Great Britain. This is specifically to clarify the original intention of the scheme that both the incident and the injury must have taken place in Great Britain. For example, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the USA in 2001, the authorities there determined that qualifying relatives of those killed and who had witnessed the events on live television in Great Britain were eligible for compensation for the mental injuries suffered. Thirty-seven applications were made, of which 26 received awards, totalling &#163;68,000. Our scheme was never intended to cover such cases and this alteration puts the meaning beyond doubt.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="080716100000130"></a>We are strengthening the criteria for withholding or reducing awards on account of the claimant&#146;s previous unspent criminal convictions and the criteria dealing with time limits for applying for compensation and accepting offers of award. The reason for clarifying how long an applicant has to apply is that the time limit for making applications has been set at two years since the introduction of the statutory tariff-based scheme in 1996. The power to waive that time limit has been used frequently, but inconsistently, within the authority and this clarification is to insure against anomalies or unfairness.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="080716100000131"></a>We have not altered the number and value of the 25 tariff bands but we have made a number of changes to the tariff of injuries. We have made changes to some of the descriptions of awards for sexual offences using terminology from the Sexual Offences Act 2003 to ensure consistency, and we have inserted some new categories and made some other changes to rectify inconsistencies. We have substantially recast the section dealing with compensation for brain damage to recognise the wide range of brain injuries and to enable the award to be more closely aligned to the injury suffered. We have increased the awards made payable for injuries to teeth in recognition of the reality that victims will often have to use some of the award to pay for corrective dental treatment.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="080716100000132"></a>We have also inserted a number of new injury descriptions, changed the descriptions of others and moved one or two injuries into higher or lower tariffs where operational experience and medical and legal advice have suggested this would now be appropriate. The tariff now lists some 450 injuries. If parliamentary

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="080716100000133"></a>We believe that the changes we are proposing will complement the radical changes that the authority has been making to its end-to-end case working and business processes over the past two years or so. I am happy to say that these changes have already led to improvements in how the authority operates. This will all help to result in a more efficient operation, providing a better, faster and more transparent service to victims of violent crime and making the best use of the available resources. I commend the draft new scheme and invite the House to accept it. I beg to move.</p>

On Monday, my honourable friend David Burrowes debated this at some length with the Minister&#146;s colleagues in another place. Most of his questions about consultation were dealt with on that occasion, so I want to add only a couple of points.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="080716108000004"></a>First, to pick up one of the Minister&#146;s last remarks, he talked about the increase in awards for dental treatment for damaged teeth. If people have to pay a lot more for restorative work for teeth, that seems to suggest that there are considerable failings in NHS dental services on that front. I would be interested in his comments on that.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="080716108000005"></a>My second point, which is more substantive, is about the various orders relating to the transfer of tribunal functions, which I understand we will be dealing with on our first day back, 6 October. The Minister will be aware that I recently saw his colleague, Mrs Bridget Prentice, about those orders because of some concerns that we have had about them. Mrs Prentice promised that there would be further consultation on those orders and said that they might have to be relaid&#151;nothing to do with the criminal injuries compensation scheme, but purely in relation to Pensions Appeal Tribunals and matters relating to war pensioners. If they are not amended and there are disruptions, as it were, in this House and the orders do not go through, what will happen to the scheme that we are going to agree to on this occasion, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2008? It is important that the Minister addresses this question. The two have to go together. It is important that we have the new tribunals in place, but, as the Minister is well aware, we cannot amend those orders if there are problems with the Pensions Appeal Tribunals when we come to discuss this on our first day back.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="080716108000006"></a>My next question for the Minister is, I appreciate,  a difficult one. His department, in its Explanatory Memorandum, which is good and very clear, reckons that compensation claims amount to something in the order of &#163;200 million a year. He was quite right to emphasise the generosity of the scheme that is in place now and how it compares with similar schemes in the United States. I appreciate that he cannot say whether the Government estimate that the scheme will increase in future, but it would be helpful if he could tell us

That is, what is inflation and what is an increase in crime or perhaps an increase in awareness of the scheme and the fact that people feel that they have an entitlement to claim on that front? I leave the Minister with those questions and I would be grateful if he would assist me when he comes to reply.</p>

I particularly welcome the fact that the Government have not proceeded with a proposal to exclude victims who suffered the crime at work, as that would have been quite unjust. A suggestion was made in the consultation paper that the employer should take on that burden and pay compensation through insurance. That would have undermined the entire scheme, so I am glad that it is not being proceeded with. I hope that the Minister can assure us that there is no intention at any point to bring that idea back.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="080716108000009"></a>I have two specific points about the detail of the scheme. Paragraph 35(1)(d)(iii) deals with care costs, but there seems to be a change from the 2001 scheme in that regard. The new scheme restricts care costs to applicants&#146; core costs, such as the cost of helping them with bodily functions and meal preparations, whereas the previous scheme seemed to deal with all one&#146;s care costs. Why has that change been made? Is it justifiable to place the extra cost on the individual victim?</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="080716108000010"></a>In a similar vein, I have a question about the earnings limit. Financial loss under the criminal injuries compensation scheme is restricted, unlike civil liability damages, to one and a half times average earnings, so someone cannot get whatever earnings they have lost; they are limited to one and a half times the average. However, the definition of &#147;average earnings&#148; appears to have changed from the one used in the 2001 scheme. In 2001, &#147;average earnings&#148; were defined as &#147;gross average industrial earnings&#148;, whereas in the new scheme they are defined as &#147;median gross weekly earnings&#148;. Why has that change been made? What difference is it expected to make? On the face of it, given that earnings are skewed with a very long tail at the high end, changing that average, which meant &#147;mean&#148;, to this average, which means &#147;median&#148;, represents a reduction in the amount of money available. On the other hand, changing from industrial earnings to earnings in general might have the opposite effect. What is the change expected to do?</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="080716108000011"></a>Besides that, we have covered the ground fairly comprehensively between the two Houses, and we on these Benches are broadly content with the scheme.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="080716108000013"></a>The noble Lord asked a number of questions. The first one was about teeth. I reject utterly his suggestion that somehow this has had something to do with a decline in the way in which dental practice occurs in this country. In our view there has been a considerable improvement, and I do not say that just because sitting beside me is the former Minister in charge of dentistry throughout the country. The fact is that awards for injuries to teeth are being increased to reflect the fact that the necessary corrective dental treatment is sometimes not available&#151;that is the reality of the situation in the NHS&#151;and the victim has to use the compensation award to meet the costs of treatment. We would have been criticised if we had not agreed to that. Although paragraph 35 of the scheme allows for the cost of private health treatment, including dental work, that provision does not take effect until the first 28 weeks of loss. The amendment helps victims who are not incapacitated for 28 weeks but still need to meet some of their dental costs.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="080716108000014"></a>As for the noble Lord&#146;s remarks and his question about orders, the issue is extraordinarily hypothetical. I can tell him that my honourable friend Bridget Prentice, whom he referred to, has had some helpful discussions with veterans&#146; associations. No doubt we can look forward with delight to a good debate on our return after Recess; in fact, it may be what keeps us going during those long weeks away. With regard to the impact of the situation on this statutory instrument, it does not affect the scheme changes. If the date of the coming into force of the tribunal SI is delayed, we will amend the coming into force of the scheme by negative resolution.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="080716108000015"></a>The noble Lord also asked about the scheme&#146;s growth over a number of years. It will be best if I write to him with a table of the increases paid each year. I opened this short debate by saying that &#163;235 million had been paid out in the last year, which was a considerable increase on the previous year. What matters to innocent victims of crime is that their applications, if they come within the scheme&#146;s ambit, should be paid as quickly as possible. I am happy to say that our record on that has improved markedly since 2006.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="080716108000016"></a>I am also grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, for her comments, although I am not sure that I am so grateful for her extremely detailed questions. However, as she knows, I did have some notice of her questions. Let me deal first with care costs. These provisions often have something in common with previous benefits legislation. The amendment on care costs, which the noble Baroness picked up, follows the wording of Section 72 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992&#151;it has taken us a bit of time to catch up with that wording. The intention is to make existing practice clear. Only core personal care costs are covered; these include dignity-based help that people need if they have been incapacitated, but not social care costs or peripheral costs such as arrangements for having housework or gardening done. We tend to see this amendment as a clarification rather than a change in emphasis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="080716108000017"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about earnings. The change of the loss of earnings calculation from one type of Office for National Statistics figure, which is no longer to be produced, to another has the effect of changing the arrangements from mean to median. We think that the practical effects&#151;I hope that the noble Baroness will be content with this&#151;are negligible, as most victims do not earn one and a half times the median gross weekly earnings. Individuals may be affected, but we are faced with the practical problem of not having the figures that the ONS used to produce to keep things in line with how they previously were.</p>

The figures have gone up from &#163;20 million in 1996-97 to &#163;207 million in 2007-08. The difference between that and the &#163;235 million is due to the fact that some are still being paid under the old tariff system. I have done my best to answer the questions.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="080716108000118"></a>&#147;Business managers are always anxious to see bills go into pre-legislative scrutiny because it makes them on the whole better bills and it improves their chances of going through&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080716108000107"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, recently introduced the Climate Change Bill by saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="080716108000119"></a>&#147;I must take this opportunity to say how helpful the pre-legislative scrutiny has been in developing the Bill. It was incredibly helpful to civil servants and parliamentary draftsmen in Whitehall&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 27/11/08; col. 1124.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080716108000108"></a>The noble Lord also said that the Bill had benefited greatly from the Joint Committee&#146;s careful examination.</p>

<p><a name="080716108000109"></a>During the Second Reading of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, the noble Baroness, Lady Crosby, noted that the Bill, as introduced, was a,</p>
<ul><a name="080716108000127"></a>&#147;remarkable example of how the legislature should be brought into the drafting and scrutiny of Bills to a much greater extent than is generally true&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/11/07; col. 685.]</ul>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="080716108000027"></a>In the years since the publication of the committee&#146;s 2004 report, the amount of pre-legislative scrutiny markedly declined. In response to that decline, my predecessor, the late Lord Holme of Cheltenham, wrote to the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, then Leader of the House, in January 2007, to ask whether she would agree to write a letter at the end of each Session enumerating the Bills published, wholly or partially in draft, and giving an explanation of the figures and any relevant trends. The noble Baroness rejected that request on the grounds that she was not convinced that it would add any real benefit. The committee, accordingly, announced that it would produce and publish statistics on the volume of draft Bills at the end of each Session, together with comment.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="080716108000028"></a>This is the first such report, and sorry reading it makes. The figures showing the decline are in the report before the House. They show that the ratio of draft Bills to government Bills fell from one in three in 2003-04 to one in nine in 2006-07. In the long 2005-06 Session, it was one in 15. The number of draft Bills dropped by two-thirds during that period, contrary to the Government&#146;s 2005 commitment at least to maintain the proportion of Bills published in draft.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="080716108000029"></a>In response to the strictures of the House of Commons Liaison Committee in its 2005-06 annual report, the Government stated that they were aware that the number of draft Bills published in recent years had not reached the same total as those published in one or two earlier years, but that they hoped that the number of draft Bills published each year would be above the number achieved in the 2005-06 Session. Yet, they introduced just four draft Bills in the 2006-07 Session, the same number as in 2005-06.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="080716108000030"></a>Your Lordships&#146; committee, therefore, resolved to call on the Government to increase the number of draft Bills published per Session to at least the 2003-04 level, to ensure that all draft Bills were published in good time, allowing 12 weeks for scrutiny at the very minimum and, if possible, considerably more, and,

We also resolved to urge the Government not to undermine the parliamentary scrutiny process by launching additional consultations once pre-legislative scrutiny is in process or, indeed, after it has been completed. No one appreciates the exigencies of parliamentary business management more than I do; I appreciate that we occasionally have emergency Bills&#151;three, recently&#151;but most are not emergency Bills. It would be comforting to know who in the Government is in charge of the pre-legislative scrutiny procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="080716108000031"></a>The Minister may also wish to revisit the decision of the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, not to write to the committee on this matter at the end of every Session. I know that noble Lords look forward to the Minister&#146;s response to the report, as to all his contributions, with eager anticipation.</p>

It has to be said that that rather restrictive attitude is somewhat surprising in view of the support that Ministers have generally given on a number of occasions&#151;most notably that of the Lord Chancellor, Jack Straw, to which the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, referred.</p>

<a name="80716-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="080716108000033"></a>The importance of pre-legislative scrutiny scarcely needs to be emphasised. However, I think it is beginning to become a significant question whether our procedures are adequate to draw forth an in-depth examination of legislation that is not emergency. This House would do well to consider whether a system of pre-legislative scrutiny should be the norm not the exception. In a number of other developed democracies, committees exist purely for that purpose; they are not necessarily a chamber of parliament. In New Zealand there is a pre-legislative committee chaired by a former Prime Minister. In that case there is a predominance of lawyers examining the legislation, and I am quite sure that that would not necessarily commend itself to this Parliament. None the less, that committee&#146;s work is valued by the New Zealand legislature. There are in other democracies other examples of deliberate examination of legislative proposals, not necessarily as part of the amending process but as an attempt to view the fitness for purpose&#151;to use that rather unattractive contemporary expression&#151;of what is being proposed and to allow, before positions become entrenched, the opportunity for those interested in the subject matter to ventilate their views and to give the benefit of their advice.</p>

<p><a name="080716108000110"></a>We all recognise that circumstances arise when it is necessary to enact legislation quickly, in an accelerated programme, where public necessity dictates, but, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, said, that is certainly the exception. Most legislation is considered quite a long time in advance within government. It is not satisfactory to accept that there are administrative requirements that make it impossible to make pre-legislative scrutiny the norm. The flexibility of the ordering of Bills is entirely a matter for government. It is not beyond the bounds of Ministers to take a more ordered view of how they will proceed overall.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="080716108000035"></a>I would not wish to give the impression that the Government are not aware of these matters. It is highly desirable and commendable that they have published their legislative programmes in advance, as it gives at least some scope for public discussion before matters are set in concrete. There is growing awareness of the need to improve legislation, but, as the committee has drawn to the House's attention, these aspirational commitments have not been fully met by a follow-up, which would certainly be desirable.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="080716108000036"></a>It is a matter for consideration&#151;perhaps particularly so at a time when the Government have published proposals for the reform of this House&#151;whether pre-legislative deliberation and scrutiny should be thought of in that context. One of the notable functions of this House is that it is able, when it is given the opportunity, to do a very good job of such scrutiny. I think that that is widely recognised from a number of examples that I have personally witnessed, and am witnessing, of pre-legislative scrutiny. It is clear that this House is particularly well suited to this deliberative process.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="080716108000037"></a>It is not necessarily an adversarial process, but is about seeking to elicit information, test ideas and judge whether the draftsmanship is adequate to reflect the intentions behind the Bill. My judgment is that that is not necessarily a function that has to be carried out by an adversarial, elected House of Parliament. It could be conducted by an appointed council of state, and that could be ancillary to the role of an elected upper House. I throw that idea in the Minister&#146;s direction without expecting him to respond in any kind of detail at all. None the less, I consider that some response is required from the Government which goes some way to indicating how they would propose to extend, and extend the effectiveness of, pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="080716108000038"></a>There is some public concern about the quality of our legislation that is not connected with hostile partisan political attitudes but with the practitioners who have to interpret it, the professionals who have to rely on it and the general consumer of legislation. Those are the concerns and interests that can be best dealt with before the matter becomes part of the cut and thrust of debate in the Committee and Report stages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="080716108000040"></a>The 2004 report looked at the legislative process holistically, addressing pre-legislative, legislative and post-legislative scrutiny. At that time, the most significant developments had occurred in respect of pre-legislative scrutiny, and it looked as if that would continue to be the case. The value of pre-legislative scrutiny was widely recognised. The experience of Bills committed for pre-legislative scrutiny demonstrated its utility for improving the quality of legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="080716108000041"></a>The case for extending scrutiny was recognised not only by the committee but also by the Government. Paragraph 28 of the 2004 report states:</p>

The Modernisation Committee in 2002 stressed that it wished to see publication in draft become the norm. The Deputy Leader of the House, Phil Woolas, has stated that &#145;a bill should be published in draft form unless there are good reasons for not doing so&#146; and has made clear that &#145;it is the Government&#146;s intention and policy to increase the amount of legislation that is subject to pre-legislative scrutiny&#146;&#148;.</p>

<ul><a name="080716108000121"></a>&#147;it is the Government&#146;s intention and policy to increase the amount of legislation that is subject to pre-legislative scrutiny&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080716108000111"></a>What has happened since? There has been a major improvement in the legislative process and there has been a significant development in respect of post-legislative scrutiny. The Constitution Committee, in its 2004 report, recommended that a Bill should, at some point during its passage, be subject to scrutiny by an evidence-taking committee. The other place has introduced Public Bill committees. This is a very welcome development, albeit one that has been little noticed outside the Palace of Westminster, and indeed has perhaps not been fully appreciated by this House. It is something that we should be examining.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="080716108000043"></a>In its 2004 report, the committee also recommended that Acts should normally be subject to post-legislative review by departments, with those reviews then submitted to departmental Select Committees in the other place. The Government referred the proposal to the Law Commission, which reported in October 2006; its report largely followed that of the committee, but also recommended the creation of a Joint Committee to consider post-legislative reviews not taken up by departmental Select Committees. The Government took their time in responding but in the event produced a very welcome report in March this year. Though not endorsing the proposal for a Joint Committee, it did accept that departments should review Acts normally within three to five years of enactment and send the reviews to Select Committees. I trust that we shall, in due course, be debating the Government&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="080716108000044"></a>My point for the moment is that there has been very welcome progress with both the legislative process and post-legislative scrutiny. What has happened with pre-legislative scrutiny? There has been, in effect, as my noble friend indicated, a regression. The Government have clearly abandoned the policy announced by Phil Woolas. As the data in the report that is the subject of this debate makes clear, the highpoint for the number of Bills subject to pre-legislative scrutiny was 2003-04.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="080716108000045"></a>What justification do the Government offer for this post-2004 regression? In their response to the latest report, they state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="080716108000122"></a>&#147;The Government also has been disappointed at the lower numbers of draft bills published in recent sessions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080716108000112"></a>It is written as though this is something external that is happening to Government, for which they have no responsibility. It continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="080716108000123"></a>&#147;But, as has been indicated in the past (for example in the reply to the Commons Liaison Committee in 2007), it will not be possible to give a general undertaking to publish most bills in draft or regularly to achieve the figures reached in 2003&#151;04. The main practical obstacle remains the need to have the freedom to bring forward much legislation on a timetable which does not allow for publication of the proposed legislation in draft form. As the Committee notes, the number planned for publication in the current session is significantly higher than in the preceding sessions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80716-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="080716108000046"></a>I have asked before, but received no answer: what on earth does this mean? I ask the Minister to explain what is meant by the following sentence:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="080716108000124"></a>&#147;The main practical obstacle remains the need to have the freedom to bring forward much legislation on a timetable which does not allow for publication of the proposed legislation in draft form&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080716108000113"></a>Why does it need that freedom? Why is it a practical obstacle, as opposed to political resistance from Ministers to having their Bills examined in draft? There is no justification offered for the Government&#146;s statement in their response either to the committee&#146;s report or to the Liaison Committee in the other place.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="080716108000047"></a>Why do the Government then go on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="080716108000125"></a>&#147;As the Committee notes, the number planned for publication in the current session is significantly higher than in the preceding sessions&#148;?</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080716108000114"></a>That does not obviously flow from what has gone before; if anything, it undermines it. It is possible to publish several Bills in draft, more so than in the immediately preceding Sessions. Why can this not be maintained and extended?</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="080716108000048"></a>As the Constitution Committee recognises, certain Bills obviously cannot be published in draft; for example, the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Bill. However, as my noble friend said, emergency legislation is the exception and not the norm. The Government have provided no clear principled or practical reason why there should not be more Bills published in draft and committed to pre-legislative scrutiny. The case for such publication and pre-legislative scrutiny is generally accepted, including by the Government, so why are they not delivering on what in 2004 was their declared policy? I know there is some incentive for departments to publish in draft, yet there seems to be a reluctance to go down this route and a failure on the part of senior Ministers to impose such a policy.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="080716108000049"></a>The Government have failed to justify this step backwards. They have made progress in other areas of the legislative process, so why not in respect of pre-legislative scrutiny?</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="080716108000050"></a>I conclude by referring to the time provided for pre-legislative scrutiny. When Bills are referred for pre-legislative scrutiny, the committee should normally have at least three months to consider the Bill. That is included in the Cabinet Office guidance to departments. Like the noble Lords, Lord Maclennan and Lord Tyler, I serve on the Joint Committee on the draft

We began work in May and we have to report by 22 July, when we are meeting&#151;this is for legislation that is essentially five Bills in one. The pressure on the Joint Committee has been enormous.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="080716108000051"></a>The Government&#146;s response to the Constitution Committee&#146;s observations on this point is wholly inadequate. In effect, it is that it is &#147;one of those things&#148;. If the political will is there, the situation can be improved. I am aware of the pressures on parliamentary counsel, but more can be done to stagger the introduction of Bills and make greater use of the provision for carryover. These points are covered in the Constitution Committee&#146;s 2004 report. There is scope for improvement. What is lacking is not necessarily the resources but rather the resolve to improve the situation. The Government&#146;s response is indicative of that. I look forward to the Minister offering far more this evening than is embodied in this rather sorry response.</p>

I have been sitting on the pre-legislative Joint Committee on the Marine Bill and endorse some of the points made by other speakers. The process has been very effective, and witnesses have been able to appear, including a fascinating witness from the EC who enabled us to take an alternative view on what we are doing. That should happen more often. The consensus emerged about the changes needed to the Bill which, I hope, will be incorporated.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="080716108000053"></a>I half-endorse the grumbling of previous speakers, although we should always remember that the best should not be the enemy of the good. Our committee has been able to sit for eight weeks this summer and done very useful work, even though we did not have the ideal 12 weeks. With those points I should like to endorse the committee.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="080716108000054"></a>Another criticism was that scrutiny committees should not be meeting if there are additional reports in the pipe-line.

As the noble Lord, Lord Norton, has already said, three of us are involved in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill, to which I shall come back in a moment; this has been an important exercise and it has conditioned my thinking on this.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="080716108000056"></a>I note in passing how important it is to have a few poachers turned gamekeepers in this House. There are two former Chief Whips, members of the old boys&#146; club, here this afternoon. In the notable case of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, we have a former government Chief Whip. As such, he comes with all the experience of the business managers of the other place, which will stand us in good stead in his committee and in his service to your Lordships&#146;  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1310"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1310</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>House. Useful work is clearly being undertaken. So many of the recommendations of the Norton report, to which we go back at regular intervals, are still relevant to what we are doing here today.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="080716108000057"></a>It is important to step back for a moment to remind ourselves why we undertake pre-legislative scrutiny: to improve the eventual product of Parliament. The quality of what we produce in this building is often justifiably criticised, but pre-legislative scrutiny is one way in which we can make dramatic and useful improvements. It is therefore important that we are concerned not only with the number of Bills that go through this process, but their importance and significance&#151;indeed, somebody mentioned their length. Although I take seriously the point of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, about the reduction from a total of 15 in the year to which he referred to one in three, the significance of that legislation is also important. It is not just quantity but quality.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="080716108000058"></a>I have a long commitment, as do my noble friends, to improving pre-legislative scrutiny and making it more applicable and work better. Indeed, in the other place, I worked closely with the late Robin Cook on these issues. I see that the Minister indicates that Robin Cook applied considerable energy and effort, and attempted to bring Members of all parties along with him to make a success of this exercise.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="080716108000059"></a>It is significant, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, has pointed out, that a great many more Bills went into pre-legislative scrutiny when Mr Cook was Leader of the House of Commons, not least those undertaken by Joint Committees. In passing, I point out, as I am a member of the Joint Committee looking at the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill, that a special role can be played in Parliament by Joint Committees. They bring together the ethos of this House with some of the expertise available in the other place. We accelerate the process because we bring together the analysis of both Houses in one exercise, rather than having to do it sequentially and thereby lose some time.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="080716108000060"></a>Reference has been made to the Joint Committee on which we are serving having been given an extraordinarily short time to deal with incredibly complicated matters, diverse to the point of disruption. Some of the issues that we have been addressing are so peculiar in their own way that they do not happily fit into a coherent draft Bill. Without betraying any of the likely consequences of our examination, we may well make that comment. To do it in just 10 weeks! We are meeting twice a week, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with our amazing Clerks from both Houses updating us between the meetings. It is extraordinary, and I pay tribute to the Clerks for that exercise, but it cannot be said to be a well organised process if we are putting them under that pressure.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="080716108000061"></a>In addition, we should recognise that one of the huge values of pre-legislative scrutiny is that we take evidence. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, said, it is extremely important that we take evidence from outwith the parliamentary estate on important issues that we address. I note, for example, that when the Joint Committee under the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, looked at the Communications Bill, evidence  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1311"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was taken from experts that could possibly not have been brought together by the normal process of examination.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="080716108000062"></a>In that context, my noble friend Lord Maclennan is right to say that, when taking evidence in a Joint Committee, you get well away from the normal adversarial process so often seen at the other end of the building&#151;and occasionally in your Lordships&#146; House. In this process, you would not know what party or group those taking the evidence of those giving it were from. That effective, impartial assessment of complicated issues was especially apparent in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Communications Bill.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="080716108000063"></a>Briefly, on parallel consideration of these issues between the two Houses, it would be inappropriate to comment in detail on what happens in the other place. However, I note&#151;because I was involved in it&#151;that this House was looking at these issues from 2002 to 2004 when the modernisation Select Committee, on which I served for a number of years, was doing so in the other place. I take seriously the work done in this House by an interesting group of party leaders while this was being discussed by the modernisation committee. It was referred to as the Leaders&#146; Group on working practices in the House of Lords, and produced a report on 29 April 2002 that went into a great deal of detail about the working practices of the House.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="080716108000064"></a>We all know what happens with the London bus syndrome: Bills all appear immediately after the Queen&#146;s Speech in December or November, and they all need a Second Reading. A number come to this House; perhaps too few, but that is a separate issue. A great number go the House of Commons, and then they all go into Committee. As a result, there is a blockage; we have a number of Bills coming at the same time. Sometimes there are 10 or a dozen Bills for Second Reading in just a few weeks, and then they all go into Committee.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="080716108000065"></a>Those pressures can be alleviated, partly by better spreading of the draft legislation for pre-legislative scrutiny, partly by allocating in which House they should start, but also by ensuring that carryover is used in appropriate cases. In 2002, this House made the sensible decision of linking the issues of pre-legislative scrutiny with carryover. Clearly, if you are to have appropriate time set aside for pre-legislative scrutiny, you may find that the resulting Bill needs to be carried over into the following Session. Unfortunately, against the pressures that I and others&#151;particularly Robin Cook&#151;tried to steer through in the other place, the same deal was not struck, nor was the same link made. I therefore fear that the other place is far less clever in organising pre-legislative scrutiny and the resulting link with carryover. That is an important link, for better digestion of the legislative programme through the year and&#151;where necessary, by agreement between the parties&#151;carryover into the following Session. I hope that the Minister will allude to that issue. Even if he cannot give a definitive view, I hope that we can go back to it.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="080716108000066"></a>We owe a great debt, not only to the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for what he has done with this committee in more recent months on behalf of your Lordships&#146; House, but also to previous chairs: the noble Lord, Lord Norton, and our much lamented former colleague, the late Lord Holme of Cheltenham, who made a

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="080716108000068"></a>Generally speaking, pre-legislative scrutiny is a desirable constitutional development. The members of a scrutiny committee have a real opportunity to influence the Government&#146;s thinking. Moreover, the existence of the committee, sitting in public, animates and engages outside interests and individuals who have preoccupations about one or more of the draft Bill&#146;s provisions. By the time it becomes a Bill, and begins its journey through the legislature, many more people than would otherwise be the case have become familiar with its contents and the issues to which it gives rise. This increased awareness goes a little way to redress the balance of power between Parliament and the Executive. Faced with a better informed House, the Government will usually have to work harder to achieve the passage of a Bill, and to give more ground than they would otherwise have done.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="080716108000069"></a>Soon after the right honourable gentleman the Prime Minister became Prime Minister, he committed himself to changing the balance of power between Parliament and the Executive. Indeed, there is a draft Bill on constitutional renewal presently under consideration by a joint legislative committee&#151;as we have heard more than once tonight&#151;much of the contents of which purport to contribute to achieving this constitutional objective. However, as my noble friends Lord Goodlad and Lord Norton of Louth powerfully said, in the arena of pre-legislative scrutiny there seems little or no sign of the Government pursuing the Prime Minister&#146;s declared aim.</p>

<a name="80716-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="080716108000070"></a>This is evident from the Government&#146;s response to your Lordships&#146; Select Committee&#146;s report. It is resoundingly negative. The Government refused the committee&#146;s request to give a,</p>

<p><a name="080716108000115"></a>Yet the Government&#146;s legislative plans for the coming session were published in May. Surely there could be greater use of pre-legislative scrutiny within this timescale, as the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, emphasised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="080716108000071"></a>Chapter 1 of the Government&#146;s 2008 draft legislative programme states that its aim is,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="080716108000072"></a>Moreover, the Government were unwilling to give the committee any comfort on its specific requests, as my noble friend Lord Goodlad explained. They declined

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="080716108000073"></a>The Minister will no doubt tell us, on the one hand, that the Government remain committed to the principle of pre-legislative scrutiny for most Bills; but, on the other, that constraints such as the availability of parliamentary draftsmen, competing demands on civil servants within departments and, quite simply, events, make specific commitments on numbers or timing impossible to make.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="080716108000074"></a>My response to that is to say that, despite these constraints, Government always respect the legislative timetable and procedures of each of the two Houses of Parliament with respect to the passage of Bills in circumstances where the above-mentioned constraints are just as relevant. Why should pre-legislative scrutiny not be regarded in most cases&#151;as I believe all speakers said this evening&#151;as an additional mandatory stage in the passage of a Bill?</p>

The Government remain committed to the use of pre-legislative scrutiny and certainly understand the benefits it can have in terms of the quality of the legislation that is eventually passed, engagement with stakeholders and increased knowledge gained by Members of both Houses who take part in it.

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="080716108000077"></a>Eighteen months ago, I well remember suddenly finding myself in the Department of Health. On almost my first day in the new job I had to deal with the first Committee day of the Mental Health Bill, which would have been a challenge in itself. However, it turned out to be even more of a challenge because many of the noble Lords who took part in the debates on that Bill had served on the pre-legislative scrutiny committee. Therefore, they came to those debates armed with huge knowledge and expertise, and sometimes with preformed judgments on some of the issues. Therefore, I experienced at first hand the benefit of pre-legislative scrutiny and have no doubt at all that it can be very beneficial for some legislation.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="080716108000078"></a>I very much enjoyed the speeches of the noble Lords, Lord Norton, Lord Tyler and Lord Maclennan, and the way in which they placed this debate in a much

Mention was made of the 2004 report, which took a holistic view of the legislative process; of the work of the Modernisation Committee of the House of Commons; and of the late Robin Cook, who was such an energising moderniser of Parliament. If one looks at the changes that have taken place in the past 10 years, one is in no doubt that there has been impressive progress in improving parliamentary scrutiny. It is easy to forget that detailed Explanatory Notes to Bills have been with us for only a few years. Prior to 1997, Members had to rely on notes on clauses, which were not widely disseminated. Impact assessments are also published with Bills. In the wider scrutiny sense, we have the Westminster Hall debates and Public Bill Committee hearings in the other place, to which the noble Lord, Lord Norton, rightly drew attention. Topical questions were introduced in the other place, no doubt following the experience of your Lordships&#146; House, which increased the number of such questions that can be asked. In addition, the draft legislative programme is published in advance of the Queen&#146;s Speech.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="080716108000079"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, rightly referred to the statement by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister last summer, <I>The Governance of Britain</I> Green Paper and the draft constitutional reform Bill, to which my noble friend Lord Hunt also referred. That shows that considerable progress is being made. However, I accept that we ought not to be complacent. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, was absolutely right to say that the opportunity that we have to debate House of Lords reform in the light of the White Paper issued on Monday also gives this House an opportunity to look at its own procedures and the way in which it deals with legislation.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="080716108000080"></a>I modestly&#151;or not modestly at all&#151;refer to the Labour Peers Working Group on Lords reform. One of the sections in it suggested an alternative way of dealing with legislation. I cannot say that it has got very far, but we have an opportunity in the next year or so, particularly leading up to the election, and following on from the White Paper, to think rather more about whether there are ways in which this House could improve the way in which it scrutinises legislation. I would very much welcome that.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="080716108000081"></a>We heard a lot about New Zealand yesterday. We were going to send the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, there to investigate the way in which it deals with witness anonymity. It would be interesting to look at the approach suggested by the noble Lord relating to pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="080716108000082"></a>I asked officials for a list of the Bills where pre-legislative scrutiny has taken place and the impact that it has had, and it is very positive. I shall mention three of them. On the Legal Services Bill, the Government accepted a large number of the Joint Committee&#146;s recommendations; the reckoning is approximately three-quarters. We have already heard the tribute paid by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill. The majority of recommendations in the committee&#146;s report on the Climate Change Bill were accepted. There is no doubt at all that that strengthened the Bill in terms of policy and legislative handling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="080716108000083"></a>On the question of numbers, ratios and the Government&#146;s current approach, the Government published 58 draft Bills between 1997 and the beginning of the current Session. We have published a further seven so far this Session: the Cultural Property (Armed Conflict) Bill; the Constitutional Renewal Bill; the Marine Bill; the Heritage Protection Bill; the Marine Navigation Bill; the Immigration Bill and the Apprenticeship Reform Bill. The draft legislative programme flagged an intention to publish two further Bills, on construction contracts and on communications data.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="080716108000084"></a>If we take the seven Bills published so far this Session, in the current Session, the Government have introduced some 23 main programme Bills for Royal Assent. One-third of those were either emergency Bills&#151;the Banking Reform Bill and the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Bill&#151;or Bills that were previously published in draft. One must be careful about the ratios.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="080716108000085"></a>I know that noble Lords think that there should be more than seven, and I accept that every noble Lord who has spoken would like there to be more, but that is evidence that the Government have not backed away from the general principle of wishing to publish Bills in draft where it is appropriate and where there will be real benefit from it. However, there are sometimes good reasons why&#151;</p>

He has just said that the Government support the use of pre-legislative scrutiny where appropriate. My understanding was that the Government had accepted the principle of exercising the pre-legislative scrutiny procedure in the case of most Bills; and that what held the Government back were factors such as the lack of parliamentary draftsmen and difficulties within government departments about priorities. Which is it? Is it that the Government simply take the view that it is entirely at the discretion of the Government as to which Bills they subject to pre-legislative scrutiny; or is it only because of those constraints that the Government do not subject most Bills to pre-legislative scrutiny?</p>

He suggested that the Government were going backwards in this matter. I suspect that the Minister would not be prepared to accept that allegation. It seems to me, from the noble Lord&#146;s reaction to my first intervention, that the Government do not know what their policy is on pre-legislative scrutiny and, even if they do, they are not prepared to tell your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

After all, it was this Government that introduced and developed pre-legislative scrutiny, alongside other modernisations and improvements&#151;</p>

He is saying that there are reasons why Bills are not published in draft. Part of the problem is that we are not told what those reasons are. One way to completely change the emphasis and address that very point is embodied in a recommendation of the Constitution Committee in 2004. Paragraph 34 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="080716108000126"></a>&#147;Acknowledging that this entails an important shift of emphasis, we recommend that the Government should move from deciding which bills should be published in draft each session to deciding which bills should not be published in draft. Where the decision is taken not to publish a bill in draft, then the reasons should appear in the Explanatory Notes to the bill&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080716108000117"></a>That would get at the point, we would know the reason, and it would provide a much clearer emphasis on what the Government are seeking to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="080716108000094"></a><a name="80716-0012.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80716-0012.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="080716108000159"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving way; I am going to come to his aid. Very useful evidence was given to the Select Committee on Modernisation about what the problem was. It was not the problem of manpower among parliamentary draftsmen. Indeed, it was recognised that spreading the load would be more effective. It was not the problem of producing draft Bills rather than complete Bills, because that, too, was recognised. If the Minister is finding it difficult to find suitable alibis for the position that the Government have taken, I suggest that he looks at the evidence given to the Modernisation Committee in the other place.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="080716108000095"></a>Finally, in that respect, it would certainly help if there was better discussion between the parties at a very early stage after the Queen&#146;s Speech about what was and was not appropriate for pre-legislative scrutiny. Again, that was one of the recommendations of Mr Robin Cook.</p>

I am quite happy to carry on in this very entertaining way. I have often thought that rather than having staid, officially written responses to Questions for Short Debate, it would be much better to have this kind of discussion. That is particularly so when it comes to such an important matter as how we can improve the job that we are here to do, particularly in your Lordships&#146; House, which is to get better scrutiny of legislation.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1317"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column 1317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="080716108000097"></a>I will not read through the list, but there are clearly substantive reasons why the Government would consider that it is not appropriate to have pre-legislative scrutiny for some Bills. Clearly, some Bills have external time constraints. The noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, referred to the emergency Bills that we have recently debated in your Lordships&#146; House. There may be other Bills that are implementing policies following a review and extensive consultation. Where that has occurred, there may be some hesitation in also having pre-legislative scrutiny, due to time factors and the fact that it would cover ground that had already been extensively covered in a consultation.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="080716108000098"></a>There are time pressures in the government timetable. I have had experience of dealing with many Bills in different government departments. While of course it is important that there should be sufficient time for pre-legislative scrutiny, proper drafting and proper consultation, the reality of government is that, with the best will in the world, sometimes there is not the time. Sometimes Governments have to make decisions that lead to legislation for which it is simply not possible or practical to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="080716108000099"></a>There will be some occasions where publishing Bills in draft may not add greatly to the knowledge of the proposed legislation. Some short Bills, for example, may legislate for the implementation of international agreements.</p>

<a name="080716108000100"></a><a name="80716-0012.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="80716-0012.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="080716108000161"></a>Lord Goodlad:</b> Can the Minister say whether there is a Minister in the Government with overall responsibility for pre-legislative scrutiny and, if so, who that is?</p>

In fact, I have gone over my time. I do not know whether the House is happy for me to do that. My understanding is that pre-legislative scrutiny is the responsibility of the business managers in the two Houses. The Leader of the House of Commons is also chair of L Cabinet Committee&#151;the Cabinet committee that all Ministers are in fear of, because it is in charge of the legislative programme. Therefore, it is L Cabinet Committee that must clear legislation. Noble Lords may not believe it, but it keeps a very tight rein and close eye on Ministers preparing Bills and on the legislative process. I certainly have the scars on my back to prove it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="080716108000102"></a>A number of other questions were raised. I know that there is an issue about statistics and how they should be measured. I hope that officials from government may meet the officials who service the noble Lord&#146;s committee to see whether there can be further discussion about statistics. Clearly, there is a question about how you measure pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="080716108000103"></a>On the House of Lords White Paper, the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, asked on Monday whether the intention was to publish draft clauses. The Government have signalled that, depending on the outcome of the White Paper deliberations, it may be possible to publish draft clauses. How should they be measured in terms of whether they are considered to constitute a Bill? There are some interesting matters that we might discuss.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="080716108000104"></a>On the question about my noble friend Lady Amos, when she was Leader of the House, and the publication of the information for which the noble Lord asked, the noble Lord will have read the response from my noble friend. I am happy to talk to my noble friend Lady Ashton about what information the Government might publish that would be of help to the House and the committee. The Government want to be co-operative in this matter.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="080716108000105"></a>Let me reiterate by, first, thanking the noble Lord and his committee for their invaluable report. Despite what may be perceived as the negativity of the response, I hope that he will not see it in that way. The Government remain committed to pre-legislative scrutiny. There is clearly a debate between us as to the extent of pre-legislative scrutiny and the criteria under which the Government decide which Bills are appropriate for it. I have no doubt that we will continue to have that debate. I also suspect that the work that will now take place on post-legislative scrutiny will throw up some interesting conclusions, which will be of help in improving the legislative process as a whole.</p>

<a name="80716-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="080716108000106"></a>I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Norton, for his championing of post-legislative scrutiny, which I believe offers much hope for the future. In the mean time, I assure noble Lords that the Government will continue to look with favour on pre-legislative scrutiny and will continue to evaluate Bills to ensure that, where appropriate, they will be considered for that process.</p>

<p><a name="08071687000011"></a>The noble Baroness said: The order was laid before the House on 18 June, with an Explanatory Memorandum and a draft code of practice. I hope that your Lordships have had the opportunity to study them. I take this opportunity to put on record my appreciation to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and, in his absence, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, for their forbearance on the last occasion. By some inadvertence the Explanatory Memorandum was not available and we were not able to deal with the matter on that occasion. I apologise most wholeheartedly for that mistake.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000012"></a>The order brings into operation a code of practice governing the exercise by prosecutors of their investigative powers in relation to civil recovery and criminal confiscation investigations. The Proceeds of Crime Act, which came into force in 2003, created investigative powers to be used in tracing criminal assets. These are the powers to apply for and execute production orders, search and seizure warrants, customer information orders, account monitoring orders and disclosure orders. These investigative powers have been exercised in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by the Assets Recovery Agency and law enforcement agencies such as the police and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. In exercising the powers, these organisations have operated under a code of practice issued by the Home Secretary under Section 377 of the Proceeds of Crime Act.</p>

The Assets Recovery Agency&#146;s investigative powers have been transferred to the Serious Organised Crime Agency and to a number of specified prosecuting authorities superintended by me&#151;namely the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Director of the Serious Fraud Office, the Director of Revenue and Customs Prosecutions and the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000014"></a>The staff of the Serious Organised Crime Agency will continue to operate under the Home Secretary&#146;s code of practice, which was recently amended to take account of the changes brought in by the Serious Crime Act and to maintain consistency with the codes of practice under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which have developed over the years. The Home Secretary&#146;s amended code was the subject of public consultation ending in January, and was brought into effect by an order approved by both Houses on 1 April.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000015"></a>The staff of the prosecuting authorities will be bound by a code of practice issued by me, and it is that prosecutor&#146;s code which is brought into operation by this order. My code is identical in all material respects to the Home Secretary&#146;s amended code, so that different agencies exercising these powers will do so to the same standards and with the same safeguards. My code was put out to public consultation in March but no responses were received, presumably because any issues had already been addressed and resolved in the drafting of the Home Secretary&#146;s amended code.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000016"></a>My code gives detailed guidance to the staff of the prosecuting authorities on the way in which they should apply for and execute the various investigative measures available to them in respect of civil recovery investigations. The code also gives guidance to prosecutors on their role in criminal confiscation investigations, namely in applying for disclosure orders on behalf of the law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p><a name="08071687000017"></a>The introductory part of the code provides an overview of the investigative powers and the provisions applicable to all of them. That includes general best practice for making applications for the various orders and warrants, and executing them. It also includes guidance on the procedures for the retention of documents and information. The code then provides some more detailed information on each of the investigative measures.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000018"></a>In summary, I am satisfied that the draft code sets out clearly the processes and safeguards required for the effective and fair operation of the investigative powers. Due to the nature of the draft order, I have spoken more to the draft code than to the order itself. The only further point on the order is that, in relation to Northern Ireland&#151;I see the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, in his place&#151;it is made by me in my capacity as Attorney-General for Northern Ireland. I beg to move.</p>

These things happen on the best run vessels, and I do not believe that any damage has been done to the national interest.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000021"></a>The order flows from the changes made to Part 8 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 by the Serious Crime Act 2007. We made it clear at the time of the passage of the then Bill that in principle we supported the changes, the most important of which has been to abolish the Assets Recovery Agency and transfer its civil recovery functions to the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the four main prosecuting authorities in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000022"></a>As the noble and learned Baroness explained, the order brings into operation a code of practice that provides guidance for prosecutors on their exercise of powers of investigation under the 2002 Act. As I understand it, the earlier code has been revised to take account of the changes introduced by the 2007 Act.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000023"></a>I have just two questions for the noble and learned Baroness. First, as she must know, concerns have been raised in Northern Ireland that SOCA&#146;s priorities will be such that cases of intimidation and local protection rackets will be considered insufficiently substantial to attract its attention. Secondly, I would be most grateful if she could assure the Committee that the costs of recovering assets, as well as the amounts recovered, will be made public on a regular basis. The change that she has introduced should not be at the expense of transparency.</p>

<p><a name="08071687000024"></a><a name="80716-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80716-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08071687000148"></a>Baroness Falkner of Margravine:</b> I, too, thank the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General for her explanation of the order. I apologise for the fact that my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford is unable to be here today; he was intrigued by the delay in receiving the code but was grateful to receive it when he did.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000025"></a>I accept that this is largely the same as the code of practice for SOCA, which was passed by both Houses earlier in the year. It is reassuring to know that the various agencies will exercise the powers of prosecution to the same standards and with the same safeguards.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000026"></a>The noble and learned Baroness mentioned that this code was put out to public consultation in March 2008 and that no responses were received. Can she tell us how long the consultation process was and why there were no responses during that period? Apart from that point, we welcome the order.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000030"></a>I am aware of the concerns raised about Northern Ireland. There has been no evidence in fact that any change has taken place. ARA in Northern Ireland has performed with considerable distinction and efficacy and it is intended that there should be no significant change in that. Every effort is being made to ensure that the efficacy of the procedure and the approach that was adopted before is continued. I know of nothing to indicate that there has been a diminution, although I am very happy to clarify that point.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000031"></a>On costs and the recovery of assets, I can reassure the noble Lord that there will be no lack of transparency. I, too, expect these figures to be disclosed in the normal way.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000032"></a>I believe that the consultation period was the same length as usual, but because the Home Secretary&#146;s order and code had been so extensively consulted upon, with issues raised and resolved, we were not surprised that there was no response to our consultation. We did not take it amiss because it is identical in terms to the Home Secretary&#146;s order.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000033"></a>It is right that we look at comprehensive safeguards and make sure the powers are exercised fairly and proportionately by, for example, making arrangements for a person interviewed under a disclosure order to have access to legal or financial advice and the support of an appropriate adult. That would deal with the sort of issues that were raised in relation to the Home Secretary&#146;s previous code and were put right or amplified in the amended code.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000034"></a>I hope that Members of the Committee will find that this is now in good order; I invite them to approve the order in the terms set.</p>

<h5><a name="08071687000140"></a>3.59 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08071687000036"></a><a name="80716-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80716-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08071687000152"></a>Lord Rooker</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 (Specified Organisations) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000037"></a>The noble Lord said: The Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 provides that the Secretary of State must specify an organisation that is concerned in terrorism connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland, or in promoting or encouraging it, and that has not established or is not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire. In applying his judgment to the second limb of that test, the Secretary of State is obliged, in particular, to take into account whether an organisation is committed to the use now and in the future of only democratic and peaceful means to achieve its objectives, has ceased to be involved in any acts of violence or preparation for violence, is directing or promoting acts of violence by other organisations, and is co-operating fully with the decommissioning commission. The Secretary of State in coming to a judgment in the round will take into account briefings from the Security Service in consultation with the chief constable.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC107"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000038"></a>The following organisations are specified at the moment: the Continuity Irish Republican Army, the Loyalist Volunteer Force, the Orange Volunteers, the Real Irish Republican Army, the Red Hand Defenders, the Ulster Volunteer Force, and the Red Hand Commando. The Secretary of State must review this list from time to time. Changes of circumstances can require amendments to the list of specified organisations.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000039"></a>To that end, the Secretary of State keeps the status of all specified organisations and those purporting to be on a ceasefire under continuous review and takes advice from the Security Service and chief constable as to the robustness of all ceasefires. The consequence of this order is that certain prisoners may be eligible for early release under the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998. However, it has been confirmed that there are currently no prisoners who will benefit from the despecification of the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Red Hand Commando. The order before us today despecifies the Ulster Volunteer Force, generally referred to as the UVF, and the Red Hand Commando. The latter organisation is associated with the UVF and has been used as a &#147;flag of convenience&#148; for UVF activity in the past. The order also specifies "glaigh na hEireann.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000040"></a>I will turn first to the specification of "glaigh na hEireann. This is the first time this organisation has been included in a specification order. "glaigh na hEireann was first identified by the Independent Monitoring Commission in its eighth report, published on 1 February 2006. The commission reported, at paragraph 3.5, a new dissident group, styling itself as "glaigh na hEireann, that had splintered from the Continuity IRA. This is the organisation that we are specifying.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000041"></a>The actions of this organisation are an attempt to pretend that the progress of recent years never occurred. The people of Northern Ireland have no appetite for this form of violence and will not tolerate this attempt to undermine the progress communities have made politically, economically and in terms of the start of the healing of community divisions. This organisation clearly meets the terms for specification. The Independent Monitoring Commission has repeatedly said that the organisation,</p>
<ul><a name="08071687000137"></a>&#147;remains a continuing and serious threat&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071687000128"></a>This organisation continues to be a risk to members of the security forces through their active targeting. The organisation is involved in serious criminal activity and organised crime. This will not be tolerated, and the Northern Ireland Organised Crime Task Force should be commended for its work in tackling the organised crime perpetrated by this and other organisations.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000042"></a>The most serious of the crimes attributable to "glaigh na hEireann is the murder of Andrew Burns, a 27 year-old Strabane man who was abducted and taken across the border to County Donegal where he was shot twice. The IMC classed this as a paramilitary murder and attributed it to "glaigh na hEireann. "glaigh na hEireann, like other dissident republican groups who set themselves on this dangerous path, represents no one but itself. It has no cause, no mandate and nowhere to go but out of business. I pay tribute to the work of the PSNI and  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC108"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the security services in tackling that threat from those organisations professionally and consistently. "glaigh na hEireann will not succeed on its dangerous path.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000043"></a>The order also despecifies the UVF and Red Hand Commando. Those two organisations were specified in 2005, following their violent feud with the Loyalist Volunteer Force, including serious and dangerous rioting at the Whiterock Parade. However, we must acknowledge the significant progress which has been made since those events. A reduction in activity and a change in direction by those organisations have been documented by the Independent Monitoring Commission in its reports. The most significant step is the 3 May 2007 statement, which announced an end to their terror campaign. The statement was that the:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071687000133"></a>&#147;UVF/Red Hand Commando will assume a non-military, civilianised role&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071687000129"></a>and that all ordnances would be &#147;put beyond reach&#148;. That announcement indicated a major turning point for those organisations. At that point, the Secretary of State committed to review the status of the organisation.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000044"></a>The IMC said in its most recent and 18th report, published on 1 May 2008, that the UVF was committed to the path set out in its statement of 3 May 2007. It is important that we acknowledge the progress made by the UVF and the Red Hand Commando, but the story should not end there. The issue of the organisations&#146; arsenal must be addressed even if it is beyond  reach. The leadership must step up its engagement with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. That process needs to result in the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000045"></a>The Secretary of State said at the Mitchell conference that structures such as the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and the IMC were,</p>
<ul><a name="08071687000138"></a>&#147;time limited, and will not be here forever&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071687000130"></a>The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning represents a legal route to decommissioning. The protections that come with this route will not be around for ever if the commission is not there. While we recognise that such things do not happen overnight, our patience and that of the community is now nearing an end. None the less, the order recognises the progress made to date. The evidence from the IMC report is clear. We have weighed that carefully and concluded that the tests for despecification are met in the case of the UVF and the Red Hand Commando. I beg to move.</p>

However, we disagree with the despecification of the UDA. It seems as though it is one law for some and another for others. As my honourable friend in the other place says not too infrequently, the UDA has not yet decommissioned even a water pistol.

The Minister quoted from the Independent Monitoring Commission reports. Yes, I read the report of 13 May, but in the report of 1 May 2008 it is made quite clear:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071687000134"></a>&#147;Overall, in the light of what we have said above, we think that the British Government should revisit the question of the despecification of the UVF&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071687000131"></a>To me that says, &#147;We do not think you are right to make this decision to despecify the UVF&#148;.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000048"></a>That is where we stand. Are HMG going soft on decommissioning? I would find it surprising if they were, and I sincerely hope that they are not, but it looks a bit like it. This order certainly points in that direction. What is the Government&#146;s position on decommissioning?</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000049"></a>I would be grateful if the Minister could give me clear reasons for the UVF being despecified and allowed to hang on to its arsenal, particularly as some of its members are trying to acquire more ordnance, as I think it is known these days. It is interesting that my noble friend Lord Trimble was not so long ago of the same view personally&#151;not as a party member&#151;that this is not the right time to despecify the UVF.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000050"></a>Certainly, the UVF has made a major statement; certainly, it has moved to some extent in the direction of the real world in which we live; but it has not yet gone far enough. It is still a criminal and potentially terrorist organisation; it still has an organisation; it still has an arsenal of weapons. Why on earth have Her Majesty&#146;s Government decided that they are good boys and girls and can be despecified without any decommissioning?</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000051"></a>I do not support the order, but as it is a statutory instrument we in this House, unlike at the other end, cannot vote against it. My party voted against it in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="08071687000052"></a><a name="80716-gc0001.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80716-gc0001.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08071687000154"></a>Lord Smith of Clifton:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for introducing the order. I share much of the scepticism of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. I understand, however, that it is necessary where possible to offer some form of encouragement to those paramilitary organisations that appear to be moving in the right direction. We could dispute as a matter of timing whether the UVF and the Red Hand Commando should at this point be no longer specified&#151;that is a matter of judgment. There remains, too, the question of the decommissioning by the UVF. It has substantial arms, and it would be much more heartening if it was to agree to give them up.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000053"></a>It is important to emphasise that while we are made more aware by the press of some of the atrocities committed by republican paramilitaries, there remains on the loyalist side a considerable threat to the peace of Northern Ireland. We can only hope that continuing prosperity&#151;fingers crossed&#151;and the rebuilding of civic society in Northern Ireland will mean that such organisations no longer have any support from any sections of the community. However, while emphasising that it is not just on the republican side that these threats exist and that significant loyalist factions are also at work, we will with some reluctance&#151;because of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran&#151;support the order.</p>

I fully support the Northern Ireland Office in its efforts to bring about such provisions. However, I point out that until now no such legislative sanction has been available against "glaigh na hEireann, despite initially being cited by the Independent Monitoring Commission in February 2006&#151;some two and a half years ago. If further groups emerge&#151;and I sincerely hope that they do not&#151;that possess the structures, ideology and capability of a terrorist grouping and the Secretary of State receives assessments confirming that, I hope that it will not take two and a half years before their inclusion under the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000055"></a>I give a guarded welcome to the despecification of the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Red Hand Commando. We have to recognise the hard work and dedicated efforts by community leaders in Northern Ireland and the organisations themselves to bring about such a situation. What continuing support and assistance do the Government intend to give loyalist communities so that they can continue to stride away from the grip of the paramilitaries and ensure that those who were once consumed by the past never return to it?</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000056"></a>I note that the Provisional IRA remains a non-specified organisation. What efforts has the Minister made to see the final withdrawal of the IRA&#146;s Army Council? That is necessary so that further political progress can be made in Northern Ireland. Can the Minister give an assessment of the continued specification of the Loyalist Volunteer Force and other such groups which, although they masquerade as politically focused paramilitary movements, adorn themselves with such convenient shrouds simply to gain control and deference in their local community? They are nothing more than a facade for deeply damaging criminal empires. Indeed, in the 18th report of the Independent Monitoring Commission, the LVF was recognised as such. Is it not high time that they were treated as such?</p>

He made a convincing case. I have just one query, and it may not be possible for him to deal with it this afternoon. From our discussions today, and in the other place, it is clear that there are matters of considerable sensitivity here. An issue that was raised in the other place but not, so far as I am aware, fully responded to by the Government was, in the event of the devolution of policing and justice powers in Northern Ireland&#151;the day for that seems to be drawing quite near&#151;what happens to the Secretary of State&#146;s power to specify an organisation? From our discussions, it can be seen that these are complicated and difficult matters. I am not clear&#151;perhaps I should be&#151;and I know others are not clear about what happens to the Secretary of State&#146;s power in this matter.

<p><a name="08071687000059"></a>I am grateful for the muted support. I realise that there is general support. The last thing that the Government or I are saying is that these organisations are perfect. They are not. I was rightly asked why it had taken so long to specify "glaigh na hEireann and was then criticised for despecifying the Ulster Volunteer Force, but the Ulster Volunteer Force&#146;s statement of 3 May 2007, which I shall not read out, is, from its point of view, quite momentous. In many ways, it is along the lines of what came out from the IRA. It is clear from the last paragraph that it took the UVF three years to issue that statement; it was not an overnight job. I will put the final paragraph of the statement on the record:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071687000135"></a>&#147;Finally we convey our appreciation for the honest forthright exchange with officers, NCOs and volunteers throughout the organisation over the past three years which has allowed us to assume with confidence the position we adopt today&#148;.</p>

It took the UVF three years to get that far, so it was not an overnight job. In addition, following that, it has taken time for the Secretary of State to consider despecification. We have received reports on "glaigh na hEireann, which identifies itself as a new organisation. Clearly, we have to ensure that it genuinely exists so that the Secretary of State can use his powers for specifying and so that we do not fall foul of judicial review and other matters. Therefore, it is not an overnight job either to despecify in the case of the UVF or to specify in the case of "glaigh na hEireann. I gladly give way to the noble Baroness.</p>

I shall come on to answer the specific questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, but he asked why we are despecifying the UVF. That is a fair point. On the one hand, the UVF took three years to make its statement of May last year, and the Secretary of State has considered that. On the other hand, I was asked why it has taken two years or more to specify "glaigh na hEireann. My point is that these things do not happen overnight. There is a set of laws and procedures for the Secretary of State to follow. These things are not done on a whim or a hunch; they are done after careful consideration and after taking advice from the Security Service and the chief constable.</p>

I know that my voice is not perfect. I recently went on an overseas trip for the Government to save the whales in Chile and I caught a bug on the plane. So far, I have referred only to the UVF. I have not referred to any other organisation. I make it absolutely clear that I have been referring to the UVF, the Red Hand Commando and "glaigh na hEireann, which I was trained to say a few days ago. I have not referred to any other organisation. I want to make that clear for noble Lords and for <I>Hansard</I>.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000066"></a>I turn to the detail of the questions. I shall not take too long on this but it is important because we are about to go into the Recess. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked why we were despecifying the UVF when it had not really decommissioned. That is absolutely clear. We took the decision to despecify the UVF and the Red Hand Commando after carefully considering the test laid down in the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998. As I said, that decision was reached in consultation with the Security Service and the chief constable. We strongly believe that the UVF has met the threshold for despecification. The May 2007 statement was a very positive step and we are satisfied that the UVF has made sufficient progress since then to enable despecification. I make it abundantly clear that we shall not hesitate to respecify if there is any change in the UVF&#146;s activities. Decommissioning is one of the elements taken into account when considering despecification. However, it is not the only factor to be taken into account in making the decision in the round.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000067"></a>The UVF must go on to decommission, but we are satisfied that it has done enough to be despecified at this point. The list of specified organisations is kept under review and, if necessary, we will not hesitate to respecify any organisation. In its 18th report, the IMC recommended that the Government consider the issue of despecification, and the Secretary of State has done so and reached his decision. It did not recommend us not to despecify.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000068"></a>We are committed to decommissioning as a central part of the political process. We want the total and verifiable decommissioning of all paramilitary arms at the earliest possible moment, and an end to the old vestiges of paramilitarism. The UVF statement of May 2007 shows a strong desire by the leadership to address the issue of weapons. However, more must be done than putting all ordnance beyond reach, and the path laid down for decommissioning must be followed in due course. Normal society cannot have the long-term presence of institutions such as the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, as I have said. That is the legal route to decommissioning. If that organisation is not there, there is no legal route to decommissioning, and the full consequences of that must be apparent to the relevant organisations. Our patience is getting thin. The structures are time-limited and will not be there for ever, so they had best make haste to decommission while it is legal to do so.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071687000136"></a>&#147;Overall, in the light of what we have said above, we think that the British Government should revisit the question of the despecification&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071687000132"></a>not specification. It says &#147;revisit&#148;; I do not know when the Government first visited despecification. I understood that to mean that they should revisit their decision to despecify. If they had not made that decision prior to the report to despecify, then I have it wrong, I think.</p>

He has considered it in the round and reviewed all organisations, hence we have come along with a package of specified organisations, which I read out. If Parliament approves the order, two will come off and one will be added, but that is the Secretary of State&#146;s decision, subsequently approved by Parliament, one assumes. I will not get into the semantics because I do not have the IMC report in front of me, but it asked him to revisit the matter. He looked at it in the round, which he is required to do; it is not just about the issue of decommissioning.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000071"></a>The noble Lord also asked me about attempts to procure weapons and involvement in organised crime. The IMC commented in the 18th report that it believed that individuals had attempted to procure weapons, but in our view that has not been as a result of any decision by the leadership to increase the UVF stocks. Indeed, the leadership has taken some action against offending members on the weapons issue. That is in line with the leadership&#146;s statement of May 2007, the final paragraph of which I read out. The Government have to draw a distinction between the actions of individuals and the organisation as a whole, and we are satisfied that the actions were not on behalf of the organisation.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000072"></a>It is evident from the arrests in Lithuania in January that law enforcement agencies are working hard to combat the activity. As I said, the Organised Crime Task Force is working hard to detect, disrupt and dismantle criminal gangs involved in organised criminal activity. Key successes include over &#163;35 million-worth of criminal assets being disrupted, seized and recovered or settled, over &#163;4 million of illegal drugs being seized, and &#163;1.6 million of counterfeit goods being seized over the past year. Cash-in-transit attacks in Northern Ireland fell by 56 per cent in 2007: there were 22 attacks compared with 51 in 2006.</p>

<p><a name="08071687000073"></a>I was then asked&#151;this is where I have to be clear in my diction&#151;what the UDA had done since it was despecified. On 6 October 2007, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning confirmed to the Secretary of State that a meeting between it and the UDA had taken place in which decommissioning was discussed and named interlocutors were appointed. We hope that this progress will be continued and that a tangible result will be forthcoming. It illustrates some, but limited, progress since the organisation&#146;s despecification in November 2004. It is modest, but it is a step in the right direction. The direction of travel is clear.</p>

<p><a name="08071687000074"></a>The LVF remains specified. Like other specified groups, it must engage with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and turn away from violence. It remains on the list. I hope that I have satisfied the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, who was kind enough to give me notice of some of his concerns regarding the despecification of the UVF.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000075"></a>I regret that I did not keep track of which noble Lord asked me about the Provisional Army Council. Everybody looks forward to the day when the vestiges of all Northern Ireland&#146;s paramilitaries, including the Provisional Army Council, have been relegated to where they belong: in the past. There is no hope for the future for these organisations. Whatever they may feel about what they have done in the past, collectively, independently and individually, there is no hope for them in the future. Financially, economically and militarily, there is no support for them. The climate has changed in Northern Ireland and they need to move with it. I understand that far less than noble Lords who live in Northern Ireland, but I do understand that these things take time. So far, effort has been channelled towards ensuring that all those who come to the table to negotiate can walk away with a vestige of success&#151;there is no victory or defeat here. The victory is for the people, the economy and the society of Northern Ireland. If they can all come to the table and walk away with a degree of success over a period of time&#151;not success in terms of victory&#151;that will be the testament, but it will not happen overnight: it is a very slow process.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000076"></a>However, slow though it may be, what we are able to report today shows that there is progress. I hope that I and other Ministers can in the future report similar progress&#151;it will be slow and it will be from time to time. There will come a day when those organisations have all gone. We hope that it will be as soon as possible, but we realise that it will not be overnight.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000079"></a>The noble Baroness said: The regulations before the Committee today make clear for employees and employers the terms and conditions to which an employee on additional maternity leave or additional adoption leave is entitled. Additional maternity or adoption leave is the second six months of the 52-week leave period. The regulations are necessary as a result of the amendments made to the Sex Discrimination Act in April this year, following the Equal Opportunities Commission 2007 case against the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC115"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000080"></a>Those amendments mean that employers will no longer be able to treat employees taking additional maternity leave less favourably than those on ordinary maternity leave in respect of employment benefits. The regulations clarify that the non-pay contractual benefits that women have during ordinary maternity leave are explicitly extended to additional maternity leave and that right applies to adopters taking additional adoption leave as well. They ensure legal clarity and consistency with the amended Sex Discrimination Act.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000081"></a>The regulations will come into force in October this year, given our commitment to common commencement dates for new employment legislation, and will apply to parents where the expected week of childbirth or placement for adoption is on or after 5 October 2008. The Sex Discrimination Act amendment also applies to women whose expected week of confinement is 5 October 2008 onwards. The timing of the maternity and adoption regulations before us today therefore dovetails with that of the Sex Discrimination Act changes.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000082"></a>Examples of the type of contractual benefit covered include accrual of contractual annual leave and the provision of company cars and mobile phones. Of course, that would be the case only where an employee is already entitled to such benefits as part of their normal contract of employment for their ordinary maternity leave.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000083"></a>These amendments, taken with the Sex Discrimination Act changes, also require that the full 52 weeks of maternity and adoption leave now be counted when assessing how long an employee has been working for an employer. Employers will benefit from the removal of the risk of claims for sex discrimination if they provide only the terms and conditions as currently required. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08071687000086"></a>The regulations were debated in the other place yesterday. My honourable friend Mr Jonathan Djanogly gave a long, extended description of what they were all about. I want to avoid the Committee suffering that. He did it beautifully and received a lot of answers. However, a few questions were left, so perhaps the Minister would not mind if I ask one or two.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000087"></a>According to the DBERR impact assessment, the regulations will impose costs of more than &#163;162 million, but will create zero financial benefit. Does the Minister believe that at a time of rapidly increasing economic competition it is right to lumber business with yet more regulations and costs? The British Chamber of Commerce estimates that government regulations have cost business in excess of &#163;65 billion since 1998. There have been 14 new regulations every working day. Is this not just another one? It is often claimed that the bulk of the regulation under which United Kingdom business struggles is derived from Europe. Although the Government are well known for their zealous application of the European regulations, I do not think this is another one; I think these are regulations of their own creation. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000088"></a>Many small businesses cannot afford to employ an extra member of staff. Therefore, how does the Minister believe that such businesses will be able to afford to maintain the benefits and privileges due to a member of staff on additional maternity leave and hire another member of staff to cover their job?</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000089"></a>That is the end of the questions that I should like the Minister to answer now, if she can, with the help of her civil servants&#151;or later, if she cannot at this stage. Every one of those questions relates to economics; obviously, I could have made a very long speech about regulations affecting maternity benefits and adoption law, but I do not think that she needs to hear me go through all that right now.</p>

<p><a name="08071687000090"></a><a name="80716-gc0002.htm_spnew24"></a><b><a name="80716-gc0002.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="08071687000168"></a>Lord Addington:</b> We really do not have any fundamental objections to this statutory instrument, but there is one question to which I would like a response. Why are not maternity and paternity leave combined to be parental leave? That would mean that women were no longer quite so stigmatised, with problems about employment and so on. Why is this not being considered? If it is being considered, when can we have an answer? The idea that one parent should choose which of them takes on responsibility would seem to be a logical extension of much of the Government&#146;s rhetoric, if not policy. When will some consideration of this be given? Other than that, I do not really have much to add to the debate, but it would surely be a logical extension of what we have talked about to allow fathers to share more of the leave and childcare duties.</p>

With respect to the question on impact assessment, there is a cost of &#163;162 million, including the adoption. That is a cost that amounts to approximately &#163;125 per firm employing people. We understand and, I believe, share a passion with the noble Baroness about better regulation. However, it would be interesting to note the benefits around the importance of the role that women play in the labour market. In encouraging women into the labour market, we face productivity challenges; we have high levels of employment and a tight labour market, and it is very important that women continue to participate in that.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000092"></a>The noble Baroness may be interested to know that, while women&#146;s employment rights have increased, the evidence shows that their participation in the labour

Compared with 1971, when they made up 38 per cent of the workforce, women are now 45 per cent of the workforce. Female employment rates in 1971 were 42 per cent and are now 70 per cent. That is among the highest in the EU, although the maternity entitlement is also the longest. But of course there is a balance to be struck and a legitimate discussion to be had to ensure that we are not complacent or introducing rigidities into the labour market.</p>

<p><a name="08071687000093"></a>On the noble Baroness&#146;s question on gold-plating, this amendment followed a case in the High Court, in which we were considered to have underimplemented and were therefore required to implement. I strongly refute the suggestion that we zealously gold-plate or overimplement regulations.</p>

<p><a name="08071687000094"></a>On affordability, the noble Baroness will be aware that small and medium enterprises are entitled to recover 104.5 per cent of statutory maternity pay from the state. In the terms of employment, if they choose to give further maternity pay, they will be considering their own affordability issues.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000095"></a>The noble Lord raised an interesting question, which also came up in another place in yesterday&#146;s debate. The Minister responsible for employment essentially said that there was a legitimate debate to be had about flexibility in paternity leave. It is important to recognise that maternal leave is set out in this way because the health of the mother is a factor, particularly in the early period after her baby is born, but adoption leave can be taken by either parent because that is not relevant. There is a debate to be had about the flexibility of maternity leave after a certain time. We also have to consider predictability for employers and their legitimate interest in this. Therefore, in 2006 the Government extended notice periods to support businesses in this matter.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000096"></a>I hope that that answers the questions that I was asked. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="08071687000099"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Section 20 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 created a statutory gateway that enables the police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and those accommodating UK Border Agency-supported asylum seekers to supply information to the Home Office for specified immigration purposes. Section 20 also provides an enabling power, subject to close scrutiny in this House and in the other place, to extend this list of bodies and the circumstances in which information may be shared.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000100"></a>Today, to improve further the sharing of information between government departments and the UK Border Agency, we are seeking to include the Secretary of State for Transport in respect of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in respect of social security information, and the chief constable of the British Transport Police in this gateway.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000101"></a>The order provides that certain information held by these departments and organisations may be supplied to the Secretary of State for the Home Department for use for immigration purposes as defined in Section 20(3) of the Act. It also extends the definition of immigration purposes to cover two additional UK Border Agency functions in relation to individuals in receipt of asylum support under Section 4 of the 1999 Act and those individuals who may have civil penalties imposed under Section 15 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000102"></a>There are currently no statutory powers for the Department for Work and Pensions, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency or the British Transport Police to supply information held in pursuance of their functions to the UK Border Agency for use for immigration purposes. These departments currently rely on common-law powers to share such information with the UK Border Agency to exercise immigration functions and to investigate criminal activity.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000103"></a>It is right that staff working in government departments should be clear as to the limits of their administrative powers under the law and the extent to which information-sharing with other departments is permitted. Given the increasing importance of information that these bodies supply for immigration functions and the increase in the volume of information the UK Border Agency requires, including via electronic format, we felt it prudent and timely to make an order setting out a clear legislative basis for the supply of this information.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000104"></a>This information will be used by the UK Border Agency to locate and remove immigration offenders, ensure compliance with existing immigration laws, including the checking of applications under the new points-based system, and prevent abuse of the asylum support benefit system. The UK Border Agency is forging closer partnerships with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the Department for Work and Pensions as part of its enforcement strategy <I>Enforcing the Deal</I>, which my right honourable friend the Home Secretary published on 19 June.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000105"></a>The order is crucial to enabling this work to proceed. It will allow the UK Border Agency to carry out more effective checks with the Department for Work and Pensions when applying the Immigration Rules that set down the criteria for entry and stay in this country. When a person is subject to a requirement that they do not claim benefits as a condition of entering and remaining here, the UK Border Agency will be able to check with the Department for Work and Pensions whether they have been truthful in their application.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000106"></a>The order will also enable us to take forward the review of migrants&#146; access to UK driving licences. Driving licences are used for many purposes, including demonstrating identity and address for the purpose of  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC119"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>accessing many other services. As such, they can be prized for that purpose by illegal migrants wishing to live here unlawfully.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000107"></a>We want to work with the Department for Transport and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to see how we can tighten up further the already stringent checks carried out on applicants by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. That includes strengthening the Driver Vehicle Licensing Agency&#146;s legal power to share data with the UK Border Agency. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the British Transport Police are included for law enforcement purposes.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000108"></a>It is important to note that the power to supply information under Section 20 simply provides a statutory gateway under which information may be shared. The new power does not abrogate the need to comply with the important safeguards in the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000109"></a>The Government take the protection of personal information very seriously. The departments involved have all reviewed the handling of personal data and implemented enhanced procedures following publication of the Cabinet Office interim report on the data-handling review in December 2007. They have continued to make improvements and are committed to implementing the Cabinet Office mandatory requirements, which were published in March and are referenced in the final report.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000110"></a>A number of initiatives have already been put in place to protect personal data within the Home Office, including the appointment of a senior information risk owner, and the issuing of new guidelines on taking information out of secure areas, including restricting the use of non-encrypted laptops and removable media. Any information shared under this new power and under existing powers will be shared securely in line with the recommendations of the Cabinet Office review. That is what the order seeks to achieve and I commend it to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

The Official Opposition do not object in principle to the Secretary of State being given as much information as is legally held that might help in ensuring our immigration laws are upheld and enforced. It is clear that the information which can be supplied by the wider spread of network of the DWP, the DVLA, the MCA and the British Transport Police can in certain circumstances add to the effectiveness of the UK Border Agency, which must surely be a cause for all-party support.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000113"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for amplifying particularly the question of the driving licences, which he rightly recognises as one of the key identification documents. The Minister in the other place yesterday gave some idea of the numbers and the progress being made. If he can give any further details of that, it would be helpful to the Committee.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC120"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000114"></a>My other point has been gone over many times during the past year. It is clear that the transfer of data between holding authorities is not without its hazards, as has been painfully shown. Once data leave a department, which will have its own security in place&#151;I am obliged to the Minister for confirming that those procedures are being tightened up&#151;they must by the very circumstances of the migration be potentially less secure. Your Lordships will be aware that the Information Commissioner has been highly critical in his latest reports of two departments in particular. The Cabinet Secretary was yesterday asked some fairly direct questions by the committee and gave assurances which the Minister has echoed today. I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s explanation and his assurance that the problem is being addressed with the greatest urgency.</p>

<p><a name="08071687000115"></a><a name="80716-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80716-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08071687000172"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I totally agree with the noble Viscount. The problem is security in transferring the information. We do not object to the order or to the use of the information specified in it but, in view of the history on this matter, we think that your Lordships should be doubly careful to scrutinise the methods by which the transfer of information is to be achieved. The Minister mentioned that it would comply fully with the recommendations in the Cabinet Office review of December 2007. He also referred to the appointment of a senior information risk owner, which I must say was news to me, but very welcome. I should like to know what the exact functions of this official are and whether reports will be made to Parliament on his assessment of the risks involved, particularly in the transfer of information. I am also grateful for the Minister&#146;s assurances that all the powers in this order will be exercised in full compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act. Presumably, under the Data Protection Act there will be oversight of the procedures involved.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000116"></a>The note on the order says that there were no specific consultations on it, and I wonder why that was. Surely, particularly on the risks involved in the transfer of information from one department to another, competent technical advice would have been available from, for example, the professional computer bodies. I noted what the Minister said about the use of non-encrypted laptops, which in the past have been the occasion for the disappearance and theft of information on a large scale. Can he assure us that no information of the kind dealt with in the order will be on unencrypted laptops? I should have thought that where a transfer of information took place between, for example, the Department for Transport, the DVLA and the Home Office, it would be done electronically over a secure link and that that would be the only possible method by which this kind of information could be transmitted from one department to another. If there are exceptions to that and information is put on to a disk or a CD or used on a laptop, I think we should know about that. We should also know what safeguards will be considered by the senior information risk owner to ensure that the information does not go astray.</p>

Both noble Lords raised the issue of data protection. They are absolutely  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC121"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>right: this is a hugely important area, which we take very seriously. There is an element of closing stable doors in some of the things that are going on at the moment, which is not very clever. Looking back over 10 or 15 years or so, I am afraid that people have not been as clever at looking after data as they should have been. We absolutely needed to tighten things up in this area and that has been done. We are taking the right measures. This is an area where people need constant education to ensure that they know the right things to do, and that has to go on all the time because it is very easy to slip back into bad habits. We are very clear about ensuring that that is done. As I said, the new power does not abrogate the need to comply with all the important safeguards in relation to data protection and the Human Rights Act. That is a very important part of it.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000118"></a>The noble Lord asked a specific question about the sharing of data. The DVLA shared information on 1,172 cases in 2007-08&#151;effectively over the past financial year&#151;for the purposes of verifying immigration status. Of those, 489 were fraudulent applications, and that shows the value of this sort of check. The scale of the problem and the fact that it is becoming more widespread means that we need this measure. We need to put things on a more formal basis so that those in administration and others understand where they stand, what the rules are and what has to apply.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000119"></a>The senior information risk officer will report to Parliament, but I will have to write with more detail on this. It is a move in the right direction and will add to existing safeguards.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000120"></a>I am not sure exactly what the specific consultations were. Perhaps I can get back to the noble Lord in writing on that point.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000121"></a>I think we are all agreed that data protection is very important. These data are crucial in countering fraud, crime and illegal immigration. We have to look after them properly as we have to use them and hold them. This is an issue not only for Government but also for private firms that are increasingly holding all sorts of data. This is a very important issue, and I am glad that it was raised.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08071687000122"></a>The information will be shared securely and will generally be passed online. If it is not, I would be very surprised, but I will make certain and let the noble Lord know in writing if it is not on an encrypted laptop. There may be occasions when it is not possible to send it online, which I imagine is when that will happen, but I will check the position and get back to the noble Lord in writing.</p>

<p><a name="08071687000123"></a><a name="80716-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80716-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08071687000174"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I cannot imagine any case in which it would be impossible to send the data over the internet on an encrypted link as opposed to passing them physically via a laptop, CD or some other hard medium. I am not asking for a reply now but I should be grateful if the noble Lord could drop me a line. The exceptions to that rule should be minimised and, if possible, there should be a rule that no data are passed in hard form if that can be avoided.</p>

<h5><a name="08071696000019"></a>5.03 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08071696000002"></a><a name="80716-gc0003.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80716-gc0003.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08071696000020"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Immigration (Biometric Registration) (Civil Penalty Code of Practice) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000003"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall take the two measures together. The UK Borders Act 2007 introduced powers for the Secretary of State to make regulations to issue identity cards to foreign nationals who are subject to immigration control. The order and the regulations will enable the UK Border Agency to do that. They are intended to enable the introduction of the first identity cards to be issued to foreign nationals, subject to immigration control, who are staying in the United Kingdom for more than six months.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000004"></a>The first identity cards will be issued from 25 November 2008 to those who are granted limited leave to remain as certain types of students and those who are granted limited leave to remain as spouses, civil partners or unmarried couples under the Immigration Rules. The cards will confirm the holder&#146;s immigration status and entitlements to work and to access public funds in the United Kingdom. The identity card will provide foreign nationals who are subject to immigration control with a secure and reliable immigration document. To achieve this, we need to make regulations under the biometric registration powers contained in the UK Borders Act 2007, allowing the UK Border Agency to enrol biometric features. These will be a photograph and 10 fingerprints. Taking the person&#146;s fingerprints will enable us to fix a person to a single identity and make it possible to verify that identity against centrally held records. At present, around 50 different documents are issued to foreign nationals granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom; I have to say that I was rather surprised by that. This makes it difficult for employers and service providers to check whether a person is entitled to work in the UK before they give them a job or allow them to access public funds.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000005"></a>Identity cards are designed to make it easier for foreign nationals to demonstrate that they are entitled to live and work in the UK. We consider this essential as part of our efforts to tackle illegal working and  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC123"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>immigration fraud. In addition, these regulations will be the way that the UK complies with a new European regulation, EC 380/2008, which requires the residence permits that grant leave to remain to be in the form of a card containing the biometric features of the holder.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000006"></a>The identity cards will be credit-card sized and will contain the holder&#146;s unique biometric features, including a photograph and two fingerprints. On the face of the card will be the holder&#146;s photograph and his biographical information, including his name, immigration status, nationality, date and place of birth, and gender. This information will also be stored in a secure embedded microchip, along with the two fingerprints. I have a copy of such a card here, which noble Lords can look at afterwards. I do not think that it is for any specific person. No, it is not.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000007"></a>In April this year, noble Lords kindly approved the Immigration (Biometric Registration) (Pilot) Regulations 2008, which enabled the UK Border Agency to test the biometric enrolment processes and technologies by registering the fingerprints and photographs of a small group of foreign nationals applying for leave to remain. The pilot started on 28 April and since that date noble Lords may be interested to learn that we have enrolled more than 7,500 biometric records and had around 2,000 responses to our applicant survey, with the vast majority of responses being positive.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000008"></a>The pilot enrolment processes and technologies are operating smoothly. Given our experiences with the pilot so far, we expect the technologies and our processes to continue to deliver our business needs when we start to issue identity cards from the end of November 2008. Identity cards are being rolled out incrementally, starting with applicants granted limited leave to remain in certain types of student categories and as spouses, civil partners or unmarried couples under the Immigration Rules. We selected these two categories based on risk and efficiency.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000009"></a>Those who are required to register their biometric identifiers will be able to enrol them at any one of the network of offices around the UK. From November 2008, there will be at least six enrolment venues sited across the country, including locations in Birmingham, Cardiff, Croydon, Glasgow, Liverpool and Sheffield. An additional centre will come on line in the following months in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000010"></a>Foreign nationals whose applications are successful will be issued with an identity card that will serve as their document granting them leave. We will not place any vignettes, stickers or stamps within the applicant&#146;s passport.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000011"></a>I shall briefly set out to your Lordships the main differences between these regulations and the pilot regulations. These regulations will apply to foreign nationals in the specified student or family categories making an application from anywhere in the UK, unlike the pilot, which applied only to those making &#147;in person&#148; applications at the Croydon Public Enquiry Office or, if applying for leave by post, those living within a London postcode address. Obligations will be placed on identity card holders to notify the Secretary of State when their circumstances change and to apply for a replacement card in situations when it is cancelled.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000012"></a>We need to define the circumstances when we will require the identity cards for foreign nationals to be used. These regulations impose requirements on holders of the identity cards to provide their cards as part of an immigration process or procedure, where the holder attends a centre to take the &#147;Life in the UK&#148; test and to provide them to an employer. We are also introducing two additional sanctions, which were excluded from the biometric registration pilot. These are a power to curtail or cancel leave and a power to issue a civil penalty notice against persons who fail to comply with the requirements included in these regulations. The bulk of the regulations were developed from the earlier biometric registration pilot regulations. I am happy to answer specific questions about them if Members of the Committee wish to discuss such issues.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000013"></a>The order will bring into force the draft code of practice concerning the sanctions for non-compliance with the biometric registration regulations, which was laid before Parliament on 11 June 2008. The code sets out how the sanctions, which the Secretary of State may impose, will be applied to those who fail to comply with requirements of the biometric registration regulations. An early version of the draft code was published in February 2008 and we consulted the public about its contents. The version before the Committee reflects many of the helpful comments made as part of the consultation process.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80716-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000014"></a>We intend the code to work in the following way. Where a person fails to comply with a biometric registration requirement, a sanction may be imposed. There are two categories of requirements, previously known as primary and secondary requirements, which, following the consultation exercise, are now termed application and maintenance requirements. The application requirements relate to the need for foreign nationals to apply for an identity card. Failure to comply with these requirements will attract a more severe sanction than failing to comply with a maintenance requirement, as we regard the requirement for foreign nationals to apply for an identity card as a fundamental step towards protecting our border. The maintenance requirements mainly apply to those who have an identity card and need to keep their records up to date, or they concern the production of the card, essentially for immigration purposes and verification that the person producing the card is the rightful holder. Where a foreign national has existing leave and fails to comply with a requirement, we will normally issue a civil penalty notice to ensure compliance with the requirements rather than curtail or cancel the person&#146;s leave.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000015"></a>As with the biometric registration pilot regulations, where a person is applying for leave and is required to apply for an identity card, we will normally disregard or refuse their immigration application unless they comply with the requirement. However, any decision to refuse, curtail or cancel leave is subject to the United Kingdom&#146;s obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998 and international conventions, such as the 1951 Refugee Convention.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08071696000016"></a>Turning specifically to the civil penalty regime, copies of the sanctions table were circulated to Committee Members and we have more here. It sets out the levels of financial penalties that may be imposed. At present, the maximum is &#163;1,000, with the starting level at

These amounts may be increased where the person continues to fail, or subsequently fails, to comply with requirements made under the regulations up to the maximum statutory penalty allowed. As with other civil penalty regimes operated by the UK Border Agency, a person issued with a civil penalty notice will have a right to object to the Secretary of State and to appeal to the courts against the notice. The result of an objection or an appeal may lead to the penalty notice being cancelled, the amount increased or decreased, or the decision being maintained.</p>

<p><a name="08071696000017"></a>I am pleased to have brought these regulations and order before the Committee today. We believe that they will be a useful tool in tackling illegal migration and other identity and immigration abuses. We consider that they will support those who are staying in the UK legally and will form part of our wider national identity scheme. These regulations and the order are the first to enable the rollout of identity cards. When we intend to broaden the categories of foreign nationals who are required to apply for an identity card, we will return to Parliament and seek further approval. That is what the regulations and order seek to achieve. I beg to move.</p>

However, he will know that, contrary to statements made by the Prime Minister and, I am sorry to say, in Labour Party leaflets distributed in the Crewe and Nantwich by-election, Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition support, in principle, the issuing of biometric information documents to foreign nationals. We take the view that these documents can sensibly be used as one weapon in helping to secure our borders.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000003"></a>Judging from their recent statements, the Liberal Democrats appear not to want to collect biometric data from anyone at all, and I shall be interested to hear the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, on this matter. While the Government want, in due course, to collect these data from everyone, we in the Official Opposition take what is in our view the sensible middle ground: that the data should be collected when it contributes to the integrity and security of our border and the nation.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000004"></a>We note that the Government have selected students and spouses to be the first foreign nationals to be required to produce ID cards, because it is among these categories that much of the abuse of immigration controls appears to take place. We welcome the news that the pilot scheme has met with a great measure of success.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000005"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum says that the rollout of the card to all foreign nationals is being undertaken on an incremental basis. I think the Minister said that  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC126"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it will start at the end of this year. Can he confirm that none of these requirements will apply within the European economic area?</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000006"></a>Turning to the second statutory instrument, clearly even the limited application of ID cards requires some enforcement regime, and the code of practice is an appropriate form. We welcome that and are pleased to see that the Secretary of State has considerable statutory powers to consider immigration sanctions, which in serious cases will simply mean removal. However, I applaud the move to a civil penalties route before that, as that is obviously a humane and fair way to deal with offenders.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000007"></a>Therefore, we support the limited application of biometric identification. Differences may well arise in the future regarding the lengths to which the Government intend to go with these procedures. However, for the time being at least, we support the order.</p>

<p><a name="08071698000008"></a><a name="80716-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80716-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08071698000049"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I know that the Conservative Party has a different approach to this matter because it supports the identity cards that we are now discussing and is opposed to the use of the national identity card. That seems to me wholly incongruous and inconsistent, as I shall seek to explain.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000009"></a>These orders bring into force identity cards for all foreign nationals, making them a precursor to the comprehensive national identity card scheme, which the Government plan later for everyone legally resident in the UK and which is now being rolled out in accordance with the <I>National Identity Scheme Delivery Plan</I>, published in March. In fact, the BIDs will be designated as ID cards under Section 4 of the Identity Cards Act 2006, as foreshadowed in the Explanatory Memorandum. No doubt the Government calculated that very few people would object to this proposal, as the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments did not draw attention to it and the consultation on the code of practice attracted very few responses&#151;just a dozen, I think.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000010"></a>The pilot regulations, which these regulations supersede, also aroused very little debate, and no one is likely to quarrel with the objective of making it more difficult for unlawful migrants to enter or remain in the UK. So far as I am aware, even the NO2ID campaign, the leading opponents of identity cards, has had nothing to say about their application to people with limited leave to remain, yet would it not seem discriminatory to argue that biometric ID cards are all well and good for migrants but not for the native population? When this scheme is in full operation, there is a danger, as Liberty pointed out when we dealt with the parent Act, that it will be predominantly BME people who are required to produce the BID to satisfy immigration officers that they are legitimately residing in the UK.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000011"></a>Already, in the periodic drives to pick up suspected illegal entrants, far greater numbers are questioned than are subsequently arrested and deported. The cards might encourage the UKBA to undertake more fishing expeditions in which they inevitably pick up a majority of lawful BME residents, undermining the confidence of those people in our claim to be a racially equal society. The survey conducted as part of the  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC127"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>impact assessment showed a perception that the cards would lead to the targeting of people from the subcontinent and Africa and states,</p>
<ul><a name="08071698000045"></a>&#147;potentially causing an adverse impact on community relations&#148;. </ul>
<p><a name="08071698000044"></a>On the other hand, it could be that as institutions of higher education and employers are required to check the validity of a student&#146;s or worker&#146;s leave to remain, the UKBA would have less reason to examine the migrants directly, but would rely on the sponsors, who, as the Minister explained, face civil penalties if they fail to make the prescribed checks.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000012"></a>We note that the intention is to introduce the cards for foreign nationals incrementally, starting with students, their spouses and their dependants, amounting to some 163,000 decisions a year in this order. As we understand it, within three years, all who apply successfully for an extension of leave to remain will receive a card, and the Minister will perhaps be able to let us have that number too.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000013"></a>Could he also tell us what the procedure will be if no decision on an application for extension of leave to remain has been made by the date on which a person's existing leave expires, and how many people that would have applied to if the scheme had been in operation in 2007? While the application is under consideration, and the identity card shows that a person&#146;s existing leave to remain has expired, as it would by reference to the information it gives under Regulation 15(1)(h) of the biometric registration regulations, the holder would be in danger of being picked up as an overstayer whenever he produced it to a UKBA official.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000014"></a>That is only one of the traps for the unwary migrant in these proposals. Under Section 16 of the UK Borders Act 2007, the Secretary of State has power to order any person, with limited leave to remain, to reside at a given address. If that person moves and for any reason fails to notify the Secretary of State, as he is required to do under Regulation 18(d), the Secretary of State may cancel his leave to remain, and he may be removed or, if the Secretary of State is in a good mood, he might simply face a civil penalty.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000015"></a>Will foreign nationals now be legally obliged to inform the Secretary of State every time they change circumstances, as the Minister implied in his introduction, even if they would still be qualified to enter or remain under the paragraph of the rules under which they were given leave to enter or remain? For instance, would the students who are to be covered under this order have to notify the Secretary of State every time they change from one faculty to another or from one college to another? The Minister said that we need to define very closely the changes in circumstances that need to be notified to the Secretary of State. I examined the Explanatory Memorandum closely, and I was none the wiser on the questions I have just put to the Minister. When the BIDs are extended to workers admitted under the points-based system, what are the implications for employers who unwittingly take on or continue to employ a foreign worker with limited leave to remain who has failed to notify the UKBA of a change in his circumstances? How will the UKBA inform migrants, universities, employers and others who may have new duties of what they have to do and what information they have to provide?</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC128"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000016"></a>Let me give one example of the sort of difficulty that may arise. If it had not been for the recent case of GO and others v the Secretary of State, in which the Court of Appeal ruled that a student could change from one course to another without invalidating  her leave to remain, switching courses might have amounted to a change in circumstances falling within Regulation 18(d) requiring the student to notify the Secretary of State. May I assume that as a result of that case, the student who changes his course does not have an obligation to notify the Secretary of State of that fact?</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000017"></a>Under Regulation 7, children under the age of 18 are to provide fingerprints and facial photographs. With no lower limit on the age given in the order, the only condition is that a responsible adult, such as the parent or guardian, must be present when the biometric information is being obtained. In the Explanatory Memorandum on the code of practice, there are three paragraphs referring to compliance with EU regulations on a uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals, to be phased in over two to three years from the agreement of technical standards. The impact assessment states that one of the benefits is that the cards are interoperable with those in place across the whole of the European Union. Surely this has to mean that the technical standards have already been agreed, so that they can be applied to the documents covered by this order. I would be grateful if the Minister could give us an assurance on that point.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000018"></a>We have opted in to agreements on residence permits in the EU, but not on visas, where the European Parliament adopted a report on 10 July dealing with the collection of biometric data from applicants for Schengen visas. Although we are not in the Schengen system, the rules for collection and storage of biometric information for visas obviously should be aligned with those for residence permits, even if they are dealt with under different provisions of European legislation. My noble friend Lady Ludford is the European Parliament rapporteur on the biometric visa system, and she tells me that they have been unable to reach agreement with the Council on the fingerprinting and photographing of children under the age of 16. The Council wants biometric data to be taken from children over five, while the European Parliament is saying that 12 should be the minimum age.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000019"></a>Meanwhile, as was mentioned by the Minister, the Council has already provided, in regulation 380/2008, that for residence permits, children are to be fingerprinted from at least six onwards and even younger at the discretion of member states. In our case, the impact assessment seems to imply, on page 13, that up to the age of six, children's biometrics will be confined to a digitalised photograph, although the order itself allows both photographs and fingerprints to be taken from babies. Would the Minister please clarify the Government's intentions on age? Whatever age is chosen as the minimum, do they envisage that, for children, the biometrics will last throughout their lives or will they have to renew them periodically, and if so how often? Is the renewal of children&#146;s biometrics built into the estimated &#163;187.6 million present value costs of the scheme over the first 10 years given on page 14 of the impact assessment?</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000020"></a>My noble friend Mr Tom Brake got no answer in another place to his question about the calculated savings from the whole scheme of &#163;29.8 million over 10 years because the Minister, Meg Hillier, said that she had already explained that figure, when all that she had actually said was that it was &#147;based on economic evidence&#148;. It would be useful if the Minister could give us a bit more information about how this saving was calculated than the Commons managed to extract from Ms Hillier when they discussed this matter. If the Minister wishes to place the information in the Library of the House rather than going into it in detail this afternoon, that will be perfectly acceptable.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000021"></a>In the impact assessment, we are told about the enrolment pilot, to which the Minister also referred, being conducted on spouses, civil partners and students applying for extensions of their leave to remain to pressure-test the enrolment processes and technology. We noted that the time needed to take fingerprints was less than expected, and we would like to know whether it enables the UKBA to verify or to amend the paper calculation of the operational costs. What was the practice on recording the applicants' children's biometrics in the pilot, and although only a vignette was issued to the applicants, and not the card now provided for in these regulations, will the people who have been through the pilot&#151;the Minister mentioned 7,500 people&#151;now receive cards using the biometrics already obtained?</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000022"></a>Although we are not in Schengen, is it the Government&#146;s intention to comply with European decisions on the biometric visa system? If so, or if our own visa system is to impose similar requirements, will everybody entering the UK legitimately from outside the EEA area have had their biometrics taken already? Will there be arrangements to transfer the electronic images of fingerprints and facial images taken for the purposes of granting the visa in the country of origin to the UKBA so that they can be incorporated in the BID so that new biometrics do not have to be taken once the migrant reaches the United Kingdom?</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000023"></a>Finally, in Committee on the then UK Borders Bill, we suggested that an independent monitor be appointed to oversee the rollout and particularly to ensure compliance with discrimination legislation. The Information Commissioner will have the responsibility of ensuring that the personal biometric information collected from the millions of persons granted limited leave to remain is collected, stored, transferred and processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act and used only for the purposes specified by Parliament. That is a huge addition to his responsibilities. However, in view of the concerns expressed by Liberty, ILPA and others and the need to ensure that we are in step with the rest of the EU, as well as the very significant cost uncertainties arising, the appointment of an independent monitor is a necessary and prudent safeguard.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000026"></a>It is important to say that we regard the integrity and security of our border and nation extremely seriously. In general terms, what has come over from the pilot study and from all our consultation is that the people whom we have talked to, including students and spouses, have welcomed this and found it very useful. I mentioned there being 50 different forms; this is something that has utility for them.</p>

<p><a name="08071698000027"></a>On whether this covers EU nationals, no, it does not. EU nationals are completely separate. They are not part of this equation. The noble Lord made a point about this being something that would affect only BMEs and that there were real dangers of this causing major problems. These people cannot be stopped by the police and asked to present their identity card; that is not how these things work. They will use them when they do specific things, make claims for specific things and that sort of thing. There is absolutely nothing within this to say that people have to carry these things round and that the police can stop them and say, &#147;Show me your identity card&#148;. The fear that we will cause a division in society is just not real. I do not believe that that will be the case at all.</p>

It may be someone from the school or the place where the person was studying.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000033"></a>We are committed to keeping children safe. There is no doubt that by their having a clear identity we are able to keep them much safer. It is children who have no clear identity or multiple identities who are trafficked across borders. An accurate identity makes them safer.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000034"></a>As regards biometrics for young children, children aged six years and under will be required to provide only a facial image, which is similar to the requirement for those who are physically incapable of providing fingerprints. On updating biometrics as children become older, current regulations stipulate that a child&#146;s card will expire after five years at the latest. After that, another application will have to be made because dramatic changes take place when children are at that age.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000035"></a>The noble Lord asked whether those who applied under the pilot will receive a card. The answer is no. Those who apply under the pilot are issued with a vignette and we will not now send them a card. Those who apply for leave in these categories after November will be issued with a card.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08071698000037"></a>I asked my team how much the cards will cost. The best figure that I have is that it will probably cost us more than &#163;10 million overall over 10 years, the rest being covered by people buying the cards. Part of the cost is the setting-up of the scheme. Once we run on from the 10 years, it will be self-financing. That is just pure cash, but the benefits of the cards are huge. A whole raft of gains makes them worth that amount of money over that period. If that figure is not accurate, I will write to noble Lords.</p>

<h5><a name="08071699000057"></a>5.39 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08071699000004"></a><a name="80716-gc0005.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80716-gc0005.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08071699000059"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Offensive Weapons) (Amendment No. 2) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000005"></a>The noble Lord said: The Criminal Justice Act 1988 introduced an order-making power to ban the manufacture, sale and importation of specified offensive weapons. Currently, the offensive weapons order prohibits 18 weapons, including sword sticks, knuckle-dusters, disguised knives and batons. On 6 April 2008, samurai swords were banned by adding swords with a curved blade of 50 centimetres or more to the offensive weapons order to address concerns of public safety. In the parliamentary debate on this ban, which was held on 18 March 2008, I gave an undertaking to listen to representations of groups with concerns that their legitimate activities had been affected by the ban. That was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. The amendment order we are discussing today acts on that undertaking.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000006"></a>Collectors had expressed their concerns to Vernon Coaker, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Crime Reduction, that the ban had unfairly impacted on valuable curved military swords from the First and Second World Wars. He was also lobbied by makers of high-quality swords who told him that they sell handcrafted curved swords, worth &#163;1,000 to &#163;8,000, for export. The Government&#146;s intention was not to disadvantage craftsmanship, nor was it to stop the trade in swords of historical and cultural significance. The intention was to ban the cheap, readily available samurai swords used in violent crime, including murders.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000007"></a>I understand that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State met collectors and manufacturers in April 2008 and he asked officials to work with them to explore ways of protecting their legitimate use of curved swords without impacting adversely on the overall effectiveness of the ban. The amendment order we are discussing today contains some small amendments, agreeable to stakeholders, which address their concerns without impacting on the effectiveness of the ban.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000008"></a>The amendments are minor in detail but significant in effect. They focus on broadening the current defence to any curved sword made before 1954 rather than just those made in Japan, and to any curved sword made after 1954 according to traditional methods of making swords by hand&#151;again, not just those made in Japan according to traditional methods. For thoroughness we are also amending the order to allow swords for use in religious ceremonies. While we have had minimal lobbying on this point, I understand from the Department for Communities and Local Government that curved swords are an integral part of Sikh wedding ceremonies and we have no wish to hinder such activities.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000009"></a>On whether the new defences would cover swords used in folk dancing and sword dancing, I cannot offer a definitive view on whether the swords used in any one particular activity would be banned under the new legislation. Groups who think that they may be affected  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC133"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should seek advice. I should emphasise, however, that the ban applies only to swords with curved blades and not swords with straight blades which, perhaps, are more likely to be used in such dances.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000010"></a>Ministers have also been asked if there are any plans to add a specific defence for swords used in belly dancing. I found that rather surprising. I thought snakes were used in belly dancing. There are no such plans, but Section 43 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 introduced a defence for those supplying offensive weapons for TV, theatrical performances and film productions. This measure provides those companies and individuals who sell and hire offensive weapons for film, television and theatre productions with a defence from prosecution. That came into force on 6 April 2008 and I suggest that individuals contact the trade union for artists and performers, Equity, for advice on whether they would be covered by this defence. Even if the sale of swords used in folk, sword and belly dancing were banned, possession would not be affected and individuals should still be able to use their current swords in those activities, as before.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000011"></a>The changes are in line with the Government fulfilling their undertaking, provided during the parliamentary debates on the original order, to listen to representations from groups who consider that their legitimate use of swords has been unfairly impacted upon. The amendments would not weaken the ban, nor adversely impact on the intention behind the ban to target the cheaply available replica samurai swords used in violent crime. The Association of Chief Police Officers supports these amendments. As such, I commend the order to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

However, we must support the Government in seeking to apply common sense to specialised uses which would otherwise be caught by the legislation. I congratulate the Minister and his colleagues on listening to the various representations. I join my noble friend Lady Hanham in thanking him for that. There are two specialised uses on which my honourable friend James Brokenshire did not get a totally satisfactory answer. I refer to historical re-enactment groups and martial arts. Is there a defence for both of those? Otherwise, we support the order.</p>

We understood why the Government were going to introduce that provision. The fact that they have listened to the various groups and made some further exceptions is useful, but my questions relate to whether the various widening of the exceptions will mean that the defences are widened in the case of people using swords for offensive purposes. Obviously,  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC134"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in widening the group substantially, the Government are widening the supply of the weapons that are likely to be lent, given away or sold.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000015"></a>My questions relate to the Gurkha kukri knife, which has very important ceremonial qualities. Will this be exempt? Will they count the ceremonial athame for followers of hermetic magic and paganism? Freemasons traditionally carry swords as part of their regalia; I have no idea whether they are curved or not, but would they be exempt if they were? Presumably they would because they are ceremonial. But when people die, for example, those swords go to the antique or the collectors markets. What happens to them then? Is that a defence if you have bought one of them?</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000016"></a>The Minister made the point that it was a defence if the weapon was made by hand, but what is the definition of that? Can it be made in a factory and simply finished by hand? Furthermore, having mulled this over, I wonder why the provision refers to blades of 50 centimetres and over; are blades of 49 centimetres any less likely to be deadly?</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000017"></a>I associate myself with the comments of those who have said that these provisions, while worthy, merely touch the tip of the problem, including the comments from the Front Bench about knife crime and knives from the kitchen drawer. I am sure that that is something that we will debate in future.</p>

<p><a name="08071699000018"></a><a name="80716-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80716-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08071699000062"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> The noble Viscount and the noble Baroness have got to the nub of the matter. One problem is to capture all the sorts of knives that one would like, which is just so difficult. There is such an availability of knives, including kitchen knives. The noble Viscount is absolutely right that they are more often used than ceremonial weapons. But the police were particularly concerned about these copies of samurai swords which had been used for a number of violent incidents. They were not the original swords made by the Japanese, which are so expensive and are made in a traditional style; apart from anything else, you know straight away from the cost. But the police were really concerned about these imitation samurai swords, which is why we went down this route. In the past few days, noble Lords may have seen people talking on television about knife crime, and there were pictures of three youths showing off with exactly those swords. They are extremely dangerous. So this is the right thing to do, but we have to ensure that other people are not captured by the provisions.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000019"></a>Enactment societies will be protected. The Sealed Knot society will be protected, for example, and so will the Gurkha kukris. The only swords that are over that length are used largely for ceremonials, particularly when an ox is ceremonially killed, for instance.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000020"></a>I do not know the answer to the Freemason question and I shall get back to noble Lords in writing. We are not meant to know what happens in freemasonry, are we? Noble Lords clearly have knowledge about that. I do not know the answer to that question, but with traditionally made swords one can tell the difference. This provision is not aimed at them.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000021"></a>We are in a very difficult area; there are much broader issues than simply removing knives, which are behind all these proposals. We will debate all these  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC135"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issues; they have been discussed for many months, but they have come to a head in the past week or so. Many other things impact on this; it is extremely difficult to capture all of them, but we have to change how people behave and act. That is the only real way in which to end these problems. But this small step is necessary. I hope that these changes make sense and will protect people who have a valid reason for having these weapons and are not the sort of people who go out and cause problems. I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000026"></a>The noble Lord said: The Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 streamlined and modernised the United Kingdom&#146;s mutual legal assistance relations with the rest of the world when it came into force on 26 April 2004. Today, in an effort further to improve international co-operation and in order to comply with our international obligations, we are seeking to designate the United States of America under various sections of that Act.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000027"></a>One of the advantages of the new arrangements is that they will improve our ability to achieve justice for British victims of serious crime. The order reflects the fact that on 25 June 2003 an agreement on mutual legal assistance between the United States of America and the European Union was concluded. As a result of the provisions of this agreement, it was necessary for the United Kingdom to amend its bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000028"></a>The terms of the amended bilateral treaty make provision for the parties to make and execute requests for assistance in locating bank accounts and to provide banking information relating to criminal investigations. This is in similar terms to European agreements aimed at tackling serious international crime, in particular, economic crime and money laundering. The domestic powers to make and receive such requests are found in Chapter 4 of Part 1 of the Act.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000029"></a>Designation of the United States of America under Section 51(2)(b) of the Act for the purpose of Sections 32, 35, 43, 44 and 45 will allow requests for such orders to be executed in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and for such requests to be made to the United States of America by certain judicial and prosecuting authorities in the United Kingdom. Designation under Sections 35  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC136"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and 44 of the Act&#151;account monitoring orders&#151;is not required under the strict terms of the agreement. However it is felt that such designation would be sensible, especially given that the Secretary of State retains a discretion whether to issue directions under Section 35.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000030"></a>Likewise, no express provision has been made to limit the designations to terrorist and money laundering cases, as is permissible under the agreement, because the Home Secretary retains a discretion whether to issue a direction under Section 35. It would be open to the Home Secretary to refuse to make such a direction where the request was made in a non-terrorist or money laundering case. In relation to outgoing requests, there is no such discretion. It will be up to the United States to decide whether to refuse a request to it on the basis that it was outwith the treaty.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000031"></a>The amended treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States of America will provide both Governments with a sound framework for future co-operation. We are clear that we will not allow criminals to escape justice simply because the evidence required is located overseas, and we are committed to assisting our international partners in doing the same. That is what the order seeks to achieve and I commend it to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

We accept that this is a technical amendment, which is necessary in order to designate the United States of America a participating country.

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000034"></a>I have two quotes, and if the Minister feels that it is easier to reply in writing, I shall quite understand. The first is from a newspaper report:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071699000052"></a>&#147;One source at the department&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071699000047"></a>of Homeland Security in America,</p>
<ul><a name="08071699000054"></a>&#147;said that as a result of the deal, the U.S. was likely to ask for full details on everyone visiting from Europe&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071699000048"></a>The second quote is from Barry Steinhardt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071699000053"></a>&#147;The US is essentially asking the rest of the world to conform to our&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071699000049"></a>that is, the United States&#146;s&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08071699000055"></a>&#147;very limited notion of what&#146;s private&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071699000050"></a>He goes on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="08071699000056"></a>&#147;it provides for wide access of data which are supposed to be protected under EU law&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071699000051"></a>Those are emotive statements, especially in the light of the recent debates over the Lisbon treaty and of concern over what appears&#151;certainly in the eyes of the public&#151;to be the very one-sided procedure for extradition. I think that the House, and indeed the public, will be seeking reassurances on these matters, which I hope the Minister will be able to give. As I said, if that is by way of a letter, that will be perfectly acceptable to us.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000035"></a>My other question concerns the cost to the private sector of the order. I think that it has been put at between &#163;1.5 billion and &#163;2.5 billion over the next 10 years. I shall be grateful if the Minister can give us further information on that.</p>

<p><a name="08071699000036"></a><a name="80716-gc0005.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80716-gc0005.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08071699000067"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> I think that the Committee is somewhat scarred by the experience of the very unilateral nature of the extradition agreement with the United States. There is certainly still a perception that the US is not a very equal partner in bilateral treaties, in that it takes what it wants but gives very little or nothing in return. It was in that vein that in a debate on 6 December 2007 the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, described a bilateral assistance deal with the US as unilateral. In that spirit, I have several questions for the Minister. What are the rights of access to data held or the rights of correction and deletion? Are they included? Are the rights expressly guaranteed by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the EU data protection directive?</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000037"></a>At the time the EU&#146;s agreement was made, Statewatch concluded that there were no effective data protection provisions worth speaking of and that there was nothing to ensure that the considerable body of EU data protection legislation was respected. What right of access is available for people to find out what data about them have been shared and stored, and what guarantees are in place to ensure the proper protection of those data? How many parties are they shared with once they arrive in the United States, and does the deal include any protocol for the deletion of data supplied to the US authorities at any time in the future, or are they simply kept indefinitely?</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000038"></a>The Minister mentioned that the Secretary of State would have within his discretion the power to refuse a request. Can he give any examples of when he would be likely to refuse such a request? The Minister said on 6 December, in the debate to which I referred, that it is very unusual that this matter has come to light and that it is something that we cannot talk about in detail because it involves criminal action. He then went on to talk about the volume of requests, which I think was 5,000 to the UK each year. I wonder what volume of requests we make to the United States. What is the balance of requests made and received? Can he give any idea of the balance of requests that are likely to be granted?</p>

The noble Viscount is right that this is a technical amendment. It is much more constrained than the noble Baroness thinks. It is important to remember that once this designation order comes into force&#151;there are a number of countries in Europe where it will also be coming into force&#151;it will allow  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC138"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column GC138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>orders to be sought only where they relate to a person who is the subject of a US investigation into a criminal offence. It will not cover every citizen coming to the UK. It is much more constrained. The information we are talking about is very precise: a bank account number and details or the name of the person holding that bank account. The order covers a specific area that is being looked at.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000040"></a>The large amounts of data being asked for do not relate to this order as it is not in force as yet. We do not think there will be that many requests under this order, but we think it is right because once they have signed it off, we will have an agreement covering every country in the EU. The EU and the US have now signed up, so clearly we need to be part of that. We think the order makes sense because if we are conducting a criminal investigation against a person, it is important to be able to get information about his bank account, if it is held somewhere else.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000041"></a>This order is much more restricted than the noble Baroness thinks. I know her concern about the amount of data that can be pulled out and used. This order is much more technical and specific. Her fears and concerns are unfounded in this case. They often are in the other cases, but in this case they certainly are, because the order is much more focused.</p>

<a name="80716-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08071699000042"></a>The noble Baroness asked if I could think of an example of requests that the Secretary of State could refuse. I find it difficult to think of an example because the order is so narrow. It would be strange if a request for data about some details about the bank accounts of someone being investigated was refused. I cannot easily think of a specific case where that would occur. However, it is right that the protection is there just in case there is an occasion to stop the sort of thing that the noble Baroness has fears about. If I have not answered all the questions that were asked, I will get back in writing on them when I have looked at <I>Hansard</I>.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="080716102000016"></a><a name="80716-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80716-wms0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080716102000146"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="080716102000017"></a>My department, in conjunction with the Home Office, has today begun a consultation on aspects of the Transport Security Bill designed to deliver more effective policing and security planning arrangements at airports.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="080716102000018"></a>The consultation sets out a new security planning process that:</p>
requires the majority of airports in the UK to agree a local airport security plan with their key stakeholders, based upon an agreed threat and risk analysis; andallows any policing element of this plan to be charged to the airport operator.
<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="080716102000019"></a>As a consequence, the activities of the police, aviation industry and control authorities will be better co-ordinated to enhance and strengthen security planning. The process of security planning will provide a greater level of understanding to all security stakeholders at an airport as to why they are carrying out certain functions and what resources are required. It is also important that we create a level playing field whereby all airport operators pay for any dedicated police presence required at their airports.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="080716102000020"></a>Given the importance of strong policing and security planning in the current climate, we are using the opportunity of introducing a Transport Security Bill into Parliament next Session to deliver these objectives as well as including provisions to combat terrorist acts at sea.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="080716102000021"></a>It is important to note that airports already provide a secure environment for the travelling public and industry staff. We now want to ensure that security is addressed at individual airports in a structured way, and that the role of the police in preventing criminal activity is clearly determined.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="080716102000022"></a>Today&#146;s proposals have developed from the findings of the independent review of airport policing that was presented to the Home Secretary and Secretary of State for Transport in July 2006. The Department for Transport and Home Office, working jointly, have developed the measures in close consultation with senior representatives from industry and the police.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="080716102000024"></a><a name="80716-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80716-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="080716102000147"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Baroness Morgan of Drefelin):</b> Today, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls) and I publish the draft Apprenticeships Bill.  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS66"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column WS66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>In January 2008, World Class Apprenticeships set out plans for achieving our aspirations for the apprenticeships programme. This draft Bill sets out the legislative framework needed to underpin our strategy to increase the number of apprenticeship places and strengthen apprenticeships in England.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="080716102000025"></a>Our ambition is that apprenticeships are seen as a key route to the best jobs, the best careers and the best chance to get on in life. Apprenticeships are at the heart of our strategy to raise the age of participation in education or training for all young people, with high quality vocational training clearly recognised as a mainstream route for young people. Apprenticeships will also help build a workforce fit for the future by providing better and more relevant skills to enable us to compete in the global economy.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="080716102000026"></a>Since 1997, we have substantially increased investment in apprenticeships, and the number of starts has increased from 65,000 in 1996-97 to 180,000 in 2006-07. This increase has been accompanied by a steady improvement in the number of people completing apprenticeships, from 40,000 in 2001-02 to 112,000 in 2006-07.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="080716102000027"></a>We want to build on this success. We want a significant increase in the number of places so that by 2013 we can ensure that there is an apprenticeship place for every suitably qualified young person who wants one. We want to strengthen the programme so that we can ensure that all apprenticeships are of a uniformly high quality.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="080716102000028"></a>Following pre-legislative scrutiny and the consultation we are launching today, the provisions in the draft Bill will form part of the Education and Skills Bill we will introduce in the next Session.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="080716102000029"></a>Copies of the draft Apprenticeships Bill will be made available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper office.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="080716102000030"></a><a name="80716-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80716-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="080716102000148"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Derek Twigg) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="080716102000031"></a>Ministers have now approved the redevelopment of Whittington Barracks, Lichfield, for use by the Defence Medical Services (DMS) and I am today announcing the next steps. </p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="080716102000032"></a>The assessment phase of the Midlands medical accommodation project has been completed.  We have concluded that the strategic, operational, economic and personnel benefits of the project will fully justify an investment of around &#163;200 million over the next few years. </p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="080716102000033"></a>Co-location on the Whittington site of the DMS headquarters and the Defence Medical Services Training Centre (DMSTC, currently based near Aldershot) will give us a critical mass of military medical expertise and assets in the Midlands.  The area will be reinforced as the central focus for British military medicine, and Lichfield will provide the future military home for the DMS.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS67"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column WS67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="080716102000034"></a>Our project assessment confirmed that the Whittington site offers excellent potential for meeting DMS needs.  A combination of new build and upgrading of existing buildings will provide ample high-quality, fit-for-purpose accommodation, training and sports facilities, within easy travelling distance of central Birmingham and the RCDM elements that will remain there.  The Whittington site also offers an adjacent military training area.  Full planning approval for the redevelopment of the site has already been granted.    </p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="080716102000035"></a>The project will be delivered in three increments:</p>
 an HQ office building;  new and refurbished training accommodation; combined officers&#146; and senior NCOs&#146; mess; junior ranks&#146; dining room; training centre; and lecture theatre; and delivery of 811 single living accommodation bed spaces. 
<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="080716102000036"></a>Increment one will involve the relocation to Lichfield of key management elements of the DMS, whose top structure is currently being reorganised as part of the DMS top structures next steps programme.      </p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="080716102000037"></a>Development of a new strategic medical HQ and the HQ for the recently established Joint Medical Command (JMC) is now in progress.  We are planning to locate these HQs at Lichfield by 1 April 2010 (although a small number of strategic medical HQ staff will remain in London).  The HQ of the JMC will comprise staffs currently based at Fort Blockhouse, Gosport, who were formerly part of the Defence Medical Education and Training Agency; Defence Dental Services HQ staffs from RAF Halton, Buckinghamshire; the Defence Healthcare Directorate from central London; and elements of the RCDM HQ from Birmingham.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="080716102000038"></a>We shall place a contract later this year for the construction at Whittington of a purpose-built office block and associated site infrastructure works.  We shall announce further details when this contract is placed.  By early 2010 we expect that the site will be supporting over 300 military and civilian personnel in total.  Almost 200 of these will be military and civilian posts transferred from central London, Gosport and Halton.  Some posts will also be relocated from the RCDM HQ in central Birmingham.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="080716102000039"></a>Increments two and three will see the relocation of the DMSTC from Keogh Barracks, Aldershot, to Lichfield, and the provision of training facilities and living accommodation for over 800 staff and trainees.  Existing facilities need to be replaced with accommodation that is fit for the 21st century. </p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="080716102000040"></a>The move of DMSTC will be completed between 2012 and 2014.  The precise date will be decided in due course.  By the end of the project there will be over 1,100 Defence Medical Services personnel at Lichfield, including up to 700 trainees, as well as over 100 personnel attached to lodger units that we expect to remain on the site.    </p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="080716102000041"></a>There will be full consultation with the trades unions as the work on the new organisations and their co-location at Lichfield proceeds.  </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="080716102000042"></a>The new jobs that this project will bring to the Midlands over the next few years will also help to fulfil our policy objective of moving jobs out of the greater south-east.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="080716102000043"></a>The decisions announced today about military medical accommodation in the Midlands are further evidence of the Government&#146;s commitment to the healthcare of service personnel.  I shall keep the House informed of progress with this important project.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="080716102000044"></a><a name="80716-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><b><a name="80716-wms0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="080716102000149"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> My honourable friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Bridget Prentice), has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="080716102000045"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence and I wish to make the following Statement to the House about the inquests of service personnel who have died overseas.  All fatalities suffered by our Armed Forces continue to be a source of profound regret.  Our sympathies are with their families.  It is particularly regrettable that this Statement comes at a time when in recent weeks we have experienced an unusually high rate of fatalities in Afghanistan.  Our service personnel risk their lives in helping to build strong, stable and democratic nations, and to protect the interests of the United Kingdom.  We cannot pay high enough tribute to the job that they do, or to the ultimate sacrifice which some of them have made.  We are, as ever, strongly committed to minimising the effect on their families and loved ones.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="080716102000046"></a>Today, we are announcing the progress that has been made since the Written Ministerial Statement on 30 April 2008 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 12WS) with information about the conduct of inquests by the Oxfordshire, Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners. This Statement gives the position at 8 July.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="080716102000047"></a>For the first time, the tables which accompany this Statement include information about those ongoing cases in which there has been a board of inquiry (BoI) report.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="080716102000048"></a>The purpose of a BoI is to examine the circumstances surrounding an incident resulting in death or serious injury, to learn lessons and to make recommendations to the chain of command for the improvement of working practices, procedures or equipment, which could help to reduce the likelihood of a similar incident happening again.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="080716102000049"></a>In some cases, the initial review of an incident will highlight any lessons to be learned or actions that could be taken to prevent a similar incident happening again.  Dispensation from holding a BoI may be given if there are no further lessons to be learned.  This is often the case for incidents occurring on operations. </p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="080716102000050"></a>Ministers and the military chain of command attach considerable importance to the timely completion of BoIs but the overriding requirement is that a thorough investigation identifies the right lessons. It should also be noted that a BoI (and the coroner&#146;s inquest) cannot conclude until the completion of any police investigations. The coroner&#146;s inquest may take place before completion of a BoI although this rarely happens in practice.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="080716102000052"></a>At the time of the last Statement, we reported that since additional funding had been provided by the Government to assist the Oxfordshire coroner, 155 inquests had been held: 141 into the overseas deaths of service personnel and 14 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="080716102000053"></a>Since April, a further 25 inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel who died in operations overseas whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham.  This makes a total of 180 inquests held since June 2006. </p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="080716102000054"></a>Since operations commenced there have been a total of 201 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including one serviceman who died in the UK of his injuries.  In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="080716102000057"></a>The Statement in April reported that there were 27 inquests to be held into the deaths of service personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton prior to 31 March 2007.  As at 8 July, there are nine such inquests.  The Oxfordshire coroner has retained jurisdiction in six of these cases; three have been transferred to coroners closer to the deceased&#146;s next of kin. Hearing dates have been set in four cases.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="080716102000058"></a>The oldest individual inquest for which no date has yet been set is that into the death of Private Reeves who was killed on 9 August 2006.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="080716102000059"></a>In addition there are 10 inquests for the crew members who died together in the crash of Hercules XV179 on 30 January 2005.  These inquests resumed on 31 March 2008 and were adjourned until 30 September. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="080716102000061"></a>Since October 2007, additional resources have been provided by the Government to ensure that a backlog of inquests will not build up in the Wiltshire and Swindon jurisdiction, now that fatalities are being repatriated via RAF Lyneham.  The coroner, Mr Masters, is continuing the practice of transferring military inquests to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="080716102000062"></a>There are 57 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel who died in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated after 1 April 2007.  Of these, Mr Masters has retained 34 inquests, whilst 23 inquests are being conducted by coroners closer to the next of kin.  Inquest hearing dates have been set in 12 of these cases.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="080716102000068"></a>It is of the greatest importance that the next of kin have full information about the progress of the inquest of their deceased.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="080716102000069"></a>We remain committed to providing better support to bereaved military families.  The Written Ministerial Statement issued on 7 June 2007 by my right honourable friend the then Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Adam Ingram), gave details of the support which was then being provided.  Since then, we have increased the number of family members who can travel and stay overnight if necessary, at public expense, to attend the repatriation ceremony; and two family members may attend any pre-inquest hearings, as well as the inquest itself, again at public expense.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="080716102000070"></a>Visiting officers are crucial in providing the liaison between families and the services, and we continue to give close attention to their selection and training. </p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="080716102000071"></a>On 1 June, the Ministry of Defence established the Defence Inquests Unit.  This unit acts as the focal point for all coroners&#146; inquests into the deaths of service and Ministry of Defence civilian personnel who die on, or as a result of injuries sustained while on, operations and those who die as a result of training activity. The unit&#146;s key role is to assist coroners so that they can complete inquests satisfactorily and as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="080716102000072"></a>The unit&#146;s main function is to establish early contact with the coroner for each inquest, and to ensure that they are provided with all relevant paperwork, including reports from the Special Investigation Branch and Board of Inquiry (if convened). The unit will also help advise on subject matter experts for inquests. While the relevant service will, rightly, remain the focal point for liaising with the bereaved families, the unit will work closely with the services to ensure that there is a consistent approach, particularly in terms of providing information to families, coroners and welfare officers.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="080716102000074"></a>The House will wish to know that Sir Ian Magee's independent review of criminality information is being published today.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="080716102000075"></a>I am grateful to Sir Ian for his work on the review. He has presented us with a substantial report with wide ranging implications for all organisations which collect information that may be relevant to the prevention, investigation, prosecution, or penalising of crime. This is a complex area and there are no quick fixes. Sir Ian's package of recommendations will require sustained

I will therefore be consulting widely and I intend to publish a full, government-wide action plan in the autumn.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="080716102000076"></a>The Government are keen to develop work quickly across a range of Sir Ian's recommendations and my department will continue to take the lead in driving this work forward as part of our primary focus on public protection. We intend now to proceed with the following.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80716-wms0002.htm"/>


<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="080716102000077"></a>First, we will continue with the complex and difficult work which the Home Office has been leading to enhance the information we have about the criminal histories of foreign nationals and UK citizens who have spent time abroad. We will do this both by making better use of existing information channels and by leading a process of improvement within Europe and more widely. This work will significantly improve the way we protect the public by ensuring relevant overseas data are available to inform the criminal justice process and key systems such as those used to vet and bar people seeking to work with children and vulnerable adults.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="080716102000078"></a>Secondly, we will build on, extend and strengthen existing streams of work, such as the programme the Home Office has led to implement the recommendations from the Bichard inquiry, to develop a clear strategic direction for the improvement of criminality information management across what Sir Ian is calling the public protection network. That will provide the framework for positive changes to sharing of criminality information, training for leaders and frontline staff and the ways in which we identify and respond to information-related risks.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="080716102000079"></a>Thirdly, the Home Office will be involved in an in-depth review of the way technology supports information flows between public protection organisations, drawing on the expertise of other departments and key organisations such as the National Policing Improvement Agency. A huge programme of work is already under way to strengthen information handling within policing and the broader criminal justice system, but we recognise the need to join up even more and sharpen the focus on public protection. There is also significant potential to save taxpayers' money through the re-use of existing technology and through reducing the amount of duplicate data held by various organisations.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="080716102000080"></a>Fourthly, Sir Ian has conducted some detailed work in specific areas of public protection and made recommendations that directly affect front line operations. We intend to implement these recommendations. Their focus is improving the way information is captured, stored and accessed, shared, analysed and acted upon, and managed. Full implementation of these recommendations will improve the quality of criminality information available to frontline staff who are making very difficult decisions on a day-to-day basis. In all these areas we will be building on the foundations of positive work which is already under way between the Home Office and its partners within the public protection network. For example, I anticipate we can:</p>
work with the UK Border Agency to improve the use of criminality information to assist in deporting people in a timely and fair way; and

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="080716102000081"></a>Working together to protect the public is the fundamental statement of purpose for the Home Office. I want that to be the guiding principle for our policies to cut crime, provide effective policing, secure our borders and protect personal identity. The effective use and sharing of criminality information is critical to the successful delivery of those policies and Sir Ian's report provides us with the framework within which that can be achieved.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="080716102000084"></a>On 10 October 2006 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 13-14WS) my predecessor announced the formation of Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) and that elements of the new organisation were to be collocated in the Bath/Bristol area. DE&amp;S was established on 1 April 2007 and in March this year a major business improvement programme, PACE (performance, agility, confidence, efficiency), was launched to drive forward the changes required to continue to improve support to the Armed Forces both now and in the future.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="080716102000085"></a>As part of this we have concluded that additional improvements to the provision of through-life military capability and logistics support to the front line can be realised through greater consolidation of DE&amp;S business activities in Bristol.  I am therefore announcing today, subject to consultation with the trades unions, the co-location of further elements of DE&amp;S at Abbey Wood in Bristol.  This will involve DE&amp;S withdrawing in its entirety from Andover, Wyton, Caversfield and from both the Ensleigh and Foxhill sites in Bath, in a phased programme through to 2012.  Those sites vacated by DE&amp;S are being considered for further defence use.  Under the DE&amp;S programme, around 2,800 posts will move to Bristol, in addition to the 1,000 transfers already in hand.  It will produce estimated savings of around &#163;560 million over a 25 year period, is a key enabler for the PACE programme and is also part of a wider departmental estates rationalisation programme, reflecting the department&#146;s commitment to maximising the funds available to support the front line.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="080716102000087"></a>Today the Government have published the <I>End of Life Care Strategy</I>. This is the first time this country will have a long-term, comprehensive strategy for the care of adults at the end of their life. The strategy

Its aim is to deliver increased choice to all adult patients, regardless of their condition, about where they live and die and to improve care given in all settings, to patients, carers and families.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="080716102000088"></a>The strategy sets out how the manifesto commitment to double investment in palliative care will be met and how choice at the end of life will be improved.

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="080716102000091"></a>I am today launching a document entitled <I>Facing the Housing Challenge: Action Today, Innovation for Tomorrow. </I>A copy will be placed in the Library.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="080716102000092"></a>We know that the vast majority of people aspire to home ownership. This is more than an economic calculation&#151;it represents their hopes and dreams for their families. Across government, we value and support these aspirations. And we are absolutely committed to making sure that everyone can find the housing that meets their needs.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a><a name="080716102000093"></a>So this time last year, we published a housing Green Paper, setting out our plans for the biggest house-building programme in decades. It set out our long-term plans to meet the housing needs of our aging, growing population, with a major increase in supply to address increasing demand, helping those families and first-time buyers priced out of the property market.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="080716102000094"></a>More recently, however, the international housing market has experienced significant challenges as a result of turbulence in the global financial markets. People are finding it harder to get a mortgage; we have seen falls in house prices and house-builders are now experiencing difficult business conditions after years of extremely favourable circumstances.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a><a name="080716102000095"></a>But the long-term demographic trends remain the same. And without action now, we risk frustrating many more potential first-time buyers and growing families in the future. Our target to achieve a rate of 240,000 new homes per year by 2016 was set to address these long-term trends and we remain absolutely committed to increasing supply to this level to respond to this long-term demand.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="080716102000096"></a>The signs are that current market conditions will lead to a fall in housing completions this year, which makes our targets of 2 million homes by 2016 and 3 million by 2020 challenging, particularly if the current conditions are protracted.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS74"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column WS74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a><a name="080716102000097"></a>However, the development industry has shown before it is capable of responding and delivering substantial increases in new homes over a short period&#151;from around 130,000 net additions in 2001-02 to approaching 200,000 in 2006-07. We therefore remain committed to our overall target of 3 million homes by 2020 as the right long-term goal, whilst recognising the scale of the challenge this entails.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a><a name="080716102000098"></a>We need now to retain our focus on stimulating market conditions, seeking new ways to deliver the housing this country urgently needs and ensuring there is a planning framework that will support a rapid market recovery.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"></a><a name="080716102000099"></a>So we are publishing this document to set out our next steps in this housing delivery programme, helping to strike the right balance in responding to both current conditions and long-term challenges.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="080716102000100"></a>We invest around &#163;6 billion per year in housing and regeneration programmes. Our priorities for these resources are to:</p>
provide greater help for first-time buyers;help existing homeowners facing difficulties due to problems in the international financial markets;keep housing supply, particularly affordable housing supply, as high as possible during the current difficulties, in order to keep on track to meet our targets; andmaintain capacity and create the right conditions for recovery and longer-term growth.
<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a><a name="080716102000101"></a>We are therefore setting out a package of measures in this document to achieve these objectives. These include:</p>
the pilot of a &#147;rent to homebuy&#148; scheme, led by the Housing Corporation, which will aim to help prospective buyers who are unable to take advantage of current shared ownership schemes, perhaps because they cannot find a suitable mortgage. The scheme will enable eligible households to rent a new-build property, at less than market rates, for a pre-specified period, with the option to buy a share in the home at the end of that time; plans from the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, Newcastle City Council, Nottingham City Council and Manchester City Council to launch the first pilot local housing companies. These have the potential to deliver up to 10,000 new homes. They represent a new model of working which combines local authority land assets with private sector investment, enhancing delivery of new homes and communities. This represents just one of the ways that local authorities will play a central role in delivering the housing the country needs; confirmation that more funding, beyond the &#163;200 million already allocated from the affordable housing budget, could be made available to purchase high quality unsold stock, in the right locations, for the right price. This would help deliver our demanding affordable housing targets, while also supporting housebuilders;proposals to support delivery of up to 75,000 homes in 20 more towns and cities in the next stage of the growth points programme. These will combine increased housing with new jobs, town centre

We will invest &#163;100 million in helping these areas to realise their ambitions for sustainable growth. Further details of the new growth points can be found in the Partnership for Growth document, being published today, which will be placed in the Library;provisional allocations of the &#163;510 million housing and planning delivery grant, to support those local authorities that are taking action to meet housing needs, and reward those that are preparing plans and identifying land supply for delivery. We will keep this under review for the next three years to ensure that it remains an effective incentive for delivery. We will also develop proposals for specific incentives to deliver affordable housing from 2010-11. Further details are set out in <I>Housing and Planning Delivery Grant: Allocation Mechanism and Summary of Consultation Responses</I>. A copy will be placed in the Library, along with the schedule of provisional allocations; a commitment to working with our stakeholders to explore the viability and practicality of mortgage rescue schemes, building on the example of local authorities and housing associations which already offer such schemes; new consumer advice and information for those concerned about mortgage repayments from the National Housing Advice Service; andthe appointment of Baroness Margaret Ford to work for Partnerships UK in identifying and releasing surplus public sector land for housing delivery, particularly land owned by central government departments and their agencies.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a><a name="080716102000102"></a>Alongside this document, I am publishing an open letter which sets out our response to the Callcutt review of housing supply. We have accepted a number of the recommendations from John Callcutt. These include the creation of a zero-carbon unit to co-ordinate and guide the programme of work to deliver zero-carbon housing from 2016, and further work to develop skills within the house-building industry.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a><a name="080716102000103"></a>I am also publishing a summary of the Pomeroy review of private-sector shared equity. Brian Pomeroy was tasked with examining how the private-sector shared-equity market is developing and what the private and public sector might do to facilitate its development. The review found that there were no major institutional barriers which were preventing a shared equity market from developing and there remains an interest in developing suitable shared equity products when conditions improve. The full text has not been published as it contains confidential information, but the summary sets out the main findings. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a><a name="080716102000104"></a>Finally, effective regional and local planning for the medium and long term is essential if we are to reach the target of 240 000 homes per year from 2016. We will now work with regional partners on a flexible basis to agree the work programmes and timetables with each regional planning body. The National Housing and Planning Advice Unit recently provided the Government with advice on the numbers it felt should be considered in regional strategy reviews. I am today

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a><a name="080716102000106"></a>However, it is not the end of the process. We will review progress and reflect on new approaches, incentives or support mechanisms which will both help address the current difficulties and deliver our longer-term programme. And we will take a proactive approach wherever it is clear that we can do more to support consumers and industry.</p>

I am grateful for the invaluable and thorough work that Richard Thomas, the Information Commissioner, and Dr Mark Walport, of the Wellcome Trust, have done in this complex area.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a><a name="080716102000111"></a>In October 2007, the Prime Minister invited Richard Thomas and Dr Mark Walport to undertake an independent review of the framework for the use of personal information&#151;in both the private and public sector.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a><a name="080716102000112"></a>The objectives of the review were to consider whether there should be any changes to the way the Data Protection Act 1998 operates in the UK and explore options for implementing any possible changes. The review also made recommendations on the powers and sanctions available to the regulator and courts in the legislation governing data sharing and data protection, as well as how the Government should develop data sharing policy in a way that ensures proper transparency, scrutiny and accountability.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a><a name="080716102000118"></a>I am, with my right honourable friend the Minister of State, Department for Children Schools and Families (Beverley Hughes), announcing the national targets for reducing adult and youth reoffending. Our new challenging targets will help drive a focus across government on those offenders who commit the highest number of offences and cause the most damage to communities.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"></a><a name="080716102000119"></a>The new national targets are:</p>
to reduce the adult reoffending rate by 10 per cent between 2005 and 2011; and to reduce the youth reoffending rate by 10 per cent between 2005 and 2011.
<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a><a name="080716102000120"></a>(The reoffending rate is defined as the number of reoffences per 100 offenders (frequency)).</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a><a name="080716102000121"></a>These targets demonstrate the Government&#146;s continuing commitment to tackling reoffending. For adult offenders, this commitment has seen a 7.4 per cent reduction in the number of reoffenders compared to a predicted rate, and an 11.4 per cent fall in the frequency rate of reoffending between 2000 and 2005. For juvenile reoffenders, while the number of reoffenders has remained stable, we have seen a 17.4 per cent fall in the frequency rate of reoffending between 2000 and 2005.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a><a name="080716102000122"></a>These targets underpin an indicator in the <I>Make Communities Safer</I> public service agreement, published last year, which set out how we will work to reduce adult and youth reoffending and reduce crime.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_96"></a><a name="080716102000123"></a>The new targets will continue to focus partners across government and beyond to work together to reduce reoffending.

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_99"></a><a name="080716102000127"></a>Roads are vital to our way of life, connecting people with jobs, schools, shops, family and friends. We must ensure that road users have reliable journeys on safe, well-managed roads. So today I am publishing the Command Paper <I>Roads</I><I>&#151;</I><I>Delivering Choice and Reliability</I> which sets out how we aim to get the best out of the road network.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_100"></a><a name="080716102000128"></a>The greatest barrier to reliable journeys is congestion. It is frustrating for motorists and has serious consequences for the economy and the environment. So we are taking a number of important steps to tackle it, focusing our efforts over the next decade on where congestion is worst&#151;on our urban roads and motorways.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"></a><a name="080716102000129"></a>I am today announcing that &#163;6 billion is available to fund improvements to national strategic roads in England in the period up to 2014. These improvements could include an innovative mix of road widening, opening up the hard shoulder, and junction improvements. In the Command Paper I set out which national schemes are being considered for this funding, which is in addition to that for strategic regional roads provided through the regional funding allocation process.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_102"></a><a name="080716102000130"></a>While some road building is needed to provide extra capacity, we must also consider how to add capacity to existing roads. That is why I am exploring where the hard shoulder could be used to provide extra space on the motorway network. Where we add new capacity either by using the hard shoulder, or by widening roads, I am particularly interested to see what role tolled or car-share lanes could play to give motorists a more reliable journey. Further work will be done on this in the coming months.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_103"></a><a name="080716102000131"></a>I am also today publishing cost estimates for the Highways Agency major roads programme. Since the Nichols review last year, the Highways Agency has made some important changes to its management of the roads programme. These changes are outlined in the Command Paper. The revised cost estimates for regional schemes will help the regions plan their programmes more effectively over the coming regional funding allocation period. I am placing a copy of the estimates in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_104"></a><a name="080716102000132"></a>The majority of congestion is in our towns and cities so we have allocated an extra &#163;200 million per year from the transport innovation fund to help local authorities manage congestion in innovative ways. I am announcing today that further pump-priming funding will go to Cambridgeshire, Reading and Leeds to help them take forward their ideas. I have also previously

My department will today tell all those companies that formally expressed an interest in participating in the project the names of the successful bidders. The trials are due to start in the autumn.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_105"></a><a name="080716102000133"></a>I am also today announcing that eight of the 10 largest urban areas in England, that all have congestion targets, will receive the first tranche of the performance-related payments from the urban congestion performance fund. The fund is worth &#163;60 million over four years and, based on their 2006-07 target performance data, &#163;6 million will be shared between Bristol, Greater Manchester, Leicester, London, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear and the West Midlands. All 10 areas will be eligible for further funding based on future years' performance data. This funding, along with an additional &#163;8 million I am announcing today to help local authorities manage their transport assets more effectively, on top of &#163;15 million already announced in January, is all in addition to the amounts provided through the regional funding allocation process.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_107"></a><a name="080716102000136"></a>In recent months my department has received representations from the Lotteries Council and the Hospice Lotteries Association, seeking changes to the regulatory regime for non-commercial society lotteries established by Section 99 of the Gambling Act 2005 (&#147;the Act&#148;). Societies under the Act are typically national and local charities, sporting and social clubs that run lottery draws in order to raise funds for local good causes such as hospices or air ambulances. Societies which operate lotteries that raise more than &#163;20,000 in a single draw or over &#163;250,000 in a year must be licensed by the Gambling Commission.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a><a name="080716102000137"></a>The aim of the representations I have received has been to persuade the Government to increase the present limit on the maximum proceeds which are permitted to be raised by society lotteries in a single draw, from the present limit of &#163;2 million. This would also allow a larger top prize to be offered, since the Act provides that a person buying a society lottery ticket cannot win more than 10 per cent of the overall proceeds of the draw.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a><a name="080716102000138"></a>These representations have been echoed in Parliament. Through signing Early Day Motion 1570 tabled by the honourable Member for Bolton North East (Mr David Crausby) in May this year, 70 honourable Members  


<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS80"></a><b>16 July 2008 : Column WS80</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on all sides have expressed support for an increase in proceeds limits under the Act, specifically in relation to hospice lotteries.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_110"></a><a name="080716102000139"></a>While very few societies currently reach the present limits, some have argued that the limits hold them back, for example by preventing a number of societies coming together to promote a larger one-off annual draw.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_111"></a><a name="080716102000140"></a>The Government have always been willing to consider representations made on behalf of the good causes which benefit from society lotteries, as we showed when we doubled the then society lottery limits in 2002. The 2005 Act also introduced a range of deregulatory measures designed to assist society lotteries. I have considered the arguments now put by the Lotteries Council and Hospice Lotteries Council, as well as the views of honourable Members. I have also taken into account the view of the Gambling Commission, which, as the Government&#146;s principal adviser on gambling matters, has also recommended an increase.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_112"></a><a name="080716102000141"></a>I have had to balance these arguments for increasing the amount which society lotteries can raise for projects with my responsibility for ensuring that the licensing objectives of the Gambling Act are observed. There is a significant risk that increasing the limit on proceeds of lottery draws, and hence the top prize available, by too great an amount could significantly change the character of a society lottery by appealing to players for whom winning such a prize would be a greater attraction than supporting the charitable cause in question. Very high prizes also bring with them an increased risk of fraud and other criminal activity.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_113"></a><a name="080716102000142"></a>Having weighed these considerations, I have concluded that there is a reasonable justification for a limited increase in the maximum proceeds that society lotteries may raise in a single lottery draw. I am now able to inform the House how the Government intend to proceed.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_114"></a><a name="080716102000143"></a>I will tomorrow publish a three-month consultation paper on a proposal to increase to &#163;4 million the maximum proceeds for each individual society lottery draw. This will entail a top prize of up to &#163;400,000 for each draw. There will be no increase to the annual maximum proceeds per society lottery of &#163;10 million since no society lotteries presently reach that limit. The maximum &#163;25,000 prize for society lotteries whose proceeds are below &#163;250,000 will also remain unaltered.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_115"></a><a name="080716102000144"></a>If in the light of public consultation we decide to proceed, either with this proposal or another that suggests itself in the light of responses to the consultation, we will bring forward the necessary order. This will be for Parliament to approve by means of an affirmative resolution, requiring a debate and potentially a vote in both Houses.</p>

<a name="80716-wms0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_116"></a><a name="080716102000145"></a>This measure would benefit around 630 societies which are presently licensed by the Gambling Commission to operate society lotteries. I believe that it would provide a valuable boost to hospices, charities and other good causes which raise funds through lottery draws, whilst retaining the character of society lotteries and remaining wholly consistent with the licensing objectives of the Act.</p>

The UN committees that consider petitions are not courts, and they cannot award damages, or produce a legal ruling on the meaning of the law. In 2004, we acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. One of our reasons for doing so was to enable us to consider, on a more empirical basis, the merits of the right of individual petition. We are currently reviewing the United Kingdom&#146;s experience under the optional protocol.</p>
