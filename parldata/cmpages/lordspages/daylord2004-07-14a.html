<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Quirk </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What implications for their higher education policy are presented by the Bologna process to create a European higher education area.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  My Lords, we welcome the increased potential for mobility, of both students and researchers, afforded by creating a European higher education area. The structure and international merit of the UK&#039;s higher   education system is already reflected in the Bachelors/Masters/PhD cycle envisaged by Bologna. We are actively involved in influencing the debate. Key action   areas currently include developing the diploma supplement and contributions to discussions on qualifications frameworks and quality assurance systems.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Quirk: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. Clearly, with events such as the Edinburgh seminar a couple of weeks ago, the Glasgow summit next May and the ministerial plenary session just after, not to mention the plans for a European research council, the pace is growing, as are the costs. She referred to the diploma supplement. Will the Government help universities with the additional costs to which they have already signed us up, such as the issue of a diploma supplement from next year?
</p>

<a name="40714-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>More broadly, I wonder about the possibility of a culture clash between a British focus on outcomes and a continental fixation with inputs such as time of study. Now that 25 of the 40 Bologna countries are part of the EU, will the Government resist any <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1240"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1240</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

pressures under which they may come from the European Commission towards a harmonisation that could interfere with the flexibilities of the UK system, such as our one-year Masters degree and quality control provisions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, a focus on outcomes is absolutely critical. There is no conflict on the one-year Masters degree, which is something of which we are very proud. We continue to work with it, and there is no conflict with Bologna. There are no plans for a research council at present; the DTI is consulting on the subject, but no proposals have been put on the table. The diploma supplement is very much about additional information for students, which is important. We are talking to the universities, but I cannot make any commitments on funding. In general, it is to be welcomed that Bologna offers real opportunities for mobility.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, I invite the Minister to comment on the statement made by the president of Universities UK last night that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;The UK Government, and most universities it must be said, have largely stood aside from the Bologna Process&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>so far. Do the Government now plan to have a much more serious and sustained engagement in the negotiations as they warm up?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I was sorry to miss the speech of the president of UUK last night, but I have a copy. We have not stood aside. Our contribution in Bologna, Berlin and Bergen next year will be critical. We are very committed to the process, working closely with UUK to ensure that we provide the energy and support that it needs.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   My Lords, I do not recall the Minister answering the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord   Quirk, on whether the Government would strive to ensure that awards were based on outcomes rather than processes. Does she see scope within the framework of Bologna for recognition of an award such as a foundation degree, a distinct form of degree that serves to give standing to vocational awards throughout Europe?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I said that there would be a focus on outcomes; I am sorry if the noble Lord did not hear me. The foundation degree is important, and we are the only country currently offering it. There is no conflict with Bologna, and we wish to see the foundation degree recognised fully for its contribution to lifelong learning.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Harrison: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend recognise that the one-year MA courses in this country are important for encouraging overseas students to take advantage of the British university system, and that it would be a mistake if we moved to the two-year MA system of some of our continental colleagues?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, we believe that our one-year Masters system is strong and rigorous <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1241"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1241</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and is highly valued by international students. We would not wish to see a two-year requirement for a European Masters degree as that would leave us out of step.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Seccombe: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us the Government&#039;s policy on the further European integration of education?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, we see processes such as Bologna&#151;where we have the opportunity to think about our higher education system and opportunities for mobility between researchers, teachers and students&#151;as a good example of how best to develop the right kind of links in both a European economy and a global economy. Such opportunities are important also for schools.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   My Lords, in expressing my support for the concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Quirk, perhaps I can declare an   interest as chief executive of Universities UK. As the Bologna process moves on, it is clear that the Government&#039;s involvement needs to be very much   increased. Can my noble friend the Minister confirm the Government&#039;s support for the work of the UK-wide Europe unit and confirm that she will ensure that there is appropriate ministerial participation at Bologna summits; high-level official representation in Bologna forums; and practical support for the introduction of Bologna reforms in institutions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I can indeed offer my support to the work of the Europe unit&#151;which I did not know about until yesterday, as I am not the Minister with responsibility for this policy area. However, I was delighted to hear of the work being done by Universities UK and the funding councils and the contribution that our senior officials are making to the committees involved. I can confirm ministerial involvement in the work that has gone beyond Bologna, for Bergen next year. We will continue to be in dialogue on the issues surrounding universities&#039; involvement. However, I believe that the UK is already well placed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister assure us that there is no further likelihood of an additional level of quality assurance regulation being imposed as a result of this? If she cannot do so, can she assure us that she would resist such an imposition?
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, although I can assure the noble Lord that we would resist such an imposition, there are no such plans. Quality assurance is being worked on in the sense of collaborative approaches across Europe, not with any view to an over-arching European quality assurance system.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us whether there is any problem in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1242"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1242</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

accommodating the MEng degree&#151;Master of Engineering&#151;which is commonly taken in the United Kingdom by engineering students?
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40714-01_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I know that concern has been expressed about the MEng degree. Nothing in the Bologna agreement or process should impinge on that in any way whatever.

<a name="40714-01_spnew16"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. In doing so, I declare my interest as the Bishop to Her Majesty&#039;s Prisons.
</p>

<a name="40714-01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>The Question was as follows:


</p>

<a name="40714-01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>To ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government why they referred to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights the judgment of that court in <i>Hirst</i> v<i> United Kingdom</i> concerning a violation of Article 3, Protocol 1 of the European convention in the matter of the denial to all sentenced prisoners of the right to vote.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040714/text/40714-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Lord Filkin): </b>  My Lords, it has been the view of successive governments, including this Government, that persons who have committed crimes serious enough to warrant a custodial sentence should forfeit the right to have a say in how the country is governed while they are detained. The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>Hirst</i> case challenges this position. We wish to ensure that the issues in relation to this important and long-standing policy are fully considered.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply, particularly for the fact that he has not sought to suggest that the present blanket disenfranchisement of convicted prisoners serves any useful purpose. Would it not be better now for the Government, given the unanimous ruling of the court, to proceed to the drafting of legislation that would allow the courts to impose a sentence of disenfranchisement as an additional penalty when they thought it appropriate? Would not such legislation mean that there were voters in our prisons and, therefore, that prospective and present Members of the other place would have an incentive to have considerable interest in what goes on there and support the Government&#039;s rehabilitation policies? Might not those rehabilitation policies be further advanced by the teaching of citizenship in relation to the right to vote?
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, my answer is no to the first question and probably no to many of the subsequent ones. The central question concerned whether we should start drafting legislation. The answer to that is no, because we believe that we have an arguable case. We think that it is an important issue. It has been part <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1243"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1243</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of the tradition of this society for very many years. It has also been a policy that has been tested by the opinion of both Houses of Parliament as recently as   2000, under the Representation of the People Act, when we introduced a modification to allow prisoners held on remand to vote&#151;but not wider than that. Therefore, we, along with many other member countries in the Council of Europe, think that we are right in our policy position.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may make a prediction, which is that the Government will now be humiliated by the Grand Chamber if they insist on taking this case before that court. As the right reverend Prelate has indicated, this was a unanimous decision. It included Sir Nicolas Bratza, the British judge; and it was a balanced judgment. The Minister has not yet told the House&#151;I should be grateful if he would&#151;why the Government disagree with the decision that legislation is disproportionate if it disqualifies 70,000 convicted prisoners of the right to vote, irrespective of sentence and irrespective of the nature and gravity of the offence. How can that demonstrate a proper sense of proportion?
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, now is not the time to engage in the hearing that will go before the Grand Chamber. I shall refer to a specific issue. One of the central arguments given by the court was the recognition of a large measure of discretion for nation states in this respect. While recognising that, the judgment did not appear to apply that test to its own judgment. It did not in any way indicate the limits of the discretion that the court thought would be appropriate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the right to vote is fundamental to our democratic values? It is accepted that those who are convicted lose certain rights, but that has nothing to do with control and discipline in prisons. Therefore, it is important that those democratic rights are valued so far as concerns our inmates.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, it is in part because we believe that active participation in democracy is important in our society that the state takes the view, as have many previous governments, that people who, by their actions, have breached that contract should for the limited period that they are in prison lose that right. Of course, the nature of imprisonment is that a person loses a range of rights. That is an unfortunate but necessary part of the prison process.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that it is not in the nature of imprisonment that a prisoner should lose his rights because, otherwise, that principle would be applied to remand prisoners as well? Can he say which other western European countries adopt a blanket ban on prisoners&#039; voting rights?
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, it would take too long to give the full list but I shall write to the noble Lord. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1244"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1244</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

However, perhaps I can summarise it. Eighteen out of 51 Council of Europe countries have no restrictions; nine have a prohibition on all prisoners; some, like Ireland, while having no legal prohibition, offer no practical rights and therefore, in practice, prisoners are not able to vote; and others have a range of restrictions according to the severity of the sentence. I shall write with full details of all such countries.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Stern: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the Canadian Supreme Court decided that Canadian prisoners must retain their right to vote because that helps to train them in citizenship and it helps their social reintegration? Does the Minister see any merit in those arguments?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, we are aware of that debate and our position in this respect is quite clear, as is that of both Houses of Parliament. These are not simple issues. Nevertheless, for many years it has been part of our society&#039;s tradition that, when people are imprisoned, they lose a range of rights, one of which is the right to participate in elections.

<a name="time_2"></a>
<a name="40714-02_time0"></a><h5></h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Renton of Mount Harry </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>When they will implement the recommendations in the Haskins report.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Whitty): </b>  My Lords, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State hopes to announce shortly our   decisions on the report by my noble friend Lord   Haskins. It will include how and when the decisions will be implemented.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Renton of Mount Harry: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that Answer and declare an interest as chairman of the Sussex Downs Conservation Board. If behind his reply is the fact that the Secretary of State is, as is widely thought, to announce her decisions on the Haskins report on 22 July, the last day on which Parliament meets, I consider that to be quite disgraceful.
</p>

<a name="40714-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>The Government had 10 months in which to consider the recommendations of the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, and they gave them a warm welcome at the start. Does the Minister accept that at present no one in either the agricultural or environmental industries knows who is to be responsible for delivery in the years ahead? Is it to be the Countryside Agency, Defra or English Nature? Surely, if they believe in rural proofing, the Government have a duty to respond to the report quickly and not on the last day of the parliamentary Session.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord will be aware that over the decades governments have made <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1245"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1245</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Statements during the last days of any Session of Parliament. Such Statements have equal validity and carry equal accountability, and noble Lords have the ability to query Statements made at any time during the parliamentary Session. Therefore, I do not think that the word &quot;disgraceful&quot; is appropriate here. These are complex issues. We gave a clear and broad indication of how the delivery structure would be altered in the light of the recommendations from my noble friend Lord Haskins, and the details of that will be conveyed in a Statement shortly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister admit that one reason for the delay is the Chancellor&#039;s Comprehensive Spending Review? What impact will the CSR have on the implementation of the Haskins report, given that Defra is subject to cuts in the CSR? How are both the CSR and the Haskins report to be integrated into future government policy?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40714-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, Defra is not subject to cuts in the CSR. I thought that it was Liberal Democrat policy, and possibly Tory policy, to cut Defra&#039;s budget, but it is certainly not the Government&#039;s. The Government have provided additional resources to Defra but the implementation of the Haskins report was not delayed because of the CSR decisions. Through the efficiency arrangements, the CSR provides some additional implementation resources but that is not central to the timing of the decision. It has been a complex matter, involving both serious discussions with staff and very serious discussions with many stakeholders, the details of which will be revealed shortly.

<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40714-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Grantchester: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the most important aspect is to put in place the correct framework for the long term and not to rush ahead with a short-term fix? Is not the best way to approach this matter to put delivery in the context of the rural strategy, reflecting all the changes that the agricultural industry is presently undergoing?
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40714-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   Indeed, my Lords. The announcement will be made in that broader context and will not simply be about the mechanisms. The other dimension to the issue, and the most complex, is the need to look at all the funding streams, as well as the machinery, so that we can rationalise and simplify for the benefit of all rural stakeholders the way in which government support rural industry, including agriculture.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="40714-03_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, if the Minister cannot agree with my noble friend that the handling of this matter has been disgraceful, will he not at least agree that the Government and his department have dragged their feet on it? The noble Lord, Lord Haskins, hoped that the report would be put before us in April, but we are now in July. I should like to know what is meant by &quot;shortly&quot;. Will the Minister tell the House how farmers are supposed to deal with cross-compliance issues when no agency is already set up?

</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="40714-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, with regard to the last point, I think that the noble Baroness completely misunderstands the issue. Neither the specialist agencies nor the Rural Payments Agency are affected by the change of structure that we are talking about in relation to cross-compliance, on which an announcement will also be made shortly. As to when &quot;shortly&quot; will be, I cannot say precisely, but the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, was not a million miles away from what noble Lords will find out definitively next week.

<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="40714-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   Yes, my Lords, we are in practical discussions. Clearly, setting up any institutional change within Whitehall also requires ongoing discussions, but they are ongoing discussions aimed at a result.

<a name="40714-03_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that local authorities are very well placed to deliver the social and economic side of many of the things that need to be delivered? I think that that point was accepted by the noble Lord, Lord Haskins. Does the Minister also accept that some local authorities in parts of the country where there are many small family farms and people who are particularly affected by CAP reform will need considerably more in the way of resource and government freedom to deliver than perhaps those in the eastern half of the country, which will have a far easier time of it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="40714-03_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, the report of my noble friend Lord Haskins suggests that local authorities and regional bodies should have a greater say and a greater role in delivering policies and guidance to rural business as a whole. However, I shall not be tempted, as the noble Baroness wishes, into suggesting a wholesale redistribution of resources between the east and west of the country, much as I might desire to do so. That is well beyond my remit.
</p>

<a name="40714-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, will next week&#039;s Statement include an indication of how much will need to be done through primary legislation and, if so, what the likely timescale will be?
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="40714-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend really should not ask me a question on the timescale of primary legislation.

present it looks as though there will inevitably be confusion between the different agencies over the next three years when no one knows precisely who is doing what? This comes at a particularly bad time when the interim review of the common agricultural policy is being implemented, and that is causing enough confusion and doubt in the agricultural industry already.

Nevertheless there are still details which require clarification and much of that will be done over the next few days and the summer.

<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>The Haskins reforms do not impact on the nature of the CAP reform. They deliver broader measures of support, and to some extent guidance and regulation, to the rural industry as a whole, whereas the CAP reform is primarily about how we support financially land management and farming within this country. Dramatic changes are involved and the agricultural sector is fairly clear about what they are. As I said, the full details will be dealt with separately. However, the decisions on the Haskins report will be announced shortly. I do not think that we will have several months&#151;certainly not years&#151;of uncertainty as to who does what. I hope that clarity will be an objective of the announcement.

<p><a name="qnpa_3"></a>Whether there is any evidence that city academy status will help regenerate failing inner-city schools.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="40714-03_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, academies are addressing deep-seated and longstanding educational failure. It will take time for the new leadership, buildings and curriculum to turn things round. However, of the three academies with GCSE results in 2003, the number of 5A* to C grades rose in two to 21 per cent and 35 per cent respectively from 7 per cent and 25 per cent in 2002, and the other had results broadly comparable with its predecessor schools. Academies are also improving behaviour and attendance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="40714-03_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply. Is she aware that in the evidence that he gave to the Select Committee last week, the Secretary of State admitted that with only 12 academies up and running, there was, in his own words, very little evidence to support the success or otherwise of such academies? Is she further aware that an evaluation is promised later this year on the 12 pilots that are up and running? Does she not agree that for a government who pride themselves on evidenced-based policy, it would <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="40714-03_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I believe that in my reply I agreed with the comments of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State. I gave the evidence to the noble Baroness as we have it. It is important that we have the PricewaterhouseCoopers review and evaluation, but children cannot wait. We have deliberately developed a policy of putting academies into areas of the country where we have the kind of deep-seated educational failure which means that what is offered to our children is simply not good enough. Here is a new mechanism which we believe could inspire greater leadership and better academic attainment and which is important for children now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40714-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that Castle Vale School in Erdington, my former constituency in Birmingham, which a few years ago became a specialist performing arts college, is now one of the most successful schools among many successful schools in the City of Birmingham? That has been under the inspiring leadership of Mrs Janet Putman, who has been headteacher there for about 11 years and is now to retire. Will my noble friend join me in celebrating that success and agree that inspiring leadership and commitment among the management of any school, whatever is nailed to the front gate, is the key to success?
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="40714-03_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I think that all noble Lords will join in the celebration of Mrs Putman&#039;s achievements with the school. Every survey that we or Ofsted have undertaken indicates that the quality and strength of leadership is one of the most critical factors in determining the success of a school. It is something to be celebrated and something that every school should have.

<a name="40714-03_spnew17"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Salisbury: </b>   My Lords, in view of the withdrawal of the partnership initiatives which have been promised to Church secondary schools, what will the Government offer the Churches in support of their continuing commitment to serving the inner cities&#039; educational needs?

<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, that is slightly wide of the Question before me. The relationship between Church of England and Church schools and the way in which the Government take forward education policy is a critical factor. I am happy to pursue that with the right reverend Prelate and with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth in his role as chairman of the Church of England Board of Education.

Government in enabling someone to take over, for a proportionately small sum of &#163;2 million, a multi-million pound school building and a subsequent school running project, especially as it seems that it will be free from government control? What rationale are the Government following?
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, that is not the most accurate description of the way the academies programme will work. I should be happy to give the noble Baroness a more lengthy description. This is about bringing in creative, entrepreneurial aspects to enable schools such as those I have indicated, which have had a succession of failure, to offer something different to help our children to succeed. There is a funding agreement&#151;I have placed a copy in the Library of the House&#151;to ensure that the Government play a key role in ensuring that such schools are run effectively and properly. The academies are inspected, and we have advisers working with them. We have very high aspirations and we expect them to achieve.
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Seccombe: </b>   My Lords, have the Government received any representation on the effects of city academies on social deprivation in inner-city areas?
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I do not believe that we have had any representations. I shall write to the noble Baroness if I discover that we have. The academy programme is run in schools in areas of highest deprivation, and therefore provides a new asset for schools. The academies which are open and those which are about to open have received many applications from parents who wish their children to attend. We hope that the academies will succeed in providing a first-class education for our children.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm what I believe about city academies; that is, that the secret is not just setting free leadership but enabling the leadership of the school to set free the professionalism of staff in the school to run things in the way they want? I wonder whether the Minister is as sorry as I am that the Liberal Democrats are not keen on that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I understand all political views in your Lordships&#039; House and I understand that people may feel nervous about something new in the system. However, we know that uniformity is not always the best approach for our children. We have some very good schools in our system and some excellent teachers. However, over the years some schools have consistently failed our students. We have to ensure that we bring to bear all of the best in our society to support them. The academy model is but one part of the toolkit available to the department to try to support children in all settings.

<p><a name="qn_3"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Newby </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_4"></a>What contingency plans they have for the continued provision of public services by a major private finance initiative contractor in the event that such contractor becomes insolvent.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport  (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </b>  My Lords, there are provisions included in PFI contracts that are specifically designed to safeguard the public sector against situations such as contractor insolvency. Where a private sector party cannot meet his obligations, it is the responsibility of other shareholders or credit providers to replace him. In the last resort, the Government have the right to terminate failing PFI contracts with substantial losses to the consortium concerned.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that if a major PFI contractor such as Jarvis were to go under, some combination of government and other public bodies would have to pick up the pieces; for example to secure the completion of student halls of residence currently under construction for the next academic year? Does that not demonstrate that in reality the Government continue to bear much of the risks of those contracts?
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew8"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   No, my Lords. If Jarvis or any other contractor were to fail in its obligations, it is, as I said in my Answer, the responsibility of the other members of the consortium to, as the noble Lord said, pick up the pieces. Of the schools contracts which Jarvis has, only one is Jarvis alone. That is for only three schools and is worth &#163;19 million. All the others have at least Barclays behind them. I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, will suggest that Barclays will not be able to take up the responsibilities which are imposed on it by the PFI contracts.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew9"></a><b> Lord St John of Bletso: </b>   My Lords, are not most PFI contracts through special purpose companies, which, if properly managed, should isolate 90 per cent of the problem if the contractor becomes insolvent?
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew10"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   Yes, my Lords. But it is not 90 per cent; it is 100 per cent. The worst that could happen is that if one member of a consortium became insolvent, there could be delays before the other members of the consortium took up his obligations, which they must do and which is in their interests. The purpose is that all the shareholders in a special purpose vehicle, to which the noble Lord, Lord St John, refers, have the incentives to complete on time and to adequate quality built in upfront in the contract.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, given that the number of contractors involved in major PFI contracts is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1251"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1251</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

relatively small, do the Government have procedures for monitoring their financial health so as to be ahead of the game? If not, why not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew12"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, value-for-money analyses are made. I see the point behind the question of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. It is true that in previous years we had a public sector comparator which was an assessment of the kind the noble Baroness seeks. But that was brought in rather late and therefore it was not the kind of evaluation for which she rightly asks. The value-for-money studies which are now carried out, and which continue to be carried out by the National Audit Office, give exactly the assurance the noble Baroness seeks.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   My Lords, in view of the widespread public concern about the financial position of Jarvis plc, can the Minister tell us what, on a look-through basis, is the total exposure of the public sector to Jarvis plc contracts?
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew14"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, it would not be appropriate for me to comment from the Dispatch Box on the finances of Jarvis Plc. On the issue of public exposure, my answers have made it clear that the exposure is of the other members of the consortiums, rather than of the public sector.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister really satisfied that the refinancing of PFI deals, which is quite common, amply safeguards the public sector, and that it receives a fair share of the better refinancing, which is available when a scheme is completed?
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew16"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   Yes, my Lords. The financing of a private finance initiative contract is a matter of legitimate risk. They are about risk management and those who undertake such contracts undertake a risk. If they can then lessen their risk by refinancing, it is legitimate that they should take some part of the benefit of that. But the contracts that have been in place since 2002 ensure that the public sector takes 50 per cent of the benefit of any refinancing.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   My Lords, how many PFI projects have been successfully completed and how many have failed? May I remind the Minister that the Government have done a good job because they have succeeded in what we would call &quot;risk transfer&quot;?
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="40714-04_spnew18"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the final remark of the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon. If I were to give the detailed answer to his question, I would keep the House for a very long time. The answers are available on the Treasury website.

Some of the intelligence disclosed is made available for the first time and gives some insight into the reasons for the judgments I and other Ministers have been making. I hope the House will understand if I deal with it in some detail.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1254"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1254</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>

<a name="40714-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_7"></a>&quot;The hallmark of the report is its balanced judgments. The report specifically supports the conclusions of Lord Hutton&#039;s inquiry about the good faith of the intelligence services and the Government in compiling the September 2002 dossier. But it also makes specific findings that the dossier and the intelligence behind it should have been better presented, had more caveats attached to it, and been better validated.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_8"></a>&quot;It reports doubts which have recently arisen on the 45 minute intelligence and says in any event it should have been included in the dossier in different terms; but it expressly supports the intelligence on Iraq&#039;s attempts to procure uranium from Niger in respect of Iraq&#039;s nuclear ambitions.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_9"></a>&quot;The report finds that there is little, if any, significant evidence of stockpiles of readily deployable weapons. But it also concludes that Saddam Hussein did indeed have: first,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&#039;the strategic intention of resuming the pursuit of prohibited weapons programmes, including if possible its nuclear weapons programme, when United Nations inspection regimes were relaxed and sanctions were eroded or lifted&#039;;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>secondly,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&#039;in support of that goal, was carrying out illicit research and development, and procurement, activities, to seek to sustain its indigenous capabilities&#039;;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>and, thirdly,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&#039;was developing ballistic missiles with a range longer than permitted under relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="40714-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_10"></a>&quot;Throughout the last 18 months, throughout the rage and ferment of the debate over Iraq, there have essentially been two questions. One is an issue of good faith, of integrity.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_11"></a>&quot;This is now the fourth exhaustive inquiry that has dealt with this issue. This report, like the Hutton inquiry, like the report of the Intelligence and Security Committee before it and of the Foreign Affairs Committee before that, has found the same thing.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_12"></a>&quot;No one lied. No one made up the intelligence. No one inserted things into the dossier against the   advice of the intelligence services. Everyone genuinely tried to do their best in good faith for the country in circumstances of acute difficulty. That issue of good faith should now be at an end.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_13"></a>&quot;But there is another issue. We expected, I expected, to find actual usable, chemical or biological weapons shortly after we entered Iraq. We even made significant contingency plans in respect of their use against our troops. UN Resolution 1441 in November 2002 was passed unanimously by the whole Security Council, including Syria, on the basis that Iraq was a WMD threat.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_14"></a>&quot;Lord Butler says in his report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>      &#039;We believe that it would be a rash person who asserted at this stage that evidence of Iraqi possession of stocks of biological or chemical agents, or even of banned missiles, does not exist or will never be found&#039;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>But I have to accept, as the months have passed, it seems increasingly clear that at the time of invasion Saddam did not have stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons ready to deploy.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_15"></a>&quot;The second issue is therefore this: even if we acted in perfectly good faith, is it now the case that, in the absence of stockpiles of weapons ready to deploy, the threat was misconceived and therefore the war was unjustified?


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_16"></a>&quot;I have searched my conscience, not in a spirit of obstinacy but in genuine reconsideration in the light of what we now know, in answer to that question. And my answer would be this: that the evidence of Saddam&#039;s weapons of mass destruction was indeed less certain and less well founded than was stated at the time. But I cannot go from there to the opposite extreme. On any basis, he retained complete strategic intent on weapons of mass destruction and significant capability. The only reason he ever let the inspectors back into Iraq was that he had 180,000 US and British troops on his doorstep. He had no intention of ever co-operating fully with the inspectors; and he was going to start up again the moment the troops and the inspectors departed or the sanctions eroded. I say further that had we backed down in respect of Saddam, we would never have taken the stand that we needed to take on weapons of mass destruction, never have got the progress, for example, on Libya that we achieved and we would have left Saddam in charge of Iraq, with every malign intent and capability still in place and every dictator with the same intent everywhere immeasurably emboldened.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para20"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_17"></a>&quot;As I shall say later, for any mistakes made, as this report finds, in good faith I of course take full responsibility, but I cannot honestly say that I believe getting rid of Saddam was a mistake at all. Iraq, the region and the wider world is a better and safer place without Saddam.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para21"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_18"></a>&quot;The report begins by an assessment of intelligence and its use in respect of countries other than Iraq. It points out that, in respect of Libya, the intelligence has largely turned out to be accurate, especially in respect of its nuclear weapons programmes; and those are now being dismantled. In respect of Iran, the report says that Iran is now engaged with the International Atomic Energy Authority, though there remain,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&#039;clearly outstanding issues about Iran&#039;s activities&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="40714-05_para22"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_19"></a>&quot;About North Korea the report concludes that it,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&#039;is now thought to be developing missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons as far away as continental US and Europe&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The report goes on at paragraph 99:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>      &#039;North Korea is a particular cause for concern because of its willingness to sell ballistic missiles to anyone prepared to pay in hard currency&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>The report also discloses the extent of the network of A Q Khan, the Pakistani former nuclear scientist. This network is now shut down, largely through US and UK intelligence work, Pakistani co-operation and the dialogue with Libya.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40714-05_para25"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_20"></a>&quot;The report then reveals, for the first time, the development of the intelligence in respect of the new global terrorism that we face. In the early years, for example, in the Joint Intelligence Committee assessment of October 1994, the view was that the likelihood of terrorists acquiring or using chemical, biological or nuclear weapons was, while theoretically possible, highly unlikely.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para26"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_21"></a>&quot;However, as the name and activities of Osama bin Laden became better known, the JIC started to change its assessment. In November 1998, it said this:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>      &#039;[UBL] has a long-standing interest in the potential terrorist use of CBR materials, and recent intelligence suggest his ideas about using toxic materials are maturing and being developed in more detail . . .  There is also secret reporting that he may have obtained some chemical and biological material&#151;and that he is interested in nuclear materials&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>And in June 1999:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>      &#039;Most of UBL&#039;s planned attacks would use conventional terrorist weapons. But he continues to seek chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear material and to develop a capability for its terrorist use&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>By mid-July 1999, this view hardened still further. Again, I quote:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>      &#039;There have been important developments in [Islamist extremist] terrorism. It has become clear that Osama Bin Laden has been seeking chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials . . .  The significance of his possession of CB materials is that, in contrast to other terrorists interested in CB, he wishes to target US, British and other interests worldwide&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>A series of further assessments to the same effect was issued in January 2000, again in August 2000, and in January 2001.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para30"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_22"></a>&quot;To anyone who wants to know why I have become increasingly focused on the link between terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, I recommend reading this part of the report and the intelligence assessments received. It was against this background of what one witness to Lord Butler called the &#039;creeping tide of proliferation&#039; that the events of September 11 2001 should be considered. As the report says, quite rightly, following September 11 the calculus of the threat changed.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para31"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_23"></a>&quot;I said in this House on 14 September 2001:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&#039;we know that the terrorists would, if they could, go further and use chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons of mass destruction. We have been warned by the events of 11 September. We should act on the warning&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="40714-05_para32"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_24"></a>&quot;I took the view then, and I stand by it now, that no Prime Minister faced with this evidence could responsibly afford to ignore it. After September 11 it was time to take an active, as opposed to reactive, position on the whole question of weapons of mass destruction. We had to close down the capability of the rogue states, usually highly repressive and unstable, to develop such weapons and the commercial networks such as those of A Q Khan helping them. Again, my clear view was that the country where we had to take a stand was Iraq.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para33"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_25"></a>&quot;Iraq was the one country to have used WMD recently. It had developed WMD capability and concealed it. Action by UN inspectors and the International Atomic Energy Authority had by the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1257"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1257</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mid to late 1990s reduced this threat significantly; but, as the Butler report shows at paragraphs 180 to 182, by the time the inspectors were effectively blocked in Iraq (at the end of 1998) the intelligence assessments were that some CW stocks remained hidden and that Iraq remained capable of a break-out chemical weapons capability within months, a biological weapons capability, also with probable stockpiles, and could have had ballistic missiles capability in breach of UN resolutions within a year. This, of course, was the reason for military action, taken without a UN resolution, in December 1998.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para34"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_26"></a>&quot;Subsequent to that, the report shows that we continued to receive the JIC assessments on Iraq&#039;s WMD capability. For example, in respect of chemical and biological weapons, in April 2000 it said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>      &#039;Our picture is limited. It is likely that Iraq is continuing to develop its offensive chemical warfare (CW) and biological warfare (BW) capabilities&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="40714-05_para35"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_27"></a>&quot;In May 2001, the JIC assessed, in respect of nuclear weapons:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>      &#039;Our knowledge of developments in Iraq&#039;s WMD and ballistic missile programmes since Desert Fox air operations in December 1998 is patchy. But intelligence gives grounds for concern and suggests that Iraq is becoming bolder in conducting activities prohibited by UN Security Council Resolution 687. There is evidence of increased activity at Iraq&#039;s only remaining nuclear facility and a growing number of reports on possible nuclear related procurement&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="40714-05_para36"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_28"></a>&quot;In February 2002, the JIC said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>      &#039;Iraq . . .  if it has not already done so, could produce significant quantities of BW agent within days&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="40714-05_para37"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_29"></a>&quot;The report specifically endorses the March 2002 advice to Ministers, which states that though containment had been partially successful and intelligence was patchy, Iraq continues to develop WMD. It said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>      &#039;Iraq has up to 20 650km range missiles left over from the Gulf War. These are capable of hitting Israel and the Gulf states. Design work for other ballistic missiles over the UN limit of 150km continues. Iraq continues with its BW and CW programmes and, if it has not already done so, could produce significant quantities of BW agents within days and CW agent within weeks of a decision to do so&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="40714-05_para38"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_30"></a>&quot;The report goes on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>      &#039;We believe it could deliver CBW by a variety of means, including in ballistic missile warheads. There are also some indications of a continuing nuclear programme&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="40714-05_para39"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_31"></a>&quot;The point I would make is simply this. The dossier of September 2002 did not reach any startling or radical conclusion. It said, in effect, what had been said for several years based not just on intelligence, but on frequent UN and international reports. It was the same conclusion, indeed, that led us to military action in 1998; to maintain sanctions; and to demand the return of UN inspectors.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para40"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_32"></a>&quot;We published the dossier in response to the enormous parliamentary and press clamour. It was not, as has been described, the case for war, but it was the case for enforcing the United Nations&#039; will. In retrospect, it has achieved a fame it never achieved at the time. As the report states at paragraph 310:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1258"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1258</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>      &#039;It is fair to say at the outset that the dossier attracted more attention after the war than it had done before it. When first published, it was regarded as cautious, and even dull. Some of the attention that it eventually received was the product of controversy over the Government&#039;s further dossier of February 2003&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="40714-05_para41"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_33"></a>&quot;It goes on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>      &#039;Some of it arose over subsequent allegations that the intelligence in the September dossier had knowingly been embellished, and hence over the good faith of the Government. Lord Hutton dismissed those allegations. We should record that we, too, have seen no evidence that would support any such allegations&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="40714-05_para42"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_34"></a>&quot;The report, at paragraph 333, states that in general the statements in the dossier reflected fairly the judgments of past JIC assessments. The report, however, goes on to say that, with hindsight, making public that the authorship of the dossier was by the JIC was a mistake. It meant that more weight was put on the intelligence than it could bear and put the JIC and its chairman in a difficult position.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para43"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_35"></a>&quot;It recommends in future a clear delineation between government and JIC, perhaps by issuing two separate documents. I think that is wise, though I doubt it would have made much difference to the reception of the intelligence at the time. The report also enlarges on the criticisms of the ISC in respect of the greater use of caveats about intelligence both in the dossier and in my foreword, and we accept that entirely.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para44"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_36"></a>&quot;The report also states that significant parts of the intelligence have now been found by SIS to be in doubt. The chief of SIS, Sir Richard Dearlove, has told me that the SIS accepts all the conclusions and recommendations of Lord Butler&#039;s report that concern the service. The SIS will fully address the recommendations that Lord Butler has made about its procedures and about the need for the service properly to resource them. The service has played, and will continue to play, a vital role in countering worldwide the tide of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, its successes are evident in Lord Butler&#039;s report.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para45"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_37"></a>&quot;I accept the report&#039;s conclusions in full. Any mistakes made should not be laid at the door of our intelligence and security community. They do a tremendous job for our country. I accept full personal responsibility for the way the issue was presented and therefore for any errors that were made. As the report indicates, there is no doubt that at the time it was genuinely believed by everyone that Saddam had both strategic intent in respect of WMD and actual weapons.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para46"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_38"></a>&quot;I make this further point. On the sparse, generalised and highly fragmented intelligence about Al&#039;Qaeda prior to September 11, it is now widely said that policy-makers should have foreseen the attacks that materialised on September 11 2001 in New York. I only ask: had we ignored the specific intelligence about the threat from Iraq, backed up by a long history of international confrontation over it, and that threat later materialised, how would we then have been judged?
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1259"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1259</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>

<a name="40714-05_para47"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_39"></a>&quot;I know some will disagree with that. There are those who were opposed to the war, remain so now and will forever be in that position. I only hope that now, after two detailed parliamentary committee reports, a judicial inquiry more exhaustive than any has ever been in examining an allegation of impropriety against government, and now this voluminous report, people will not disrespect the other&#039;s point of view, but will accept that those who agree and those who disagree about the war in Iraq hold their views not because they are warmongers on the one hand, or closet supporters of Saddam on the other, but because of a genuine difference of judgment as to the right thing to have done.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para48"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_40"></a>&quot;There was no conspiracy. There was no impropriety. The essential judgment and truth, as usual, does not lie in extremes. We all of us acknowledge Saddam was evil and his regime depraved. Whether or not actual stockpiles of weapons are found, there was not and is not any doubt that Saddam used weapons of mass destruction and retained every strategic intent to carry on developing them. The judgment is this: would it have been better or more practical to have contained him through continuing sanctions and weapons inspections; or was that inevitably going to be at some point a policy that failed? Was removing Saddam a diversion from pursuing the global terrorist threat, or part of it?


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para49"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_41"></a>&quot;I can honestly say that I have never had to make a harder judgment. But in the end, my judgment was that after September 11 we could no longer run the risk; that instead of waiting for the potential threat of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction to come together, we had to get out and get after it. One part was removing the training ground of Al&#039;Qaeda in Afghanistan. The other was taking a stand on WMD; and the place to take that stand was in respect of Iraq, whose regime was the only one ever to have used weapons of mass destruction and was subject to 12 years of UN resolutions and weapons inspections that turned out to be unsatisfactory.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para50"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_42"></a>&quot;Though in neither case was the nature of the regime the reason for conflict, it was decisive for me in the judgment as to the balance of risk for action or inaction. Both countries, Afghanistan and Iraq, now face an uncertain struggle for the future, but both at least now have a future. The one country in which you will find an overwhelming majority in favour of the removal of Saddam is Iraq.


</p>

<a name="40714-05_para51"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_43"></a>&quot;I am proud and remain proud; was proud and remain proud of this country and the part it played, especially our magnificent Armed Forces, in removing two vile dictatorships and giving people who were oppressed, almost enslaved, the prospect of democracy and liberty. This report will not end the arguments about the war, but in its balance and common sense it should at least help to set them in a more rational light; and for that we should be grateful&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40714-05_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="40714-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Strathclyde: </b>   My Lords, first, on behalf of the whole House, I thank the noble Baroness the Leader of the House for repeating the Statement.
</p>

<a name="40714-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>It is a long Statement, and much of it deals with various generalities, as well, of course, as the outstanding performance of our troops and the justification for war. We agreed with the justification for the war, and we still agree with it. I reiterate our support for removing Saddam. However, the issue before us is not the war but the conduct of government and whether proper use was made of intelligence. I shall not respond to the rhetorical bulk of the Statement. Much of it smacked of the idea that the end justified the means. That is never a safe doctrine for a parliamentary democracy. The tragedy is that, although the Government had a good case for war, the way in which it was argued&#151;as exposed, once again, in this outstanding report, which has found serious flaws in intelligence and its uses&#151;has weakened that good case and damaged the credibility of the Prime Minister in the country.
</p>

<a name="40714-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>I said that it was an outstanding report, and I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, and his committee for their work.
</p>

<a name="40714-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>The report demonstrates unequivocally&#151;the Prime Minister has accepted this&#151;that the Prime Minister went, in his certainties, far beyond what the intelligence would bear. I shall give one example. On 21 August 2002, the JIC said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;We have little intelligence . . .  and know little about Iraq&#039;s chemical and biological weapons work since late 1998&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>On 9 September 2002, it said, &quot;Intelligence remains limited&quot;. That is what the JIC told the Prime Minister. However, in his foreword to the September dossier, the Prime Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;I am in no doubt that the threat is serious and current&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>He also said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt . . .  that Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Can the noble Baroness explain the contrast? What led the Prime Minister so to alter the emphasis? Was he told to write that, or were they his own words, written in full knowledge of the caveats and conditions surrounding the intelligence?
</p>

<a name="40714-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>The conclusion reached by the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, is stark:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;it was a serious weakness that the JIC&#039;s warnings on the limitations of intelligence underlying its judgments were not made sufficiently clear&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Does the noble Baroness agree with that conclusion? The noble Lord suggested at his press conference this afternoon that the Government wanted the dossier as a document to back up their evolving policy. That put the JIC under what the noble Lord called &quot;strain&quot;. He said that the 45-minute claim should not have been included in the dossier without qualifications. Can the noble Baroness tell the House who took the decision that it should be highlighted by the Prime Minister in that way? We were told time and again that the dossier <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1261"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1261</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

attracted little attention. It is strange, then, that I am the only one who recalls the splashed headlines and the diagrams showing the great ballistic threat.
</p>

<a name="40714-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>The Prime Minister has said that he did not know until later that Iraq did not have ballistic weapons. He said that he acted in good faith over the 45-minute claim. But he was preparing our forces for war. Why did he not know that the adversaries that they were being sent against did not have the capability that he had told the country they had? Did he not ask?
</p>

<a name="40714-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>Like many others, I am concerned about the picture of government presented in the report and about the informal nature of this Government. There were meetings without papers and meetings without minutes or recorded conclusions. The noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, said that he had found no evidence of the Government planning to exaggerate the case for war. In such a context, is it possible that there may have been meetings and conversations of which no record was kept?

</p>

<a name="40714-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>I turn finally to the role of the Attorney-General, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, who is in his place today. The noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, makes it clear that he did not examine the legal aspects of the noble and learned Lord&#039;s advice. How many opinions did the noble and learned Lord give? That matter remains obscure, even after the Butler report. Paragraph 374 says that, before Resolution 1441 was adopted, the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;on the basis of the information he had seen, there would be no justification for the use of force against Iraq on grounds of self-defence against an imminent threat&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40714-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Later, we are told that the noble and learned Lord had a meeting with the Prime Minister&#039;s chief of staff and the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Huyton, about his view of the legal position. They asked him to provide a further assessment. According to paragraph 379, he said that, in the absence of a second UN resolution, the Prime Minister must be satisfied that Iraq failed to take the final opportunity to comply with Resolution 1441.
</p>

<a name="40714-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>We read of a further meeting with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, who was not, at that time, Lord Chancellor, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Huyton, on 13 March and then a formal request from the Attorney-General&#039;s office for the Prime Minister to say that it was unequivocally his view that Iraq had committed further breaches. On 15 March, No. 10 Downing Street replied:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;It is indeed the Prime Minister&#039;s unequivocal view that Iraq is in further material breach of its material obligations&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>In other words, it appears that the Prime Minister himself certified the legal case for war.

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, did not examine in detail the legal aspects of the case. Is there any reason, given the partial light thrown on this by the Butler report, why the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General should not come to the House tomorrow and explain the full background of the paragraphs? In particular, can the noble Baroness tell <br>&nbsp;<br>

the House whether the intelligence evidence played any part in the Attorney-General changing the advice that he gave to the Government between January and March? If the noble Baroness cannot answer that today, perhaps she would help to persuade the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General to offer some clarification to the House tomorrow. I know that the whole House would find that most interesting and welcome.

<a name="40714-06_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   My Lords, I too thank the noble Baroness the Leader of the House for repeating the Statement made in another place by the Prime Minister. I also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, on a detailed and careful report. However, I must add, with regret, that once again, as with the Hutton inquiry, the terms of the remit given to the noble Lord&#039;s inquiry were so tightly drawn that the key questions that the House would like answered could not be answered by the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, if he stayed within his remit. The key questions remain. Who made the decision to propose to Parliament that we should go to war? Who decided that shaky intelligence should be strengthened and firmed up, with all the conditions and qualifications left behind? Those are the key questions, and the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, was precluded from answering them, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, was before him.
</p>

<a name="40714-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>First, I must draw the attention of the House to the remarkable change in the Prime Minister&#039;s stance between November 2000 and the autumn of 2002, a mere two years later. On 1 November 2000, the Prime Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;We believe that the sanctions regime has effectively contained Saddam Hussein in the last 10 years&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 1/11/2000; col. 511W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>A year and a half later&#151;24 September 2002&#151;the Prime Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;The policy of containment is not working&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 24/9/02; col. 3.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Between those two dates, two major things occurred: there was a report by UNMOVIC, the inspectors in Iraq, and a report by Hans Blix, both confirming that the threat had become less and not more.
</p>

<a name="40714-06_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>Paragraph 427 of the Butler report states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;The Government&#039;s conclusion in the spring of 2002 that stronger action (although not necessarily military action) needed to be taken to enforce Iraqi disarmament was not based on any new development in the current intelligence picture on Iraq&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>First, what happened between autumn 2000 and autumn 2002? There was no change in Iraq&#039;s threat to the world or any change in the policy of containment. But, quite simply, there was a meeting between the Prime Minister and President Bush, of which we have not been told and of which we know little; either when it occurred or what occurred during it. Surely, that meeting must have had some influence on the quite remarkable change in the position not just of the Government but the whole of the government machine.

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1263</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40714-06_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>Secondly, would Parliament have taken us to war in March 2003 if it had known that the intelligence was based on uncertain sources; if it had known that that intelligence was assessed in a very doubtful way; if it had known that some of those statements made on behalf of the Government were exaggerated and that qualifications and modifications had been removed? It is clear from paragraph 555 and other parts of the Butler report that those qualifications had gone.
</p>

<a name="40714-06_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>Would Parliament have agreed to take us to war if it had known, as the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, pointed out, that the Attorney-General produced new and revised advice on 17 March following an unequivocal assurance from the Prime Minister that Iraq was in material breach of Resolution 1441? Would Parliament have taken us to war if it had seen the assessments made by no less a body than the Joint Intelligence Committee? There was assessment after assessment between October 2002 and March 2003 indicating that Iraq was not a serious and current threat. There were reports that were never published, never shown to MPs and never shown to Parliament as a whole; reports that very clearly undermine the case for war.
</p>

<a name="40714-06_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Finally, we turn to the question of who is responsible&#151;that illusive question that the inquiry conducted by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, was unable to address. Who is responsible? Was it the virtual government of Mr Jonathan Powell and Mr Alastair Campbell? Was it the intelligence community? Was it perhaps the elected politicians in Cabinet, including the Prime Minister, who are meant to be responsible for the major policy decisions?
</p>

<a name="40714-06_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>We still have not been told. To me it is a tragedy that we will now wait yet again on the Senate of the United States to show the clear line of accountability between how that decision to go to war was taken and how, thousands of lives and much destruction later, we have still not seriously addressed the question.

<a name="40714-07_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, first, perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, that I am aware that they did not have access to the report until 12.30 p.m. Some of what is being said today is, in my view, partial. A complete reading of the document demonstrates that the report is comprehensive, balanced and thorough. Some of the views that have been expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, are not borne out by a thorough reading of the report. I would recommend to all Members of this House that they read the report from beginning to end.
</p>

<a name="40714-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>With respect to the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, in relation to the intelligence material and what had changed, the noble Baroness is well aware of what changed. The context in which we discussed those issues changed fundamentally after September 11. The Statement makes that absolutely clear. Indeed, a reading of the report and, in particular, the intelligence material in relation to that period <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1264"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1264</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

makes that absolutely clear, as does the knowledge that terrorists were doing everything that they could to get hold of WMD. Again, that is factually borne out by the report.
</p>

<a name="40714-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>The report and the Statement have tried absolutely clearly to put the discussions and decisions that were made in relation to Iraq in their proper context. That is something of which we should all be aware and something that we should all remember to do.
</p>

<a name="40714-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>With respect to the issue of the legal basis for the war, I think that my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General has answered the questions that were asked of him in relation to that. I hope that in again asking those questions the integrity of my noble and learned friend was not being called into question.
</p>

<a name="40714-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>To help the House, perhaps I may repeat where we stand. In the report, it is made very clear that the advice of my noble and learned friend was not based on WMD-related intelligence. I would direct noble Lords to paragraph 379 of the report. My noble and learned friend confirmed in this House, including on 21 March when he explained his view to the House, that it was his independent view that military action was justified.
</p>

<a name="40714-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>The Butler report confirms, as my noble and learned friend has always maintained, that his advice, which the noble Lord&#039;s review saw, was based on the interpretation of relevant Security Council resolutions and negotiating history in the United Nations and, I repeat, not on WMD-related intelligence. So the lawfulness of the conflict is not undermined by the   failure to find WMD or by any reassessment of the intelligence. It could not be clearer.
</p>

<a name="40714-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>A question was also raised with respect to the use that was made of the dossier. When noble Lords look at the report in detail, I invite them to read the footnote on page 127 where the inquiry team makes it clear that it,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;wrote to some 60 Editors of national and regional print and broadcast media to ask them if they had been briefed by representatives of the Government about the dossier immediately prior to its publication or whether, post-publication, they were guided to report particular aspects, such as the &#039;45 minute&#039; story. All of those who replied said that they had not been guided to particular parts of the dossier prior to its publication . . .  Some Editors noted that the &#039;45 minute&#039; story attracted attention because it was of itself an eyecatching item in a document containing much that was either not new or rather technical in nature&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Perhaps I may say to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, that on 26 September 2002, in the <i>Western Morning News</i>, the Leader of the Liberal Democrats in another place, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;There is no killer fact in the dossier. It is more a confirmation of what we already knew&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Again, before the dossier was published, on 23 March 2002 the shadow Foreign Secretary said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;The Iraqi threat is indisputable. Horrific weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a despot who will use them or give them to others to use in every part of the world. Our shared objective is the destruction of these weapons before they can be used. The means of achieving it must be effective and enduring. We cannot rule any option out&quot;.</p>

<a name="40714-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>In conclusion, with regard to the comments which have been made about the nature of government, the so-called informality of the Government, and the fact that meetings are held which are not minuted, we all know that if you are to have effective government, you need to operate in a variety of different ways. Those noble Lords opposite who may remember a time when they were in government might recall occasions when it was necessary to hold informal meetings before they then had formal meetings.
</p>

<a name="40714-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>I say this to the House: the Butler report makes it absolutely clear that the Cabinet discussed these issues on 24 occasions. As noble Lords know, the Cabinet is always minuted.

Reverting to the last reply given by the noble Baroness the Leader of the House, I am among those who have been in government and served in a Cabinet for a considerable time. I can say that the strictures&#151;which they are, albeit in restrained terms&#151;made in the Butler report at paragraphs 6.06 to 6.11, although not exclusively there, on the way that this administration conducts the procedures and processes of government is something that did not apply to any administration in which I have served.
</p>

<a name="40714-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>I ask the noble Baroness whether she is aware that this is a serious matter. Throughout the over-long Statement of the Prime Minister, repeated by the noble Baroness, there was no acknowledgment of that whatever. When is this very important issue going to be addressed, and how?

<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="40714-07_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord did not hear everything I said in the Statement, where it was made absolutely clear that we accept the report and the recommendations made in it. Perhaps I may also say to the noble Lord that at his press conference this morning the noble Lord, Lord Butler, was asked a specific question about the style of government. I watched it. The noble Lord said that the overall effect of the way the Government operated in no way made them any less efficient. Noble Lords should read what is in the report and listen to the words of the noble Lord, Lord Butler.

Can <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="40714-07_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, my noble and learned friend is absolutely right. Perhaps I may say in relation to his final point about transparency that, having watched governments operate over many years, no government have sought to be as transparent and as open with their people as this Government have sought to be.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="40714-07_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Wright of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, I have not yet had the opportunity to read the Butler report in full, but as a former chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee and as a Member of this House who has strongly questioned and still questions the case for going to war in Iraq, I should like to make a few brief points.
</p>

<a name="40714-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>First, it is quite clear from what I have read of the Butler report that the process of assessing and publicising intelligence in the case of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, and therefore of the imminence of an Iraqi threat, was flawed.
</p>

<a name="40714-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>Secondly, the role and involvement of political advisers and No. 10 press officers in the process of intelligence assessment and in producing the flawed dossier was unwise and led to pressure, perhaps unconscious pressure or strain, on the intelligence services to support the case for war. I am surprised that neither the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, nor, so far as I know, the noble Lord, Lord Butler, has drawn particular attention to Mr Jonathan Powell&#039;s e-mail, in which he is reported to have complained that the first draft of the dossier was inadequate to support the Government&#039;s case for going to war.
</p>

<a name="40714-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Thirdly, this House was repeatedly assured by Ministers that no decisions to go to war had been taken. Indeed, I was assured privately by a Minister, within weeks of military action, that we would not go to war without a second United Nations resolution. But it has long been clear from Bob Woodward&#039;s books, as I have reminded this House several times, that a decision had been taken by senior members of the United States Administration as early as four years ago, if not earlier, that an early and imminent invasion of Iraq was desirable and necessary, and that the events of September 11 in the following year were used improperly and dishonestly as a justification for going to war.
</p>

<a name="40714-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Little attempt has been made either by the United States Government or by the British Government to correct the widespread belief in the United States that Saddam Hussein was behind the attack on the twin towers. I share the regret expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, that the Attorney-General&#039;s confidential advice has still not been published, when a great deal of information has been revealed which in my day would have been&#151;

be a better place without Saddam, but let us not forget that the removal of Saddam was never given by Her Majesty&#039;s Government as the justification for war. On the contrary, we were told again and again that it was not the policy of Her Majesty&#039;s Government to change other people&#039;s governments. Is that still the policy of Her Majesty&#039;s Government?

<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="40714-08_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Wright, is correct. What the report does is to flag up places where the process is flawed. In his press report, the noble Lord, Lord Butler, spoke of the 45   minutes claim, saying that it was an uncharacteristically poor piece of assessment. The report makes it absolutely clear that there are some flaws in the process, that these need to be addressed urgently and that there is a great deal of learning to be done within that. The report goes into a great deal of detail. The four case studies used at the beginning of the report&#151;in particular in relation to Iran, AQ Khan, Libya and North Korea&#151;establish the context in which this work was being developed.
</p>

<a name="40714-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I cannot accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Wright, as regards pressure being put on the intelligence community or on the Joint Intelligence Committee, and the Butler report is absolutely clear on that point.

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>Turning to the issue of the second UN resolution, at the time I was myself a Minister at the Foreign Office. We worked assiduously to get a second UN resolution, but it was absolutely clear that a resolution which contained within it any kind of ultimatum with respect to the length of time that was going to be available to Iraq would not pass. That was the point at which our strategy needed to be revised.

</p>

<a name="40714-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I draw attention to the fact that in paragraph 379 the report recognises that the Attorney-General&#039;s advice was,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;based on the legal interpretation of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and negotiating history in the United Nations, and not on WMD-related intelligence&quot;.</p>

<a name="40714-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>If the violation of 16 Chapter 7 UN resolutions is not legal justification for military action, I do not know what is.
</p>

<a name="40714-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>Does my noble friend agree that, although the report found deficiencies in the validation process of some Iraqi intelligence, the fact that it concluded that the four case studies made of Libya, Iran, North Korea and AQ Khan were all success stories for the SIS demonstrates that the doubts cast on the overall efficiency and performance of the SIS are misplaced? Certainly that is not the opinion of the report.

</ul>

<a name="40714-08_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Garden: </b>   My Lords, we sent 43,000 troops to kill or be killed and yet the report makes it clear that we did not look again at the intelligence when Hans Blix was in the country and able to give us up-to-date information.

<a name="40714-08_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord will be aware that the JIC makes reassessments of its intelligence all the time. That is the way in which it operates. As to the wider question raised by the noble Lord, I draw his attention to paragraph 474 on page 116 of the report, which refers to the validation of the intelligence. The report states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;we have reached the conclusion that prior to the war the Iraqi regime . . .  Had the strategic intention of resuming the pursuit of prohibited weapons programmes, including if possible its nuclear weapons programme, when United Nations inspection regimes were relaxed and sanctions were eroded or lifted . . .  In support of that goal, was carrying out illicit research and development . . .  Was developing ballistic missiles with a range longer than permitted under relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="40714-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that paragraph 584 of this excellent report deserves careful consideration? It states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;much of what was reliably known about Iraq&#039;s unconventional weapons programmes in the mid- and late-1990s was obtained through the reports of the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) and of the International Atomic Energy Agency&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>That paragraph goes on to say that the work of those agencies has perhaps been underestimated in the past and that due weight should be given to it in future. More support should be given to them with the support of our intelligence agencies. Does not my noble friend agree that that paragraph gives ground for considerable reflection on just how seriously we took the work of Hans Blix and the UN inspectors at the time or how far, rather, we chose to push it to one side because of our own priorities in government?
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="40714-09_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, I agree with one part of my noble friend&#039;s comment, but not with the other. I entirely agree with him about the importance of the UN mechanisms. The Government have always upheld them. However, I must tell my noble friend, with respect to the judgment made about containment, that it was at the time and remains our firm view&#151;indeed, in the light of the paragraph from the Butler report that I cited about the validation of intelligence, it is clear&#151;that containment was not working. Concern was being expressed not just by our Government or by that of the United States but by others around the world about what Saddam Hussein intended to do. In that respect, I do not agree with my noble friend.

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="40714-09_spnew2"></a><b> Lord King of Bridgwater: </b>   My Lords, does not the noble Baroness recognise that her plea for the matter now to be closed will simply not be recognised by the general public, especially because of the limited, restricted terms of reference, to which the noble Lord, Lord Butler, properly stuck? I did not hear a clear answer to my noble friend&#039;s question from the Front Bench about whether the Attorney-General would come to make a statement on the matter. The noble Lord, Lord Butler, made clear that he had not pursued that matter; the committee did not consider the question of the legality of the war. Likewise, the role of government was likewise more circumscribed in the terms of reference.

</p>

<a name="40714-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Even given his limited terms of reference, the noble Lord, Lord Butler, found that there were serious failings for which there was collective responsibility. Who takes collective responsibility in this Government?

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="40714-09_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, first, I think that the noble Lord, Lord King, cannot have heard what I said. I in no way said that the issue is closed.

they did not consider had been answered in the reports. The reports have collectively made it absolutely clear that in no sense did the Government act in bad faith.   So those who are looking for some kind of ammunition will not find it. I did not say that the case is closed. I said that there have been four reports on the issue and that at some point we have to agree, when considering what has been said collectively through the reports, that the questions raised have been addressed.

<a name="40714-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>I think that we have addressed the specific point about my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General. My noble and learned friend made a written Statement.

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>We are at that stage of our parliamentary process where we are hopefully approaching the end of consideration of the Bill. Let no one allege that the Government have not listened and reflected on what the House has said. My noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor gave serious reflection to the arguments made in the House about the judicial review ouster and came back with an alternative which, in broad measure, the House has welcomed. Secondly, we previously considered the issue of legal aid success fees. I gave the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, my undertaking that, within the terms in which he had put the issue to me, I would take the issue away and seek to address it in another place. I hope that he will find that we have done so.

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>The noble Lord will also know from Commons consideration that we also considered the issue of lay members, which we did not rejoice about, but we also listened to the House in that respect.

</p>

<a name="40714-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>New Section 103A in Amendment No. 28 allows a party to the appeal before the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal to seek a review of the tribunal&#039;s decision in the High Court, on the grounds that the tribunal may have made an error of law. The High Court may order the tribunal to reconsider the case. As those who have been following the Bill closely will know, there is also an interim process, a filter process&#151;because there may   be a large volume of such applications to the tribunal&#151;whereby, if the transitional process in Amendment No. 62 is in place, the review will first be considered by a senior judge in the tribunal. He may also make an order for reconsideration of the case. If he chooses not to, the applicant may opt in for the case to be considered by the High Court anyway.

</p>

<a name="40714-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>Amendments Nos. 28A, 28B and 62A restore the Government&#039;s intention that five-day time limits should apply to that process, both for the initial application, and the opting in, if the transitional filter process is in place&#151;in the circumstances I just described.
</p>

<a name="40714-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The Bill originally contained an ouster of the jurisdiction of the higher courts. Having listened to opinions, we brought forward the new policy in Amendment No. 28. Under the new policy, the decisions of the single-tier tribunal are now subject to review in the High Court. We agree that it is important that the High Court has such oversight, but we cannot allow that to compromise our legitimate aims of speed and efficiency. Therefore, it is vital that limits are placed on the review to prevent applicants without meritorious cases using the process to cause delay and expense. One of those limits is the new system of legal aid for reviews, to which we shall return later, and another is the limit on the time in which an application can be made.

</p>

<a name="40714-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>The Government are confident that five days is more than enough for an applicant to consult their legal representative, for the representative to prepare the application and for the application to be lodged. Similarly, five days is also entirely sufficient for the simple procedure of opting to have a review application considered by the High Court under the transitional provisions.
</p>

<a name="40714-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>For the avoidance of doubt, five days means five working days&#151;weekends and bank holidays are excluded. That does not need to be spelt out in the Bill, although new Section 103A(4)(a) points to the fact that that effect is already achieved by rules. I should also point out that after the decision is promulgated by the tribunal, two days are allowed for the determination to reach the representative through the post before the five days starts. Therefore, we are talking about five full days for the representative to work on the application.
</p>

<a name="40714-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The time limits in Amendments Nos. 28A and 28B apply when a party to the appeal wants to challenge the decision of the asylum and immigration tribunal. The applicant will therefore have already presented his case to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and before an independent tribunal before reaching that stage. The grounds of appeal will already have been covered at the appeal and in the tribunal&#039;s statement of <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1277</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reasons. Furthermore, that review is not a rehearing, but is focused solely on errors of law made by the tribunal. Given that the legal representative will, in most cases, already be familiar with the case, the preparation for it should not prove onerous.

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>In order to test the assertion, and to test the realism of what we are putting before the House, we have asked the Legal Services Commission to look at the current statutory review process under Section 101 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Based on this, we have looked at what, in practice, have been the submissions made by lawyers as part of the statutory review process. I have inspected some of those cases and solicitors have not always been&#151;how shall I put it?&#151;very fulsome in terms of the cases they have put forward. We would expect them to do around six hours&#039; work on a review application, including reading through the papers, interviewing the client, taking instructions and, if necessary, briefing counsel. Counsel is not always briefed in such cases; if counsel is involved, he could be expected to take between two and five hours to draft the application. We are therefore talking about six hours for the solicitor and up to five hours for counsel. That is very achievable in five working days.
</p>

<a name="40714-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Of course, there will always be exceptions. We have made it clear from the outset that we would not want   to see this lead to injustice. Therefore, Section   103A(4)(b) explicitly allows the High Court to accept out-of-time applications,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;where it thinks that the application could not reasonably practicably have been made within that period&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>This will deal with all the exceptional circumstances&#151;for example, if the usual legal representative of the applicant was unwell and unable to complete the application in time, or if specialist evidence needed to be collated to present a full review application. This will work by the applicant applying out of time and the High Court exercising its discretion to allow the out-of-time application.
</p>

<a name="40714-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>Put at its simplest, we are confident that five days is adequate in the majority of cases. The legislation explicitly allows the High Court judge, who will clearly be charged with upholding the interests of justice, to grant further time when the case is put to him and he considers that that case could not reasonably practicably have been made within that period. The legislation could not be clearer or, we believe, fairer.
</p>

<a name="40714-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>It would be even more absurd to allow more than five days for &quot;opting in&quot; under the transitional filter process. I do not want to bore the House with the detail, but this is essentially when a case has been considered by a senior judge in the AIT on a review application and has been found not to be valid. At that point, the applicant still has the further right to lodge a case to the High Court, but this will require little more than a fax or a letter to be sent to the High Court, indicating that the applicant wishes his case to be considered again, following consideration by a judge in the tribunal. That could be done in half an hour, so five days is somewhat generous.

<a name="40714-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Why does all this matter? As I have set out on previous discussions on the Bill, it is important that we have a process that is no slower than necessary in the interests of justice. It is important that we send a message that this review process is for obvious errors of law, and not to allow legal representatives to trawl through obscure legal arguments and technicalities. And we will send that message clearly if we make sure that the opportunities for causing delay are minimised.
</p>

What more, fairly, should be done? I ask the House not to resist the Commons amendment in this respect.

<p><a name="st_114"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 28AA, I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 28BA and 62B.

</p>

<a name="40714-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Five days is, frankly, a ridiculously short period of time. The applicant&#039;s lawyer will have to read the decision carefully; he or she will have to consider the legal issues involved in the decision; he or she may well have to consult the client, which is likely to involve arranging a meeting at which an interpreter must be present; he or she may have to consult counsel; and he or she will have to draft the application, a document requiring great care as it is the sole basis on which a judge of the appropriate court will decide the application. There is no chance to supplement that document at an oral hearing as there will be no oral hearing. It will also be necessary to get the application to the appropriate court before it closes for business on the last available day.
</p>

<a name="40714-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>If the lawyer in question had little else to do, a five-day period might well be enough.

time. He or she will not know in advance when the decision will be released by the tribunal. If it arrives when the lawyer is appearing in court, the lawyer cannot possibly drop everything else. The lawyer may have to hand over the case to a colleague in the same firm or organisation who is not familiar with it; or it may be impossible for the lawyer to find someone else and the applicant may have to find a new lawyer.
</p>

<a name="40714-10_para2"></a>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I might rephrase that as, &quot;It means you can draft your application in advance&quot;. That, frankly, is absurd. One ground for the application&#151;and it is only one of many possible grounds&#151;might be that the tribunal member in question failed to take into account evidence he should have taken into account. That comes within the description of an error of law. But how can you possibly know in advance that the member of the tribunal will have failed to take into account a particular piece of evidence? To make that application, you then have to say what the evidence was, show that it was not taken into account and why it might have made a difference it if had been. All those things will take a substantial amount of time.

<a name="40714-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord   Filkin, was right in saying that there has been a considerable amount of beneficial flexibility as the Bill has moved through your Lordships&#039; House and another place. The issue of time has been, in my submission, the one exception to that.
</p>

<a name="40714-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, that the time limits should be demanding. In Committee, we ourselves tabled an amendment suggesting a limit of seven days; but it is our view that setting a limit of five days goes too far.
</p>

<a name="40714-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>There are many circumstances in immigration appeals in which it is necessary to switch from a legal adviser who has a general practice in immigration law to an adviser who deals with very special issues. It would be extremely difficult to make such a switch within as tight a timetable as five days.
</p>

<a name="40714-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>Moreover, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, although appeals can only be on the basis of an error of law, there are many occasions when, to make out an appeal on an error of law, a legal adviser has to study in considerable detail the factual structure of the case to determine whether a perverse decision was reached with respect to the evidence.
</p>

<a name="40714-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>We must not forget, either, that, on occasions, the consequences of a wrong decision for an applicant are very serious if he is returned to a country that is determined to incarcerate him for a long period or to put him to death. We must remember that those applicants often do not speak any English.
</p>

<a name="40714-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>In all those circumstances, it is our view that the limit of five days ought to be considered again by the Government and extended. We on these Benches will support the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in his amendment.

<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="40714-10_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </b>   My Lords, in the early 1970s, it was my privilege to be the president of the National Industrial Relations Court. I claimed, rightly, that it was the fastest court in the West, which produced the reasonable comment from Michael Foot that I was &quot;trigger happy&quot;. I mention that merely to show that I am not one who supports sluggardliness in court proceedings. It is terribly important to keep things moving. But&#151;and this is an important but&#151;it is no good fixing one&#039;s timetable at a point when there then must be numerous applications for extensions of time. That itself involves a waste of time.
</p>

<a name="40714-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, rightly pointed out that people who are any good at any specialty in the law tend to be very fully employed. That is why they become experts and why they are so employed. That being so, I could not help thinking that the Minister believed that lawyers were concerned only with one case at a time. It would appear that he believes that they can pick up a case on a Monday and study it, not in a desultory manner but giving 11 hours to it, which is nearly two days, then have nothing else to do for the rest of the week. It is not like that. It may be that someone with a true specialty has only one case at a time and that case lasts for a couple of months&#151;but that is very different. It is not the area that we are discussing.

</p>

<a name="40714-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>The Minister then talks about lawyers trawling through the law and seeking obscure technicalities. People do not do that, or certainly not in a field with which they are familiar. They know what the points are; without reference to any particular case, they know what they are looking for, and they look for it. They certainly will not try to find fancy points&#151;unless, of course, they are satisfied that there is some real injustice occurring that is way outside the ordinary experience. Then they will look to see whether there is any way in which they can safeguard the true and real interests&#151;not bogus interests&#151;of their clients. I do not find that reprehensible at all, although there seems to be an assumption that it is.
</p>

<a name="40714-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>I cannot understand what real difference there is between 10 days and five days. Looking at the whole period in which the proceedings are governed, I do not know quite what they are, but I am sure that an extra five days represents a very small increase in the time available. I am also tempted to wonder whether anyone has found out whether the judges can cope with that period. It is one of the features of judicial life and managing courts that there is a degree of ebb and flow. If one has no time to balance things out, one becomes either a bit slap-happy or inefficient.

It means that people will be rushed in producing what should be a very important document, or they will be obliged to apply to the court to exercise its discretion&#151;something which will add considerable delay.

</p>




<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="40714-11_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, your Lordships&#039; House might find the Minister&#039;s argument more convincing if he had taken seriously the amendments that we tabled at an earlier stage, introducing time limits to the beginning and the end of the asylum procedure&#151;in other words, between the asylum application and the initial consideration by the Home Office; then, after the appeal process was over, between that point and the time of deportation. If the Government were prepared to entertain time limits at those stages, which cause far greater delay than the delays within the appeal procedure, your Lordships&#039; House might find the Minister&#039;s argument more convincing.
</p>




<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="40714-11_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, I shall make my own judgment on how the Government wish to put their case forward, but I am always grateful for the advice of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland.
</p>

<a name="40714-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>The essence of what we have said throughout this debate is that the Government must prevent unnecessary delay at every single part of the process. It is not a question of saying that we should bear down only on the initial consideration, although the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is right in saying that we should. We have made great progress on that in recent years and the process is vastly shorter and of higher quality than it was. But that is no reason whatever for saying, &quot;What does another week matter? Let&#039;s have   another week added on to the process for the avoidance of doubt&quot;. I remind the House that keeping a family on state support while a lengthy appeal process goes through costs several hundred pounds a week. The state should willingly support that expenditure if it is necessary but we should not get drawn into it if it is not.
</p>

<a name="40714-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, was clear in his argument that lawyers are busy people&#151;many people are busy people&#151;and that they are not just waiting for cases to come over the hill to be addressed. That is true, but, as I sought to indicate, on the best estimate we have been able to identify, we are talking about approximately one day&#039;s work by a lawyer. In the process that we are talking about, five days are provided for doing that one day&#039;s work and if there are reasonable grounds why that is not possible they can go to court and be granted more.

</p>

<a name="40714-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>It also matters because the system is prone to abuse. I make no apology for coming back to that. We know that 50 per cent of all people who are refused by the adjudicator then appeal. The noble Lord, Lord Newton, who is in his place, will know that one gets nothing like those statistics in any other part of the tribunal system. The reason why is obvious: it runs the case long and reduces the time period when the individual might be removed from the country if he is found not to have a meritorious case.
</p>

<a name="40714-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>I draw the attention of the House to the judgment by Mr Justice Collins, whose judgments have not always been met with rejoicing by the Government. He gave a clear example just last week of a case that had been run right through the process by the Refugee Legal Centre. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1283"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1283</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

It cost &#163;60,000 and in his judgment Mr Justice Collins said that he found in it absolutely no merit whatever. We should not be party to supporting a system that runs cases long when there is no justification for doing so.
</p>

<a name="40714-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>It is not proper for me to go into detail but, of course, the department has consulted the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice on this process. I am certain that he has a view that he does not want the High Court swamped with unmeritorious cases. We would be a foolish Government, particularly in the light of our recent experiences, if we had not consulted properly.
</p>

<a name="40714-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>I shall say no more. We think that five days are perfectly adequate for this process. I do not think that we are going to have a meeting of minds on this matter so no doubt the House will decide the issue.

(x)   shall provide that a party to an appeal is to be treated as having received notice of the Tribunal&#039;s decision, unless the contrary is shown, at such time as may be specified in, or determined in accordance with, the rules;

<br>

<br>
28DA Line 10, at end insert &quot;(and may, in particular, make provision of a kind that may be made by rules of court under section 103A(5)(b))&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_129"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendments Nos. 28C and 28D are minor amendments. They introduce an additional flexibility to the procedure for review. In the majority of cases, the High Court judge will simply look at the applicant&#039;s papers in order to decide whether or not there may have been an error of law. However, in some circumstances it may be appropriate for other submissions to be considered. These amendments allow flexibility to make provision for this through rules of court. An example of when it might be helpful for the respondent to file submissions involves fast-track cases. Where speed is key, allowing a respondent&#039;s submissions would enable the reconsideration to take place more quickly. I should clarify that in both cases, we are talking about a process whereby a High Court judge is considering whether to allow the case to be heard on a point of law and to be returned to the AIT for this purpose. It is not itself a hearing.
</p>

<a name="40714-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Amendment No. 28DA is consequential on Amendments Nos. 28C and 28D and introduces a similar flexibility for the review while the filter is in place. For an initial period, the review application will first be considered by the tribunal. This amendment means that the procedure rules for the AIT can similarly allow the tribunal to consider additional papers. I therefore urge noble Lords to agree to Amendments Nos. 28C, 28D and 28DA. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="40714-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>This amendment brings us to the issue of lay members, which we discussed at a previous stage, when the House made clear its wish that lay members should be retained within the new asylum and immigration tribunal. The House argued that there was merit in them being there as a resource to the tribunal in certain cases.
</p>

<a name="40714-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, the Government did not believe that that was in principle desirable for reasons that I set out earlier. However, the Government have concluded, as can be seen from proceedings in another place, that we will not seek to insist on the removal of lay members from the tribunal; <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1287"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1287</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we have listened to the House in that respect. On the other hand, an amendment that was linked to it&#151;as least by implication or consequentially&#151;was that all tribunal panels should be three-member panels. We will consider that amendment later. In essence, in this process we are saying that we are content not to seek to remove lay members from the AIT. In a sense, our view is that it is important that the president of the tribunal has the discretion to deploy the judicial resources&#151;including lay members&#151;as he or she thinks fit. That is very much in tune with our discussions on these issues.
</p>

<a name="40714-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>There are specific amendments on these issues essentially because draftsmen have felt that for the avoidance of doubt or better drafting processes, they needed to be brought forward in a slightly different form. Their thrust, purpose or outcome is four-square with what I believe the House wanted when it pressed this matter at previous stages. With that prelude I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 42, 43, 44 and 61 and Commons Amendments Nos. 61A to 61C thereto, which are part of the same group.
</p>

<a name="40714-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>We are prepared to accept the will of the House that there should be a role for lay members in the new tribunal. This was expressed in the original Amendments Nos. 42, 43, 44 and 61. However, the drafting had unintended consequences, and so parliamentary counsel has produced Amendments Nos. 61A to 61C and 28E in lieu. They have the same effect.
</p>

<a name="40714-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>One notable difference is that the drafting of Amendment No. 61A as opposed to Amendment No.   42 allows for the appointment as legally qualified members of the tribunal of people who do not satisfy the letter of the requirements in sub-paragraphs 2(a) to (c) of Schedule 1, but who none the less are suitably qualified, perhaps from academic legal experience or judicial experience gained in another jurisdiction.
</p>

<a name="40714-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>I should, of course, be clear that we are accepting lay members, but we are not prepared to accept the amendment we shall come to later&#151;Amendment No.   46&#151;that requires all cases to be heard by panels of three members.
</p>

<a name="40714-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>I hope, therefore, that these amendments will prove uncontroversial. I ask the House to agree to Amendments Nos. 28E, 61A, 61B and 61C. I beg to move.
</p>

<a name="40714-12_para13"></a>

<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="40714-12_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, I rise simply to thank the Minister for responding so thoughtfully to the amendments that we tabled to include lay members in the new tribunal system.
</p>

<a name="40714-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>The Minister is right in saying that, strictly speaking, the issues raised by Amendment No. 46A fall outside the group, but, nevertheless, I think it appropriate for me to say something about that matter now. I promise not to repeat myself when the Minister rises to introduce the line of amendments beginning with Amendment No. 46 later on.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1288"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1288</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40714-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>I should like to suggest, respectfully, that Amendment No. 46A, if not quite meeting the principle of three-member tribunals that we sought on Report, is nevertheless a good compromise. It gives the president of the tribunal the discretion, where appropriate, in cases which raise issues of legal or factual complexity, to have tribunals of more than one member while recognising that issues of cost cannot be entirely ignored when one is managing any form of public service. The Immigration Service is no different from any other public service in that respect. I recognise that the requirement of three-member tribunals in all circumstances could be too demanding a standard to meet. The drafting that the Minister has achieved, if I may say so, is in my view masterly. I should like to thank him very much indeed for the way in which he has responded to this issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="40714-12_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, it is very welcome that the Government have responded to some of the concerns that were expressed at earlier stages of the Bill. I entirely accept the Minister&#039;s claim that this has been a listening exercise and that on the whole, with certain unfortunate exceptions, Ministers have been responsive to the views that were expressed in your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="40714-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>I wish to ask the noble Lord only one question about the particular form in which these amendments are couched. As regards Amendment No. 61A, who will exercise this opinion when the Lord Chancellor is no longer sitting on the Woolsack? That event is not far distant in time and I should have thought we might have anticipated it in the drafting.
</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="40714-12_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, I wonder where the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, was yesterday when your Lordships&#039; House voted on this matter.

The answer to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is that those responsibilities will be picked up by whatever successor authority the House so decides, but clearly the Government&#039;s intention is that it is picked up by the relevant Secretary of State, as we discussed in our many fulsome debates yesterday.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1289"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1289</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40714-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>At Lords Third Reading, I set out the problem we are trying to address with the proposals for a new legal aid scheme, and more broadly the move to a single tier tribunal. I sought to set out the issues that set the coloration to that: namely, that legal aid costs had quadrupled since 1998&#150;99; that the average cost of an individual pursuing an appeal to the end of the process is some &#163;4,000; and that these are unjustifiable amounts when only one in 10 of cases results in a different outcome.
</p>

<a name="40714-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>I also signalled that the appeal process, if run to the full, could easily run to 62 weeks or more from beginning to end. I set that in the context that while undoubtedly genuine asylum claimants come to our shores, and it is our responsibility as a state to look at their cases fairly, we are also aware that a massive amount of trafficking of people goes on, as I instanced in the relevant debate.
</p>

<a name="40714-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>As it stands, the system leads to delay and expense. There is concern that a slow process and an uncertain ability to bring it rapidly to a conclusion and to return people from whence they came feeds the traffickers&#039; business and makes it easier for them to get people to pay remarkably high sums of money to be brought here.
</p>

<a name="40714-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>In introducing a new system we have to ensure that the exploitation does not continue. The new legal aid arrangements are central to achieving that. They will stop weak applications from flooding the High Court which leads to the cycle of delay, while ensuring at the same time that the interests of justice are met.
</p>

<a name="40714-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The new scheme that we are bringing forward, which is different from the one that we discussed at Third Reading&#151;again, we listened to the arguments put forward on this matter&#151;will be a system of retrospective funding. We are not removing legal aid for the review and reconsideration but we are clear that lawyers have to take a part in making judgments about whether cases are meritorious. While lawyers will not know until the end of the process, when the judge makes his order, whether they will receive legal aid, good lawyers already make such judgments. The system that we are constructing will try to ensure that all lawyers make the kind of judgments that a good lawyer does in such circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40714-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>However, in introducing a scheme involving retrospective funding, we recognise that the focus of the scheme should be on merit and not just success. At Third Reading I therefore agreed with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on this point&#151;we tested each other across the Dispatch Box to make sure there was no misunderstanding and we managed to reduce most if not all of the misunderstanding&#151;when he signalled that he would like to see a system based on a &quot;robust merits test&quot;. There appeared, therefore, to be no issue of principle between us on that; it was a matter of how one applied that.
</p>

<a name="40714-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>This has always been the Government&#039;s intention. It became apparent at Third Reading that perhaps there were different ways of achieving that objective from the one that we had advanced to the House which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1290"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1290</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

clearly caused unhappiness on the part of some noble Lords. I do not think that &quot;unhappiness&quot; is too sharp a word. Therefore, I hope that the amendments which we brought forward in another place are seen as very much four-square with what I signalled in broad terms at Third Reading.
</p>

<a name="40714-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>Amendment No. 28F removes the provision for variable fees to be paid dependent on the result of the reconsideration. Amendment No. 28G links the award of legal aid more explicitly to an applicant&#039;s prospects of success at the time the application was made; that is, whether the case had significant merit such that the lawyer was right to pursue it in a system based on merit. In a system based on merit that is fair. This test does not ask lawyers to pre-empt the decision of the tribunal; it simply asks them carefully to assess whether a case has merit. If the judgment they have made is sound, which is reasonable to expect, legal aid will be paid.

</p>

<a name="40714-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>We were brought to that conclusion by thoughtfulness by counsel that the best way of ensuring justice was that the tribunal should decide whether legal aid should be paid, not in a sense simply by what happened at the end, but by looking at the case as it was at the time that the lawyer had to make the judgment at the beginning of the process. That seemed a very fair point, so that hindsight is not applied to the decision but that it can be said that, when the lawyer had to make the decision, the question was whether the case had merit.

<a name="40714-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>The amendments meet many of the concerns raised. I recognise that they did not respond to all of the noble Lord&#039;s concerns, which is why, following discussion, the Government proposed Amendment No. 28H. It enables the High Court to award legal aid for the review application even if no reconsideration order or Court of Appeal referral has been made.
</p>

<a name="40714-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>It is important to be clear exactly what Amendment No. 28H means. It remains our intention that the High Court&#039;s power to award legal aid will be used only in exceptional cases. In the majority of cases, the tribunal will be best placed to make the decision on funding at the reconsideration. At that stage, the tribunal will possess the relevant information to decide whether, when the review application was made, the lawyer was right to have pursued the case. By comparison, the High Court will simply consider, on the papers, whether there may have been an error of law&#151;in other words, whether the case should be looked at further.
</p>

<a name="40714-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>Although we accept that there may be circumstances where it is appropriate for the High Court to award legal aid for a review application, even if an order for reconsideration or a referral is not made, regulations will be made to prescribe tightly when that power can be exercised. An example of when the power might be used is when a reference to the Court of Appeal is made. Another might be when a review application which has good prospects of success is rendered unsuccessful following a lead decision of a case, which had not been decided at the time the application was made.

<p><a name="st_147"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, it is quite clear what I am after in Amendments Nos. 1 and 2. We have debated the topic. I did not move the equivalent amendment on Report for various reasons, which those of us who attended the debate will understand.

<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="40714-14_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My Lords, I had an interesting discussion with the noble Lord a few weeks ago about the issues underlying the amendments, and he has since written to me about them. He made the point that, where the regulator uses his powers to appoint a director or a manager to a CIC, it would be helpful if the regulator could obtain the consent of the CIC&#039;s existing directors to his action. That would reduce the risk of the regulator acting in a heavy-handed way, and of the appointment leading to tensions within the management team.
</p>

<a name="40714-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>We would all agree that it would be desirable to get the consent of the CIC&#039;s directors to an appointment, and that the regulator should aim to do it where possible. However, it will not always be realistic to expect to obtain the board&#039;s agreement. As the noble Lord and I have discussed, an appointment under either of the powers will be made only where the CIC in question is in breach of at least one of the default conditions set out in Clause 39, and the regulator thinks that the power must be exercised to maintain confidence in CICs. The situation will therefore be quite serious.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1295"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1295</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40714-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>In such a position, we would of course expect the regulator to be in dialogue with the CIC concerned. He will surely need to talk to the directors of the CIC to find out what is going on, and what needs to be done to fix it. If he has not done so, he will not be able to provide good reasons for taking action, and will, quite rightly, be challenged. But there can be no certainty that the board of the CIC will co-operate with him, let alone that it will agree with the regulator&#039;s decision. For instance, the regulator may decide to appoint a director or a manager to a CIC because he considers that the existing directors are not capable without assistance of remedying the problem. In some cases, one can easily imagine that the existing directors might not agree. In other cases, the board might be so split that no agreement was possible.
</p>

<a name="40714-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, appreciates those points. I expect that is why his amendments require the regulator to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;take all reasonable steps to ensure&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>the consent of the board, rather than to require their consent in all cases. However, I do not think that this additional measure is necessary. That is because the regulator is already required by the general principles of administrative law not to behave unreasonably. He is also subject to the specific constraints in the Bill, to act in accordance with good regulatory practice and to use his supervisory powers only where necessary. This means that where the regulator acted improperly or unreasonably in making an appointment, he would be subject to challenge.
</p>

<a name="40714-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>If the appointment of a manager or director by the regulator is unnecessary, or inappropriate, the regulator would be in breach of his duty in Clause 39 to use his powers only to the extent necessary; and the CIC would be able to appeal to the appeal officer. The Government brought forward amendments at Report stage to require the regulator to give reasons for his decisions and to allow the appeal officer to consider appeals on matters of law as well as fact.

</p>

<a name="40714-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>Overall, the Bill together with existing administrative law already place significant constraints on the way in which the regulator may use his power. As I have said in previous debates, our aim is that the regulator should have a light but proportionate touch and we think that the current provisions of the Bill achieve that. I hope that in the light of that explanation the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, will be reassured and will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

</ul>

</p>




<p><a name="st_155"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this modest and simple amendment, I should first like to comment briefly on the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Richard, yesterday took me to task for having allowed a note of acidity to creep into my speech. My only comment on that is that, given my view of the recent saga regarding the Government&#039;s conduct towards the House of Lords, I thought my reaction was more than justified. I have nothing to add beyond that.
</p>

<a name="40714-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>The first of my two amendments is rooted in doubt and uncertainty as to whether the Government actually mean what they say. I should be interested to hear what the noble and learned Lord says in reply. It is admirable that the Bill says that Ministers,

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>were inserted. I see no reason why they should not be, and that would underline the Government&#039;s stated intention and is in no way contrary to what Ministers state is their intention. I hope therefore that the noble and learned Lord will in an act of grace, which would go some way to comfort me, seek to accept the amendment on behalf of the Government. There is no need for me to prolong my remarks. The meaning of the amendment is obvious. I beg to move.

<a name="40714-15_spnew5"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   Amendment No. 6 is grouped with Amendment No. 5, although the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, has not yet spoken to it. It seems to me that Amendment No. 6 adds enormous force to the issue. At present, Clause 1(3) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;Ministers of the Crown must not seek to influence particular judicial decisions through any special access to the judiciary&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="40714-15_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </b>   Perhaps the noble Viscount will forgive me for intervening. He is right: I did not refer to Amendment No. 6. Perhaps I should have done, but I thought that it would be simpler to keep the two separate, even though they are grouped together. After all, I have a right to move Amendment No. 6 in due course.
</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="40714-15_spnew7"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   I am in the hands of the Committee. I think that Amendment No. 6 is necessary and that, with that amendment, Amendment No. 5 is unnecessary. However, I shall happily wait until the noble Lord moves Amendment No. 6 before I say why it is desirable. I do not know whether the noble and learned Lord would find it more convenient to deal with the two together or separately. Perhaps he could give us some guidance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="40714-15_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   I rise because my name is attached to Amendment No. 5. I had expected my noble friend to speak to both amendments together, and I think that it would have been helpful if he had. Although I put my name to Amendment No. 5 and not Amendment No. 6, on reconsideration I greatly prefer Amendment No. 6. But the fact is that my concern about this issue is fairly obvious.
</p>

<a name="40714-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>It is a rather extraordinary suggestion that Ministers should seek to interfere by having private conversations with judges in order to try to obtain a particular decision. I do not think that is very likely to happen. The idea that they will carry out personal lobbying does not seem to me to be the real threat. The real threat is that there may be an attempt by Ministers, through briefing and so on, to stir up the media to create a campaign on why a particular line taken by the judiciary is wrong and to force the judiciary down a route where the law would not take them. Indeed, it is possible that a Minister would do something that I considered to be extremely unwise, as the Home Secretary did the other day. He commented on the kind of judgment that he would like to see in the case of the individual who had been sentenced in Portugal for offences in connection with football hooliganism.

<a name="40714-16_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </b>   I think that it is the will of the Committee that I speak briefly to Amendment No. 6. I am very happy to do so, and I apologise to all concerned if I made it in any way awkward for them by my failure to do so before.

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>are, first, rather suggestive that people have a habit of making secret approaches to the judiciary. I think that that is totally unjustified. Secondly, without those words, the clause means all that one wants it to mean, and I cannot see that anything is gained by adding those words to it. I shall be most interested to hear what the noble and learned Lord says, but I cannot think that the words are necessary and it is my intention, in due course, to move that amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="40714-16_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   As my name is added to Amendment No. 6, I, too, want to say that I cannot see any reason that the obligation under Clause 1(3) should be restricted to cases where the Minister has &quot;special access to the judiciary&quot;, whatever those words may mean. So far as I am concerned, they do not have any obvious meaning.
</p>

<a name="40714-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>In any event, the restriction is undesirable because it may suggest that Ministers can seek to influence particular judicial decisions when they are not taking advantage of special access. Is that really what the Government intend? I am sure that that is not the case.
</p>




<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="40714-16_spnew6"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   I can now complete what I was trying to say. I would put the point rather higher than the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. If one says that Ministers cannot seek to influence particular judicial decisions through any special access to the judiciary, one is accepting that they can seek to influence particular judicial decisions by any other <br>&nbsp;<br>

means. There is only one possible way in which it is proper for the Government to seek to influence particular decisions and that is by addressing the court either as a party to the case or as an <i>amicus curiae</i> if they are allowed to appear as such. But there is no other way in which it is proper for the Government to seek to influence particular judicial decisions. The words should be removed from the clause and then we would not need the words in Amendment No. 5.
</p>




<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="40714-16_spnew7"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   First, as a layman, I have listened to many debates in this House and I have always gathered that when extra words are added to a measure in this way, thus qualifying it, that immediately implies that anything not included in those words is then allowed. Therefore, as it stands, the clause specifically allows other influence to take place.
</p>

<a name="40714-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>Secondly, I think that the wording is intended to deal with the concordat, which we do not know much about. It is trying to say that in the concordat between Ministers and the judiciary there should not be any mechanism by which one can influence the other. I was concerned when I heard about the concordat earlier because I thought that it should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. At present, the judiciary should be responsible to Parliament and not to a Minister in another place. We are not talking about a true separation of powers, and I think that this is one of the hidden, underlying examples of where the powers are not separated because we have a concordat that is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny.

<a name="40714-16_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   To answer the point made by the noble Earl, the concordat is printed in full as an annex to the report. The amendments that needed to be made to the Bill as a result of the concordat were either inserted into the Bill in the Select Committee or the Lord Chancellor said that he would do so.
</p>




<p><a name="st_172"></a>
<a name="40714-16_spnew12"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   I thought that a concordat could be changed subsequently without parliamentary scrutiny&#151;that is, it is a side agreement. Although the concordat may be as it is at present, future changes to it would not necessarily be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. But I do not understand these matters properly.

<p><a name="st_173"></a>
<a name="40714-16_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   I am sure that if elements of the concordat were not in the Bill and it needed to be changed, it would be fully debated. If they were in the Bill, one would need primary legislation in order to alter it.

<p><a name="st_175"></a>
<a name="40714-16_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   I start by making two procedural points. First, the speech made by the noble <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1301"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1301</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord, Lord Peyton, yesterday was a little acidic, but I have always thought that the point of the noble Lord was his acid. I hold him in the highest possible affection and did not take any offence whatever yesterday in relation to his speech.
</p>

<a name="40714-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>Secondly, with regard to the Committee stage yesterday evening and, again, this afternoon, perhaps I may say as a spectator&#151;I feel like a bit of a spectator in this&#151;that our proceedings are becoming somewhat private. No one appears to be able to make a speech from beginning to end; everyone who speaks is primarily a member of the committee; and everyone else who then intervenes is treated like an outsider. I do not know what other noble Lords think, but it may be more sensible for us to proceed in the conventional, rather than the unconventional, way.
</p>

<a name="40714-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>I turn to the points raised in the two amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, and, first, to the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;through any special access to the judiciary&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40714-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The subsection was expressed in that way precisely for the reason given by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe. There are cases in which, quite legitimately, a Minister will wish to influence the court. As the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, said, one such occasion is when he is appearing as a party in the proceedings. He will seek to influence, and that is why the clause is worded in that way.
</p>

<a name="40714-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, expressed the fear that public campaigns might be used to seek to put pressure on the judiciary. That is dealt with by the Contempt of Court Act. The courts have been robust in stating those things that they can resist. This is slightly different. Where juries are involved, the courts have quite rightly been much more susceptible and tried to ensure that no sort of campaign is started. But broadly I do not think that there is much dispute between us as to what we seek to achieve; namely, no undue influence on the judges; that it is plainly quite legitimate to argue one&#039;s case in court; and not to start campaigns or behave improperly in relation to that, but that is dealt with by the Contempt of Court Act.
</p>

<a name="40714-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>Amendment No. 5 seeks to insert the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;under any circumstances or by any means&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Following up what the noble Earl said, it is best not to insert words that are unnecessary. To insert those words after the words &quot;must not&quot; would not add anything to the Bill. &quot;Must not&quot; is absolute. It does not need further clarification. Amendment No. 5 is unnecessary to achieve the purpose that the noble Lord wishes to achieve. In those circumstances, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

I just wanted them to underline what the Government have said. After all that has happened, one sometimes has doubts, if I may put this gently, as to the durability of the Government&#039;s intentions. I say no more than that. I am content to beg leave to withdraw the amendment. However, before I do that, as Amendment No. 6 is grouped with this amendment, I am not at all sure what the noble and learned Lord said; that is, whether he is willing to accept Amendment No. 6 or whether he will take it away and think about it.

</p>

<a name="40714-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>In Clause 1(4) the Government state that the Minister must have regard to&#151;the key words are &quot;have regard to&quot;&#151;the need to defend the independence of the judiciary, the need to provide support for the judiciary and the need for the public interest to be represented in decisions affecting the administration of justice. I believe that the words &quot;have regard to&quot; in the context are extremely and undesirably feeble. Regard can be had to all sorts of matters. For example, regard may be had to the outcome of next week&#039;s by-election.

<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="40714-17_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I was speaking in a general sense. The words &quot;have regard to&quot; do not indicate any priority for the defence of judicial independence over other factors. On the other hand, I believe that Amendments Nos. 10 to 13 go too far the other way by imposing duties on the Minister which appear to be justiciable. Amendment No. 16 goes further still because the use of the word &quot;unlawful&quot; makes it plain that the relevant duties are intended to be justiciable.
</p>

<a name="40714-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>That is of particular importance in relation to Clause 1(4)(b). That is the paragraph that refers to,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;the need for the judiciary to have the support necessary to enable them to exercise their functions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>If that is a justiciable duty, it could be for the court to decide whether the Minister had provided the support needed by the judiciary in the event of a dispute. I do not know how, in those circumstances, one could possibly find an impartial court to decide that issue. But if one could, it would then extend the existing powers of the court to control powers of spending by the Government. That is an undesirable step towards government by judges rather than by elected representatives.
</p>

<a name="40714-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>Amendment No. 9 replaces the words, &quot;have regard to&quot; with &quot;respect&quot; in relation to the independent judiciary. Amendment No. 19 creates similar wording in relation to the rule of law. I believe that &quot;respect&quot; is stronger than &quot;have regard to&quot;. It creates a higher benchmark for the Minister to apply when he or she is making a decision, but it leaves that decision on issues such as the needs of the judiciary within the discretion of the Minister. It does not create an objective test that can be examined and enforced by the courts. I think that that is the right balance. I beg to move.

These are very fine distinctions and it is highly unlikely that we will find cases before the court in which the Secretary of State of the day has to justify the significance of the word that is used in the statute.

At this stage that is inappropriate because a decision was not reached on that last night. Therefore, I cannot press Amendment No. 10 today. However, more importantly for this purpose, it deals with the question of the right word.

Whether or not one wants justiciability, this is not the right way to get it, without risking incorporating justiciability by the back door. I do not think Amendment No. 10 does that, but the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart is concerned about it.

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>Some form of wording must be put in Clause 1(4) which is vastly stronger than just saying, &quot;Yes, we take the independence of the judiciary into account, but we take into account a lot of other things.

One says, &quot;Well, I have considered it&quot;, but with no duty as to the outcome of that consideration. The consideration has to be in a particular direction. I think that certainly one, if not more, noble and learned Lord made that same point in the report.

It seems to me that whether we use the words &quot;have regard to&quot;, &quot;respect&quot; or &quot;take all reasonable steps to ensure&quot;, or whatever, Clause 1 is almost incomprehensible unless the Minister adequately has regard to the factors in subsection (4) in order to fulfil the guarantee that he has a duty to fulfil.

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, with great respect to him, is correct in saying that the primary obligation is in   Clause 1(1); and I suppose that the operational paragraph in respect to that is subsection (4). So there is an absolute obligation in subsection (1) to uphold the independence of the judiciary; and under subsection (4), the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs shall have regard to whether or not he needs to defend that independence. In my submission, that is an unfortunate dilution of the obligation in Clause 1(1), and for that <br>&nbsp;<br>

The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, was much keener to enforce these rights by proceedings than anybody else in the committee.

I was saying that in no way am I seeking by the back door, with Amendment No. 10, to render it justiciable. I have not yet spoken on the question of whether or not I think it should be justiciable.

</p>

<a name="40714-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>As I said yesterday in response to the rule of law amendment, it is not the intention to work radical changes to general constitutional principles outside the scope of the Bill. The &quot;have regard to&quot; language in Clause 1(4) was decided upon to ensure that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1307"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1307</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord   Chancellor has a duty to act in accordance with the stated objectives while at the same time acknowledging that policy formulation and the substance of decisions must be for him but subject to that duty; that delivery of the objectives is not always within his exclusive gift; and that his existing constitutional position as a member of the Cabinet should not be undermined. I hope that it is obvious to Members of the Committee that the present wording of Clause 1(4) in no way detracts from the fact that the Lord Chancellor will be bound, along with all other Ministers, by the general duty to uphold the independence of the judiciary in Clause 1(1). This preserves collective responsibility because the same duty will be applied to all Ministers.
</p>

<a name="40714-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, would impose on the Secretary of State an absolute duty to take whatever steps were necessary to ensure that the outcomes in Clause 1(4) were achieved. That would leave the Secretary of State exposed to judicial review on the merits of the question of what is and what is not a necessary step to achieve the objective in question. That would be completely unprecedented; it would impose an unacceptable burden on policy formulation and decision-making by the Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="40714-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>The problem would be particularly acute given that informed and reasonable opinion could differ substantially on the question at issue, particularly in relation to such controversial matters as the rule of law which are still in the clause. That may not be a very good point to make if the noble Viscount is putting that to one side for the purposes of this part of the debate. The amendment also fails to take account of the broader picture. As I said, the objective specified will not always be in the exclusive gift of the Lord Chancellor; the same is the position now. It therefore does not make sense to impose an absolute duty on the Lord Chancellor as the noble Viscount&#039;s amendment would do.
</p>

<a name="40714-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>There is one further reason why I oppose the noble Viscount&#039;s amendment. It fails to take proper account of the role of the Lord Chancellor in the context of Parliament. The absolute legal duty created by the amendment would apply to the Lord Chancellor when he was exercising functions in connection with parliamentary proceedings. As the duty would be in absolute terms, with no reference to such proceedings, questions could arise on the legality of the Lord Chancellor&#039;s actions in Parliament, including his position on Bills and the content of his speeches. I am sure that the content of some of my speeches would have been alleged to contravene parts of the proposal that the noble Viscount makes in his amendment, but I cannot believe that that is what he had in mind.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>I will not deal with the amendment tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, as he will deal with it separately.

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>Amendment No. 9, spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, would insert the words &quot;must respect&quot; in place of &quot;have regard to&quot;. An obligation to have regard to something has accepted meaning in <br>&nbsp;<br>

public law; an obligation to respect something does not have the same meaning. That may not be a reason not to support it, as it may be an indication that it is not intended to be justiciable. It would, however, be a step into the unknown. It might be stronger or weaker than the duty imposed by the existing text; we simply do not know in legal terms. The Lord Chancellor would have difficulty in determining what he had to do to comply with the duty. That would not be an acceptable outcome of our deliberations on the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40714-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Having said that, I note noble Lords&#039; concerns about whether the wording is adequate. I will think about it, not with a view to coming back with something that leads to the possibility of legal proceedings, but with a view to coming back with something that, if possible, reflects&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, said, although these were not quite his words&#151;the appropriate importance of the duty being imposed. I take that to include all the sorts of things that the noble Lord was saying. &quot;Gravity&quot; would be an even better word. In those circumstances, I invite noble Lords either to withdraw or not to move their amendments.

On behalf of the working group of the Judges&#039; Council, Lady Justice Arden argued that Clause 1,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;should be given some enhanced status to prevent inadvertent implied repeal. It is not a question of entrenching it because it would be open to Parliament to depart from judicial independence if it wished to do so, although it would have to use clear language. The enhanced status would be achieved by imposing an interpretive obligation along the lines of section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998. That provides that, so far as it is possible to do so, primary and subordinate legislation must be read in effect in a way which is compatible with convention rights. We suggest that <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40714-19_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </b>   Amendments Nos. 15 and 16A that are grouped seem somewhat oddly placed in a clause that is directed towards spelling out the duty of the Lord Chancellor. The amendments appear to seek to impose a duty on the courts, a restrictive interpretation, which is a bid to entrench the provisions of Clause 1.
</p>

<a name="40714-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>Amendment No. 15 seems in a sense otiose, even if it is in the right place in the Bill. If one pauses to consider, it is inconceivable that judges would interpret legislation, be it primary or subordinate, in a way that suggested that it was not intended to be compatible with the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. It seems to me that in her evidence Lady Justice Arden was making a proposition that is certainly unconventional in our constitutional law. We have not normally espoused the methods of entrenchment of the kind that she suggested. Judges are free to interpret the law as they like, but something that is plainly incompatible with the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law is unlikely to be a matter giving rise to great doubt as to the intentions of Parliament. It also seems inconceivable that such a measure would have reached the statute book without the intentions of Parliament having been made clear.
</p>

<a name="40714-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>Amendment No. 16A appears to seek to draw on the experience of the Human Rights Act to empower a declaration of incompatibility to be given by the court. That raises grave questions of uncertainty. Here, to some extent, I embrace the arguments advanced on an earlier amendment by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, about what is meant by &quot;the rule of law&quot;. In the case of the Human Rights Act on which this appears to be based, the provisions of law that a particular new provision is declared to be incompatible are spelled out clearly in law. However, we have no such agreed acceptance as to what is meant by &quot;the rule of law&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40714-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>I do not think it wise that a general constitutional principle should be translated almost inadvertently into something that it would be open to the courts to seek to interpret in a way that might be unpredictable to Parliament at this stage.

In respect to the clause, it is right that the provisions should be there as declaratory of constitutional principle, but they should not be capable of giving rise <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40714-19_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I would like to be clear about the noble Lord&#039;s objections to the expression, &quot;the rule of law&quot;, in this context. I presume that, at the time that the European Convention on Human Rights was incorporated in English, law the noble Lord supported that initiative by the Government. If that is so, in principle the noble Lord must accept that it is possible by the methods set out in the amendments&#151;indeed, it is desirable by the methods set out in the amendments&#151;to test primary legislation against the principles set out in the European convention.
</p>

<a name="40714-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>If the noble Lord accepts that, the only difference between the requirement to test primary legislation against the rule of law and the requirement to test primary legislation against the convention is that, unlike the convention, the rule of law is not set out in a document that has been interpreted by judges over a period of time. If my analysis is correct, surely the only objection that the noble Lord can have to this amendment, particularly to Amendment No. 16A, is that the rule of law is not set out in specific terms in a legislative document against which primary legislation can be measured.

There is no such particularity about the rule of law. I submit, with respect, that it would be difficult to do that. It would be almost as difficult as to say that the courts would be entitled to strike down a measure because it was incompatible with democracy, which this Parliament is deemed to favour and support. Democracy, the rule of law, and justice are broad constitutional principles&#151;they are not precise rules that are capable of enforcement by the courts. It is legislating without clarity as to what would be the precise consequence to give effect to the amendments that have been set out in this way.

Lord   Lloyd of Berwick, for whom we all have the greatest admiration&#151;I am worried about Amendment No. 16A. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;If a court is satisfied that a provision of primary or secondary legislation is incompatible with either the independence of the judiciary or the rule of law it&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>the court&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;may make a declaration of that incompatibility&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>I am keeping an open mind about that, and the Committee may feel that it is right. However, although we had, if I may say so, a very strong committee, with two retired Law Lords on it, we were never asked to consider the matter of incompatibility with the independence of the judiciary. We were conscious of the independence of the rule of law.
</p>

<a name="40714-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>The Committee may feel that I am making heavy weather of this; I hope not. It is something new. I recollect no statutory provision that required a court to consider incompatibility with the independence of the judiciary. It is not an easy matter. In some circumstances, it may give rise to great problems of interpretation. I mention it just in case the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, would care to make any comment about it or even say that it is something new and something that he would prefer to reconsider.
</p>




<p><a name="st_217"></a>
<a name="40714-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   I rise primarily to support Amendment No. 15, moved by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, for the reasons that he gave. Secondarily, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Renton, for the kind things that he has just said about me. However, I shall duck the question that he asked, by suggesting that it might be answered by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, whose name stands first in respect of that amendment. Having ducked that question, I shall speak briefly to Amendment No. 16, which is based, quite simply, on Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, which provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way that is incompatible with a convention right.

</p>

<a name="40714-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>If Clause 1 is to be an effective&#151;I emphasise the word &quot;effective&quot;&#151;substitute for the presence of the Lord Chancellor in Cabinet, which was, as I understood from the debate on 12 March, the original intention of the clause and, I imagine, is still the intention of the clause, it must be given some teeth. Unless it is enforceable, a statement of duty is, in the words of Professor Jolowicz, which we all learnt yesterday, sometimes called &quot;<i>lex imperfecta</i>&quot;. I prefer the immortal words of Daisy Ashford, who talked about &quot;piffle before the wind&quot;. By themselves, the words mean nothing, unless they are, in some way, enforceable.
</p>

<a name="40714-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>The duty is specifically imposed on Ministers by Parliament, and the only way to give it meaning and effect is to say simply that, if a Minister acts in a way that is contrary to the duty imposed by Parliament or proposes to act in such a way, he is acting unlawfully. What on earth could be wrong with that?
</p>

<a name="40714-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>I accept that the matter could probably be tested in the courts, although that would be for the courts to decide. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, <br>&nbsp;<br>

said that that would be undesirable and that there would be too much litigation. There would not. There is no reason to suppose that anybody could bring proceedings to enforce the duty unless he had some <i>locus standi</i>. In the absence of someone with <i>locus standi</i>, it would, in accordance with the ordinary law, be for the Attorney-General to bring proceedings as guardian of the public interest, a well known role of the Attorney-General. It will happen once in a blue moon, no more frequently. It will not happen often because, one hopes, Ministers will not act in breach of their duty.

</p>




<p><a name="st_218"></a>
<a name="40714-20_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </b>   Can the noble and learned Lord recall any instance in which the Attorney-General has brought proceedings against a Cabinet colleague that is at all cognate to the circumstance that he suggests?
</p>




<p><a name="st_219"></a>
<a name="40714-20_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   I am afraid that my hearing aid was not acting correctly. Perhaps I may see the noble Lord afterwards and answer him privately. I did not quite hear what he said.

</p>

<a name="40714-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord cannot be challenging the idea&#151;I am sure that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor would not challenge it either&#151;that, in certain circumstances, the Attorney-General has a duty to act on behalf of the public in enforcing a duty owed to the public. It is a well established role for the Attorney-General. It would happen very infrequently, but, in the absence of some form of ultimate fall-back on the power of the courts, the duty means nothing. That is why I propose that the amendment should be made.
</p>




<p><a name="st_220"></a>
<a name="40714-20_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </b>   I respectfully support and endorse what has just been said. Things will have come to a pretty pass&#151;not, in practical terms, a foreseeable pass&#151;if the Attorney-General were to take such steps against one of his own Ministers&#151;I do not mean one of &quot;his own&quot; Ministers; I mean &quot;one of his colleagues&quot;. None the less, that does not deprive what is proposed of any force. It will concentrate Ministers&#039; minds. Why? Because, as they contemplate one version of draft legislation as against another, an official will say, &quot;Don&#039;t forget, Minister, that this is legally enforceable, and you may get somebody taking you to court on judicial review because you have arguably contravened it&quot;. It will concentrate the mind. I have a little experience of such situations, so I regard that as entirely practical and foreseeable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_221"></a>
<a name="40714-20_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   I want to make two points. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, said that such a move would concentrate minds. It may do, but one must ask what it is that would become justiciable according to the amendment tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick.
</p>

<a name="40714-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>With the amendment, the Home Secretary would have obligations to uphold the rule of law. Is it being seriously argued that somebody could take the Home Secretary to court on an application for judicial review <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1314"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1314</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

because he had not provided enough police in Liverpool? Could the Lord Chancellor be taken to court because he had not provided enough judges in Cleethorpes? Once the doors are opened to such an obligation, the possibilities for and ramifications of judicial&#151;I hesitate to use the word &quot;meddling&quot; because it would not be sufficiently polite to the judges&#151;intervention are enormous.
</p>

<a name="40714-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>I cannot believe that when the noble and learned Lord who has just sat down was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland he would seriously have welcomed a situation in which, under an obligation to uphold the rule of law, practically whatever he did in terms of   security in the Province would be potentially justiciable presumably by any individual who claimed to be affected by it. It is much too wide. That is my principal argument against Amendment No. 16.
</p>

<a name="40714-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>It is all very well for the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, to say that there have to be some teeth. There may have to be a clear statement of what the Minister responsible has to do, but to open the floodgates to the extent that this amendment would, in my very respectful submission to the Committee, is going much too far.
</p>

<a name="40714-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>I had thought that the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Lloyd, had ungrouped the other two amendments. But as regards Amendments Nos. 15 and 16A, I feel for the poor judge. What does he have to do under Amendment No. 16A? The amendment states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;If a court is satisfied&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>so the judge has to be satisfied&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;that a provision of primary or secondary legislation is incompatible with either&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>of two concepts, which are pretty inchoate and certainly are not expressed, are not defined and are not codified&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a>&quot;the independence of the judiciary or the rule of law it may make a declaration of that incompatibility&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>That would impose an extraordinary burden on a judge.
</p>

<a name="40714-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>In effect, that says that a judge should have the power to strike down&#151;or make a declaration of incompatibility, which is much the same thing&#151;an Act of Parliament on the basis that he, the judge, considers that it is incompatible with,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a>&quot;the independence of the judiciary&#039;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>or the operation of the rule of law.
</p>

<a name="40714-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>Sitting on this side of the House, holding the views that the House knows that I hold on Europe and European development, I have heard time and again from the Benches opposite arguments about the constitutionality of the absolute necessity for enforcing the sovereignty of Parliament against the great intrusions that are coming from Brussels. One should not hand over to courts the possibility of striking down Acts of Parliament&#151;indeed, whether primary or secondary legislation.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1315"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1315</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40714-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>There is a certain inconsistency in the approach put forward in this amendment. To ask judges, in effect, to judge the constitutionality or otherwise of an Act of Parliament is a very dangerous road down which we should not go.

<p><a name="st_222"></a>
<a name="40714-21_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   I should like to comment on that. I have some comments to make on Amendments Nos. 15 and 16A and several to make on Amendment No. 16. I think that what the noble Lord, Lord Richard, has just said is nonsense since <i>Pepper </i>v<i> Hart</i>. In <i>Pepper </i>v<i> Hart</i>, because law passed by the British Parliament was not compatible with the intention of some European legislation, I thought that the courts looked at it and either struck it down or altered it. I do not know the detail.
</p>




<p><a name="st_223"></a>
<a name="40714-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   The point is that that is a matter put up by way of complaint. In other words, the fact that a British court has to strike something down because it is incompatible with the European Court is a matter of complaint being made by the other side, not a matter of pride.
</p>




<p><a name="st_224"></a>
<a name="40714-21_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   The British courts are having to do that already. To say that this is a totally novel concept is not valid. I do not see why, if we are erecting a Supreme Court, it should not be able to defend democracy and itself. Surely, Amendment No. 15 simply states that the court can interpret anything in the correct way according to this Act. Amendment No 16A says that a court can declare that a provision is incompatible which, effectively, will send it back to Parliament for reconsideration. As we move more from common law to statute law, we have to look at other protections and protections to which we are not used. That is my first point. I do not agree with anything that the noble Lord, Lord Richard, said.
</p>

<a name="40714-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>Secondly, Amendment No. 16 is very important. As a member of the public, I do not see why any Minister should feel that he is above the law. In some foreign countries, we see that certain leaders are above the law. We do not respect that at all. I do not have any problems with the concept that a Minister should have to obey the law. From what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, said, I understand that this is an ECHR obligation. So putting it into this Bill will not alter the fact that the matter will be either brought to a British court or to the ECHR if a Minister does not obey the law. Taking the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, I do not think that this has got anything to do with the provision of police whatever. It is about the independence of the judiciary.
</p>




<p><a name="st_225"></a>
<a name="40714-21_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   Again, as a non-lawyer, I hesitate to intervene in this debate between many expert lawyers. But I am prompted by the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, who based a great deal of his argument around the effect of these amendments on the rule of law part of Clause 1. Of course, as the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, pointed out, we have not got around to dealing with the rule of law point.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1316"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1316</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40714-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>It is worth observing that the Judges&#039; Council and Lady Justice Arden, who were responsible for introducing the whole proposal, did not put forward the proposal in connection with the rule of law at all. On referring to the examination of witnesses and question 713 in Volume 2 of the Select Committee report, the whole cross-examination at that point, and her evidence, was based on the subject of the independence of the judiciary. It was in that connection that Lady Justice Arden suggested that there were relevant precedents and that the matter could be appropriately dealt with in the way that she suggested.
</p>

<a name="40714-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>She also made it absolutely clear in response to a number of questions from the Lord Chancellor&#151;notably, questions 720, 721 and 722&#151;that she was concerned about inadvertent implied repeal. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a>&quot;we would all agree that we . . .  would not want inadvertent repeal of, or limitations&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Lady Justice Arden also made it perfectly clear that, ultimately, of course Parliament could make specific enactments and that the principle of parliamentary sovereignty was not in question.
</p>

<a name="40714-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>It is at least worth considering whether the proposal put forward by the Judges&#039; Council and by Lady Justice Arden, which was concerned with the independence of the judiciary, can stand up if we take away the rule of law question with all the difficulties that have been legitimately raised about the definition of the rule of law. As the proposal came from the Judges&#039; Council, at least we should consider it on the basis that it proposed it.
</p>

<a name="40714-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>My second point concerns the question of legal enforceability where, as noble Lords who heard my speech last night will understand, we have got back to my King Charles&#039;s head and the whole question of the enforceability of Clause 1. I apologise to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, for saying last night that I thought that it was inconceivable that the clause would be made enforceable. Here he is making a perfectly good and effective proposal for making it enforceable, particularly in connection with the independence of the judiciary.
</p>

<a name="40714-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>Again, it is worth our considering&#151;we have all these difficulties that have been accepted about the rule of law issue&#151;whether this is a matter concerning the independence of the judiciary where it would be better to have a legally enforceable clause.
</p>




<p><a name="st_226"></a>
<a name="40714-21_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Onslow: </b>   Perhaps another non-lawyer may intervene but temporarily. I fail to understand, if one puts a duty on someone to do something and then he or she does not do it, that it should not be enforceable in a court of law. There is no point in doing that unless one does.

<a name="40714-21_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Brennan: </b>   Those of us who did not serve on the Select Committee have not suffered the contagion of constitutional enthusiasm, which some of its members are displaying in this debate. This is a chapter dealing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1317"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1317</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with the judiciary, a chapter on constitution. Inevitably there is a desire on the part of a convinced democrat and constitutionally minded person to seek to use such legislation as a vehicle for adding on whatever might take their constitutional fancy as the debate goes on. That is totally inappropriate.
</p>

<a name="40714-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Both of these amendments use the phrase,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a>&quot;the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>The independence of the judiciary, in terms of its definition, occupies some seven or eight pages of the United Nations Basic Principles on the independence of the judiciary covering everything from appointment to security of tenure, unreasonable interference and so forth. So the inchoate nature observed by my noble friend Lord Richard is illustrated as regards the independence of the judiciary just as it is on the rule of law.
</p>

<a name="40714-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>Let me give an example. Let us suppose that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with the agreement of the Cabinet, decided that economic circumstances in the country required a 30 per cent cut in judicial salaries, or even pensions. In many countries it would be plausibly argued that, whatever the intent, that would in fact interfere with the independence of the judiciary because it would affect their security of tenure and their independence from state salary considerations. That has arisen in many countries as a constitutional argument. I simply cannot accept that the phrase, &quot;the independence of the judiciary&quot; has some kind of purist interpretation easily applied by a court which has to determine whether or not it is being observed.

</p>

<a name="40714-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>Turning to the rule of law, the debate we are having now may be repeated later, in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in this context, and it is the elision of the phrase &quot;rule of law&quot; with the contents of the Human Rights Act. The preamble to the Act refers to the rule of law, but none of the clauses of the convention and none of the sections of our Act refer to it&#151;and they do so with consideration. That is because the convention and the Act set out specific rights which become justiciable and in respect of which as to legislation there may be a declaration of incompatibility. So it is entirely misleading to invite us to treat the rule of law as readily to be assimilated with the provisions of the Human Rights Act and easily applicable in interpreting clauses if they are amended in this way. That is not so.
</p>

<a name="40714-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>The inchoate nature of these two concepts, as my noble friend Lord Richard put it, illustrates how I began. This is a chapter about the judiciary in our constitutional history. We are not accustomed to debating constitutional legislation in this place; it rarely happens. Distinguished though the lawyers are on the Select Committee, I was not able to identify any one of them as a specialist constitutional lawyer, nor do I see one in the Chamber today. When we seek to add a little bit to this chapter, as I call it, we must be extremely conservative.

</p>

<a name="40714-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>The time may come when we do consider in this House the general declaratory principles of a constitution. In order to do that, there should be full consultation and full <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1318"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1318</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

debate before it reaches this House. The example is that of the American Constitution. The first articles are declaratory. It is in the main the subsequent amendments that cause litigation in the United States because it was by those amendments that specific rights were created as regards freedom of expression and so forth which then became justiciable and enforceable. In America they do not litigate Article 1 of the Constitution, and neither should we, in the debate on this clause or on others, seek to introduce into this legislation about the judiciary general concepts of constitutional significance. If we are tempted to do so, we should look at them with strict intellectual rigour.

<a name="40714-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   The difficulty here is that the noble Lord was not present at the meetings of the Select Committee. Throughout the two or three months of our consideration of the Bill, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor promised us a provision to cover the rule of law. We are still waiting for a provision to cover the rule of law&#151;or at least I think we are, but perhaps I am wrong.
</p>




<p><a name="st_229"></a>
<a name="40714-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   The remark of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, is profoundly unfair, for two reasons. First, the points made by my noble friend Lord Brennan were not remotely related to the detail of the rule of law provision. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, shakes his head, but they were not. The noble and learned Lord is seeking to imply that the precise terms of the provision affected what my noble friend Lord Brennan said, but they most certainly did not. The point made by my noble friend, one that in my view is entirely fair, was that the way that the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary are drawn in these provisions has a huge effect on the constitution. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, seeks to respond to that by saying that I have taken such a long time to produce my rule of law clause that the point cannot readily be dealt with unless we are in Committee. With the greatest respect, that seems wrong.

not. With great respect to Lady Justice Arden, she herself is a company lawyer. The Judges&#039; Council embraces the entire gamut of the judiciary; I am not aware that any one of them would call himself a constitutional specialist.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>I turn to the intervention of the noble Earl. My whole point is that Clause 1 is declaratory, as are most constitutional principles. They are not by their nature intended to be enforceable before the courts. That is why in America the amendments arrived. They did so because people wanted specific rights.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para3"></a>

<a name="40714-22_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   From what the noble Lord, Lord   Brennan, has said, I gather that he thinks that because this Bill deals with broad constitutional principles it should not have been brought before this House before it had been discussed properly on a philosophical basis outside.

</p>




<p><a name="st_233"></a>
<a name="40714-22_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Brennan: </b>   No, I was saying that this particular Bill is limited in scope which has been reasonably investigated. To extend it beyond its present scope should not take place without the kind of debate outlined by the noble Earl.

<a name="40714-22_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, said that this Bill is of limited scope; but it is described as the Constitutional Reform Bill and it seeks to enact the biggest constitutional reform of the judicial arm of our country since the Act of Settlement. I must also say that I am rather concerned about the anxiety expressed on the Government Benches about the insertion of &quot;the rule of law&quot; in a document which seeks to guarantee constitutional reform.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>There should be nothing surprising to your Lordships&#039; Committee about the amendments under discussion, Amendments Nos. 15 and 16A. The approach they take is entirely familiar; the wording is almost identical to the wording in the Human Rights Act 1998, which was promoted from the Government Benches under the leadership of the noble Lord, Lord Richard.

</p>

<a name="40714-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>Amendment No. 15, which concerns the manner in which the courts should interpret primary legislation in the context of the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law, is simply taken from Section 3(1) of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1320"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1320</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Human Rights Act 1998. It could be cogently argued that the expression &quot;the independence of the judiciary&quot; is otiose because, I suspect, the 1998 Act has the effect of protecting the independence of the judiciary in exactly the same way as Amendment No. 15. So to the extent that the noble Lord is opposed to the application of Amendment No. 15 to the independence of the judiciary, he would be reneging on legislation promoted by the Government at a time when the noble Lord was the Leader of the House.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>That also applies to Amendment No. 16A.
</p>




<p><a name="st_237"></a>
<a name="40714-22_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   The noble Lord must not provoke me&#151;at least not too much. I am trying to follow his argument. He said that it is not necessary because there is already law dealing with the point. In which case, why bother?
</p>




<p><a name="st_238"></a>
<a name="40714-22_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I said that it was arguable that it was not necessary; not that it was not necessary. The purpose of my argument was to point out to the noble Lord that, far from being a novel constitutional concept, it was introduced by his own Government at the time the noble Lord was the Leader of your Lordships&#039; House and holding the great office of Lord   Privy Seal&#151;which, I am delighted to see, still has its usefulness today.

</p>

<a name="40714-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>The same argument applies to Amendment No. 16A. The declaration of incompatibility in relation to European convention rights is contained in the Human Rights Act 1998. I repeat that I would be very surprised to discover that the independence of the judiciary was not one of the ingredients of the European convention which was protected under the 1998 Act.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>So, far from being a novel concept, the independence of the judiciary as proposed in both amendments simply reiterates a right which already exists&#151;and yet the noble Lord, Lord Richard, seems to want to repudiate it. I accept that the introduction of the rule of law is novel, but not in the sense that it is a novel way of introducing the rule of law in our constitution; it is novel because the rule of law has not yet been set out in a detailed way so as to mimic the approach that our European friends have taken under the convention.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>In my submission, much of the rule of law in the United Kingdom is already reflected in the European convention. The only issues that arise are where the standards set by the European convention are not as high as the standards set under the common law. I see no difficulty in our judges developing jurisprudence to fill in those gaps; that has been the task of the common law in this country over the centuries.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>I am afraid that there have been some lamentable examples recently of the Government proposing legislation in the sphere of criminal law in which many provisions fall well below the standards that, throughout the 20th century, were regarded as the rightful standards that the prosecution should meet before a conviction was obtained. I have no fear at all at the thought that our judges might continue to develop the common law jurisprudence in relation to   criminal law under clauses such as those proposed <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_239"></a>
<a name="40714-22_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord   Kingsland, puts his argument clearly and defines the effect of what he is saying very well. Perhaps I may indicate, with the greatest respect, the dangers of what he is proposing.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>The purpose of Clause 1 is to seek to impose upon the office holder&#151;who is to be called the Lord Chancellor because of the vote yesterday&#151;similar obligations within government to those of the current Lord Chancellor. Those obligations are intended to be dealt with as part of the Executive, relying upon his special role within it. There is neither a desire for nor sense in making the role subject to court enforcement. It should depend upon the way in which the office holder performs the role; if he or she performs the role badly, then the accountability should be to Parliament and not to the court, as it currently is. Indeed, that view was taken by the Lord Chief Justice in the evidence that he gave to the Select Committee.

</p>

<a name="40714-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>That approach is taken because, admirable as the courts are, I do not think that in this country we want the courts to decide what the level of expenditure on police should be. Of course we do not. Nor do we want any suggestion that that kind of issue is justiciable before the courts. Nor do we want&#151;I would regard this as an unsatisfactory spectacle&#151;the Attorney-General of the day bringing the Chancellor of the Exchequer to court because it is alleged that he infringed Clause 1(1). Merely to say that that is the position seems to me to give the absurdity to the proposal that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, is suggesting.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, who was a member of the Select Committee&#151;but no worse for that&#151;exactly identified the purpose of the amendment, which was more limited than that being advanced now&#151;namely, it was to deal, as Lady Justice Arden said, with the possibility of inadvertent repeal or inadvertent inconsistency with Clause 1 of the Constitutional Reform Bill. That was a possibility that we all recognised, but I think I speak for the Members of the Committee when I say that we did not regard that as a particularly serious threat; we were much more concerned with the bigger issues of judicial independence and what the new office holder would do to give effect to it.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>Now, instead of simply dealing with the well-defined and limited point proposed by Lady Justice Arden, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggests that we should introduce a new body of undefined law&#151;the rule of law. We must remember that the rule of law is not an amorphous concept; it is enforced by reference to specific legal obligations. The noble Lord is saying that although a statute dealing with, for example&#151;and he may have this in mind&#151;previous misconduct evidence <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1322"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1322</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in a criminal trial might have a particular meaning now, before the clause is introduced, it could well be construed as meaning something different as a result of the effect of the reference to &quot;the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law&quot; in the Bill. So he is inviting the introduction of a whole new constitutional concept.

</p>

<a name="40714-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>That may well be&#151;I am fairly sure it is&#151;what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, wants, but I have absolutely no doubt that that has never been debated before, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord   Brennan. It is an extraordinarily wide-reaching proposal. To come to it first in a rather limited clause proposed by Lady Justice Arden, entirely sensibly, seems to me, with the greatest respect, not to be the way in which the Committee of the House should proceed.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, that we should be very rigorous to see what will be the effects of the matters we are proposing. But the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, seeks to go even further than that. With great respect, the noble and learned Lord has not been nearly as clear and straightforward as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. He wishes that acts done by a Minister, or proposals made by a Minister, or whatever Parliament does, should always be subject to the template of the rule of law or the independence of the judiciary.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>For example, if a Minister were to propose that there be an ouster of judicial review in relation to immigration and asylum cases, rather than the matter being decided by Parliament, it would instead be capable of being dealt with in the courts by proceedings being brought in court, with Parliament being, in effect, denied the opportunity to debate it. Noble Lords may think that that is a good idea if they believe that the courts are the best places to test policy considerations. That is not our constitution at the moment&#151;our constitution provides that Parliament has the opportunity to decide these matters.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>So let us be under no illusion that these three amendments&#151;I treat Amendment No. 16 as being in this group, although it is not&#151;would have very far-reaching effects. They are intended to give the courts powers that they currently do not have.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>May I adopt the argument of the noble Lord, Lord   Maclennan, as well? He makes two separate points&#151;first, that the duties were intended to be declaratory only. I accept that. Secondly, this is wholly unlike the Human Rights Act, in which a similar clause compares primary or secondary legislation to a body of rights that has been developed over a long period of time, in respect of which there is a corpus of law, well defined and understandable by the courts, with a proper degree of certainty. I could think of nothing more inimical to the rule of law&#151;and one aspect of the rule of law is certainty&#151;than to have a transformation of the constitutional position in the way in which these three amendments propose.
</p>

<a name="40714-22_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>I am not averse to considering how one gives effect to the very limited purpose that Lady Justice Arden proposes. But I strongly urge the Committee to resist the three Trojan horses which have been proposed, as <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40714-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>As the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor describes it, two other Trojan horses have been coupled with Amendment No. 15. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that each amendment is separate and has a different purpose, and that they do not need to be cumulative.
</p>

<a name="40714-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>Amendment No. 15 says that, wherever possible, a judge considering any Act other than this shall try to assume that that Act does not interfere with the independence of the judiciary. If, notwithstanding that effort, there is only one meaning which the judge can give to the Act that has been passed, he gives effect to it, notwithstanding the fact that it interferes with the independence of the judiciary. The amendment does not in any way require the courts to strike down anything that Parliament has said; it merely imputes to Parliament a keen desire not to interfere with the independence of the judiciary if it can.
</p>

<a name="40714-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>Amendment No. 16A goes somewhat further. It says that if, notwithstanding that exercise, the court has to say that this Act has an effect on the independence of the judiciary, then it can declare so. That is a position further down the line, and it may or may not be a good proposition. But the invalidity of No. 2 does not in any way strike down No. 1. At that point, it extends even further, to Amendment No. 16 itself, which says that actions which are incompatible with the rule of law are unlawful.
</p>

<a name="40714-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>It is wholly unfair to attribute to Lady Justice Arden responsibility for either Amendment No. 16 or Amendment No. 16A. The inadequacies of Amendment No. 16&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_243"></a>
<a name="40714-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   I am not accusing Lady Justice Arden of any iniquity in this. Her position was completely clear throughout&#151;it is not Lady Justice Arden I am contesting but the propositions that underlie the three amendments.

Nos. 16 and 16A. The fact that he does not like Amendments Nos. 16 or 16A and has advanced arguments against them is no argument whatever against the validity of Amendment No. 15. That is the only point that I am making.
</p>

<a name="40714-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>Secondly, I must apologise to the Committee for failing to make myself clear. I thought that I said, totally clearly, in moving Amendment No. 15 that I ignored and took out the words,

</p>

<a name="40714-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>because we have not yet got them on the face of the Bill. None the less, the speech of the noble Lord, Lord   Maclennan, dealt largely with the fact that one could not have this amendment related to the rule of law. In further answer to the noble Lord, I have no interest in the geography of the proposal. If it is, as I want, put on the face of the Bill, it can be on the face of the Bill anywhere the noble Lord, as a cartographer, wishes to put it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_245"></a>
<a name="40714-23_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Viscount for giving way. I defer to his very much greater experience of following how canons of interpretation are applied by the judiciary. My failure to deal with the point he has just made&#151;not about geography but about the effect of Amendment No.   15&#151;was to do with the fact that it seemed otiose in that it dealt with precisely how the judiciary would address a provision that appeared to have that effect. It would follow the plain meaning but would presume that it was not Parliament&#039;s intention to repeal such an important provision of law.
</p>




<p><a name="st_246"></a>
<a name="40714-23_spnew6"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   I was just coming to that. I can quite see that the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, may regard the amendment as otiose. But it seems rather surprising, if it is otiose, that it was advanced by Lady Justice Arden on behalf of the whole Judges&#039; Council. It is sometimes the case that an Act, in its more natural interpretation, would interfere with the principle of the independence of the judiciary. Assisted by this, Lady Justice Arden and the judges appear to think that it will help them, and who are the noble Lord and I to say that it will not?

</p>

<a name="40714-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>On the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, of course Clause 1 is declaratory. In it the Government set out a constitutional principle about the independence of the judiciary. The Government think that that means something, presumably. Therefore, it is not very difficult to say that the judges shall take that into account when considering statutes.
</p>

<a name="40714-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>Finally, on a slightly more frivolous note, the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, raised the question of the effect of a proposal to reduce judicial salaries by 30 per cent in times of stress. Surely he is not unaware of the very important decision in the case called, I think, <i>Board of Inland Revenue</i> v <i>Haddock</i>. It decided that when such a proposal has been made, it is impossible for the judiciary to try any claim by the Inland Revenue or any other claim by a government department, because it <br>&nbsp;<br>

As everyone knows, in the national emergency in the 1930s such a proposal was made. It involved all public servants including judges having their salaries reduced by a particular percentage. The judges objected on the basis that that would interfere with judicial independence. The Government refused to comply with their demands that their salary not be reduced. There was a stand-off, which lasted until an Act of Parliament was produced that would have reduced their salaries but with which the Government did not then proceed.

(c)   of the parliamentary role as Speaker of the House of Lords in the interests of the self-regulation. 


<br>
(2)   The Prime Minister must recommend to Her Majesty the appointment to the office of Lord Chancellor.


<br>
(3)   Save as to the exercise of the functions retained under subsection (1), the other functions of the Lord Chancellor are transferred to the Minister.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_253"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to the question whether Clause 11 should stand part, which relates to the Speakership. The question whether Clause 12 should stand part, which comes further down the amendment list, has already been spoken to; that clause relates to the abolition of the office of Lord Chancellor. I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 102 and 103, which propose relevant consequential amendments to the title.
</p>

<a name="40714-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>I find myself in a little difficulty because, having attended this debate before the short adjournment, I was totally unable to understand where we were going. However, I shall do my best. I am afraid that my intellect is not capable of dealing with the situation as it now seems to be.
</p>

<a name="40714-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>This is a probing amendment, which was tabled on the assumption that Amendment No. 1 might well commend itself in terms of retaining the office of Lord Chancellor. As noble Lords know&#151;although there are not many here&#151;I have throughout sought to retain the position of Lord Chancellor in every relevant speech that I have made in the House in the context of the passage of this Bill and the committee that reported on the Speakership.
</p>

<a name="40714-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>As my noble friend Lord Kingsland said, it is not the intention to unravel the architecture of this Bill. The tripartite structure is accepted. I must try to clarify where I stand; I accept that. At this stage, the Bill as amended by the Select Committee is accepted subject to further amendment by noble Lords. I want to try to create a firm basis on which to address the House. I do not think that that has yet been totally established. The proposal will not be retabled on Report without consultation with my noble friend Lord Kingsland and without consideration of any contributions that noble Lords make in today&#039;s debate, and it will be considered in the light of any relevant amendments tabled before Report.
</p>

<a name="40714-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>I have a difficulty in this regard which I hope to put shortly. I said, and I still say&#151;I said this yesterday&#151;that we have to retain the constitutional role of the   Lord Chancellor because concepts such as the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law are not so readily defined or enforceable. I still stand by <br>&nbsp;<br>

that approach. I found myself in some difficulty with the amendments that were sought to be enforced in the courts. I listened, said nothing and wondered. But you have to go one way or the other. My way&#151;I have not had an opportunity to discuss it with my noble friend Lord Kingsland&#151;subject to his agreement, is to assert that the Lord Chancellor shall attend in Cabinet as a legally qualified Member of this House.
</p>

<a name="40714-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>Having said that, one has to note that the noble Lord, Lord Richard&#151;who unfortunately is not in his place, but I am not going to say anything particularly unkind&#151;said that there was no real agreement on what the Lord Chancellor was to do, what his functions were or what should be retained. I have brought the report with me in case anybody wishes to challenge that.
</p>

<a name="40714-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>Amendment No. 18 proposes retention of the three functions only, all of which have been spoken to on Amendment No. 1 and require no repetition. It is on record; there is nothing more to trouble your Lordships with. As yet no other amendment concerning retained functions has been tabled. The speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, at cols. 1146&#150;1147 of <i>Hansard</i> of 13 July, warrants in my respectful opinion the most serious consideration in that context, the reason being that the scope for this amendment may well be, by the will of the House, extended. It is not for me&#151;I cannot do it&#151;to predict what will happen between now and Report, but when this amendment is retabled, I shall have consulted with everybody and with the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, and taken into account everything that has been said and the amendments.
</p>

<a name="40714-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>There is a point that I think I must take now because it could not be taken before. It is relevant to the retention of the parliamentary role of the Lord Chancellor. So, by leave&#151;it will not take long&#151;I should like to take it now. As regards the retention of the parliamentary role, which is part of this amendment, the Lord Chancellor shall continue to introduce legal Bills of constitutional importance, as, indeed, the noble and learned Lord is doing today, and his predecessor did on the Human Rights Act.
</p>

<a name="40714-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>The Lord Chancellor participated in the concordat and the deliberations of the Select Committee, as was graciously acknowledged by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, at col. 1139. That leads one to wonder how on earth the noble Lord could have permitted himself, in the context of retained functions, to say that,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40714-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>It beggars belief. We are arguing about substance, and about means. If we do not have the amendments on enforcement in the courts, there is nothing else. They would be the only means of enforcement. How the matter can be treated as a sort of frippery I do not understand. All sorts of things happen in this House; there it is.

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>I shall not take much more time. Proposed new subsection (1) has been spoken about. On proposed new subsection (2), it is accepted that the Lord Chancellor must be a Member of the House of Lords and legally qualified. I would go to the stake on those matters on appropriate amendments; some have already been tabled by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe. Anyone plucked from the Bar, another place or wherever for that post should be granted a life peerage.

<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>I shall move on to proposed new subsection (3). Having read with great care the contribution of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, I suspect that, if proposed new subsection (1) should require amendment to omit &quot;only&quot;, extension may be needed. But we have to weight an amendment for the acceptance of the House. Then, to include functions other than only the three functions, proposed new subsection (3) would stand. On that basis, the amendment should be re-tabled after consultation with my noble friend Lord Kingsland, taking into account the matters to which I have referred&#151;accepting that the Lord Chancellor be debarred from sitting as a judge and no longer solely responsible for selecting the judiciary, and that in principle a Judicial Appointments Commission be set up. That would leave open the questions of whether he will continue to run the courts and legal aid, and whether there would be a Supreme Court, for which I see no justification and which I shall oppose.
</p>

<a name="40714-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>That is the probative basis&#151;I hope that it is at least intelligible and straightforward&#151;on which I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>The Lord Chancellor&#039;s functions, as limited by Amendment No. 18, would leave a shadow of the present office and, curiously, retain aspects of it which might at best be regarded as an adjunct, and certainly not essential to the discharge of the role within the Cabinet of seeking to safeguard the rule of law or the independence of the judiciary.

</p>

<a name="40714-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>In the Select Committee we received evidence about the Great Seal from a previous holder, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. There was an entertaining exchange with the present Lord Chancellor about its weight. To be candid, however, the possession of the Great Seal could scarcely be described as a &quot;function&quot; of the Lord Chancellor that is necessary in the 21st century.
</p>

<a name="40714-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>As far as the parliamentary role of the Lord Chancellor as speaker is concerned, it may be thought that if the object is to enhance the standing of the office of Lord Chancellor, his presence at debates in this House does little towards that end. Other considerations concerned with the separation of the legislature from the executive seem to outweigh any advantage that might be gained from his sitting on the Woolsack.

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>&#151;covers so many uncertainties that it is doubtful that it has any administrative content at all. I am doubtful whether a Minister could sit in the Cabinet with no administrative duties and carry any weight with parliamentary colleagues.

</p>

<a name="40714-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>The amendment may reflect some of the thinking that was manifested to the Select Committee by the former Lord Chancellor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, who plainly thought it desirable that some of the administrative duties that had been added to the role of Lord Chancellor might be dispersed without loss among other members of the Government. In my judgment, however, that reflected a peculiarly apolitical view of the role. The willingness of the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Mackay of Clashfern, to dispose of the duty of being responsible for the administration of legal aid, for example, suggested that he had found it an uncomfortable political task when faced with the claims of other departmental Ministers with calls upon the Exchequer. Although his personal discomfiture was understandable, if one is in charge of the administration of justice, it is not merely cognate to that to be responsible for access to justice; it is an essential part of the job. I do not believe that the recommendations of the noble and learned Lord,   Lord Mackay, should carry weight with this Committee.

<a name="40714-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I thank my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway for tabling this amendment which he himself described as a probing amendment. I think that it is important to recall that the amendment was tabled long before yesterday&#039;s vote. Since the vote, it has become clear that the functions of the Lord Chancellor will be those that the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs was intended to have under the Bill. Consequently, we will have a Lord Chancellor with far more extensive responsibilities than those envisaged in the amendment of my noble friend.
</p>

<a name="40714-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>I thank my noble friend for offering me the opportunity of conversations with him between now and Report stage. It may be that, in the light of those conversations, he will reconsider the type of amendment that he tables on Report. I suppose that, to some extent, that will depend upon the degree to which I am persuasive in the course of our exchanges.
</p>

<a name="40714-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>It is important to recognise that the responsibilities of the Lord Chancellor, as set out in the Bill, can, and in my view should, be extended. I respectfully agree with the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan; it is hard to escape the conclusion that if the Lord Chancellor is to be responsible for the matters contained in the Bill, he should also deal with all questions concerned with access to justice. I also think that there is a powerful <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1331"></a>

argument for him to remain in control of the court system. I recognise that that raises questions of public expenditure. However, those questions can, I am sure, be dealt with by the presence in another place of a suitably qualified and senior Minister of State.
</p>

<a name="40714-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>The question of the responsibilities of the Lord Chancellor beyond those that I have already mentioned is naturally more controversial. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, already has a number of responsibilities which go further than the ones that I have mentioned. The degree to which those should be retained once the Bill has become an Act seems to me more perplexing.
</p>

<a name="40714-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>However, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, once again for his thoughts on these matters. He was, as ever when he speaks, thought-provoking and I shall certainly think carefully about what he said over the next weeks and, indeed, because we shall soon have the summer break, months.
</p>




<p><a name="st_256"></a>
<a name="40714-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for reasserting the position that he made clear yesterday, when he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a>&quot;I emphasise at the outset of the debate that it is not the Opposition&#039;s intention to unravel, in any way, the architecture of the Bill; we accept the tripartite architecture in full. Our only concern, encapsulated in Amendment No. 1, is whether the position of the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs is sufficiently powerful to carry out the tasks stipulated in the Bill for that role&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 13/7/04; col. 1143.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40714-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>Therefore, putting aside the office-holder&#039;s title and the office which performs the functions, the position of the Opposition is that the function performed should be that of the Minister responsible for at least the judiciary-related functions and legal aid, that of the person responsible for the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law in Cabinet, and that of the person performing the Minister&#039;s function on the Minister&#039;s side of the concordat.
</p>

<a name="40714-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>As I understand the position of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, no comment is made on the role of Speaker of the House of Lords. That is a matter for the House of Lords to decide. I agree with the noble Lord about the broad functions of the person. I do not agree with him about the title, the office or the name, but I lost in relation to that yesterday and it will be put right in another place. But as for what the office does, there is no dispute between us.
</p>

<a name="40714-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>The amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord   Campbell of Alloway, proposes a role for the holder, whether he be called Lord Chancellor or otherwise, that is supremely defective in two respects. First, he proposes an office holder with no ministerial responsibility&#151;not the head of the judiciary or a judge, yet someone who is supposed to carry the weight in Cabinet to defend the independence of the judiciary. With respect, that seems unmaintainable. Secondly, he proposes in statute that Parliament&#151;the House of Commons and the House of Lords&#151;should determine the position of the Speaker of this House, which is far better dealt with and, indeed, should be dealt with by this House.

<p><a name="st_260"></a>
<a name="40714-25_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   I am moving Amendment No. 20, which transposes Clause 3 to after Clause 8 and then there are a large number of amendments in the group. I misunderstood the noble Viscount. I thought he was saying to me before we returned that he would like to look at the long list of technical amendments. If his problem does not relate to that, noble Lords should forget what I have said. I was trying to help him.
</p>

<a name="40714-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>The amendments are technical and drafting amendments, which do not affect policy. I would draw particular attention to Amendments Nos. 20 and 76. These two amendments change the ordering of what are currently Clause 3 and the accompanying Schedule 1, so that these will now follow Clause 8 and its accompanying Schedule 4. Clause 3 and Schedule 1 deal with the judiciary and court-related functions of the Lord Chancellor; Clause 8 and Schedule 4 deal with appointment functions. These changes are required, in part, to pave the way for the introduction of the Northern Ireland functions and to assist the manner in which we are dealing with the extent provisions of Clause 1.
</p>

<a name="40714-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>The effect of these amendments is that the existing Clause 1 and its Northern Ireland counterpart will stand alone under the subtitle &quot;Continued judicial independence&quot;. The extent of these two clauses will be the United Kingdom, but with the &quot;carve-outs&quot; for Scotland and Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40714-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>The next subtitle will be &quot;The judiciary and courts&quot;. Counsel has advised that it would be preferable to present current Clause 8 and its schedule&#151;appointment functions&#151;as preliminary. Current Clause 3 and its schedule will then be presented as dealing with the consequences of current Clause 8, as well as bringing in all of the remaining judiciary and court-related functions. This is necessary because the overlap between the current Schedules 1 and 4 is becoming increasingly unsatisfactory and confusing. The extent of the clauses under this subtitle will also be the United Kingdom, other than those clauses dealing with the President of the Courts of England and Wales and the Heads of Justice, which will be limited to England and Wales.

</p>

<a name="40714-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>In summary, the other amendments achieve the following. Amendments Nos. 24, 25, and 30 amend Sections 73(1) and 73(3) of the Agriculture Act 1947 and Section 6(6) of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1954, which deal with powers to constitute agricultural land tribunals for hearings, to make provision for procedure relating to the agricultural land tribunal, and to regulate the proceedings of agricultural lands tribunals respectively.

</p>

<a name="40714-25_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>The amendments are technical in nature and serve to remove any uncertainty arising from earlier amendments to the relevant provisions as to the effectiveness of the amendments in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40714-25_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>Amendment No. 32 provides for consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland by, and it says, &quot;the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs&quot;, but that will need to be changed to the Lord Chancellor, in performing the function of creating or altering divisions of the General Commissioners of Income Tax in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40714-25_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>Amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 37 repeal in the body of the Bill spent provisions, which are already listed under the repeals in Schedule 17 to the Bill. Amendment No. 61 retains provisions incorrectly repealed in the Bill dealing with prescribed parliamentary procedure for statutory instruments relating to regulations made. Amendment No. 38 repeals the Lord Chancellor&#039;s functions in respect of the central office of the Supreme Court, while ensuring that the functions of the central office itself remain unaffected.
</p>

<a name="40714-25_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>Amendments Nos. 33, 41 and 73, for consistency, replace a reference to &quot;Secretary of State&quot; with a reference to &quot;Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs&quot; and replace references to &quot;Lord Chief Justice&quot; with references to &quot;Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales&quot;. Amendment No. 64 deletes a duplication, which also contains a printing error. I beg to move.

<a name="column_1335"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1335</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in an enormous number of respects to change references to &quot;the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs&quot; to &quot;the Lord Chancellor&quot;. As I understand it, his department will undertake that laborious task and bring forward all those amendments on Report.
</p>

<a name="40714-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>As I understand it, these amendments further amend Schedule 1. We saw some 400 of them in the Select Committee and dealt with them in what turned out to be a very efficacious way. The noble and learned Lord very kindly made available the officials in his department, who had a mastery of the detail such as would have enabled them to answer the question of the noble Lord, Lord Renton. They explained the details of the amendments to the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, and me. We were able to satisfy ourselves and the Select Committee, to which the role was delegated, on the suggestion of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, to the two of us, that 99 per cent of the amendments seemed wholly acceptable.
</p>

<a name="40714-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>I suggested to the noble and learned Lord that we took the same approach here. He has suggested as an alternative that we make the amendments to the Bill now; that we have such a discussion before Report; and that it is then open to us to return to any with which we are not satisfied. I confess that I find that an extremely attractive solution which would save a great deal of your Lordships&#039; time. Speaking for myself, I would be happy to nod through all the amendments to Schedule 1 proposed today on the basis that on Report all the references to &quot;the Secretary of State&quot; will be changed to &quot;the Lord Chancellor&quot;, and that it will be open to us to bring forward any individual points on which the officials cannot convince us. If that is the proposal that the noble and learned Lord makes, it is eminently satisfactory.

<a name="40714-26_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </b>   I have sat in silence for most of the day, but I wish simply to say how proud I feel that the precedent that I suggested in the committee of dealing with this vast raft of mysterious provisions in this informal fashion is being followed in this way. Procedure is always intended to help us and not to get in the way. I commend the wisdom of all concerned and wish them luck during the weeks ahead.

<p><a name="st_266"></a>
<a name="40714-26_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I hope that I am correct in concluding, from what the noble Viscount has just said and from the reaction of the noble and learned Lord, that the noble and learned Lord accepts the noble Viscount&#039;s interpretation of the position and also the task of redrafting Schedule 1.
</p>

<a name="40714-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>A week or two ago, we sought advice as to whether we should table our own amendments to Schedule 1 and we were advised that that would not be necessary. We are prepared to table our own amendments to Schedule 1 on Report; but if I understand the position <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1336"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1336</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

correctly, that is now a task that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor is content to take on. If he confirms that, I am grateful to him.
</p>




<p><a name="st_267"></a>
<a name="40714-26_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   Yes, I do. I hope that I have made it clear that I read the Committee&#039;s decision yesterday as saying that whereas we sought to create a Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs to perform the functions laid out for the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, the Committee wished the Lord Chancellor to conduct those functions. Unless there is some extremity that I cannot work out at the moment, the consequence of that seems to be that in Schedule 1 the references to &quot;the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs&quot; should be replaced by a reference to &quot;the Lord Chancellor&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40714-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>It seems right that I should do that, on the basis that we need to work through the consequences of what was decided yesterday. I make it clear that I opposed the proposal and did not want to accept it, but that was its effect. That is what we must now help to give effect to while the Bill is in this House.

All references in this Bill are in Arabic numerals, rather than Roman numerals, even if they refer to older statutes printed in the latter&#151;i.e. Roman numerals.

<p><a name="st_286"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment. Schedule 1&#151;or, at any rate, Schedule 1 as it was originally&#151;contains an enormous number of amendments that are consequential on either the change of role or the change of name of the Lord Chancellor. So far as they simply change the name from &quot;Lord Chancellor&quot; to &quot;Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs&quot;, they will, after yesterday&#039;s vote, go into limbo. No doubt, they will, in due course, disappear from the Bill altogether. However, not all the necessary changes relating to the role of the Lord Chancellor have, in fact, been made.
</p>

<a name="40714-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>In particular, the necessary changes have not been made to what I believe is a very important piece of legislation; namely, Schedule 4 to the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. That schedule is now not in its original form, but in the form set out in Schedule 5 to the Access to Justice Act 1999, which replaced the original Schedule 4 to the 1990 Act.
</p>

<a name="40714-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>Schedule 4 relates to bodies authorised to have rights of audience in the courts and rights to conduct litigation. The schedule is in four parts. Part 1 deals with the power of the Lord Chancellor to designate bodies whose members have rights of audience or rights to conduct litigation. Part 2 relates to the power of the Lord Chancellor to approve alterations of rules made by the designated bodies. Part 3 deals with the power of the Lord Chancellor to impose rule changes on the designated bodies. Part 4 contains a power for the Lord Chancellor to revoke a designation.
</p>

<a name="40714-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>From that brief summary, it is obvious that those are very important powers. They were the subject of very considerable debates in the course of the passing of the Bill which became the Access to Justice Act. They are of course important because they impinge on the independence of the legal profession, which I think is nearly equal to the importance of the independence of the judiciary. I have some surprise that this had not already been dealt with&#151;or not until I raised this point at a late stage in the proceedings of the Select Committee&#151;by the Lord Chancellor&#039;s Department.
</p>

<a name="40714-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>All the relevant powers under Schedule 4 are vested in the Lord Chancellor alone. Before exercising those powers, the Lord Chancellor is required to consult a consultative panel set up under Section 18A of the 1990 Act. He is required to consult the Director-General of Fair Trading and the four designated judges; the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the President of the Family Division and the Vice-Chancellor.

<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>The original Schedule 4, which was replaced by the 1999 Act, gave each of the four designated judges a veto over decisions made by the Lord Chancellor. But that veto was removed in 1999 and the Lord Chancellor was left with sole decision-making powers.
</p>

<a name="40714-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>The change in the role of the Lord Chancellor&#151;in particular, the fact that he is no longer a judge or head of the judiciary&#151;makes it no longer appropriate for him to have the sole decision-making powers. Equally, it is not appropriate to transfer those powers to the Lord Chief Justice or to the judiciary as a whole. There are of course political issues involved, particularly on competition issues. Leaving Schedule 4 powers solely in the hands of the judiciary would be wrong. I believe that judges would find it difficult to overcome the sense of professional solidarity with the profession from which they have come. There is a danger that if that is left in the hands of the judiciary, there would be no sufficient consideration of the general public interest.
</p>

<a name="40714-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>The best solution is to leave the powers to initiate action in the hands of the Lord Chancellor, but to require, as is done in a large number of other circumstances, the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice. I do not think that we should go back to the original position of the 1990 Act where we had four designated judges, each with an individual power of veto. That is partly as a result of the fact that, under this Bill, the Lord Chief Justice will have a status as head of the judiciary, not just the status of one of a &quot;gang of four&quot;, even if perhaps <i>primus inter pares</i> among those four.
</p>

<a name="40714-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>I believe that that balance, giving the Lord Chancellor the initiative but requiring the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice to get the balance right, is what Amendment No. 45 is intended to achieve. However, it is a sample amendment because it extends only to Part 1 of Schedule 4. However, the same principles obviously apply to Parts 2, 3 and 4. I did not feel it necessary to produce identical amendments on this occasion.
</p>

<a name="40714-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>I raise this very much as a matter for discussion and I have no intention of pressing it any further on this occasion. I would be interested to hear whether the Lord Chancellor and, indeed, other noble Lords are prepared to accept this analysis and the solution I have proposed. I beg to move.

<a name="40714-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </b>   I recall, although without superb accuracy, the time when the formula which the noble Lord seeks to change was legislated; that is, the requirement of the approval or the concurrence of each of the four heads of division. At the time the profession was greatly fraught and felt very strongly about this. I am not at all sure that I am as yet persuaded by the argument put forward by the noble Lord by way of justification for removing the safeguard. I think that matters of, for example, rights <br>&nbsp;<br>

of audience are of immense importance to the independence of the profession, and to the service that can be provided by it.
</p>

<a name="40714-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>I would not want this matter to pass wholly without contribution from the Back Benches, which looked likely to be the case.
</p>




<p><a name="st_288"></a>
<a name="40714-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   The amendment proposes, in the context of the implementation of the concordat and Schedule 1 to the Bill, to alter the arrangements Parliament has set in place in Schedule 4 to the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, as amended by the Access to Justice Act 1999. These arrangements relate to the consideration of applications from a body to grant its members rights of audience or rights to conduct litigation, or applications from organisations such as the Bar Council, the Law Society, the Institute of Legal Executives, the Institute of Trade Mark Agents and the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents for approval of changes to their qualification regulations or rules of conduct.
</p>

<a name="40714-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>As noble Lords are aware, last July I announced a review of the framework of legal services regulation which is being led by Sir David Clementi. I gave Sir David wide terms of reference. He is looking at the whole regulatory framework and the role and responsibilities within it. The consultation paper issued by his review team earlier this year asked questions about regulatory models and, specifically, about a regulator and the role of the judiciary. The team is analysing the responses to that consultation exercise now and Sir David is due to report to me at the end of the year.

</p>

<a name="40714-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>I said at the time, and I think that this is right, that I do not intend to alter the existing arrangements further until I have received his report. When I have considered his recommendations I shall report to your Lordships&#039; House. I do not wish his review to be undermined by any attempt to make new arrangements within the overall existing regulatory structure.
</p>

<a name="40714-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>I turn now to the detail of the amendment. When drafting the amendment, it appears that the noble Lord was not aware that the Lord Chancellor&#039;s functions under Schedule 4 to the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 had already been transferred to the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs by a transfer of functions order laid before Parliament on 29 July last year. But it is not for that reason alone that I will ask the noble Lord to withdraw this amendment.
</p>

<a name="40714-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>The amendment seeks to transfer functions from the Lord Chancellor to a &quot;Secretary of State for Justice&quot;, which is a detail we do not need to deal with at this point. It would replace the arrangements under which the Secretary of State receives advice and applications from each of the designated senior judges with an arrangement under which he would receive the view of the Lord Chief Justice only. This would mean that the Lord Chief Justice alone must consider the application and the advice of the Legal Services Consultative Panel and that of the Office of Fair Trading before providing his advice to the Secretary of State or the Lord Chancellor. The proposed amendment does not allow <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1343"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1343</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Lord Chief Justice to delegate this function to any other senior judge. Given that applications for rights of audience and rights to conduct litigation can be several hundred pages long, it is unlikely that the Lord Chief Justice alone would be able to give the attention necessary to determine if the application should be accepted without introducing considerable delay into the process. That would be neither in the interests of the legal profession nor that of the public.
</p>

<a name="40714-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>The designated judges&#151;this reflects the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew&#151;bring a range of experience and expertise and have, on occasions, brought a range of views for the Secretary of State to consider. Losing this breadth of experience would not be in the interests of the public, who are most affected by changes to the professions&#039; rules. For that reason, too, I would ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40714-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>The effect of the amendment is also to constrain the freedom Parliament has given the Secretary of State to act once he has received the advice of the Lord Chief Justice.
</p>

<a name="40714-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>I fully accept, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, that these are very important issues, but, in a sense, they arise only by a side wind as a result of the Bill. I said to the noble Lord at the end of the Select Committee that I thought these kinds of matters should be transferred to the Lord Chief Justice. I was plainly wrong. My point is basically to let them stay where they are in the broad architecture until we hear what Clementi has to say. In those circumstances, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_289"></a>
<a name="40714-28_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I shall start by dealing with the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, who I think misunderstood the point I was making. The protection that was given by each of the four designated judges having a veto would not be removed by my amendment; it was removed by the Access to Justice Act 1999, at a time when I myself took part in the debate and objected to the removal of that protection.
</p>

<a name="40714-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>The effect of my amendment would be to restore that protection to a considerable extent by giving a veto not to each of the four designated judges but to the Lord Chief Justice alone. That is a reasonable move because having four judges each with an individual veto was unsatisfactory. The result of that was that any one of the four could have vetoed a change in the rules which was entirely acceptable to the other three designated judges. Giving the veto to one judge, who is now formally recognised as the official head of the judiciary, is a reasonable step to take.
</p>

<a name="40714-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>I am somewhat disappointed by the reply of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. I am concerned about leaving the position of the professional bodies unprotected when so many other aspects will be protected by requiring the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice&#151;for instance, in the disciplinary role up until now exercised by the Lord Chancellor.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1344"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column 1344</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40714-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>If this issue is left over to be dealt with in response to the Clementi report, it seems to me that we are very unlikely to have anything incorporated in this Bill. Therefore it follows that further primary legislation is likely to be needed to amend Schedule 4. Given the changed role of the Lord Chancellor, it is a matter of importance that he should not be in a position to impose his own will on the professional bodies which are subject to Schedule 4 to the 1990 Act. It would be appropriate to put into the Bill now a provision that changes can be made only with the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice.
</p>

<a name="40714-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>I would have no objection to rephrasing the amendment&#151;I accept that there are other respects in which it needs to be amended&#151;in a way which would enable further appropriate changes to be made by statutory instrument under the affirmative resolution procedure once Clementi has reported.
</p>

<a name="40714-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>However, I would be very unhappy about the idea that the Bill would become law with no further protection given to the professional bodies because, as I said, the independence of the legal profession is very nearly as important as that of the judiciary. Having said that, as I said earlier, I will ask for the leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment, but I may come back with a further amendment in a somewhat different form to take up the points made by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor today. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="40714-29_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  My right honourable friend the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40714-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>I have today placed in the Library of the House copies of the new draft letter of statutory guidance from the Secretary of State to the Director of Fair Access (commonly known as the Office for Fair Access or OFFA).
</p>

<a name="40714-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>On 23 February 2004 the Secretary of State published the draft regulations and guidance on OFFA as the Higher Education Bill made its way to Committee stage in the House of Commons.
</p>

<a name="40714-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>Since that time the Bill has received Royal Assent and some important amendments have been made. Now that the Bill has become an Act and we have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS60"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column WS60</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

advertised for the post of the Director of Fair Access, the Secretary of State has issued a new draft letter of statutory guidance to the new director. New draft regulations were published on 7 July and copies laid in the Library of the House.
</p>

<a name="40714-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>We are determined to ensure that access to higher education is broadened, not narrowed. That is why the new Director of Fair Access will have such an important role. Now that we have advertised for the post of director it is important to remind all those interested of the function, powers and responsibilities. OFFA will be necessary, focused, non-bureaucratic, powerful, independent, open and nothing to do with admissions.
</p>

<a name="40714-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>The new director will be in post by the autumn and this letter suggests how he or she might approach the approval and monitoring of institutions&#039; access agreements. The judgments that the director will exercise in ensuring fair access will have far-reaching consequences. His or her freedom to challenge institutions where necessary will be an important safeguard and public reassurance.
</p>

<a name="40714-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The new draft letter reflects changes made to the Bill. The key changes are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>Admissions and academic freedom&#151;The HE Act now makes crystal clear, on the face of the legislation, that OFFA cannot infringe on academic freedom, ensuring OFFA is concentrated single-mindedly on widening access.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>Good practice&#151;A government amendment in both Houses.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_2"></a>Part-time education and OFFA&#151;A government amendment responded to concern expressed in both Houses about the position of part-time students. It makes plain that while OFFA&#039;s prime focus is on the regulation of full-time fees its remit includes safeguarding and promoting access to both full-time and part-time study. The amendment sends a clear signal in primary legislation about the importance that the Government attach to part-time study.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>Reasonableness and sanctions&#151;It is a general principle of law that a body such as OFFA has to act reasonably. This amendment prevents sanctions being imposed if an institution has done all it possibly can to comply with its access agreement. It safeguards institutions from being penalised for problems outside their control. Failure to meet their own milestones is not of itself grounds for any sanction. But where progress is less than expected, OFFA will take into account whether any underlying causes have been identified and addressed by the institution when considering renewal.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_4"></a>Review&#151;This amendment allows institutions to seek a review of decisions made by OFFA to an independent person or panel. The panel will only be able to ask OFFA to look again at a decision, for instance in the light of new information. This is a sensible position for a new regulator, and ensures a fair deal for institutions as well as students.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_5"></a>Gap years&#151;Paragraph 4.2 of the letter reminds institutions that they should not charge higher fees to students who took a gap year and deferred their entry from the 2005&#150;06 academic year to 2006&#150;07.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="40714-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>The key principles set out in the letter of guidance are that OFFA should be well focused, non-bureaucratic and open to views from within the sector.

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="40714-29_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Whitty): </b>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40714-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>I am pleased to announce today the publication of the draft Animal Welfare Bill.

</p>

<a name="40714-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>The draft Bill seeks to consolidate and modernise over 20 pieces of animal welfare legislation relating to farmed and non-farmed animals, some of which date back to 1911. It follows a public consultation held in 2002, and   meetings with over 100 welfare organisations, professional veterinary associations and industry groups.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS62"></a>

<b>14 Jul 2004 : Column WS62</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40714-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>The Bill introduces into our law a clear definition of cruelty against an animal and provides the courts, the police and government law enforcement agencies with the powers that are needed to deal effectively with people who ill treat or neglect animals in their care. The Bill also extends a duty to promote animal welfare&#151;currently present in farmed animal legislation&#151;to all animal keepers. This will mean that all domestic or captive animals must be cared for in accordance with good animal husbandry practices and the best available scientific knowledge concerning welfare needs. This is a major improvement to current welfare laws which are often based on the view that good welfare is about taking action after an animal has suffered.
</p>

<a name="40714-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>The Bill will also provide powers to introduce secondary legislation and codes of practice to protect the welfare of non-farmed animals kept by man. This enabling power is already available for farmed animals and our aim is to ensure that in future all domestic and captive animals will be protected by legislation that can be easily revised to take account of changing welfare needs and increased scientific knowledge.
</p>

<a name="40714-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>Copies of the draft Animal Welfare Bill are available in the Printed Paper Office and the Libraries of the House.

</p>

<a name="40714-29_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>Copies are also available on the Stationery Office   website at http://www.officialdocuments.co.uk/document/cm62/6252/6252.htm.

<a name="40714w01_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Lord Rooker): </b>  Planning Circular 11/95 provides guidance on the use of conditions in planning permission. The circular advises that conditions attached to planning permissions should be necessary, relevant to planning, relevant to the development permitted, enforceable, precise and reasonable in all other respects. A condition requiring that an agreement under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 must be entered into is unlikely to meet the tests set out in the circular because the terms of the agreement will not be known at the time permission is granted. The policy relating to planning conditions reflects current case law and helps to ensure fairness and transparency for those involved in the planning process. We have no proposals to change this policy.

<p><a name="wa_st_9"></a>
<a name="40714w01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The number of infantry recruits who have been given a training commencement date longer than two months from their date of attestation in 2004 is 467. Of these, some would have requested a delay before starting training due to personal commitments such as jobs, education and holidays. It should be noted that there is a two-month gap between intakes to Parachute Regiment courses due to their popularity, which results in recruits to the Parachute Regiment automatically having a two-month delay before entering training. If Parachute Regiment figures are excluded, the number of infantry recruits who have a training commencement date in excess of two months is reduced to 352.

<a name="40714w01_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_13"></a>Until all current candidates have successfully completed their selection process at recruit selection centres (RSC), it is impossible to say how many will not begin their basic training for over two months. Once a potential recruit has successfully passed RSC, they will be allocated on to the first available phase 1 course that is being run for their chosen career employment group and the time involved may of course vary considerably.

[HL3654]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_18"></a>
<a name="40714w02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   London did not score badly for government support. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) awarded London a range of 8&#150;9 out of 10 for the technical criterion &quot;Government Support&quot;, the same as all other applicant cities. In addition to this assessment of the level of support, the overall score for the category included a multiplier for feasibility. London and New York had a lower multiplier for feasibility than Paris and Madrid, of 0.8 compared to 0.9. In the terms of the IOC evaluation report 0.8 is rated as &quot;high probability&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40714w02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a>The report of the IOC does not offer any explicit explanation why London and New York were given slightly lower feasibility ratings. However, as part of the information used to score this category, candidate cities were asked to provide information about the frequency of elections before 2005. London was alone in possibly facing two sets of elections that could affect government support for the bid&#151;both mayoral and a potential general election. New York has presidential, congressional and state legislative elections in the bidding period. Paris will have no elections that would significantly affect government or city support, and Madrid had a general election (in March) and will not hold a city or regional ballot before July 2005.
</p>

<a name="40714w02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a>As part of their response to the Working Group Report the bid company is in discussions with the IOC to establish the underlying reasons for both this marking and the other areas of the file where London scored lower than other cities.
