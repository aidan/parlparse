This was published on 30 November 2010. It does not contain an estimate of the impact on homelessness as we cannot anticipate the behaviour of tenants or their landlords. To reduce the risk of households becoming homeless we have a substantial package of financial and practical support in place, and we are giving households up to nine months' transitional protection so that they can look for alternative accommodation if they need to.</p>

Shelter estimates that 129,000 children will be forced to move home and that 54,000 live in families whose income, after housing costs, will now be pushed below £100 a week. Given that the Government say that they intend to take forward further analysis of the child poverty effect, should they not suspend these controversial orders until that important work is complete?</p>

There are some heroic assumptions in the Shelter figures. For instance, they are based on an average shortfall of £18 a week, which is well above what the shortfall will be. I should point out that 40 per cent of people in the private rental sector move every year and 70 per cent move within three years.</p>

That is why we have put a large amount of resource into helping that transition process. The current figure, which we announced last week, has been increased by another £50 million to a total of £190 million over the SR 2010 period.</p>

On the other side the argument now seems to be that, if you take out issues around London, no one will see their rent reduced and they will therefore be turfed out on their ear. Meanwhile, the Government believe that the private sector will reduce its rents. Why is the Minister so convinced that the private sector will reduce its rents?</p>

First, we as taxpayers represent 40 per cent of the private rental market. Secondly, there have been some surveys of landlord attitudes; roughly half say that they are prepared to reduce rates. Obviously, they are sending a message back to the main buyer. Thirdly, last week we put in place a mechanism to help that adjustment process. We are prepared to pay direct rents to landlords where they are prepared to show flexibility in helping people to stay in their homes.</p>

That is why we fine-tuned our arrangements, as we announced last week, so that they come into effect in April, but there is a nine-month period for people to make an adjustment. We have also put in £50 million to help local authorities deal with the transition-some of which will be difficult-to make sure that it goes as smoothly as possible.</p>

The whole purpose of our reform of the benefit system is to get rid of that problem-to make sure that there

As things stand, the officers who are eligible for retirement, having 30 years' service, number 3,260 out of a total force of 143,000 warranted officers. Therefore, I do not think that we should exaggerate the quantum of those involved.</p>

A number of chief constables, including the head of the Metropolitan Police Service, have indicated that they do not wish to lose the experience that is available to them. I remind the House that this power is available to the police. It permits them to retire people; it does not oblige them to do so.</p>

I accept that these decisions have to be made by local police forces but, for example, as the Minister will well know, people such as counterterrorist support officers working for NaCTSO tend to be at the very end of their careers and have huge experience. I believe that somehow the Government have to make a judgment in the overall balance of the advice that goes, for example, to the architectural industry and other areas. Does the Minister have any way of measuring the cuts that are being made in various areas so that there is a national view of the impact on areas as important as counterterrorism?</p>

The Government are clear that we need police to be available on the streets. HMIC has noted that 11 per cent of the available police force is invisible to the public at any given moment. In other words, we need to drive out a great deal of the bureaucracy that was imposed on the police by the previous Government. I am absolutely certain that the police will take their responsibilities seriously in ensuring that terrorism does not in any way prevail in this country.</p>

However, that does not necessarily correlate to anyone's age. I do not think that it is an age discrimination matter; it is a length of service issue.</p>

Given that, can the Minister tell us how he will ensure that pupil premiums are indeed paid to advance the attainments of disadvantaged children and that schools are not tempted to use those payments to encourage more children on the edge of getting five A to Cs rather than those where the return will be certainly slower?

It will be a matter for their judgment because they know the pupils best. If, for instance, they think that the money would be better spent on one-to-one tuition rather than something else, they should make that judgment. We suggest they should have to account publicly to parents and publish how the money has been spent, so that people can see the linkage between the money and what it is spent on.</p>

I am aware of the issues around the education maintenance allowance and the point that underlies the noble Lord's question. The enhanced discretionary fund, which will be targeted on those who most need the help, will, I hope, deal with some of that. For 16 to 18 year-olds, deprivation factors are already in the funding formula which will help to address some of the same issues.</p>

The Parliament Bill became an Act on 18 August 1911 and a century has gone by. With all the talk of reform, should we not at least set a deadline of 18 August or a date close to it-I do not intend to call the House back on 18 August unless noble Lords so desire it-for the reform procedure?</p>

The Labour Party says in its manifesto that it wants a proportional system for elections to the House of Lords, and we say in the coalition agreement that we, too, want a proportional system. The preamble to the Parliament Act 1911 suggests that the present House of Lords be substituted by,</p>

I fear that I am going to disappoint him again, although I must say that I admire his perseverance after 100 years since the last Liberal Prime Minister passed the Parliament Act 1911. I think he is optimistic to suggest that the Chamber will be constituted on a different basis by August next year, or that any of us will be here to mark that occasion on 18 August. I can tell him, however, that the Deputy Prime Minister intends to publish a draft Bill early next year that makes provision for a wholly or mainly elected Chamber with elections on a system of proportional representation.</p>

I am not one of those who regard the passage of the 1911 Act as one that the House of Lords should celebrate. I think it was a disaster for the House of Lords.

Until the Government address, which they have not done so far any more than the previous Government did, this fundamental question of the effect of an elected Lords on the powers and influence of the House of Commons, they really do not deserve to be taken seriously on Lords reform.</p>

Last week, I offered one on the indicative aspect, and today I offer "before 31 October". It does not alter the Bill in any way or force any change. The coalition can still meet their intention to have the referendum on 5 May, even if they accept my amendment. It is now 6 December. We are five months away from that date, or 20-odd weeks. Royal Assent is some time away. The Bill has to go back to the Commons in any event because there are government amendments to the Bill in your Lordships' House. They were in addition to the 286 government amendments put in the Bill in the other place, which doubled its length from 150 pages to 300 pages. Even then, they could not get it right, because they have come to this House and have already tabled amendments. It is all rush, rush, rush. They must ask themselves, "Can we do it?". I have to say that it shows a level of faith in local government, the Electoral Commission, the weather and the parliamentary process which, in the words of "Yes Minister" is "brave". There are 20 weeks to go, and we are on only the second day in Committee in your Lordships' House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="1012066000064"></a>Do the Government have a risk analysis of this process? If not, they are not conducting public administration in the same way that most of the public bodies they are trying to abolish already do. On that assumption, I assume they have a risk analysis, and I ask them to share it with the House, perhaps in the speech that answers this amendment.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="1012066000065"></a>My amendment is a contingency measure. I will not argue about the referendum question; that is not the issue and we will come to that later. However, I want to make it clear, as I did last week, that this amendment does not stop the referendum taking place on 5 May. If all the things are in place, fine. The question we must ask is: what happens if they are not? What a disaster it will be if we get a bit close to the date and the Electoral Commission says: "Ten weeks to go and we have not quite got this ready". We also have to ask ourselves about the administrative procedures that have to be gone through as issues are raised about some of the other processes of local government and the Electoral Commission. Let us leave all those aside for the minute: they are mechanical and administrative. What about the voters? How are the voters going to be dealt with at the last minute in this rush, rush, rush? There is never time to educate the public until such time as they are forced to make a decision. People want to get on with their lives-their work and their families-and they are not interested until the deadline comes. Then it will be: "Oh, I have not heard about this. What does all this mean? Does this mean that Parliament is going to change? What effect will it have? What about the misconceptions about the voting system?". Time might well be needed by the Government to have a decent information campaign.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="1012066000066"></a>It is already known, following a series of YouGov polls commissioned by the Constitution Society a few months ago, that there are considerable problems about this idea. Most respondents do not understand AV. Its summary says that the yes and no votes are evenly balanced, but that exposure to information about AV increases the no votes. Perhaps that is the reason for the rush, rush, rush-because polling evidence indicates that the more people know about it, the more they are inclined to vote no. However, it has to be their choice and they must choose in a free way.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="1012066000067"></a>The polls also found that there are a number of widespread misconceptions about AV. Well, there are, and I think a few of those will be deployed in the coming days. The polls also indicated that the same arguments are commonly used to justify votes both for and against AV. In other words, I have only gone through half of the findings in summary form and it is clear that there is a hell of a job to do to explain to the public what all this is about. If it can not be done well before 5 May, that would be an absolute disgrace, because the Government could have plenty of opportunity to avoid having that problem if they accept my amendment.</p>

That is something that would be well taken by everybody. The

I once said that to one of our Prime Ministers, by the way. The response I got across the table was: "This is not a bad decision". The fact of the matter is that I was reminded about that. I am not saying that having a referendum is a bad decision, because if we are going to change the voting system, we have to have a referendum. I am not arguing about that. I am arguing here about the timing of it; 5 May is entrenched in the Bill. There is no get-out from that and we do not want a shambles. The Electoral Commission has already warned the other place and the Deputy Prime Minister has told a Select Committee there, though he did not give any details, about the factors that might cause a problem. However, it would be quite useful to have those teased out because we need to show the public, in case things do start to go wrong or even if it is a success, that these things were thought about beforehand.</p>

With the public's misconceptions, there is evidence that we will need a decent education campaign because of what will be thrown on both sides of the argument. We cannot do that until the Bill has Royal Assent. After Second Reading, I realised that certain amounts of public expenditure can be used. Once the Government have secured a Second Reading, certain changes are triggered. But it is only after Royal Assent that the treasurers and accounting officers in local government and other institutions can say, "Hang on, this is really on".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="1012066000070"></a>There is quite a bit of preparation for this in terms of the mechanics of even the private sector and industry. Notwithstanding that the Minister will say, "It is all in place for 5 May", probably not every difficulty has been foreseen and it is too early for that now. I submit that with 20 weeks to go, a lot could go wrong. I do not want it to go wrong and to be a shambles. I am just giving the Government a get-out, so that the referendum could take place any time before 31 October. I freely admit that anything that causes a problem for 5 May could be dealt with well before 31 October. All the procedures, including administrative and mechanical, could be overcome.</p>

All I am saying is that this is a lifeboat. You could jump into it. It would not affect the Bill or the planning for 5 May in any way. It could mean that we would need less debate on some of the other amendments. I would not bother. Provided that the referendum was before 31 October, I would not be interested in the date. The target is 5 May. If it were not on 5 May, it would be before 31 October. The public and Parliament would know that. I do not see a serious problem in accepting an amendment which is a contingency and a lifeboat. I beg to move.</p>

I think that there will be enormous confusion if the referendum is held on the same day as local elections. As the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has pointed out, this is an extremely complex matter, which is not well understood by the electorate. Therefore, we need a special day. I am not too worried when it is after the local elections on 5 May, but it should be on a separate day. I know that this would involve £15 million-worth of public expenditure at a time of austerity. But this is a very important change in our constitutional arrangements and it has to be properly debated. The people of this country have got to understand what is at stake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="1012066000074"></a>If the referendum is to be wrapped up in local authority elections with certain, say, Labour campaigners saying, "Vote for your Labour candidate, but vote against the alternative vote in the referendum"-the Conservatives would be doing similar-that will be extremely confusing to the electorate. Therefore, it is important that the referendum is held on a separate day. This is a radical and important change in our electoral system, and it should not be allowed to be muddled up in the local elections. I do not think that it will be satisfactory for anyone, whatever the result of the referendum, if it goes through while the electorate do not understand what was going on. We need a separate date. We need to debate it properly and to make absolutely certain that the people of this country understand what is at stake and understand the issues involved in whether we have an alternative vote system or not. That is why it should be on a separate date and why I am pleased to support the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, in his amendment.</p>

I remind your Lordships-and I shall be interested to hear from the opposition Front Bench in a moment-that the previous Administration pushed through the referendum on London government and mayoral and Assembly legislation, with the exact same collision of votes on 7 May 1998. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, may like to comment on the following extract from a speech by his colleague Mr Nick Raynsford, who was then the responsible Minister:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="1012066000217"></a>"We are holding the referendum on 7 May deliberately to gain the benefits from combining the poll with local government elections. That will result in a considerable saving in public expenditure, which I would have thought all hon. Members would welcome. Separating the referendum date from the local election day would probably result in additional public expenditure of some £2 million to £3 million and could reduce voter turnout. That is not in the interests of democracy or of economy, and the Government do not intend to propose that".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/11/1997; col. 380]</p>

<p><a name="1012066000205"></a>What was right for London is apparently not right for other parts of the country. Perhaps Members on the other side think that somehow the voters of Scotland and Wales are not capable of taking two quite distinct decisions on the same day but people in London are.</p>

That is not the issue as far as my amendment is concerned; I know that others in the group are concerned with this. My question is this: what were the relevant dates for that legislation? I know the referendum the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, refers to was for London only and not national, but how close to the referendum did the legislation start through the two Houses? That is the point that I am raising. I am not arguing against 5 May; I am just saying that if something goes wrong between now and then, my amendment is a lifeboat and we can still have the referendum.</p>

That Bill started its progress through the House of Commons on 28 October 1997 and was not completed until well into 1998, so it is a very similar situation to the present one. I go a step further, which is why I hope we are going to get a contribution from the opposition Front Bench. Amendment 12 specifies that this referendum should take place on the same day as the mayoral and Assembly elections in London in 2012. What is right for the goose is surely right for the gander. How can we possibly argue, as Members opposite did for hours the other night-it seemed interminable-that somehow the Scots are not capable of taking this decision on the same day when London has done so in the past, and there is a proposal, which has been supported by at least some Members opposite, to do so again in 2012? I stand up for the Scots as a fellow Celt. I think they are quite capable of taking this decision on the same day, and I hope your Lordships' House will take the same view.</p>

There are certainly many arguments for holding these elections on the same day as elections in Scotland, Wales and England, and there are many arguments against. My point is limited to this issue. Why did Her Majesty's Government think for a moment that it was right to come to a final determination on this matter without consulting the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly? It seems to me, looking at it either with naivety or with remorseless logic, that it was either a case of negligence or a studied discourtesy. Which was it?</p>

It in no way prevents the Government from having the referendum when they want to have it. It simply gives them, as my noble friend has expressed very clearly, another lifeboat. It would have been so much simpler if we had had an indicative referendum, as has already been said, because huge chunks of this document would not have to be debated between now and 5 May, if that is when the Government want to hold the referendum. Those would be matters to consider after the indicative referendum, but the House has decided not to go ahead with that. As my noble friend said, the choice is still there for the Government to take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="1012066000080"></a>I put this to the Government in as gentle a way as I can. Quite often you put documents together before an election, although on this occasion the coalition document was put together after the election. This would not be the first Government in history to find that it was not possible to enact some of their intentions. That would not be a first in British constitutional history.</p>

It was a shambles for which the Labour Government were rightly upbraided. That is precisely the point that is being made about the potential on this occasion.</p>

We have so many different electoral systems-five already with one proposed implicitly in this legislation and another additionally proposed if and when we come to elect the House of Lords. Before long, one will need at least a first year's study on the British constitution to understand the various electoral systems that are being simultaneously offered to the British public. That is something that requires serious attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="1012066000083"></a>We all understand the Government's intention. Apart from financial reasons, I would like them to explain why it is so urgent to get this dealt with by 5 May. We recognise that all too often Governments do not get what they want. That is sometimes for very good reasons. Perhaps the Liberal Democrats know a little about this at the moment in respect of student fees. When that happens, the ideal position to be in is one of some flexibility, which my noble friend offers with this amendment.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="1012066000084"></a>I offer one thought. I had the honour of having the responsibility in this House of trying to schedule government business in a way that was, as far as humanly possible, acceptable to the four parties to the discussions-the three political parties operating independently and the Cross-Benchers. It is an extraordinarily difficult business to achieve satisfactorily. For the life of me I cannot see how this Bill, which has not had the pre-legislative scrutiny or proper consideration for a Bill of this size-which is actually two Bills because it will become the Act that delivers the referendum, should the vote go in favour of a change in the voting system-can be considered in the time available between now and next February. It is beyond me.</p>

We have another 300 pages to go. We have three more Committee sittings before Christmas. We have a half-term break scheduled. There have to be two weeks between Committee and Report on the Bill, three days between Report and Third Reading and heaven knows how many exchanges of ping-pong between the two Houses. It is quite

I have not done the maths but, even if we spent all the legislative days left between now and next February on this Bill-assuming you get through, let us say, five pages a day, which would be pretty good going at the rate we are going at present-I do not see how on earth this can be delivered.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="1012066000086"></a>If the Government are sensible, there will not need to be any vote. If there is any reason other than the alleged saving for having all these elections on the same day, please let us hear it. The only one that I have heard is the financial argument, which we must take seriously. Of course, the best financial argument of the lot would be the one that I would offer to the Government, which is not to hold the referendum at all. Perhaps we could have the figures on that just to show the probity with which I assessed these questions of public expenditure. If there is another explanation, let us have it, but in the mean time what is conceivably lost by having the flexibility that my noble friend is offering?</p>

I think the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, gave away his game right in his last remark. I speak as a neighbour of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, for goodness knows how many years in Birmingham. He is always unbelievably persuasive and I am quite often on his side, but not on this. We have here a bewildering number of dates, not just his: in addition, we have 30 June, 15 September, 6 October, 13 October and 3 May 2012.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="1012066000088"></a>I argue that there is a very positive reason for having it on 5 May, as proposed. I am a strong supporter of referendums, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, in what I take his view to be. Against the fashion I took the view that we would be much better served as a nation had we put the big European issues to the electorate right from the beginning in referendums. I said that in my first election manifesto of 1970, so I come to it as a supporter. Following that, however, I also believe that we should have the biggest possible turnout for such a referendum. The fact that 5 May coincides with other elections I see not as a disadvantage but as an advantage. Far more people are likely to produce a good turnout on that day than, say, for a separate election in September or October, let alone in 2012. It would obviously also be far more cost-effective; the extra cost of a separate election would be eliminated.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="1012066000089"></a>I cannot see the advantage of what is now being proposed. With all legislation the test should be what is in the interest of the user and the consumer. In this case the consumer is the elector, and I would have thought overwhelmingly that his interest would be very much to have it on the same day. He is much more likely to go out willingly on that day, and we will achieve a much bigger vote.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="1012066000090"></a>At this point it is worth remembering the evidence of the Electoral Commission to the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee. It is interesting because the committee specifically sought clarification of the commission's position on the combination of a referendum with other polls. In 2002, the commission  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_18"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>had stated that referendums on fundamental issues of national importance should be considered in isolation. Jenny Watson, the chairman, explained that the commission had reconsidered this view and had decided that the evidence was not conclusive enough to support its earlier position that a referendum should never be combined with another poll. According to the committee:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="1012066000218"></a>"Ms Watson said that the Commission had decided that on balance there were definite benefits from combining the AV referendum with other polls, especially because there would not be so much 'voter fatigue, which would be the case if you didn't combine".</p>

<p><a name="1012066000206"></a>That was the commission's considered opinion against a background of scepticism on this position. I agree with that. I think it is a very strong case. The question is clear and that the public are entirely capable of making up their minds on this issue, and it is a bit condescending to suggest otherwise.</p>

It is perfectly true that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, stuck to that particular argument, but that has not been the only argument adduced. My argument is, counter to that of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, that all power and effort should be devoted to having the referendum on 5 May because that is to the advantage of the public and the whole system. That is how we will get the biggest possible vote, and it is for that reason that I support the 5 May date. We would be quite mistaken to turn our back on it.</p>

I regret that I did not see the groupings suggested for these amendments in advance, because we would have done better to separate the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, which would give us a contingency plan in case it was impossible to make 5 May, from the amendments that I and some other noble Lords have put forward, which suggest an alternative date.

I did not take it terribly well when he said that the debate on this has already been interminable. It is a bit odd to say that a debate has been interminable as you jump to your feet to make a substantial contribution yourself. Leaving that to one side, I believe that this is a desperately important matter, particularly to the  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_19"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people of Scotland and Wales, who have some representatives on the Benches opposite. To say that we have had an interminable debate-I think that we had one of about an hour and a half the other day-suggests that this Government are uninterested in concluding debates in a civilised and thorough manner and merely want to push this Bill on to the statute book with a sort of droit de seigneur because they won the general election. So I thought that was sad.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="1012066000095"></a>I also did not find the noble Lord's 1998 analogy terribly convincing. Yes, there were two separate polls in London in 1998, but they were both on local government matters-elections to the council and changes in the structure of government in London. People's minds were on local government at that time, and it is not unreasonable to expect a combined vote on that. But here you are having local government elections at the same time as you debate what system should be used for national elections. I certainly do not underestimate voters' intelligence; it is when Governments try to confuse them that voters get confused. There could not be any recipe more confusing to the voter than combining a referendum on what system should be used for general elections in future with one on who should run their local council tomorrow. That is a very sad combination and, on this side of the House, we have tried various ways to skin the cat and to avoid it.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="1012066000096"></a>The other topic that will come up on other amendments is cost; it is the only substantial argument put forward by most of the speakers for the Government for combining the two things. I except the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, from that charge. On this matter, I have just received a most helpful and polite note from the Leader of the House in response to the promise that he made last week to set out the cost in full. It sheds light on one confusion that arose last week, when nobody knew whether it would cost £15 million, or whether £30 million would be saved, by having the two things on the same day. I shall paraphrase the noble Lord's letter, and no doubt he will interrupt if I get him wrong; he said that it would cost £15 million, because it would cost less to have the referendum on AV, and that it would save £15 million in addition because it would cost less to have local government elections if there was an AV referendum. My sense is that an official has sensibly not tried to get too sophisticated in the analysis and has attributed half the cost to one thing and half to the other.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="1012066000097"></a>That is a great clarification for which the House will be grateful. It enables us to concentrate on the wider figure. I am not going to have a discussion on whether £80 million, £50 million or £30 million is a very large sum of money. My experience is that many people do not distinguish the number of noughts on the end of a figure anyway. If I had £1 for every time the <I>Guardian</I> has said £1 billion when it means £1 million or £1 million when it means £1 billion, I should be rich enough to pay for the referendum out of my own back pocket.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="1012066000098"></a>There is a curiosity highlighted by this. If it is worth having such a referendum at a cost of around £90 million, surely it is right to pay an extra £15 million-less than 20 per cent of that-to have a referendum that really means something and settles the argument one way or the other once and for all. Penny-pinching to the tune

The reality, as every Member of this House knows, is that it has nothing to do with cost. The Government want it on that day as part of a deal. The Lib Dems, wrongly in my view, think that they are more likely to win the referendum if it takes place on 5 May.

Why then, in Wales, is there to be a referendum in March and another in May? Why not combine those two? It would save money. That shows again the vacuity of the cost argument. It is not about cost. That is why the Government are prepared to pay for a referendum on Welsh legislative powers in March separate from the one in May. It is about the view of Lib Dem members of the coalition that they are more likely to win on 5 May and the Government's view that the Lib Dems can have what they want, as long as they-the Government-get their boundary changes and a reduction in the number of MPs that will increase their advantage in the House of Commons as a result.</p>

The Bill proposes to sweep that all aside on the same day as holding local elections. It is an outrageous suggestion. Changing the electoral system is a one-off instrument that will change voting in this country forever. Yet we will be asked to have a discussion of this huge constructional change in the midst of local elections.</p>

We went around canvassing for our policies. We spoke through loudspeakers on corners of streets to convey our message to the electorate-although I do not think that they do that now. What will we do if, first of all, we have to convince electors that they should vote for our policies-whichever our party-and, at the same time, ask them to make a decision about a vital and profound alteration to our electoral system?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="1012066000104"></a>As I have said before, this is an outrageous proposal which treats the electorate with contempt. The electorate are being asked to change something that they have had for 100 years. They understand the system and have got used to it. In times gone by-certainly something has happened since-the electorate were producing electoral decisions based on a very high turnout, sometimes 75 or 80 per cent. Here we are asking them to change the system without a proper discussion. This system is complex-it is a change that people will not easily understand. People deserve to be informed of exactly what results will appertain from the change and be told exactly how it will work before they can make a decision. That cannot be mixed up with local elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="1012066000105"></a>I cannot understand why the coalition is bringing this forward. It has time to make a change. Although I do not agree with the AV system, it would probably do better if it had a separate referendum at a different time so that people could be asked to understand what is being proposed. If the Government are unable to change their mind on holding the referendum at the same time as other local and regional elections, they will regret it very much. I urge them to change their minds.</p>

It gives me, and others, another chance to state yet again that, apart from the occasional speech, I do not find any great resistance among the Labour ranks to the actual fact of holding a referendum. There will be people who are very principled against it and I respect that. However, it has to be judged against the majority. I do not think that my noble friend's amendment is a destructive or wrecking amendment, designed to defeat the Bill and bring the Government into chaos-although it would not take much, right enough. However, that is another story. The timing of the Bill in relation to other matters this week might split this collaboration Government. Supporting this amendment does not necessarily mean being against the referendum. I would look forward to a referendum and would participate strongly against AV. That is everybody's right if and when it happens. I make it clear again, especially for the benefit of the Liberal Benches, that I am not against the referendum. Let the people speak and I will do my best to influence them.</p>

Frankly, you would need to have been there to see the shambles. It has been indicated that this is a simple thing. There was a sly reference, suggesting that, by expressing doubt about the efficacy of the referendum, we are somehow casting aspersions on our own people. The Scots are pretty good at insulting other people; we are not too bad at insulting our own as well, but do not let anybody else

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="1012066000108"></a>I find myself being tempted down the road of dealing with the Liberals again so I will spend just a minute on them. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, uses the word "internal" about this debate. My God, this is only a very early stage. Last week, when we discussed the first group of amendments, the only Liberal who spoke was the noble Lord, Lord Rennard. The Liberal Benches were otherwise silent. There was no participation, scrutiny or involvement and there were no interventions-nothing. Is that what this House is here for? There might have been an occasional intervention but they were so fleeting that I do not remember them. I see the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, indicating disagreement. I did not hear or see much involvement from the Liberal Benches last week. I think there was one intervention from the Conservative Benches from the only noble Lord who happened to be there at the time-the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton. If this House is a revising Chamber, as I strongly believe it is, where was the participation? The Liberal Peers should look to their own house on that.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="1012066000109"></a>There was no consultation with the devolved Assemblies on holding the referendum on the same day. Before I am accused of repetition, that cannot be said often enough or sincerely enough to get across to the Government just how insulting that is held to be in Scotland. There was no consideration, no consultation and no involvement. Scotland was somehow tagged on as though it was a type of poodle at the end of Westminster. I say that although I am no Scot nat. It has been badly handled and it indicates what has been disregarded in the rush.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="1012066000110"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, made some points; frankly, they could be telling. I do not dismiss in any way what he said. They are relevant matters, worth discussing. However, they are made inoperable in this sense. I have here the business and minutes of proceedings for this House. The forward business for Monday 20 December of this year-not next year-says that it is expected that the Committee stage of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill will conclude. That is the rush to judgment, referred to by several of my noble friends, which we could all collectively regret, although I hope not. I do not want to cite the Dangerous Dogs Act, which many noble Lords will recall. However, in response to the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, the rush to judgment is dangerous and it should not continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="1012066000111"></a>My noble friend Lord Rooker has mentioned the lifeboat syndrome, and that is right, because this amendment would give the Government a chance to think again. I keep coming up against a brick wall in the sense that the logical, rational side of me cannot grasp why there is this rush to legislate-a 300-page Bill being rammed through the House of Lords in a matter of weeks. Then the politician in me asks, "Why? There's got to be a reason". And once again we come up against the reason: the reason is political expediency. The Conservative side of the collaboration Government are desperate to get their boundaries Bill, and the Liberal part of the collaboration Government are desperate to get a referendum Bill to save their party

I am unsure exactly what-</p>

As I was going to say, however, I would be interested to know what system they are to be elected under-maybe an additional system to add to the ones we have got.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="1012066000115"></a>The importance of this issue is greater than considerations of cost-not only because it is a not once-in-a-generation but a once-in-three-generations decision, but also because of the unintended consequences. The consequences might be desirable or they might be undesirable: how we as political parties-which is how most of us in the House, although obviously not all, do our politics; how we organise; how we campaign; how we select candidates. All those sorts of issues have yet to be thought through. I was very against my own party's decision-I am very sorry; I see that I have upset the Front Bench in front of me-to bring in a closed voting system for the European elections. I thought they were wrong, I told them they were wrong, I threatened that I would not vote Labour if they brought that system in. But the women who had called for the vote for women for so long would never forgive me if I did not vote, and I knew that my hand would drop off if I did not vote Labour, so eventually I did. But I thought that the system was wrong, and I maintain it was wrong. What is important, however, is how that has made a difference to how we do our politics. So even if I was wrong and the system chosen was the perfect one, it had consequences for the way that we campaign, for the way that we select and, indeed, for the power of the parties. I think that it gave far too much power to parties in the selection of candidates. We had not had time on that occasion to think through and talk about it. I believe that my party was wrong in doing it at that stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="1012066000116"></a>However, before we cast our votes in the referendum, I believe that we need a debate on how these different systems have worked. How have the Welsh and Scottish systems worked? How has it worked in Northern Ireland, where there has been a local government system for a long time? How is the European system working? We need that debate and therefore it seems to me important to give us time before we come to this decision. We need time to debate the matter in this House-although we are privileged and that is a luxury-but even more important is to make time for the electorate to consider this important question before we ask it to make such an important decision.</p>

The Government are understandably preoccupied with advancing their policy of a referendum in which the people of this country will be offered a choice as to the future system of elections to the House of Commons. It is a profoundly important issue. Also to be held on that day are local elections, which are profoundly important as well. We ought to keep the interests of local government in the forefront of our minds, as there is a question about respect for local government that we should consider very carefully. However, perhaps I may come back to that point in a second.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="1012066000118"></a>Whichever side of the argument we may be on-in favour or against the alternative vote system-and whichever side we are on in the argument about whether there should be some sort of change to the system of electing Members of Parliament, I think we all agree that this is a momentous issue of the utmost importance. It is also an issue that will be considered only on very rare occasions in our political life. I believe that there is a compelling case for keeping the nation's deliberations on that issue distinct from the deliberations on other important issues that are to be put to the vote. Therefore, in the interests of clarity and wise decision-taking, and, as my noble friend Lord Rooker put it to us, in the interests of simply not rushing the process, there seems to be a very strong case for holding the referendum separately from, and later than, the local government elections.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="1012066000119"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, argued in favour of holding the two elections on the same day precisely on the basis that the referendum is extremely important and that it would be most unsatisfactory if it were to be determined on a low turnout. However, I put it to the noble Lord that there is a better and more reliable means of ensuring that there is an adequate turnout, which is to introduce a threshold requirement into this legislation. That is a debate for another day but I think we shall have that debate. Personally, I hope very much that Parliament will conclude that we should not change anything so fundamental in our constitution as our system of elections to the House of Commons on a derisory turnout, that we should insist on a requirement for a minimum percentage of those entitled to vote and that, if that minimum percentage is not reached, there

I think that that is a better way to secure the entirely valid objective of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="1012066000120"></a>Perhaps I may come back for a moment to the question of respect for local government. One sadness of my political life is that in all the years that I have been in one House of Parliament or another I have seen local government disparaged and demeaned, and, if I may say so, that has been all too characteristic of Parliament and of Governments of all parties over a long period. We are at risk of showing insufficient consideration and respect for the validity and importance of the local elections on 5 May next year. One understands why in the mid-1970s central government felt that they had to move to restrict some of the more exciting activities of local government. Indeed, one Secretary of State said that the party was over.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="1012066000121"></a>But the Treasury-above all, the Treasury, I believe-exploited that opportunity quite ruthlessly. Expenditure in this country and power in this country are, in a way, a zero-sum game, and the Treasury was deeply resentful of any fiscal independence on the part of local government and of any independent rights that local government might have to raise money. So we saw increasing restrictions. We saw capping. We saw limits on borrowing. We saw an increasing tendency of government to ring-fence the grant to local government through specific grants. All of this has been profoundly bad for our democratic culture in this country. If there is an alienation from our politics in this country then I believe that, in important measure, it stems from this source. Therefore I think that we should always think very carefully about the standing of local government, the dignity of local government and, indeed, the independence of local government to act as a check and a balance within our constitution and within the power structure of this country.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="1012066000122"></a>To muddle up the issues on 5 May next year could with some justification be interpreted as cynical and as far too characteristic of the habitual attitude of central government and, I fear, of Parliament to local government. For that reason also, therefore, it would be unfortunate if the two sets of elections were to be held on the same day next spring or early summer. However, the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Rooker is not prescriptive in this particular matter. It allows a margin of flexibility. It allows the Government to reflect carefully on whether it is wise to hold the referendum on the same day as the local elections. As my noble friend said, it also provides a contingency margin so that, if we do indeed find that the preparations cannot be advanced with sufficient speed and the conditions in which the referendum would be held would be unsatisfactory, the Government can with dignity adjust the date and we can still go ahead with the referendum on this extremely important issue, but we can do so in a sensible set of circumstances. So I hope that the House will be willing to support my noble friend Lord Rooker if he presses his amendment this afternoon.</p>

I am pleased that my noble friend was able to intervene before me. It is not just a question of whether the Electoral Commission would recommend that the date be changed; it is whether the Government for other reasons might wish to change the date of the referendum. I would remind the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, that in 2001 a Government had to defer elections due to the foot and mouth crisis. All over the country, returning officers were arguing with their local authorities that it would be impractical, because of problems at polling stations, to carry out polling on that particular day. In addition to the question asked by my noble friend, I would therefore like to know what would happen in those circumstances.</p>

I would like to draw the House's attention to the then Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill which was considered by Parliament earlier this year-a Bill produced by the then Labour Government. Under Clause 29 of that legislation we find my noble friend's amendment. Under "Referendum on voting systems", it states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="1012066000219"></a>"A referendum is to be held, no later than 31 October 2011, on the voting system for parliamentary elections".</p>

There is a lot of evidence out there to suggest that the optional multi-preference election system under the alternative vote system-which applies not in Australia generally in its federal Parliament arrangements, but only in one state, Queensland-is flawed. There has been a lot of academic work to prove that. In later stages of the Bill I will bring forward evidence, on the basis of international evidence which we have been able to collate, to dismantle systematically the case made for that system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="1012066000131"></a>Even this morning I received a paper on STV which applies under the Scottish system for local elections. The interesting thing about STV in Scotland is that when a by-election takes place there it triggers an AV election. In other words, within the United Kingdom we have examples of AV operating which have not been fully considered by Parliament. The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, drew my attention to that the other day-he nods his head. What happened in those 32 by-elections in Scotland will be of great interest to the House when we produce that information. This morning I received a document, whose authors are Professor David Denver of Lancaster University, Dr Alistair Clark of Belfast and Dr Lynn Bennie of Aberdeen, on the operation of the STV system in Scotland-not on AV as it applies in individual constituencies when there is a by-election.</p>

Is the noble Lord aware that a royal commission recommended the adoption of the AV system in 1910; that an all-party Speaker's Conference made the same recommendation in 1917; and that the House of Commons voted for the introduction of the alternative vote system in 1931? Does he consider that this is perhaps the only place where 100 years is deemed inadequate time for consultation before voters are allowed to say how their representatives should be chosen?</p>

It is true that AV was considered, but not in the form that is proposed in the Bill. That is at the heart of my argument. It is a different system. There are three major systems available under the alternative vote and the historic debate in this country has taken place on the Australian system, where it is compulsory to vote. Indeed, if you do not exercise all your votes, under the Australian AV system, your vote is discounted, not even taken into account.</p>

That is what we are doing. We are not, for a moment, calling anyone stupid.

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="1012066000150"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, intervened to tell us what took place about AV in 1911 and subsequently. I have watched the career of the noble Lord with some interest. He has been better at fixing by-elections than at participating in them in his time as chief executive of the Liberal Democrats, but let us bring him bang up to date so far as AV is concerned, and particularly as far as your Lordships' House is concerned. As recently as 1998, AV was denounced as "disturbingly unpredictable" by no less a personage than the late Roy Jenkins. I cannot claim any close association with Roy Jenkins, although I was his Whip in the 1970s, and a pretty tough job that was, but I appreciate that he commanded enormous respect in both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="1012066000151"></a>I want to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Fowler. I know he is a notable personage in the Conservative Party, but his was the first Back-Bench speech I have heard in favour of this Bill. The Conservative Party normally sits mute during the passage of this legislation because it knows full well what it is about. I do not think I am betraying any secrets in saying that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler and I had a long and friendly parliamentary relationship in the other place. Now that we can both escape from the wrath of our respective activists, I can say that we were paired for some years in the other place. I never knew he was a secret referendum addict during that time-not that it would have made any difference, of course, but I thought that his speech was at least supportive of this Bill.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="1012066000152"></a>I do not want to delay the House unduly, or to repeat anything that I said in debates last week. However, on AV and its possible complications, I think the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, who will reply to this debate, owes the House a detailed explanation as to how exactly voters-and particularly the Scots-will be able to differentiate between the various elections and look at AV as well. He shakes his head: as a Scot, I know he would be delighted to tell me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="1012066000153"></a>Actually, I thought this debate would be replied to from the government Front Bench by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, so I have a proposition to put to him which I hope his noble friend will pass on. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, and I have one thing in common. He used to represent my hometown of Stockport in the Labour interest in those days, before apostasy became fashionable. If the noble Lord, Lord McNally, believes that the alternative vote system is a simple one, and that we are being condescending and patronising to the electorate by saying it deserves a proper and full debate and a date on its own to be voted on, let me issue this challenge. I invite him to walk with me through the streets of Stockport next Saturday morning and ask two questions of anybody we come across. First, are you in favour of the alternative vote system; and, secondly, could you tell me what it is? Perhaps we could ask a third question as well: would you mind accompanying us to watch Stockport County? That is where I will be heading.</p>

When I came into this House a couple of months ago, I was told very quietly that this is a reflective Chamber, and we take our time here and mop up the mistakes made in the House of Commons by looking at Bills in a detailed way. If there ever is an opportunity to caw canny, as they say in Scotland, I think it is this amendment today. My noble friend Lord Rooker said it would not change anything; it would still give the Government freedom to decide when to have the referendum. When I participated as a very keen observer in the Scottish Parliament elections in 2007, in the constituency across the River Clyde from me there were 1,600 discarded and spoiled votes. The majority of our win was less than 100. The SNP then went on to govern Scotland as a result of a shambolic election. I spoke to the returning officers, and they said that it was done too quickly: that too many pressures were piled on them and that situation was the result. As my noble friend Lord McAlvoy has said, the debate here will end on 20 December until next year. All that administrative stuff has to be undertaken after the legislation has been passed. I fear that we could have another shambles as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="1012066000157"></a>There is time for us to tell the Government that we can slow down. This is a radical Government in terms of the welfare reforms that they are implementing. A couple of months ago, the Chancellor stood in the House of Commons and pulled £17 billion from the hat. We do not know where those welfare reforms will hit. We know that there is a child benefit threshold for higher rate taxpayers. But last Thursday, the Treasury sneaked out a report stating that another 100,000 people will be taken into the higher rate tax threshold because it has been lowered by £1,400. As a former chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, I say that the problems are piling up for this Government and that they will be answered in perhaps a year or 15 months' time.</p>

At the time, the Government did not think about the losers. I suggest that there will be losers in the radical

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="1012066000159"></a>Some problems are being played out at the moment; for example, tuition fees. I am a good friend of the Business Secretary, Vince Cable, but to say that he is standing on his head in terms of tuition fees is an understatement. My former friend Anne Widdecombe has shown us something on "Strictly Come Dancing" that Vince has not done on the tuition fees-simply because the problem has not been thought out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="1012066000160"></a>My noble friend Lord Donoughue was in Downing Street with Jim Callaghan and has written an excellent book. He said that Jim Callaghan as Prime Minister had a "maybe man" in Downing Street. The Government might have had a policy, which they were going to implement, and the "maybe man" said, "Hold on. What are the implications of this?". This is a "maybe man" moment in this Chamber, so that my noble friend Lord Rooker's amendment gets the opportunity to be reflected on and the Government do not run headlong into a shambles of their own making.</p>

My noble friend Lord Rooker's amendment is modest and sensible. He is saying that it would be possible for the Government to have the referendum on any date between 5 May and 31 October 2011. He is not addressing the combination issue; nor is he addressing how long it would take to have proper debates. He is saying, "Give yourselves some flexibility".</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="1012066000162"></a>There are obviously two reasons for flexibility. The first is in relation to the administration of the election. In relation to the administration of the referendum, the Electoral Commission believes that,</p>
<ul><a name="1012066000226"></a>"on balance ... it should be possible to deliver the different polls proposed for 5 May 2011".</ul>
<p><a name="1012066000209"></a>I am quoting the chairman of the Electoral Commission when giving evidence to the Scottish Parliament. It is to be noted that that conclusion, she says, is expressly contingent upon "the key practical risks" being "properly managed". The Electoral Commission has several times repeated that,</p>
<ul><a name="1012066000227"></a>"the rules on how the referendum will be conducted must be clear from at least six months in advance".</ul>
<p><a name="1012066000210"></a>We are now less than six months in advance from the date of the referendum. It has added that,</p>
<ul><a name="1012066000228"></a>"provided the Bill receives Royal Assent in time to allow a referendum period of at least 10 weeks, there will be adequate time for the Commission to register campaigners and designate lead campaigning organisations, and for campaigners to put the arguments to voters".</ul>
<p><a name="1012066000211"></a>Put neutrally, it is pretty obvious that there is a significant risk that the administration will not be ready by 5 May 2011. That should be looked at in the context of the Government not having consulted, before they chose 5 May 2011, either the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh Assembly. The Scottish Executive expressed the view that holding the referendum on 5 May 2011,</p>
<ul><a name="1012066000229"></a>"shows a lack of respect for the devolved administrations",</ul>
<p><a name="1012066000212"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="1012066000230"></a>"undermines the integrity of elections to the Scottish Parliament".</ul>
<p><a name="1012066000213"></a>As everybody knows, the Welsh Assembly Government are likewise opposed to holding the referendum on the same day as the Assembly elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="1012066000163"></a>The Select Committee of this House published its seventh report of the Session 2010-11. It was printed on 10 November 2010 and its cross-party unanimous conclusion was:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="1012066000220"></a>"Given that the Bill was introduced in the House only six months before the proposed referendum date, there is a danger that these deadlines will not be met".</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="1012066000164"></a>The obvious and sensible conclusion for the Government is to give themselves leeway if they cannot meet the deadlines, either because of organisational issues or issues in relation to scrutiny. A Government who say no to that are a Government in their early days. If they were more sensible, they would say, "Yes, I see the force of the argument and we will agree to that". If the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, pushes the matter to a vote, we will support it.</p>

Noble Lords who were there will have recognised that many of the issues that were raised last week were raised again today. I make no great criticism of that. It is inevitable in the early stages of discussing a Bill. The only surprise is that nobody, in an hour and a half of debate, mentioned a subject that was raised several times last week-that of the royal wedding. So as far as I can see, we have moved a great step forward over the course of the past week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="1012066000166"></a>The debate really divided into three groups of speakers. First, there were those who were against the amendment and in favour of the Government's proposal. Secondly, there were those like the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, who sensed that the Government were doing the right thing in offering a referendum but that they have not thought through all the various contingencies and needed some help and support-the word "lifeboat" was used and that sort of language. And thirdly, there were those like the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, my noble friend Lord Hamilton, and one or two others, who were opposed to the referendum and opposed to AV, and they also would support the amendment.</p>

But this amendment is about the date, and all those who will support the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, if he presses it to a vote, have understood that by accepting this amendment, in practice the referendum cannot take place on 5 May. Amendment 5 does not specify an alternative appropriate day. Setting the date in the Bill, as we have done, gives certainty to those involved in the planning and campaigning. I could not help thinking during the course of the debate that if the Government had published a Bill with no date, noble Lords opposite would be the first to get up and say, "How outrageous this is. How can anybody campaign? This is the Government making it up as they go along".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="1012066000170"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, said that people will be confused. There is a lot of outrage in the House today about this sense of confusion. As my noble friend Lord Tyler said, people have no difficulty in voting in local elections and general elections on the same day. In this House, we are used to making lots of decisions every day, but the poor people outside are not so blessed with our brains and will find it much more difficult. I think not. People are well capable of deciding who should represent them in terms of local government, the Welsh Assembly or Scottish Parliament. They are able to decide on a simple yes or no whether or not they wish to have AV. I have no truck with these arguments about confusion.</p>

The Government wanted to make an announcement on a national basis on a given day to Parliament. Even if it was a lack of respect, should we change the date just because of that lack of respect, if there is no other reason not to continue?</p>

There will be local elections in England, in 36 metropolitan boroughs and 49 unitary authorities; in some of these, one-third are up for election, and some are all up. Then there are the 194 second-tier districts in England. In other words, 279 local authorities will run elections in England, local elections in Northern Ireland and mayoral elections-that was what the noble Baroness was after-and in four local authorities in England: those of Bedford, Middlesbrough, Mansfield and Torbay. Then, of course, there will be parish elections in England.</p>

Some of that will be dealt with in the localism Bill, but no one knows when that Bill will enter the other House.

Do not tell me that there is no group of Ministers or civil servants assessing the risks of this measure. If there is not, there will be one hell of a row, because every other public body has a risk assessment of things that can go wrong. It is implicit that in the conduct of public administration there should be an assessment of the risks, but there is no mention of that. There is a fixation on certainty instead. I do not mind that; I am just offering the Government a degree of flexibility on the practicalities. I deliberately did not refer to any of the other amendments on the dates.

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="1012066000198"></a>In paragraph 24 of the Constitution Committee report, to which my noble friend referred briefly, the Electoral Commission said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="1012066000222"></a>"Provided the Bill receives Royal Assent in time to allow a referendum period of at least 10 weeks, there will be adequate time for the Commission to register campaigners and designate",</p>

That recent poll was not undertaken 100 years ago, as the noble Lord, Lord Rennard said; it was undertaken by YouGov for the Constitution Society in only August/September this year.

Everyone knew that local elections and general elections were supposed to happen but there were hot discussions in the Cabinet and with the Prime Minister about them. We had a degree of flexibility, but the fact is that no one had planned for foot and mouth. We did not plan for the one in 2007, which was completely self-inflicted. We could have a problem and all I am saying is that, leaving aside some of the issues raised by colleagues, we ought to build in flexibility.</p>

It is not a sneaky amendment; it is seductive, if you like-I prefer seductive. If she wants sneaky, there is one much further on in the Bill; it came out of last week's debate and I fully accept that it could be classed as sneaky. I am trying to give the Government the opportunity to have flexibility. All Governments want it; local government wants it. It was in my mind that 31 October had been referred to somewhere. I had forgotten that it was in the Constitutional Reform Bill. The previous Government introduced a Bill without a date-they said that it should be before 31 October.</p>

However, this amendment could not possibly cause the Electoral Commission one iota of concern. The date of 5 May is still a runner. That is the Government's intention, Parliament's assumption and the assumption that we want everyone outside to make. There is a degree of certainty. No one will say that it is deliberate, but things can happen outside the control of local government, the private sector and central government. It does not really matter; one can think these things up, which is why I am sad to say that we have not had the list from the risk committee that has been discussed in government. I cannot believe that this has not been dealt with somewhere.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="10120617000002"></a>The speed with which the Bill has been put together has been justly criticised. One consequence of the haste has been a lack of consultation on the date of the proposed referendum. The Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly were not consulted about the date, and during the debate on the previous amendment I read to noble Lords the view that the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly took on that matter.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_42"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101206-0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="10120617000003"></a>The poll, as proposed, will be on 5 May next year. On that date, elections are already scheduled for the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the Northern Ireland Assembly, 279 local authorities in England and 26 local councils in Northern Ireland, as well as some mayoral elections. Thanks to the questions asked by my noble friend Lady McDonagh, who sadly is not in her place, we have learnt that, although the legislation has not yet been passed, there will in addition in certain places be a number of referendums on whether there should be mayors. Therefore, 5 May will be a busy electoral day for the vast majority of the British public, even without a referendum vote, and it will be made all the more busy if the poll on changing the electoral system goes ahead on 5 May as well.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10120617000004"></a>We are not suggesting for one moment that voters will be unable to vote in more than one poll at once, but the potential for confusion and administrative complexity must be acknowledged. In its assessment of a combination of referendums and elections, the Electoral Commission pointed to risks arising from different regulatory regimes running concurrently. These regulations can refer to spending limits and also to the make-up of the electoral register. As my noble friend Lord Foulkes informed us in Committee last Monday, overseas voters, for example, are on the parliamentary franchise but not on the local government franchise, whereas citizens of European countries living in the United Kingdom are on the local government franchise but not on the parliamentary one.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="10120617000005"></a>Campaigning for the multitude of votes on 5 May 2011 will also cause a muddle. The election campaigns for the local and devolved assemblies will be held on a party basis but the campaign for the referendum will be cross-party. I may be of the same opinion as many noble Lords opposite when it comes to deciding whether we should adopt the alternative vote system for elections to the House of Commons but, should I meet the noble Lord the Leader of the House on the streets of London, I do not believe that we will be arguing for the same party candidate to be returned. On reflection, no party candidates will be returned in London because there will be no voting in London, so I shall be very confused if I am there.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="10120617000006"></a>The Gould report on the 2007 elections in Scotland identified the combination of polls as one of the most controversial aspects of the votes that took place on 3 May 2007. Gould concluded in his report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="10120617000101"></a>"If local issues and the visibility of local government candidates are viewed as a primary objective, then separating the Scottish parliamentary from the local government elections is necessary in order to avoid the dominance of campaigns conducted for the Scottish parliamentary contests. In addition, separating the two elections would result in minimising the potential for voter confusion".</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10120617000007"></a>The issues surrounding the local and devolved elections already scheduled deserve the space to be debated and aired without the distraction of totally different matters relating to the referendum. Similarly, if the arguments surrounding the merits or demerits of changing the voting system for the House of Commons are to be fully discussed and understood, they need their own time and space as well. Changing the voting system is a major and significant constitutional reform. It should not get lost among campaigns and arguments.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_43"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101206-0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10120617000008"></a>We believe that our argument for no combination of polls is strengthened given the circumstances in which the date of the referendum vote came about-five days of coalition negotiation and we are told that there is to be a vote on 5 May 2011. It is the sort of thing where it would be useful to consult more widely and then come to a sensible conclusion about the date. Despite knowing that the devolved Assemblies would be voting on this day, neither Scotland, Wales, as I have said, nor Northern Ireland has been consulted on the referendum date. Alex Salmond wrote to the Prime Minister in the following terms:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="10120617000102"></a>"I believe that your proposals to hold a referendum on the same day undermines the integrity of the elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These elections are of profound importance to our citizens and I believe they have the right to make their electoral choices for the respective devolved chambers without the distraction of a parallel referendum campaign on the UK voting system".</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10120617000009"></a>The Welsh Assembly Government have been similarly scathing. The fear of distraction from other polls to be held on 5 May was the motivation behind the Welsh Assembly's decision not to hold its own referendum on extending powers to the Assembly on the same day as Assembly elections.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10120617000010"></a>The cross-party Constitution Committee of your Lordships' House has noted opposition to the combination of polls. It has quoted the matters I have identified from the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly and agrees with that sentiment.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10120617000011"></a>There is a critical issue which all of those issues are but an expression of. Our Constitution Committee said that if you have an election on the same day as other elections, even assuming that you can get through the issue of confusion, there is evidence showing that the reform issue will be swamped by the issue of who you want to have as your elected representative, whether it be in the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly or the local authority. That is what the evidence shows.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="10120617000012"></a>I understand why those negotiating the coalition agreement five days after the election were unaware of that evidence. However, now that we know that the experts are saying that this is the position, and in view of the fact that we are dealing with an issue as important as a change in the electoral system, it is very difficult to see what damage, beyond the money that the extra poll would cost, would be caused by having it on a different date. I cannot believe that the Government honestly think that if we had to have them on different days we could not afford to have them. I cannot believe that they honestly think they could not get enough voters out to make it plausible. If they do think that then we should not have this referendum at all.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="10120617000013"></a>I ask the noble Lord the Leader of the House to focus on the issue. He wants a plausible referendum which people have confidence in. Listen to the evidence, and have it on a separate day from all of those other polls. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="10120617000014"></a><b><a name="101206-0001.htm_spnew121"></a><a name="10120617000505"></a>Lord Strathclyde:</b> I am very grateful to the noble and learned Lord for introducing his amendment. As he laid out, it seeks to prevent the referendum from being combined with any other poll. I am aware of the  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_44"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 44</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>concerns that have been expressed regarding combining polls next May: we had some of them in the previous debate, and last week. However, as I said earlier, 84 per cent of the electorate will already have a reason to go to the polls on 5 May 2011, and combining this with other polls on that day will save in the region of £30 million across all polls.</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="10120617000015"></a>Combined polls are not unusual and I have every confidence that voters will be able to distinguish between the different polls taking place-in fact, it is increasingly strange to suggest otherwise. What does the Electoral Commission say? It advised that it is possible to successfully deliver these different polls on 5 May. The commission also issued briefing throughout the Bill's passage through the Commons and has concluded that the Bill contains,</p>
<ul><a name="10120617000116"></a>"the necessary provisions for the combination of the referendum poll with the scheduled elections. We are satisfied that the technical issues we have identified with these provisions to date have been addressed by the Government.</ul>
<p><a name="10120617000098"></a>The commission went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="10120617000103"></a>"The Government has tabled a series of amendments ... to reflect relevant changes to the election conduct rules made by the revised conduct Orders for the May 2011 elections to the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales and Northern Ireland Assembly and local councils in Northern Ireland, which have been laid before Parliament. We welcome these amendments which seek to ensure that the combination provisions are accurate and workable".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="10120617000016"></a>The noble and learned Lord quoted the Gould report. I, too, have read what he said, and we can all quote selectively from it.</p>

In respect of the comparison with 2007, Ron Gould said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="10120617000104"></a>"I do not believe that holding both on the same day would create the same degree of confusion and resultant rejected ballots especially if sufficient advance public information and guidance was provided to the voters".</p>

<a name="101206-0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="10120617000019"></a>The rigorous testing carried out by the Electoral Commission should also reassure those worried about voter confusion. The new draft clearly enables the electorate to understand the choice it is being asked to make and to express its views. The Bill also gives the Electoral Commission a role in providing information about the referendum and how to vote in it, which will help to minimise confusion. For those reasons, I hope the noble and learned Lord will feel that we have covered all the questions that he posed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="10120617000020"></a>The only election which comes to mind when there was a combined referendum was the one which the noble and learned Lord will remember so well in London in 1998.</p>

Can he confirm that there will be no real problem about adding the alternative vote to all the other matters that will be taking place if the Government get their way and we all have to troop out to vote for various things on the same day? How many people has he come across who have actually advocated the AV system? In his experience, aside from the rather peculiar friends that we all keep in politics, who, among ordinary people, knows exactly how AV works or, in fact, does not work?</p>

If I am able to find out, I will drop him a line. The noble Lord, Lord Snape, introduces an interesting argument: if, as he believes, people do not understand some aspect of this, they should never be asked whether or not they agree with it. Apart from the fact that that shows a surprising degree of arrogance and is patronising to his former constituents, and even if they do not understand it now, they will have plenty of opportunity to do so before the referendum takes place.</p>

They are not my former constituents, in fact. I am talking about the fellow citizens of my home town-the town that the noble and, alas, absent noble Lord, Lord McNally, represented in the Labour interest in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, the noble Lord cannot get away with that; it is not a plausible response. The fact is that for people who do not take a deep interest in politics, the letters AV make their eyes glaze over. All that we on these Benches are saying is that before such a momentous and dramatic change is put to the British people in a binding referendum, some explanation ought to be put before them as to why this particular system-denounced as it was for many years by the Conservatives' new-found allies in the Liberal Democrats-is the one and only choice to be available to them on the ballot paper. As for the other point, about being patronising, the noble Lord will notice that I have an amendment down for debate later which gives people genuine choice between first past the post, which I support, and the AV system, which, as far as I am aware, has no great supporters other than those hoping to save their necks among his new-found allies.</p>

Earlier today I raised the impact of the proposals on campaigning. My difficulty, which I am sure will be shared with noble Lords opposite who have been involved in this, is knowing who to knock up on the night. You want them to vote for your own political party, but if you know they will not be voting the same way on the AV referendum, you might get a bit choosy. It will be quite difficult to get our normal political activity involved late at night. I am sorry for the Cross-Benchers-this is a party issue. However, it is undoubtedly one that, as we vote in the local government elections, will be uppermost in the minds of all our local organisers.</p>

These bodies have been set up for over 10 years and the present Secretary of State makes a huge play of her wish to work with the Welsh Assembly in Wales. If this is a precursor of how the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament are to be treated in future; if this is the result of hurried legislation; if the Leader of the House sees that he has no duty to apologise, not personally but on behalf of the Government, it augurs pretty badly for the relationship in the future.</p>

I was not going to intervene in this debate but I was struck by the Leader of the House's use of the word confidentiality. I have the privilege outside this House of chairing the board of a non-ministerial department-I give a new flavour to the coalition, in some ways, on a UK-wide body. We are responsible and accountable to the four separate Governments. The issue of confidentiality, lack of trust and not being able to be frank and open with Ministers-who are themselves very widely in coalition in the UK-has, in my experience, never arisen. The devolved Administrations are not the enemy. I am not certain but I have a feeling that some Ministers in Whitehall, or the infrastructure in Whitehall, are new to dealing with devolved Administrations who have genuine power-it was new to all of us-and they look on them as the enemy. But they are not.</p>

The point I was making was that the correct announcement was to make a single national statement, which is precisely what we did. The noble Lord, Lord Snape, says that nobody understands what AV is. That, of course, will be up to the campaigns and the Electoral Commission to explain. As for the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, and her issues about knocking-up, again, this is a campaigning issue and it will be up to the campaigns to decide how best to get people to vote yes or no during the course of the campaign.</p>

Instead, he said that we were saying it was impossible to have the debate, which was very disappointing. He was arrogant in treating the request of the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament for an apology. My noble and learned friend Lord Morris of Aberavon made it absolutely clear that he was expecting not a personal apology but an indication from the Government that this is a serious matter, and an apology-or token of acceptance-that this is not something to be laughed at. Perhaps one reason why the debate was quite frustrating was the dismal performance of Ministers in dealing with the heart of the issue. The only way that it is possible to make the Leader of the House concentrate on the issues is to keep putting them. I would therefore like to test the opinion of the House on the combination issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="10120617000042"></a>This amendment is not about the date of the referendum, but about its substance. In Clause 1 of the Bill, line 7 on page 1 gives the voter the choice between retaining the first past the post system to elect MPs, and the alternative vote system. This amendment is designed to give voters, in addition, an opportunity to express a preference for proportional representation. By allowing voters to rank their preferences, this amendment is sure to result in a majority expressing their preference for one or other of the three nominated options. It is a very simple demonstration of the power of the alternative vote under certain conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="10120617000043"></a>Originally, those who tabled the amendment had intended to put all the varieties of proportional representation-AV plus, the additional member system, STV and maybe others-on the ballot paper, but, after consulting, it was decided to add just one general extra option: general proportional representation. This would leave the House of Commons to decide which version to adopt should PR get a majority. That seems sensible. The advantage of putting all the PR options to the electorate is quite compelling in terms of democracy, but, against that, it would overcomplicate the question being asked, and a referendum should be about broad principles and not about details. That is our main argument against the amendments moved by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, and the group of amendments put down by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. I hope that on reflection they will feel willing to support the amendments in the name of my noble friend Lord Owen.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="10120617000044"></a>This amendment expresses our disappointment that the alternative vote is the only alternative to the status quo which the Government are willing to offer. Whereas party-political deals are an essential part of political life-we all know that-I doubt whether such a flagrant party-political deal should be the subject of a referendum. We know why it has happened-no one denies it: it was the price of the coalition. The Liberal Democrats wanted electoral reform without a referendum; the Conservatives, who favour retaining the first past the post system, would not concede that, and a referendum on AV was the compromise position.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10120617000045"></a>We also know from many sources, but most recently from Anthony Seldon's fascinating book, <I>Brown at Ten</I>, that, after the general election, Gordon Brown-who was still Prime Minister-offered the Liberal Democrats a multi-question referendum identical to the amendment I am now moving. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, will probably know more about this than I do, but anyway, that was the revelation. The former Prime Minister offered the Liberal Democrats a multi-question referendum identical to the amendment I am now moving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10120617000048"></a>There was also an offer to make it a vote of confidence to guarantee its passage through Parliament. That was the offer. I am not questioning the judgment of the Liberal Democrat negotiators in turning down that offer in favour of a much inferior alternative, from their point of view. As they say, there were other considerations, but it might be helpful for noble Lords on the Labour and Liberal Democrat Benches to be reminded of this little history-and I think it is authentic-in making up their mind about the value of this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10120617000049"></a>In our view, narrowing the choice to only two alternatives represents an abuse of the referendum mechanism. Referenda are not part of our political tradition. We use them sparingly to decide on questions

I do not agree with those noble Lords who said that AV represents a radical change in our constitutional system. It retains most of the features of the first past the post system. By providing for reallocation of votes according to preference rankings, it ensures that no constituency Member is returned with less than 50 per cent of the vote. That is a change-it is a majority rather than a plurality-but it does not ensure representation of the minority any more than the first past the post system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10120617000050"></a>Nor would the alternative vote make much difference in practice. It has been calculated, for example, that the 2010 general election held under the alternative vote system would have returned 281 Conservative, 262 Labour and 79 Liberal Democrat MPs, as opposed to 307 Conservative, 258 Labour and 57 Liberal Democrat MPs. With impending boundary changes, one would expect that gap to shrink even further as time went on.</p>

In terms of the suffragette analogy put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, it is rather as if the Government of the day had offered votes to women more than 60 or 70 years old, which would have been regarded as a great change in the electoral system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10120617000052"></a>A referendum should be on a grand constitutional issue. A change in the voting system which radically changes the composition of the House of Commons would be a big constitutional change and would meet the standard for a referendum. PR does that and would therefore be worth having a referendum about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10120617000053"></a>Without debating the merits of a pure alternative vote system, it is a fact that it has been turned down by a number of recent inquires; notably, the Plant commission in 1990 and the Roy Jenkins committee in 1997, basically on the grounds that the game was not worth the candle. We believe that this is an additional argument for adding PR to the options offered by the referendum.</p>

It said that it was a perfectly acceptable system, but that it just preferred another. That system was within the AV family of systems; namely, the supplementary vote. I know that the noble Lord has had to pick up the brief from others who unfortunately are not able to attend, but I am having difficulty in understanding why he does not accept the supplementary vote in his amendment. He alluded to it previously, but it was not clear to me exactly what he meant in his explanation. Will he tell us that before he sits down?</p>

When people get into the nitty-gritty of constitutional change, first, they can get obsessive about having their own preferred system and, secondly, it can become very complicated.

We thought that it would be a better idea to have three broad choices, one of which was proportional representation, leaving it to the House of Commons to decide, if that was the

I wish to follow up on something to which the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, referred. He referred to "a proportional vote system", which would be inserted under proposed subsection (3)(c) to be inserted into Clause 1 under Amendment 16. In other words, this referendum would not deal with only clear alternatives set out in the referendum question; it would pose the question, "Do you want a proportional vote system?", which at this stage is not to be identified in the referendum question. By implication, there inevitably would have to be an inquiry arising out of a referendum which might choose new subsection (3)(c) as the option.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10120617000058"></a>I am very interested in inquiries because last week we spent several hours arguing the case for an inquiry. What interested me about this amendment, and why I sought in my Amendment 17 to include the supplementary vote, is that that is precisely what I want to see. I want to see an alternative vote referendum based on the need for an inquiry in exactly the same way as is proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Owen, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Blackburn and the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, in their amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10120617000059"></a>In private conversation, I asked the noble Lord, Lord Owen, whether he might be prepared to accept this amendment. There may well be conditions in which some of us would like to divide the House on this. It raises very important issues. He gave me the same explanation; namely, that it is too complicated. But the reality is that, of all the electoral systems that confront the British electorate at the moment, apart from first past the post, the supplementary vote is the simplest system. It is used nationally in the mayoral elections. It has been supported by many millions of voters. Next year, when the mayoral elections finally take place in the new mayoralties-I think that there was reference to 12-I presume that they will also be fought on the supplementary vote. I cannot quite understand why introducing the simplest possible system should be regarded as a complication of the question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="10120617000061"></a>The content of Amendment 16A is the substance of an amendment that I shall move later and, again, it is about the principle of an inquiry. The referendum question at the moment refers specifically to "the" alternative vote-a specific system that has been identified, which I and many of my colleagues reject for different reasons. My amendment, which I would have slotted in as paragraph (d) of subsection (3) as proposed under Amendment 16, would enable the public to vote on a question which asked whether they were in favour of "an" alternative vote system. That would then beg the question of an inquiry to take place and a decision to be taken by Parliament or whoever wanted to make representations. Finally, a decision to be taken by government could be put to the House. I ask the noble Lord to take this back to his noble friends, because I regard the amendment that he has moved as one of the most important to be considered on this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="10120617000064"></a>It will not surprise anyone that I speak as someone who has been over time a strong supporter of our existing system. In the 1970s, I even wrote a pamphlet defending our system, called <I>Electoral Reform No Reform</I>. At least I stand by the title because it has always seemed to me that the advantages and disadvantages of electoral systems are more evenly balanced than people acknowledge. The word "reform" is tendentious and "change" would be a better word. I have to confess on reading my pamphlet written 40 years ago that not all the arguments have stood the test of time brilliantly. I accept that there is more of a case than it appeared then for something like the German mixed system.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10120617000065"></a>Some of the criticisms, however, that are made of our system, including one made by the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, are fallacious. The noble Lord referred to the first past the post system as one that depends on making the winner someone with a plurality rather than a majority of votes. The criticism is commonly made about our system producing over 50 per cent of the seats with people who have perhaps only 40 per cent of the votes and this is not a majority. The point is made that the Government do not reflect majority opinion under our electoral system. The fallacy in this argument is that there naturally exists in public opinion such a thing as a majority. It is true that if you take any single issue-like whether people are for or against the euro, whether they are for or against privatisation, whether they prefer public expenditure to lower taxes-you can get a majority for any single proposition. But elections are not fought on one proposition; they are fought on four or five issues. Opinion polls show that it is much more difficult to get a majority for four or five issues at once than it is for one issue. So it is a wrong argument to say that you have an electoral system that produces a majority when there is not in fact an underlying real majority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10120617000066"></a>What is the magic of a majority anyway? In a democracy, power, even by a majority, must be exercised with restraint and with respect towards one's opponents. All electoral systems create a majority in an artificial way. The first past the post system does it by converting around 40 per cent of the votes into 50 per cent of the seats. The alternative vote system creates a majority artificially by taking the second preferences of the bottom candidate and allowing those to determine the outcome. But the second preferences of the second candidate do not count. The second preferences are given undue weight, which is why I was able to quote in Second Reading what Winston Churchill said about the system when he called it the least scientific in which the most worthless votes for the most worthless candidate determined the outcome. That is the artificiality of the AV system in creating a majority. With PR, equally, majorities are created rather artificially because people take two or three parties that may have fought the elections on completely different programmes, as we well know, and add them together and call it a majority, although nobody actually voted for the programme of the Government. So the artificiality of a majority is something that has to be recognised before one pours all this criticism on first past the post.</p>

Specifically on the amendment, its Achilles heel is the one the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, alighted on-namely, that it gives as an alternative this broad category of a proportional system. Proportional systems vary enormously. Some of them, like the German mixed system, are not so different from our system. They are different but they are not very different. And there is a world of difference between PR on a national list system, as it used to be at one time in Italy and as it is in Israel, and the German system. It is a huge variation, so much so that it would make the question, if it was put in this form in a referendum, completely nonsensical. I do not think one can follow the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, and say, "We will have a referendum in which two or three of the outcomes may be definite but if a rather vague outcome is voted for, then we will have another inquiry". This seems to be a slightly unbalanced and rather strange way of proceeding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10120617000069"></a>The second objection that I have, which is the reason I called it a rather strange amendment, is this device of using AV in order to determine which electoral system we have. It would be extraordinary on something as important as our choice of electoral system, which could have profound effects on the way we run politics in this country, to say that again the result should be determined by the second preferences of the system that people least wanted. The arguments that I put

To revert to the point I made earlier, I do not think one could leave PR as a choice just defined as PR. If one tried to answer that, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, was suggesting, by putting the supplementary vote system, or STV, or any of the many different systems of PR, that would make the whole referendum meaningless. So I am afraid that, although the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, made a very interesting speech, I think this is a completely unworkable amendment and should be rejected.</p>

One is that it uses AV to choose the winner of the contest. No electoral theoretician would think this was a good way of choosing between these preferences. You would need some sort of Condorcet system which ran off options to find the one that emerged as having the most support rather than a system that simply eliminates a better choice. It does not work terribly well for this kind of referendum. AV has the great advantage of simplicity, which is also the reason I, for one, favour it as our national electoral system.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="10120617000071"></a>The other reason I am quite tempted by this amendment is that I have no doubt that the result of the referendum, whether it was AV or first past the post, would certainly knock out PR for ever. The power of the arguments that would be placed against a PR system for Britain would be so enormous that nobody would be tempted. As a political observer I add this point. The only people who would be speaking up for PR in such a referendum would be the Liberal Democrats. Liberal Democrat advocacy of anything at the moment is a certainty for its unpopularity. This is the party that has lost more than half the votes that were cast for it at the General Election. The thought of these poor lambs bleating round the country for STV, or whichever system they choose, would make it a certain feature of the result of the referendum that it went down the plughole. So for those reasons, I am tempted by the noble Lord's proposal, though not perhaps for the reasons that he put forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10120617000072"></a>I go back to where I started on electoral reform, about which I did not know a huge amount at the time, which was with the Jenkins committee. That committee's terms of reference were written, in many ways wisely, by the party of which I am a member. The terms of reference did not say, "Put forward a whole lot of possible options and discuss their merits as the electoral system for Britain". Nor did they say, "Recommend an electoral system and we will have it". They said, "Recommend the best possible alternative to first past the post to be put before the British people in a referendum". I regret deeply that it was not put before the British people in a referendum at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10120617000073"></a>In the same way as the coalition is wise to put forward an alternative for the referendum, in writing the terms of reference widely in that way the Government were right about what a referendum can seriously manage to do. I think that I heard the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, correctly. He said that this was an abuse of a referendum. It is not. Let us face it: referendums

They are quite good at resolving a simple question on which the political class is divided. The supreme example in my lifetime was Europe. The referendum of 1975 settled things, rightly or wrongly, for many years to come. There was no other way within our political system that it could have been settled because of the state of the Labour Party at the time and later the Conservative Party, which nearly blew itself apart over Europe. The voice of the British people came down clearly on a single alternative, which was to stay in, rightly or wrongly. That defused a bomb at the heart of the political system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10120617000074"></a>This is no disrespect to the British people, but I do not think it is reasonable to expect them to come to grips with the degree of complexity of choice such as is implied by this referendum, still less the choice that exists in real life. Imagine the kind of atmosphere that goes on during an election with claims and counter claims being made. Every time someone says, "This is more proportional", the AV lot will say, "Ours isn't more proportional". You would have a cacophony, which even those who have been studying this subject for half their lives, such as me, would have difficulty disentangling. At least the option that we have before us would give the British people a clear choice to make and the arguments between AV and first past the post are not that complicated.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10120617000075"></a>Moreover, as I said in an earlier debate on the Bill, in a number of years' time people may think, "Well this has worked quite well. We would like to go further to a proportional system". Or, they may say, "That was a big mistake. Let's go back to first past the post". They may say, like the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, "Never go back", but that may show the inadequacy of the system that I thought he favoured. It is not a once-and-for-all choice. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, that there are other choices that could be made about our electoral system. They do not all have to be made in one jump at one time.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10120617000076"></a>I now move on to the case made rather well by the noble Lord, Lord Lamont. The idea that there is something called a proportional system that has a unique set of features is completely without foundation. The differences between STV, the single transferable vote, between national list systems and between the additional member system as used in Germany and recommended in part by the Jenkins commission, are enormous. This calls for a proportional system but there is virtually no proportional system in the world. The only exception is Israel. I have talked to many people about electoral systems but I have yet to find a single person who thinks that the Israeli electoral system is ever other than a complete disaster. It allows for the representation of parties with only tiny members of votes who can then hold the polity to ransom in favour of their peculiar religious objectives. Israel is a disaster among democracies for that reason and, arguably, the current state of the Middle East is a result of that political system.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10120617000077"></a>Other than the Israeli system, there is huge variety among more proportional systems as to how much proportionality. You can have a national list with thresholds, for example. It is a perfectly good system as long as you do not mind all MPs being chosen by  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_59"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 59</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their parties, the end of the constituency representative tradition in our country and the complete dominance of the party Whips over our politics forever more. You can have a national list system. STV is not designed to bring about proportionality at all, although it is a more proportional system. STV came out of the 19th century tradition where they wanted a greater emphasis on the character of individual Members of Parliament rather than on the party that they represented. If you look at the Irish STV system, what happens there is that the contest is not between parties but between individual members of those parties about who is the best representative of the people. You can make a case for that but it is not essentially the case for proportional representation, although it produces proportional outcomes. Additional member systems have a completely different set of characteristics again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="10120617000078"></a>At this stage, one can hear the people crying, "Mercy, please. We pay you to sort some of these things out. Some of us think we pay you too much".</p>

However, it adds not one choice, but a plethora of choices without defining what they are, all with completely different characteristics one from the other and having very little in common except that they can, just about sometimes, be squeezed into the rubric of proportionality. That is why this is not a suggestion that should carry faith.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10120617000081"></a>When the referendum campaign comes, I guess that what will happen in the last few weeks is that those who are against any change will say something like, "If you don't know, vote no". They will try to capitalise on people's ignorance. Even those in this Chamber-and there are many sitting around me-who favour first past the post would probably rather it was not decided on that basis. They would probably rather the people took a clear view of the virtues of the electoral system that we have and the virtues of the alternatives and made their verdict on that, which we would all accept as the way forward. This is a recipe for an extremely blurred choice of ill-defined alternatives which is hard to explain and unfair to ask people to grapple with. It is made even worse because unless the referendum date is moved as a result of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, which we passed earlier, they will be grappling with this choice at a time when they are dealing with local elections, new mayors and, in Scotland and Wales, with the all-important question of what their national governments should be. This is a seductive amendment, but it is profoundly misguided and I hope therefore that the House will not countenance it tonight.</p>

The referendum should be about fairness and trust: being fair to the public and trusting the public.

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10120622000002"></a>I have heard people say quite a lot recently that the public are not very interested in voting systems. As an example, they are more interested in how the cuts will affect them today, tomorrow and the next day. Yes of course; most people are not going to be that exercised at present about something that is still fairly abstract and we are not even quite sure will actually happen, but when the public has confirmation of the date and the terms of the referendum, they will, with help from newspapers, TV and the internet, rapidly become experts in different voting systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10120622000003"></a>However, there will be qualified interested only if the choice is between first past the post and AV: and no wonder, since a win for first past the post cannot possibly be interpreted as a ringing endorsement if AV is the only other option on the ballot paper. Likewise if AV wins, that too cannot possibly be seen as the system the public would most prefer if they have been denied other key voting systems.</p>

Clearly there are different ways to present the options. I bow to others' much more in-depth knowledge of the various voting systems, particularly their history and development. However, the most important point is that both these amendments are infinitely better, in their own way, than the referendum that we have at the moment, which is incomplete.</p>

In a balanced way, it puts trust in both the public and in Parliament. First, the wording on the ballot paper should be as clear as possible. Secondly, it also needs to be transparent so the public know what they are voting for. Thirdly, it should cover all the reasonable options. If the will is here in Parliament to give the public a proper choice, the hammering out of these details should not be an insurmountable problem.</p>

I note from his recent correspondence with the Electoral Reform Society that he has been referring to the alliance commission in the early 1980s, which, on behalf of the Liberal Party and the SDP, looked at electoral systems. He notes that that commission found in favour of STV rather than the alternative vote system, but I ask him when he looks at his <I>Hansard</I><I></I>to consider that report again in some detail because it also said that in parts of the country where perhaps it was appropriate to have only a single member-such as in the far-flung rural parts of the country-it was appropriate to use the alternative vote system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10120622000009"></a>I also draw his attention, and that of some of his noble friends, to the system that operated for choosing single candidates within the SDP-of which he was a member between 1981 and 1988-and in the party that he led between 1988 and 1990. The system chosen for choosing a single person, be it a leader, a president or a candidate, was in fact the alternative vote system.</p>

I served under the late Robin Cook and my noble friend Lord Maclennan of Rogart. We had very high hopes then because it was agreed between the then main opposition parties that as and when there was a general election in 1997, and if the Conservative Party was defeated, there would be a referendum on an alternative proportional voting system. Over the 13 years in which that Government lasted, no such referendum was ever held.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10120622000013"></a>Shortly after the general election of 1997, the late Lord Jenkins chaired the commission that looked at the alternatives; the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, was a member of it.

As the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, has confirmed in earlier debates, when it came to actually looking at this issue, the great-and I think very wise-Lord Jenkins, actually decided that the best system, in his opinion, was for AV for single-member constituencies in rural areas and for STV in the bigger city areas with multi-Member constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="10120622000014"></a>I note the words of my noble-he called me a little while ago his erstwhile-friend Lord Alton of Liverpool. He said that Lord Jenkins had in the end rejected the AV system. To all those who hold the memory of the late Lord Jenkins in some esteem-I hope there are many in this House-I would say that I know that it was to his great, great regret, in a very long and very distinguished career, that at that period in the late 1990s, when there was the opportunity to implement the AV system, he did not help to seize that opportunity. I believe that we must not let the opportunity of some form of electoral reform go away again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="10120622000015"></a>The Electoral Reform Society, which was formerly known as the Proportional Representation Society, campaigned for PR for more than 100 years. It is urging rejection of these amendments in order to get some progress and to give voters some say on the issue as opposed to none at all. The alternative vote system may not be perfect, but it gives more power to the voter. It would mean, for example, that MPs who considered themselves unfairly deselected by their party could stand again without fear of splitting their party vote, thus giving more power to the voter. It would have meant, for example, that supporters of the noble Lord, Lord Owen, could have stood against the party that became the Liberal Democrats and avoided the split in votes that damaged his cause and split the vote of what had been the alliance in the 1980s. For these reasons, I would say that AV is at least a much more attractive proposition than first past the post, to say nothing of the greater power that it gives to the voter.</p>

It is a good precedent to let people have their say, and we will wait to see when there is public demand again to have any further say. But for 138 years we have kept the same system. One hundred years ago, a Royal Commission recommended the adoption of the alternative vote, and 93 years ago, a Speakers Conference recommended the use of preference voting. Seventy-nine years ago, the other place voted for the adoption of the alternative vote, which was blocked on five occasions by your Lordships' House. It is 36 years since a minority Conservative Government offered another Speakers Conference on electoral reform and it is 13 years since a Labour Government with a large majority had a manifesto promise and were elected on the basis that there would be a referendum on the issue of proportional representation. So it is a significant achievement for all those committed to electoral reform that twice this year in the House of Commons, with different Governments in place, there have been substantial majorities for a referendum to be held on the alternative vote. I want to see progress on this issue and hope that we will not give Members in another place a further opportunity to deny the voters their say on this issue and leave us back where we were in 1872.</p>

It certainly needs more work, and I do not think that it should be passed as it is at present drafted, but it points in the right direction. The political parties have been right to come to the view, and have somehow stumbled in the past 12 months or so into agreement on the notion, that it is now timely to offer the opportunity to the people of this country to revisit their electoral system and consider whether they want change.</p>

That is wrong in principle and unsatisfactory in practice. It may be that the malaise would be dispelled were we to be blessed with

If we were to enjoy a period of government under which the people of this country came to the view that they were being wisely and benignly governed in the interests of all the people and that they could look forward to unlimited peace and prosperity, no doubt the demand for constitutional change, such as it is-it is not very well articulated, but I think that it is there-would abate.</p>

However, I disagree with my noble friends Lord McAvoy and Lord Grocott, who contend that there is simply no public interest in this question. While I accept that it is something of a preoccupation of the chattering classes and the professional political class, those of us in politics who believe that there is significant dissatisfaction in our political culture and that it has something important to do with the electoral system simply seek to understand the public mood and to see what ways there might be to improve on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="10120626000015"></a>It is right that we have a referendum on the future electoral system to be used in this country for elections to the House of Commons, but if we are going to do it we should do it properly. It seems quite absurd to have a great national debate and to go through all this palaver, expense and effort to resolve a timid and incomplete choice between first past the post and the alternative vote. If we are to have a referendum on the future electoral system of this country, a rare and very important event, then let us allow the people to have the choice between the range of plausible and significant systems. I support my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours in his view that the supplementary vote should be among the choices offered at a referendum. That means, if we are going to do it properly, we would have to take time over it and the debate would have to be much more extended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="10120626000016"></a>It makes no sense at all to try to rush a debate of this complexity and importance through in the brief period between whatever date this Bill gains Royal Assent and 5 May. Let us have a sustained exercise of political education and debate, following which a decision shall be made. How that decision should be arrived at-the technicalities of the choice to be offered in the referendum-certainly needs more careful examination. I am worried that offering a choice between four major options -but that choice to be determined by AV, which is among the choices to be offered-might somehow bias the outcome. I do not know; I think these things need careful thought. But we should not fluff this opportunity. We should enable all the important choices to be fully considered. That must surely be right. From a personal point of view, I suspect that I would end up voting for first past the post. But it is right that everybody should have the freedom to decide between the major serious options. This amendment is

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="10120626000018"></a>I remind noble Lords that Wales is the only part of the Union where a substantial number of people speak two languages. Indeed, 20 per cent of people in Wales speak English and Welsh, so it is important that any ballot paper should contain information in both languages. Indeed, there are five parliamentary constituencies in Wales-Ynys Mon, Arfon, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Ceredigion, and Carmarthen East and Dinefor where the majority of people speak Welsh as their first language. We will come to that when we come to the part of the Bill on boundaries. I hope that we will have support around the House when we try to ensure that those Welsh-speaking areas will not have their representation in the House of Commons diminished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="10120626000021"></a>I have one point to leave with the Minister. As I said, there are five parliamentary constituencies in Wales where Welsh would be the first language. It is not spoken across Wales in any uniform pattern. In my former constituency, perhaps 2 to 4 per cent of people are bilingual. Therefore, it is important for the Government to consider that whatever goes on a ballot paper in a referendum, in those areas identified as being where a majority of people speak Welsh as their first language, the question should appear in Welsh first on the ballot paper. In areas where the majority of people do not speak Welsh as their first language, the question should be in English first. I am not suggesting in any way that people will be unable to understand all the ramifications of the vote, but having two languages on the ballot paper will be confusing for people who are not familiar with Welsh as their first language if the question is written first in Welsh. I ask the Minister to consider that when the Government decide what will be on the ballot paper.</p>

We have an electoral system, that we share, for the European elections-the list system where there is no choice whatever. It is a great pity that we accepted that. Try to name your MEP. We were talking about going down the streets of Stockport earlier when my noble friend Lord Snape was speaking. Go down the street and ask people who is their MEP. They do not know who they are as they do not relate to local people or have the same kind of contact, accountability or responsibility of other elected Members.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Lamont-I am pronouncing his name properly for a change-said that he liked the German system. The system for the Scottish Parliament elections is akin to the German electoral system. I warned him and others against the alternative member system. When he comes back up to Scotland, as I know he does from time to time, he will see a bastard of a system, if noble Lords will excuse the phrase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="10120629000004"></a>We have 73 constituencies elected by first past the post in Scotland. We used to have 72 constituencies. Why are there 73? It is because Orkney and Shetland have a constituency each-another concession to the Liberals that was a dreadful mistake. The good bit is that 73 are elected by first past the post. However, on the basis of the regional vote, 56 members-seven members in each of eight constituencies-are added members according to the vote of each party in each constituency, which produces the most unexpected results. In 2007, in Lothian, I was unexpectedly elected by that very strange system. It produces coalitions, the first of which we had with the Liberal Democrats, in which we conceded-I think foolishly-single transferrable votes.</p>

I am an English person, who, by the way, would like the Scottish system. The only reason why he was elected for Lothian in the top-up system is because there were tens of thousands of Labour voters in that region without a constituency representative. That is the point. That is why he was elected. That this system did not leave hundreds of square miles with Labour voters without any direct representation is a bonus. It is a plus that my noble friend was elected to the Scottish Parliament, not a minus.</p>

Since my noble friend Lord McConnell represents a constituency-Motherwell and Wishaw-if he were to retire tomorrow, there would be a by-election and the people would have a say. However, if Margo MacDonald-who stood as an independent-were to retire tomorrow, there would be no filling of the vacancy whatever.

If the Lords is the revising Chamber and is not forming the Government, there is an argument for it being elected by first past the post because then you have a different system balancing what the House of Commons and what the Government are putting to Parliament.</p>

Everything needs to be much more clearly defined. That is why it would be madness-and this is where I come to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, which was moved on behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Owen-to rush into this kind of referendum, or any kind of referendum, to change the system for the House of Commons. There are enough other changes taking place with the proposed reform of the House of Lords; we should learn from the changes that have taken place in Scotland, although it has not been a happy experience. We should not rush into something that has unexpected consequences just because the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, apparently puts a convincing case. Just because the noble Lord has spent 35 years arguing the case for proportional representation, we should not move in that direction. What is best for the Labour Party and the country is to stick to first past the post, which has provided election to the House of Commons with some degree of stability over a long period.</p>

Frankly, if one were dealing in the theory of referenda and the reform of electoral systems at this time, I would find a great deal to favour particularly in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. I will be frank-I have fought and lost five parliamentary elections. The first was for Labour in 1970. At that time, I confess, I did not think twice about electoral systems. I knew, as all Labour and Tory Members know, that the first past the post system was deeply in their favour. One of the problems of discussing reform here or in the other place is that we are all parti pris. We are all conflicted. Nobody can look at this complex but profound issue without party affiliation coming into play.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="10120629000023"></a>However, it is also fair to say-the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, expressed it very well-that, before and above that, we are concerned about Parliament: its respect in the country, its effectiveness and its health. I do not think anybody sitting here tonight believes that our Parliament, in 2010, is in good fettle. I do not for one second suggest that the lack of democratic adherence to it is, by any means, solely down to the electoral system. However, I maintain that it is one of the principal reasons why so many of our fellow countrymen do not even bother to vote-to use the precious vote that our forefathers fought so hard for. Four out of 10 do not vote and-I heard this statistic the other night-of those aged under 30, only around two out of six voted in the last election. One principal reason is that unless you are a Tory or Labour supporter your vote is apt to count for nothing. I think as much of the Greens and, indeed, UKIP as I do of the Liberal Democrat Party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="10120629000024"></a>The other thing I know, which deeply affects my feeling about this amendment, is that we have been going round and round this mulberry bush my entire political life. There is always not just one but 10 reasons

There are always several reasons. My noble friend Lord Rennard gave, as the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, kindly admitted, an extremely clear and persuasive history of electoral reform-or rather the failure to have electoral reform-in this country. It is perfectly clear that many organisations and all the parties in this House use AV now. It has no deep defect. What is absolutely unavoidable is that the consequences of bringing in AV at this juncture will profoundly affect all parties in this country.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="10120629000025"></a>I come to my last point, which is to admit that the Liberal Democrats are plainly the party that is keenest on AV for electoral purposes. It is in our self-interest-of course it is. However, we also believe-I hope noble Lords will accept my sincerity-that it is also in the public interest, for the reasons I have briefly touched on, to give many more people a stake in government and a useful vote. Incidentally, if any non-Lib Dem was to go around with a Lib Dem on the doorsteps, my goodness, they would hear about electoral reform then. I am not surprised that you do not hear about it if you are a Conservative or Labour supporter.</p>

It would kill it stone dead. Why? Because the main party in the coalition-the Conservatives-will not have a PR system. It is as simple as that. It will go to the other end and they will chuck it back at us. The profound practical question tonight is about whether we give the people of this country the chance to choose whether they want a major-though not fundamental-reform of and improvement in the electoral system. I have spent much of my political life struggling to get some reform into the system. It is painful.</p>

Every time the word went round that we were suggesting there should be a change in the electoral system for Europe, local government, Scotland, Wales or wherever, I always did my best within government to try and prevent that happening.

With this kind of debate, the whole of the discussion takes place as if nothing has happened, A lot has happened. A lot of electoral systems have been tried.

I should add that I have also lost three county council elections and one or two parish elections as well. So it is a pretty abysmal electoral record. However, I have no doubt whatever that as far as local electors in local constituencies are concerned, first past the post is the fairest, best and most understood electoral system. But that is not what we are here to debate. I am not going to filibuster-I can assure the House of that. I am going to stick rigorously and briefly to the amendment that we are debating and try and say why I am opposed to it.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="10120632000022"></a>The amendment would give us a choice between first past the post, the alternative vote system and a proportional vote system. People like me used to be at a huge disadvantage-like the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, I have not changed my mind on this over decades-but I support, and always have done, first past the post. Historically, however, we were always at a huge disadvantage. We were asking people whenever we were in debate, "Judge the first past the post system, which you know and with which you are familiar, against these various alternative theoretical systems", which were unspecified-and particularly, I say without undue criticism of the amendment, unspecified in the choices being put to the electorate here. As for the first past the post system, it is precise and exact. That is what we know. That is what we have lived through. It has its strengths and it has its weaknesses, and we are very familiar with its weaknesses.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="10120632000023"></a>As for the alternative vote system, as my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours has already conclusively argued, it is actually a series of possible options in itself. As for a proportional vote system, there are very nearly as many of those as one can imagine. Whenever I was in a debate with someone about first past the post versus proportional representation, they would always say to me, "Ah, but you're arguing against that form of proportional representation, not the form of proportional representation that I am in favour of". When you are choosing between what is known and what is unknown, a referendum of this sort is always difficult. But I am not therefore arguing that you can never put anything to the electorate because, taking that to its logical conclusion, you never could put anything to the electorate as you would always know what is familiar best. I am saying, in relation to this amendment, that if we are to have a referendum-I would prefer that we did not, but if we do-it needs to be as specific as it can be.</p>

That at least has the merit of clarity, although I would much prefer that we did not have either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="10120632000026"></a>I think that I can probably help the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, in his summing up. His Liberal Democrat colleagues rightly have been asked: "How long? Should this referendum result in a yes, for how long would it stand?". The Liberal Democrats have already given us their answer, which is basically: "As short a period as possible. We want to move on rapidly to full PR or whatever". I can guess what the answer of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, would be if he were asked: how soon after a yes or no vote should the matter be put to the public again in a referendum? I would guess that his answer would be, "We wouldn't want to touch that with a barge pole". I think that that would at least be a straightforward and honest response. But as far as this proposed amendment is concerned, it is not one that should be attractive to the House.</p>

Unlike him-purely coincidentally, I am sure-I have had a bit more success, which is probably the best argument against first past the post that either side of your Lordships' House has come up with. Certainly I do not find much favour with the amendment due to the various alternatives that it provides. No one listening to this debate could doubt the sincerity of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, although I found some of his conclusions somewhat confusing, to say the least. We talk about young people and politics. There will be lots of young people interested in politics demonstrating outside this building this week, largely because politicians who make promises and then immediately break them do not greatly enamour themselves to those young people.</p>

He said that if I followed him round and talked to Liberal Democrats, I would come across people desperate to embrace the principle of proportional representation. I have to tell the noble Lord that I have canvassed unsuccessfully for my own party in various by-elections in various Liberal Democrat strongholds. In places such as Eastbourne, people said to me, "I'm not voting for the Labour candidate; I'm voting for the Liberal candidate", but when I asked them why, they could not normally tell me. Let us be honest about this. Many supporters of the Liberal Democrat party are diametrically opposed to many of that party's policies. That is a fact, as all of us who have gone around knocking on doors will know. No one ever said to me, "I'm voting for the Liberal party because I'm in favour of proportional representation". The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, might argue that I mix with the wrong sort of people, and that may well be true, but that was certainly my experience and I suspect that

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="10120632000029"></a>We heard a fascinating speech, as ever, from the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, who said that he was in favour of the alternative vote system because it was a step along the road to PR. However, according to the late Roy Jenkins, it is actually a step away from PR. As I reminded the noble Lord earlier today, in 1998 Roy Jenkins said that the conclusion of the independent royal commission which he chaired was that AV was even less proportional than the current system. Therefore, what the noble Lord is proposing is a step away from what he wants-or at least it is according to Roy Jenkins.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="10120632000030"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, my noble friend Lord Howarth, who I am afraid is not in his place at the moment, bemoaned what he called the widespread disillusion about politics, and he felt that the acceptance of this amendment or a change in the electoral system might help to cure that widespread disillusion. I do not want to run again through the list of countries that have AV as their electoral system but Australia has been widely mentioned. I wonder whether my noble friend, who I am glad to see has rejoined us, has been to Australia. If he has, he will not have found the Australian people or their press speaking lyrically about their politics or their politicians, even though they are elected under the AV system. Indeed, if he travels a bit nearer to home-to Italy-he might find that, because of the system that they have there at present, a lot of people say, "If only we had a system like yours". Therefore, to pretend that AV or any other proportional representation system is being widely demanded by people out there or that it will transform this nation into a happy band of brothers and sisters is, in my view, a complete aberration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="10120632000031"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, accuses those of us who are in favour of first past the post of wanting to preserve, presumably in aspic, a political system that has been around for more than 100 years. However, it is the coalition that appears to be following the doctrine, "If it ain't broke, break it". I honestly cannot see how the Liberal Democrats can justify their stance on AV for any reason other than that it might favour them, and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips was honest enough to let the cat out of the bag on that. It might save them-or at least their colleagues in the other place-from electoral Armageddon at some point in the future. That is the only reason why they support it. It might shock the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, and his Cross-Bench colleagues that a member of the Liberal Democrat party in particular could be so blatantly political about these matters. However, it has to be recognised that the reason why the Liberal Democrats are in favour of this AV system, which they have long campaigned against, is that they hope it will preserve some of their colleagues down the Corridor at the next election. Therefore, I cannot bring myself to support the noble Lord's amendment.</p>

The fact is that we got it wrong. At least that is certainly the opinion that many of us hold, and we will continue to get it wrong if we continue to support it. I accept the sincerity of my noble friend and my noble friend Lord Rooker. I remember a conversation that I had with him in 1987 after the then-from the party's point of view-unsuccessful election. I asked him why he was in favour of PR. I cannot imagine why we were discussing PR-we must have been stuck on a very long train journey. I hope that I am not betraying any confidences when I say that my noble friend was brutally honest and said, "Because we can't win under the present system". However, we did eventually win under that system. The Liberal Democrats argue that they cannot win under the present system because their votes are diffused throughout the United Kingdom. I understand why they campaign in favour of proportional representation and I would understand them supporting some parts of the amendment before your Lordships tonight. However, I wish that they would be a little more honest, as was the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, in their declared support for AV. It is totally in their interests, although it is against everything for which they have campaigned for over 100 years.</p>

For the past hour and three-quarters, we on this side of the Committee have been privileged to attend a Labour Party seminar on electoral reform. It has been a fascinating experience and the advocacy from the other side for every possible system of voting has been heard in this Committee. I feel almost sympathy and sorrow for the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer-not a sentiment that I often feel-because he is supposed to be representing Labour Party Front-Bench opinion. I do not know what threads he is going to draw out of what he has heard this evening. Do I see a conversion to first past the post for a Front-Bench speaker? That is not consistent with what his leader is saying. The leader of the Labour Party is totally opposed to most of the views that have been expressed on the Benches opposite.

That is an amendment that deserves the support of many people on our side of the Chamber.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="10120632000038"></a>So far as concerns the general question of why we need a debate on this issue, I think that we should set aside questions of party advantage. I know that people will laugh at that but I think that we should do so and ask ourselves whether the present system has legitimacy. The first general election in which I canvassed and campaigned was the 1964 general election, when the Labour Party and the Conservative Party got more than 85 per cent of the votes cast. The two parties were overwhelmingly dominant in our politics. But when you look at the result of the last two general elections-2010 and 2005-you see that the two major parties won only about two-thirds, 65 per cent, of the votes cast. This is not legitimate. You cannot have a system, which is an alleged two-party system, in which the voice of 35 per cent of the electorate is not being effectively heard. That is why we have to have a big debate in our country about electoral reform.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="10120632000039"></a>There are many arguments made against electoral reform, such as that it will result in weak government because there have to be coalitions. However, although I do not agree with the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition, I do not believe that it is a weak Government. I think it is quite a decisive Government who are getting on with doing a lot of things I do not particularly like. It blows a hole, however, in one of the arguments against proportional representation, which is that it would result in a coalition politics that would mean that nothing would ever get done.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="10120632000040"></a>There is a strong argument to be made for the sake of the country. The late Lord Jenkins, of whom I was a great admirer, attached a lot of importance to the belief, based on his experience in the 1980s, that it was a very bad situation indeed when there were no Conservatives in the county of Durham and no Labour people in the county of Surrey. What you got was a polarisation of the country when in fact what you want is a system of representation where there are Conservatives who have to represent the deprived areas of the north of England and there are Labour MPs who represent the more affluent districts. That would be good for the country and would produce a more legitimate system. That is why I support electoral reform; why I am tempted by the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, but am not going to support it; why I would definitely support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker; and why I very much support the principle of a referendum on some change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="10120634000002"></a>The amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Owen, says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="10120634000079"></a>"At present, the UK uses the 'first past the post' system to elect MPs to the House of Commons".</p>

<p><a name="10120634000003"></a>Then we get this wonderful sentence:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="10120634000080"></a>"It is proposed that the system should be changed".</p>

<p><a name="10120634000004"></a>Let us note the two words "proposed" and "changed". You are actually sensitising the respondent to the desired response, because everyone accepts on that basis that it is proposed, so it is a good thing: and "change", as we know, is a very powerful word-think of Barack Obama. It is a false question in terms of equal balance because you are making clear the direction of the desired response just by using those two words: "proposed" and "changed".</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="10120634000005"></a>We then get on to the more substantive issue of linking the first past the post system, which is actually undefined, with the alternative vote system. The one thing that we have learnt during the debates and discussions on this is that we do not know whether there is "the" alternative vote system. Very different types of systems claim to be the alternative vote system, but there is not one "the" alternative vote system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="10120634000006"></a>The game is given away in proposed new Clause 3(c), which says: "a proportional vote system". What does that mean? Does it mean an absolutely strictly proportional system, such as the system used in Israel where every party's representation on the Knesset is dependent quite rigorously on the application of a proportional system? This is one of the major reasons why Israel has not been able to move towards a broader Middle East settlement, particularly on the Palestinian issues. If you have a strictly proportional system you will inevitably finish up being in hock to a whole range of minor parties.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="10120634000007"></a>I am not sure whether that is what is meant by a proportional vote system, but if it is not it has to be specified in the amendment. Does it mean STV? Does it not mean STV? Does it mean strict proportionality? Does it not mean strict proportionality? This amendment as it stands deals totally inadequately with the issues that we face in possibly revising the voting system upon which the House of Commons is elected.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, delivered an extremely good speech that was rational, reasonable and sensible. It basically said that, if we are going to have a debate about constitutional reform, let everyone have a reasonable choice. Unfortunately-this is no fault of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky-he has absolutely no understanding of what is going in relation to the proposal for constitutional reform that is being advanced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="10120634000009"></a>For the past 13, maybe 20, years, our approach to constitutional reform as a nation has been that this House has the role at least of producing as good a constitutional reform as we can. The work of the Cook-Maclennan report, which had lots of years behind it, was to produce the best constitutional reform.  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_81"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Extraordinarily, this constitutional reform, unlike any other constitutional reform I can remember, is being conducted without Parliament having a view on it. Individual parliamentarians like the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, who delivered an excellent speech, have a view on constitutional reform, but neither Parliament, nor indeed the Government, has a view on this reform. They had a view on devolution in 1997, and Parliament had a view on the Common Market in 1975, but this is a process, not support for constitutional reform.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="10120634000010"></a>The perfectly reasonable amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, therefore meets a car crash. The first part of the car crash is the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, who, with eyes popping with sincerity, tells us that he is strongly in favour of AV, having never supported AV before. The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, then gets up and says that he has been talking about constitutional reform since he was 15-I rather agree with the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, when he says "poor Lord Rennard", whom we greatly admire in this House-and he says that he supports the alternative vote system. This lot on the Liberal Democrat Benches are therefore standing on their heads. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has the nerve to say that they are doing this to restore the people's trust in our parliamentary representatives by adopting a system that the Liberal Democrats have opposed for so long and which, as has often been said, is described by Mr Nicholas Clegg as "a miserable little compromise". The public think that they are doing this to get more seats, not because they are sincere, so they are eroding public support. Sensibly, the party opposite has remained completely silent throughout this debate in relation to whether there should be a change to the electoral system. Members opposite looked patronisingly on the Liberal Democrats for being so easily gulled into behaving in a way that brings the whole system into contempt.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="10120634000011"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Baker, in an embittered little speech, had the nerve to say, "I have been privileged to listen to a seminar on electoral reform from the Labour Party". Yes he has, and he is lucky to have done so because no one else in the whole country appears to be debating what the right system is. Surely the least the public could expect is Parliament debating what the best system is, because no other debate is going on. In answer to the noble Lord's question about how to bring all the strands together, I have great sympathy for the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky. There are problems with it. It is pretty eccentric to choose an electoral system on AV when you are asking the public to determine whether they like AV best. I understand why that is being done-it is a rational way of doing it-but I am afraid he is wasting his time because this constitutional reform is motivated not by what the best constitutional reform is but by a grubby deal that was done that had no reference to what was best for the public.</p>

He will also remember in the context of his suggestions that this is just a stitch-up: that the Labour Party in Government did not implement the Cook-Maclennan proposals on electoral reform, despite a manifesto commitment to give the public the opportunity. In those days the Labour Party was not in favour of PR; yet it committed itself to giving the public a choice. Where is the difference now?</p>

We did not implement Lord Jenkins' proposals. We said that if we were going to implement a change, there would be a referendum. I fail to see how that justifies implementing a system of election which Lord Jenkins said would sometimes lead to greater disproportionality than the present system. As the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, has said, that leads to the second party's second preference votes having no say in the answer. Although he is absolutely right to condemn us for that, I do not think that it allows the public to have sicked upon it a system that absolutely no one wants. My position on the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, is that I admire his logic in proposing it, but I would not support it because of the technical changes. In a sense, I think he is wasting his time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="10120634000017"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to give people the choice of a proportional system along with the choice of first past the post and the alternative vote. As the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, explained, they had previously tabled an amendment giving a choice of AV+, AMS or STV but had subsequently changed their amendment, so it was not about specifically wanting to pose AV+, AMS or STV as options in their own right but to pose the principle of PR as an option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="10120634000018"></a>We believe that on an issue as fundamental as voting reform, the public need to be given a clear choice that will produce an equally clear result. The key point is about the impact that this sort of approach will have on the result. I understand that the noble Lord wished to see a multiple choice of voting options, including some form of PR. However, for the sake of simplicity-this is the crucial point-it is better to present people with a simple yes/no alternative, exactly as set out in the Bill. Multiple choice questions go against the recommendations of the Lords Constitution Committee report on referendums, which concluded

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="10120634000019"></a>A referendum on AV replacing the existing system will give a clear choice to the electorate, with the ability for them to express a clear view. Offering more than one choice could lead to an indecisive result and confusion over the interpretation of the result. The watchwords that we need to stand by when holding any referendum are simplicity, clarity and decisiveness. We would risk disregarding each of those if we went down the road suggested by these amendments.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="10120634000020"></a>The question in the Bill as it currently stands reflects the recommendations of the Electoral Commission, which tested the question through focus groups and interviews with members of the public as well as through input from language experts. This amendment risks going against that independent advice from the Electoral Commission, which recommended that, unlike a question requiring a yes/no answer, this style of question has never been used in a UK-wide referendum, and, as such, fuller testing would need to be undertaken before recommending this style of question ahead of a more traditional yes/no question.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="10120634000023"></a>Another issue is that the wording in the amendment could influence voters, as it says:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="10120634000024"></a>In these amendments there is not even an indication of the kind of proportional voting system that the public would get if they voted for this option or of how this type of system would work. One attraction of the approach taken in the Bill is that for all the arguments there might be about how AV works, the Bill sets that out in Clause 9 and in Schedule 10. Any questions about how AV works can be resolved by looking at the Bill, which would not be the case with these amendments. The results might be a lack of clarity and voter confusion.</p>

He made a very powerful case against the alternative vote-he might even have persuaded me of its demerits-but I emphasise that the amendment was not about the merits and demerits of particular voting systems; it was designed to give people a choice.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="10120634000028"></a>Secondly, it was said that voting reform is not a subject of interest to the mass of the people; it is of interest only to the chattering classes. I think there are quite a large number of chattering classes in this country, and if you call them professional classes they may even constitute a majority. They are interested in subjects such as this, so that is simply wrong.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="10120634000029"></a>I am not convinced that ordinary people are incapable of understanding the principle of proportionality. I think that it is a very reasonable question to put and that people will know what you mean and how it differs from first past the post and the alternative vote.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="10120634000030"></a>Finally, no one addressed the issue I raised in my speech of whether a simple choice, of the kind that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, supported, is worth a referendum. Referenda ought to be preserved for grand issues of constitutional import, and a measure of this kind, which would make a marginal change in the voting system, is not worth a referendum. No one really addressed that.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="10120634000031"></a>Having said all that, I am very grateful. I do not propose to test the opinion of the House on this amendment, and I therefore ask leave to withdraw the amendment, but I give notice that I may return to it on Report. Thank you very much.</p>

I very much hope, though not with every expectation, that the negotiations in Cancun have a greater chance of success than those that took place in Copenhagen a year ago. By focusing on the Arctic, I do not do so at the expense of the focus that needs to be continued on those who suffer most from climate change, particularly in the poorest countries of the world.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="10120634000033"></a>The issue this evening is not whether climate change is happening or who or what caused it. The issue is that change, dramatic change, is occurring in the Arctic with potentially profound implications, including for British interests. The question is whether we are doing enough now to protect and promote our interests in the future. The subject might be less immediate than many discussed in your Lordships' House, but other nations are reacting to the changes they see or foresee. Our interests are affected too and my concern is that, if we do not take them seriously now, we may well regret that later.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="10120634000034"></a>The Arctic is the fastest warming region on Earth. By 2007, it had lost half the ice that existed in 1950-over one million square miles of ice, roughly equivalent to one quarter of the United States. The result is that the Arctic is becoming more accessible. In 2007 and 2008, the north-west passage was opened for two weeks. In August last year, two German commercial ships, unaccompanied by icebreakers, traversed the North Sea route from Vladivostok to the Netherlands. These routes are substantially shorter than the traditional sea routes from east to west and vice versa. They are, of course, only navigable for short periods and there is always the risk of ice and of atrocious weather in hostile, not-well-charted waters. My father was captain of a naval escort ship which escorted Arctic convoys during the Second World War and his description of conditions in the Arctic were not for the faint-hearted.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="10120634000035"></a>These seas, the Arctic Ocean, are not going to become the new great sea route for the world in the next decade, but, in 20 years or so-by which time scientists expect ice-free summers-they might. When they do-and I believe that it is a "when" and not an "if"-will there not be opportunities for maritime nations such as ours? Might there not be scope for developing again some of the great ports of northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to service the new shipping lanes? Are there not huge opportunities, too, for our insurance companies and our insurance markets? I hope that the Minister will comment on that.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="10120634000036"></a>Meanwhile, there is already great interest in the prospect of mineral extraction from the Arctic. Here too, there are risks and opportunities. The risks, of course, are the environmental catastrophes that can follow mineral and especially oil extraction, as we have seen already in Alaska and, more recently, in the Gulf of Mexico. There is at present uncertainty over the likely timescale for exploiting the Arctic; much will depend, as always, on demand, on price and on technology. However, present estimates-and they can only be estimates-are that 13 per cent of so-far-undiscovered supplies of oil in the world, 30 per cent of natural gas and 20 per cent of natural liquid gas, could lie in the  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_86"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Arctic. The Arctic already currently produces about 10 per cent of the world's oil and 25 per cent of its gas, and those figures seem bound to increase. Here again, the opportunities for Britain companies that are used to operating in some of the world's most inhospitable zones are great, so what is being done now to maximise their chances of success? What scope will there be for fisheries in our increasingly ice-free Arctic? My understanding is that Iceland, Norway and Russia are already interested in investing in large fishing fleets with an eye to Arctic bounty. What is Britain doing? Is there scope for replacing some of the declining traditional fisheries with fisheries in the Arctic? Will we allow others to gain the advantage here, or will we take it ourselves?</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="10120634000037"></a>There is significant change under way in the Arctic, with important implications for Britain. It is therefore equally important that we should remain fully involved in international negotiations and discussions about the future of the region. There are many British academic and non-governmental organisations with great experience and expertise and with much to offer others. The British Antarctic Survey, which has an important Arctic dimension and a deservedly high reputation, is one, but intergovernmental co-operation is crucial. The key forum is the Arctic Council, consisting of the Arctic states: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States. The UK is an observer and, indeed, an active observer, and rightly so, but there is a move among Arctic states members to limit the role of observer states, including the United Kingdom. Can the Minister give an assurance that we will continue to be closely involved in the work of the Arctic Council, given its importance and our experience and interests in the region?</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="10120634000038"></a>However, the Arctic Council covers only some Arctic issues, essentially protecting the environment, which is, of course, crucial. Other international organisations have a key role too, for example, the International Maritime Organization, for shipping issues, or the UN law of the sea conference, but other issues, including, crucially, security, are less obviously covered by existing institutions. Sovereignty is not always clear. We all remember, I suspect, the Russian flag planted on the Arctic sea bed a couple of years ago to stake a sovereignty claim. How are territorial disputes linking, for example, to oil fields, to be resolved as the Arctic becomes more widely navigable and exploited?</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="10120634000039"></a>I do not know how often Arctic affairs have been discussed in your Lordships' House, but I would guess that they will be discussed pretty regularly in the future, as the significance of the melting of the ice cap becomes more apparent, and with it the important implications for British interests. I look forward to Minister's response.</p>

I am sure that he is right in saying that this is just the first of the debates we shall have on the Arctic. He mentioned the pace of the melting of the ice. This is nothing new. When Nansen's "Fram" drifted across the Arctic Ocean, it took three years to get from the Bering Strait to clear  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_87"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>water off Greenland. When the French boat "Tara" did it in 2006, it took just two years. Indeed, the Arctic flow is twice as strong as it was 100 years ago, and that is a pretty dramatic change. In 2007, the summer ice shrank to half the level that it was in the 1950s and 1960s, as the noble Lord said. I would like to draw to the attention of the House another phenomenon, which scientists call the Albedo effect. The sunlight shining down on ice or snow is almost all reflected and only about 15 per cent goes to warm the seas underneath. If there is clear water, 95 per cent of the sunlight warms the water. Therefore, as the amount of clear water in the summer increases, so the Albedo effect has an accelerating impact on the melting of the ice. This is the reason why the Arctic is growing warmer faster than anywhere else in the world.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="10120634000041"></a>The noble Lord raised a number of questions, but there is no doubt about it: this has greatly encouraged the huge search for minerals. There is a difference. Off Alaska, the American environmentalist movement has now made it extremely difficult for international oil companies to prospect for oil with any prospect of being allowed to do so. Shell, one of the big companies there-a British company- is at the moment marking time on this. If one looks across to Siberia, however, the Russian experience is very different. There are, as I have heard described, staggering quantities of gas as well as oil. During the Soviet era, there were enormous and immensely damaging changes to the environment. That is now being corrected by the new Russian administration. The Russians have at least three very major projects offshore of the Siberian coast. Much the biggest is the Shtokman gas field, which is-noble Lords may be surprised to learn- the second largest gas field in the world, though in immensely challenging, hugely deep water.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="10120634000042"></a>The noble Lord referred to the ice cap; but of course, there is no land under the North Pole-it is all ice. It is immensely deep water, sometimes four or five miles deep. There are huge icebergs, but in Alun Anderson's book <I>After the Ice</I><I>,</I> which first attracted me to this-and I really recommend anybody who is interested in this subject to read it; it is a fascinating compendium of facts, history and forecasts-the author described the Shtokman field as,</p>
<ul><a name="10120634000082"></a>"the hottest groundbreaking project in the entire Arctic, and Russia is driving it forward".</ul>
<p><a name="10120634000078"></a>That is something of which we really need to take account. If one looks at the deeper water further north, it is even more difficult. The combination of accelerating warming and this advancing technology poses, as the noble Lord has said, huge challenges for us all, and I, too, look forward to my noble friend's reply from the Front Bench as to what we are doing about it.</p>

If one reads the press cuttings and look at the news, whether it is the two Mir exploratory submarines of the Russian Federation or whatever, the Arctic is going to be, or already is, the second Cold War, with all the military threats that there are, including the resource wars-all of that is a real threat to global security. On the other side, I was at a meeting not that long ago of heads of parliamentary foreign affairs committees in Prague. I was speaking to my Danish colleague-Denmark being, because of Greenland, one of the Arctic Council nations-and I mentioned all these issues about the north-west passage, international waters and resources, and she looked at me completely calmly and said, "No, the Arctic Council has all of these under control. We are discussing them all and we are doing that within international law and everything will be resolved. Robin, don't worry about it. Worry about everything else, but that one, as Arctic nations, we've got sorted". That is a paraphrase.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="10120634000044"></a>The Arctic is of great interest to us. First, the Arctic is the leading indicator of global warming. As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, an important factor is the reflective effect of the polar ice cap, which will lead to the increase in methane in that area that we already see elsewhere in our planet's atmosphere. We have international shipping; we have the strong Canadian view that not all of these waters are international waters, and that it has national control over many of these areas, and so there is potentially a dispute with the United States, among others, and those other nations that might want to use them. There are commodities there, including 100 billion tonnes of hydrocarbons-25 per cent of global reserves. All of that is there to be fought over; I refer to territorial claims and the 1,200 mile-long Lomonosov Ridge-and I am not sure whether I have got that pronunciation exactly right- Ridge that extends across much of that area.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="10120634000045"></a>From my humble position, I see that there are things that need to be done, and I would be interested in the Minister's reply. First, in terms of world security, global warming is the one thing that needs to be sorted out in this area, but that is not just an Arctic issue. In terms of territorial disputes, it is most important that we persuade and cajole the United States to finally become a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, through which these disputes and boundaries can be resolved amicably.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="10120634000046"></a>As regards drilling and the way in which these resources will inevitably be exploited, this year, the Gulf of Mexico has shown that we need very stringent terms and conditions in terms of the way in which those minerals are exploited and in terms of the emergency facilities when that does not work. As to international seaways, we need to look to Canada to talk very closely and carefully with the international community to resolve international waters conversations and disputes in a way that everyone is able to respect. We also need to increase hugely our communications ability in respect of emergencies and the seaway. But, most of all, I ask that we encourage-the EU and the United Kingdom should participate in the Arctic Council-the use of these methods to come to a peaceful, long-lasting and legal framework for resolution of these issues.</p>

But as the region warms in the decades to come, the ice cap will gradually melt and its ecosystems change. Technology will improve and commercial opportunities will present shorter shipping routes, fishing grounds, new destinations for commercial tourism, and new oil and gas development opportunities. The United States Geological Survey 2008, for example, has estimated the potential magnitude of the resources in the Arctic as containing, as we have already heard, 90 billion barrels of oil, 1,700 TCF of gas and 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids, all equating to some 10 years of current global oil and gas demand.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="10120634000048"></a>A framework for the staged implementation of performance-based standards is required therefore to govern Arctic offshore oil and gas exploration, development, production and transportation, which must take into consideration the special challenges of the Arctic environment, and so enable compliance integrated with regulatory arrangements. Therefore, co-operation between industry, regulators and other stakeholders is a fundamental.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="10120634000049"></a>The central question that comes to my mind is, "How is a global treasure to be developed in a manner which provides, yet preserves?". International and national interest in mitigating and adapting to future changes to make responsible development happen has led to calls from Arctic and non-Arctic nations to anticipate and assess the new levels of activity to the region. Effective governance through Arctic-specific international standards, and adapted national regulations and standards, is critical in managing and mitigating risks and securing safe, reliable and environmentally responsible development. Many commentators choose to view the changes in the Arctic in terms of security; namely, energy security, environmental security and human security.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="10120634000050"></a>If the Arctic is to be developed, and there is no possibility of this not happening, it is essential that international co-operation on science, planning, inclusive engagement, standards of operation and safety is ensured. Have we got to the stage that world players, Governments and private sector alike have the experience and technology to develop in a manner that causes no future long-term regret? Have we learnt from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, including what went wrong and what will be done to prevent a similar occurrence? A constant concern is whether sufficient emphasis will be placed on addressing the wishes and needs of the Arctic's 4 million inhabitants. The Arctic is not about taking short-cuts and the residents of the region should be brought on board at an early stage of planning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="10120634000051"></a>In 2009, the Aspen Commission on Arctic Climate Change of the Aspen Institute identified initial principles of Arctic governance as forming the foundation and the standards by which future governance and sustainable management of human activities in the Arctic marine environment should be measured. Building on those principles, the Aspen commission is in the throes of publishing its final report, which is expected to report its recommendations in January 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="10120634000052"></a>I expect a number of points to emerge, the most important of which is to ensure the strengthening of the Arctic Council to allow it to follow through on all recommendations, including those of the Aspen Institute. Other points I expect include, first, that marine spatial planning should be the innovative tool to implement and measure success over time of ecosystem-based management across sectors and large marine ecosystems. It should be noted, however, that the starting point of such a process should be the formulation of clear development objectives. Secondly, a new Arctic marine conservation sustainable development plan should be called for and should recognise that the region's challenges are not limited to national concerns. Launching such an effort would require high-level ministerial engagement, if not that of the heads of state of Arctic Governments. And thirdly, an Arctic science programme should be implemented and integrated as part of an Arctic marine conservation sustainable development plan, using an open-source information network. The Arctic high seas, for example, should be designated as a science reserve to signal a new level and scope of international co-operation and collaboration. A specific plan should be developed to gather the scientific information urgently needed to make informed decisions about the region's future.</p>

The Arctic is among the most sensitive to temperature fluctuations and consequent changes in the ice cap. Notwithstanding the downsides of the melting of the ice cap, one of the upsides, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Jay, is the increased accessibility of the north-west passage. This opens up considerable economic and environmental benefits, providing scope to obviate existing security threats in the Gulf of Aden and introducing alternative routes to the Suez and Panama canals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="10120634000055"></a>Nor should we ignore Greenland, an autonomous country within the kingdom of Denmark, located within the Arctic Circle. It is the world's largest island and owes its name to the agricultural opportunities that settlers were keen to exploit-a green land that as a private pilot I have landed on a number of times. Populated for around 5,000 years, the Norse Vikings established farmland settlements around the year 1000 AD, something which would have been impossible in 1900. However, even at the time of the Vikings' presence on the island, almost the entirety of the land mass would have been covered by at least a 1 kilometre sheet of ice, yet the climate along the coast was conducive to supporting an agricultural community, attractive in its similarity to the lifestyle of the Scandinavian farmer of that period, based on arable and livestock farming.</p>

Its natural resources include coal, iron ore, lead, zinc, molybdenum, diamonds, gold, platinum, niobium, tantalite, uranium, fish, seals, whales and hydropower-quite a lot. Additionally, there are significant potential oil and gas fields, especially in the northern and north-eastern parts of the island. The current economy remains critically dependent on increased catches and exports of shrimp, Greenland halibut and, most recently, crabs. These represent around 82 per cent of the country's total exports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="10120634000057"></a>Opportunities for fishing in Greenland may be widened further but the scope to broaden its economic position in respect of other natural resources should not be discounted. For example, the increased interest in hydrocarbon exploration off Greenland's western coast represents a significant opportunity to deliver both economic and environmental benefits. The potential abundance of hydropower generation could also become a considerable source of power. Similarly, there has been an increase in tourism in Greenland. Cruise liners now operate in the western and southern waters during the peak summer tourist seasons. Although debates on topics of this kind tend to be characterised by the threat of impending doom, we should not forget that opportunities will emerge. We should be alert to them and include them in our considerations.</p>

Perhaps one of the notable references was that of Lord Dufferin, who, as a young man in his 20s, took a wooden sailing boat and sailed the whole way to Spitsbergen. This was before he went on to be ambassador at St Petersburg and Paris, Viceroy of India and Governor General of Canada, where he is still favourably remembered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="10120634000059"></a>In those days, the voyage was not much followed up because although Lord Dufferin wrote letters to his wife which were published in <I>Letters </I><I>F</I><I>rom </I><I>H</I><I>igh </I><I>L</I><I>atitudes</I><I>,</I> it was a cold and difficult place. There were much better places to go for resources, such as in the scramble for Africa, the struggle over South America and North America and of course in the Far East. Indeed, every century seems to have seen a scramble or race for somewhere. In the latter part of the past century, it was probably the struggle for space.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="10120634000060"></a>One characteristic of every one of those struggles was not just that it opened up new lands in order that there would be more resources available, but that it ended up with military struggle-the struggle for power and control. While we think of the situation in the Arctic and the melting of the waters in environmental terms-I understand that today it is expected in Ottawa that the Minister may well declare a scientific park just off the north of Baffin Island-and although there has been much said about the economic consequences,

Those are the questions that I would like to add to those that have already been raised by other noble Lords when my noble friend comes to reply.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="10120634000061"></a>My old friend Bill Graham, when he was defence Minister in Canada, remarked on the fact that the melting of the Arctic ice opened up great opportunities but also real threats. Canada has sent military equipment and men into the region in order to identify its own interests and show that it has the capacity to defend them should the time come. In 2009, the president of the United States in a presidential directive indicated potential security concerns in the region, and Russia has for quite a substantial time had a major military presence on the surface and more particularly under the surface in the region.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="10120634000062"></a>We have always to some extent-although this was not entirely true during the Second World War when a threat did indeed emerge from the north-felt that there was some degree of protection. That is not the same if it is possible to traverse the areas easily. Not least at a time when austerity has forced us to cut back on our military naval fleet, it is important that part of our strategic defence thinking over the next number of years should include not just the opportunities, which are marvellous and the requirement to protect our world, but the potential threats to our own security and that of the European Union.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="10120634000063"></a>This is not solely a matter for ourselves of course. It is clearly a northward shift of emphasis for NATO. If one looks at the map not from a normal perspective of Britain being right at the centre but looks down at the world from an Arctic projection, one sees a northern equivalent of the Pacific rim, where there is a major confrontation between Russia, which has half of all the coastline, Canada and the United States and, as has been mentioned, Denmark in the form of Greenland, as well as Norway. I am keen to hear from my noble friend what our security advisers are telling us about the need to protect ourselves and our national interests, and what is being discussed at NATO in this regard where there is a much greater and more obvious responsibility.</p>

I suggest it will be quite a few years beyond that. Most of the voyages that have been made round the north-east passage rather than the north-west passage, which is over the top of Russia, have been experimental. We can go back to 1997 when a Finnish tanker made the voyage. More recently, as the noble Lord said, two German freighters made the voyage but not, as he said, from Vladivostok to Holland; in fact, they came from South Korea and went over the top to Rotterdam. They stopped off on the way at Novyy in Yamburg province which meant they had icebreaker escort and had to take Russian ice pilots.</p>

She was also escorted by three icebreakers.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="10120634000066"></a>Sovcomflot is preparing to send an even bigger tanker-162,000 tonnes-on a trial voyage next year. However, here we come up against draft restrictions. At the moment the Sankov and Sannikar Straits are restricted to 12.5 metres and 13 metres respectively and larger ships, drawing more than 15 metres, will be forced to go further offshore into higher latitudes, where the risk from floating icebergs is greater.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="10120634000067"></a>Companies which have sent ships around the north have said that they are very satisfied-it cuts 4,000 miles off the voyage, it saves them paying Suez Canal dues and saves the piracy problems. If a much larger amount of shipping was to go round the north of Russia, and if one was to believe from WikiLeaks' revelations that Russia is a mafia state, I can see various Russians becoming very interested in what was going around their shores and there is nobody there to help ships, unlike going through the Gulf of Aden.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="10120634000068"></a>One possible drawback to the northern sea route is attracting the attention from the green and climate change lobbies. One report suggests that the release of CO2 and engine particles-that is, black carbon or soot as we know it-from diesel engines in a sensitive area as regards climate change could lead to an increase in global warming.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="10120634000069"></a>Other reports suggest that up to 2 per cent of global shipping traffic could be using northern sea routes by 2030, rising to 5 per cent by 2050. To put that in context, today 4 per cent of world shipping uses the Suez Canal-that is an enormous amount of shipping. To be quite honest, I cannot see it happening for a very long time.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="10120634000070"></a>The other thing to take into account, which has not been mentioned, is that at the moment, with global warming, we have a two-month window in effect for shipping but the winter is still frozen over. Shipping is not going to suddenly take to using these Arctic routes. I think the likelihood is that it will be reserved for bulk cargoes, both wet and dry, mainly exports from Russia. The main container trades, I would suggest, are very unlikely to start using these northern routes. I want to give an example of the mileages-Hamburg to Yokohama going by the northern sea route saves about 4,000 miles; to Hong Kong you save about 1,000 miles and to Singapore the distances are exactly the same.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="10120634000071"></a>Container shipping is a very complex web these days and ships pick up cargo all over the place. Let's face it-they are not going to get any cargo in northern Russia, so I think they are going to stick to their proven routes for some time to come.</p>

But she will be educated, I am sure, if I can persuade her to read <I>Hansard</I><I></I>and the excellent debate we have had. I am very grateful, as others are, to the noble Lord, Lord Jay, for setting it out so clearly. I would like to begin by looking at the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, of security. There are a couple of very interesting RUSI documents: one by Clive Murgatroyd published last year called <I>Defence and the Arctic-Go with the Floe?</I>; and another by Paul Berkman. They raised the question whether there is any choice other than having a zone of peace or an enhanced military presence, with all the danger that that brings. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="10120634000073"></a>A number of noble Lords have set out the opportunities provided by the melting of the Arctic ice cap and have rightly described some of the repercussions. Sometimes our media and our own enthusiasm will not give true weight to some of those issues. I have rarely seen the albedo effect, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, argued other than in the most scientific and technical journals.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="10120634000074"></a>Access to oil and gas will be an issue, not only because of the unpredictable seas but because of the thawing permafrost. There is also the very real question of oil spills, which could be a major problem under ice, because it could spill for many hundreds of thousands of miles. That points, as all these questions do, to international co-operation, licensing and safety regimes. Then there are the fisheries. It is perhaps not so much a question of the ice cap melting that is the issue with fisheries, but as a result of that fish stocks will migrate to other areas. Sustainable fisheries management is the key. Again, that talks of the need for international co-operation, if we are not to see some of the problems that we have seen in the past decade or two repeat themselves.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="10120634000075"></a>We have the question of commercial shipping. Yes, there are insurance opportunities, but someone's opportunity for enhanced insurance premiums is someone else's penalty in having to pay them. More importantly, whatever shipping is used in those new routes, emergency cover is probably more difficult to provide than where we are at the moment. I join with others in asking what action the Government have in mind to meet these challenges in the IMO, with NATO, the EU and other international forums, by way of enhanced regulatory frameworks and increased collaboration. Specifically, what are the prospects of the United States signing up to the UN law of the sea convention? We have heard words from Washington to suggest that that is an intention, but is it a realistic intention, particularly in the light of shifts of power within Congress?</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="10120634000076"></a>I finish with an important point from a domestic point of view-the impact of rising seas on the coastlines of Britain. We have seen various estimates of how the seas could rise as a result of melting ice caps, including one of 2 metres by the end of this century, which has been pooh-poohed or debunked, not least by the Met Office and others. But there will certainly be substantial increases. The last Administration made urgent legislation to protect homes and businesses, and the Environment Agency says that more than 5 million properties are at

It is a very fast-developing situation, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, pointed out, with rapidly melting ice packs and ice floes in the Arctic region. The House is grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Jay, for letting us focus briefly on this; it may be the sort of issue that we will come back to in much greater detail in future.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="1012071000002"></a>The phenomenon is all the more striking because of the possibilities that it raises. Greenland is becoming greener, or so we are told. Indeed, there is evidence of areas becoming habitable again in Greenland, which have not been available for five or six centuries. There is a certain irony in the whole situation that, as the ice melts, the hydrocarbons are becoming more accessible. While we want to combat global warming, which is widely believed to be closely associated with excess use of fossil fuels, we have a situation which is making access to fossil fuels all the easier, although perhaps easier is too strong a word. It is certainly less difficult and more possible than it has been in history.</p>

<a name="101206-0002.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="1012071000003"></a>There is the hydrocarbon situation and the fascinating prospect of opening the north-west passage, which my noble friend Lord Rotherwick referred to, and the possibility of solar routes. I want to come to both of those in a moment, but let me begin by answering the central question: what are our key aims in the Arctic and what are we in the UK doing to meet these challenges? Let me sum up the answers to those questions briefly before coming to more detail about hydrocarbons and many other aspects of the Arctic phenomenon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="1012071000004"></a>Our aims are to promote peace and good governance in the region, increase UK influence by maintaining good bilateral and multilateral relationships with the Arctic states, and to support the work of the Arctic Council and other international and regional bodies. The noble Lord, Lord Jay, asked about our status in relation to the Arctic Council We are an observer and we have presented a very strong case for our continued observer status. Frankly, we would like to see this whole issue raised by the Arctic powers of who should be observers and how that should work in the future. We want that to be as settled as possible and believe that we can make a powerful contribution to the continued work of the Arctic Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="1012071000005"></a>Our second aim is to protect crucial UK energy supplies from the region and promote UK business interests. Thirdly, we want to ensure access to fisheries and transport routes in the region, including the ones that may open up in the future-not just in summer but in winter. Fourthly, we want to promote wider UK

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="1012071000006"></a>Let me move from the general to the particular. I have noted already the irony that the melting of the ice means that all sorts of possibilities open up for access to the huge hydrocarbon resources in the region. We need to remember that this is not virgin territory. We have the Stockman field, to which my noble friend referred, Snohvit, the Norwegian development, Prudhoe Bay and the vast Alaska resources operated by BP, so oil and gas-particularly gas-is being extracted from the area in substantial quantities already. They are small compared with what is estimated to lie in the region, and all kinds of vast figures are thrown around. The US authorities estimated some years ago that 30 per cent of the world's gas reserves and 13 per cent of the world's oil reserves lay under the Arctic ice, or in the Arctic region. One has to be careful with these figures because they are assessments of what has not been discovered, so they have a guessing element to them. But there is no doubt that colossal reserves are there and the question arises as to how they can be got out economically and in line with all the other restraints that the world wants, including respect for the environment.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="1012071000007"></a>There are then the shipping aspects, which are potentially very interesting, to which my noble friend Lord Rotherwick referred. In a way, although one may be eliding the timescales a little, many would say that today travelling through the Gulf of Aden has become considerably more hazardous with the unfortunate growing piracy elements. Insurance premiums have gone up enormously for taking the traditional routes between the West and the East, and the north-west passage is many thousands of kilometres-and miles-shorter. If the passage became available in the summer, and at least parts of the winter, the gain would be enormous and of great interest to the great shipping and transport companies of the world. Those are the possibilities. They are undoubtedly exciting and real because the melting is taking place. Scientists argue about the precise nature and speed of the causes and whether we are talking about a cyclical, historical or permanent trend. That is a debate that we do not want to enter into this evening. However, the melting is a fact.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="1012071000008"></a>Against that, it has to be accepted that extracting oil and gas in the area could lead to oil spills and environmental hazards. The conditions are very difficult and, even with the melting of the ice, we are dealing with appallingly cold conditions. Deep-sea drilling, as we know from the tragedies in the Gulf of Mexico, is full of hazards. The world is watching closely to see that these things are controlled very carefully. The noble Viscount, Lord Waverley, was concerned about the guidelines for the extraction of hydrocarbons. We fully support the Arctic Council guidelines. They must be adhered to rigidly.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="1012071000009"></a>Secondly, there is the question of straightforward economics. At what price a barrel of crude does it begin to look realistic to develop the technologies to extract from under the ice and to develop the kind of offshore sub-sea stations that can draw oil and gas horizontally on to land-based refining and receiving stations? The costs are very high. All sorts of estimates  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_97"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 97</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fly around. There is no doubt that if the price of crude was as low as it dipped two years ago-or as low as it dipped back in the 1980s-the attractions of any kind of extraction in this area would be very small. There are major environmental issues and major fisheries interests to be safeguarded. There are the interests of the indigenous peoples to be looked after.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="1012071000010"></a>Against that, the politics of the whole region has begun to be not as dismaying and deterring as perhaps it seemed in the past. The littoral five-Russia, Norway, Denmark, Canada and the USA-and the other three members of the Arctic Council-Iceland, Finland and Sweden-are now co-operating more closely than they have in the past. The long debate between Russia and Norway about demarcation lines looks like being settled. It is yet to be completely signed but the spirit is one of co-operation and is constructive. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, brought us a hint of the good news from his interlocutor. The major political problems and quarrels that might have tarnished the whole scene as it unfolds look like they are being tempered by a degree of co-operation, which is very good news.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="1012071000011"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, asked about security. There are concerns that various countries have sent patrol vessels to the area. Everyone became very excited when the Russian authorities decided to place a sub-sea titanium flag on the North Pole. Again, one hopes that the spirit of co-operation that is evident in the Arctic Council will prevail.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="1012071000012"></a>That is the scene. We are involved with it and watch it very closely. The possibilities are undeniable and there are also dangers. I hope that noble Lords will feel that Her Majesty's Government are alert to this new development. We are not closing our eyes to something of great importance. We are not an Arctic power but we tend to be close to it. The possible implications for our coastline, if the climate developments continue in the way some fear, and certainly for our energy security, are real.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="1012071000013"></a>I hope that this debate has helped the noble Lord, Lord Brett, warm up a little from his cold start this morning. I have not answered in detail about the flooding matters., but I will write to him about them. They are part of a more general concern that we all have about flood protection. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Jay, very warmly for initiating such a fascinating, interesting and important debate.</p>

<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_98"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 98</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>choice". That is what this group is about. At the moment, nobody has asked the people. Nobody has asked anybody whether they want to change the voting system. This group of amendments splits the question into two parts. It is fairly self-explanatory, although it is not as easy to see when they are split up on the Marshalled List. The first question is in Amendment 21 and would ask people:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="1012071000073"></a>"Do you wish to change the voting system?".</p>

<p><a name="1012071000015"></a>People are not being asked this. It was implied by Amendment 16. People were not asked whether they wanted change; it said that it had been agreed to change the voting system. I want to ask people whether they want to do so.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="1012071000016"></a>The second part, if there are yes and no answers to that first question, is in Amendment 27:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="1012071000074"></a>"If a majority vote for a change in the voting system, which of the alternatives"-</p>

<p><a name="1012071000017"></a>I call them families-</p>
<ul><a name="1012071000078"></a>"would you prefer?".</ul>
<p><a name="1012071000018"></a>There are four there; it is a little package. I will not labour the point. I did not invent this. It is a replica, although not exactly, of what happened in New Zealand nearly 20 years ago. New Zealand had first past the post, a very modern democracy and votes for women 30 years before this country did, so we should not lecture anyone there about democracy and parliamentary systems. It had first past the post and there was pressure for change. I shall not deploy all the documentation and so on but a referendum was held in New Zealand in two parts. The people were asked, first, "Do you wish to change the system? Yes or no?", and then below that on the paper was the second question, "If the yes vote wins, which one of the following do you want?". The options given were in families-I use that term because of the debates that we have had-rather than in detail. Parliament took it away, worked on it to make it a practical reality and then a year later, in 1993, there was a second binding referendum between first past the post and the alternative, which won the vote and was turned into a practical system. It worked. I do not know how many times it has been used-probably at least four or five-but in New Zealand the people were asked before a change was made.</p>

I could not get away from the Chamber and my file is across the road, so I do not know. It was a hot issue and I have copies of the information that at the time was distributed to people by the equivalent of the Electoral Commission to explain the systems and what was going on, together with copies of the ballot papers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="1012071000021"></a>I am not going to spend this debate deploying the whys and wherefores of the system. The principle is clear: first, we should ask the people, "Do you want to change the system?". I can make the case for that but the change, when it occurs, has to be cemented, and  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_99"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that is my anxiety about what is being proposed. This is not intended to be a cemented change, because it is clear that, assuming it is carried, the Liberal Democrats will come back later for a move to PR. Were I in favour of PR, I would go straight to PR, but that is not the point that I am making here.</p>

As I understand his argument, he wants to have an initial decision on whether to change from first past the post. If there is a majority in favour of change, that becomes a trigger for a list of alternatives, which, according to the first decision, excludes the retention of first past the post. Would it not be possible to have, say, 45 per cent of the people voting for first past the post and then, when you come to the alternatives, to have any one of the alternatives securing less than 45 per cent of the support of the electorate? What would happen then?</p>

I know that I shall be criticised for Amendment 30 but, if you are going to have multi-choice answers, you have to be able to rank them so that there is a clear winner. What I have here are two questions that are intended to be on one ballot paper: "Do you want to change the system? Yes or no?". If the yes vote wins, which will not be known until the papers are counted, then the second question comes in: "Which family would you choose?". In New Zealand, there was a year's gap between the two referendums. The first referendum was not binding but the second one was. It was do or die between one system or another. As the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, said, the second referendum required a yes or no answer and so was absolutely clear.</p>

First past the post was mentioned in both referendums even though when people were asked in the first referendum, "Do you want to change from first past the post? Yes or no?", the yes vote won. They then chose what I call, in shorthand, the additional member system as the preferred option from the family. A year later, there was a run-off between a detailed additional member system and the status quo, the first past the post. You could not complain if you were a first past the poster that you did not get a fair crack of the whip in New Zealand, because there were two opportunities. That is what cemented the change, because on two occasions first past the post lost. It lost on the indicative referendum to start with, when the choice came; and then it lost on the binding referendum. So, on the second referendum, first past the post was back. It was incredibly sophisticated, modern and democratic, and this was 1992-93. The system worked, and it is one on which I wanted to model this kind of operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="1012071000026"></a>They did it and it works, so there is somewhere in the world that we can point to-somewhere that is English-speaking, first past the post, democratic. We are scratching around because no one can find a place  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_100"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>where the type of alternative vote proposed in the Bill actually works in reality. I was going to use Canada as an example, but it was not a national election when they used it there, when it all went dramatically wrong for lots of people. It was always in the provinces. If you google Canada and the alternative vote you will come up with a textbook of how to smash the alternative vote. It was not a national election, however, so I am not going to use it.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="1012071000027"></a>It was a two-stage question and a two-stage referendum, but my amendments do not cover the second stage. I just wanted to deploy the case and give at least a positive push-or a nudge, in the language-to the effect that it can work, because it did work and there is a classic example for it.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="1012071000028"></a>There are a couple of points I did not speak on in the last debate-I showed enormous restraint, as I said to the Leader of the House-because I have got nothing new to add to what I am not going to say now. One of the reasons that I never joined the Electoral Reform Society after I became a convert just over 20 years ago was this issue about STV. That is why I never joined. I have worked very happily with lots of people on joint platforms and would be happy to do so again, but I will never join because it has this thing whereby if you join, people will say, "Oh, he is in favour of STV". It is the one system I do not like because it forces party people to fight against each other. I do not think that is a clever system. It was also dissected by the Plant commission, which I will come to in a moment, which was chaired by my noble friend Lord Plant back in the 1990s.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="1012071000029"></a>On AV, you have to ask yourself what you are trying to do. Are you trying to elect the most popular person for a constituency and then as a by-product get a popular Government, because it is slightly more proportionate? The question that should be asked on this referendum is: do you want a majoritarian system or a proportional system? That is the question to ask. First past the post and AV are both majoritarian systems; there is no argument about that. They are not remotely proportional, so they are in the majoritarian family. But if you want to elect the most popular person, AV will not do that.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="1012071000030"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lamont, raised an issue which I have covered later in Amendment 52, so I will not go into it in detail now, about what you do with those preferences for the bottom candidates. It is unfair; there is no question about that. The sixth candidate gets chucked out. That second preference is worth exactly the same as the first vote for the first candidate or the second preference for the second candidate. It is very unfair that someone's vote should have that value. Amendment 52 gets us round that. But there is not a system that will deliver the most popular candidate.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="1012071000031"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, gave us a seminar on the last election. I want to read a bit from page 66 of the Plant report, which was a long time ago, about how to get the most popular person elected. You certainly cannot do it by ranking and kicking people out; that does not work. For example, as I tried to explain in a previous debate, the supporters of the first three candidates in a list might all hate each other equally, but each of the supporters of the first three  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_101"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would vote for the fourth. That is what is known as the Condorcet winner-which is defined as the option that beats every other in an exhaustive series of pair-wise contests.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="1012071000032"></a>I raised this with some academics upstairs and they gave me a good example of someone who would have been a Condorcet winner, although it did not happen because of the system that was used. Noble Lords will remember the French election when Chirac ran up against Le Pen and Jospin came third. Jospin was the Condorcet winner because, in a run-off with Chirac, he would have beaten Chirac and in a run off with Le Pen, he would have beaten Le Pen, but because he was third he got knocked out. He would have been the Condorcet winner in that case, but he was not because of the way the system worked with the two-round ballot, so the most popular person did not win. That is a good example from recent history and we all know what happened in the French election.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="1012071000033"></a>The alternative vote system will not give you the most popular candidate. I did not want to interrupt the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, earlier-that would be far beyond my pay grade-but he repeated the canard about the winner securing 50 per cent plus of the votes. It is not true; it cannot happen under the system in this Bill. In order for it to happen every voter would have to use every single preference on the ballot paper and that will not happen because of what I said last week. I can guarantee that some Liberal Democrat candidates will go around the country saying to their supporters, "Don't vote and use your second preference because they will work out what might happen if that second preference all goes wrong". People will not be encouraged to use all their preferences.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="1012071000034"></a>There are some problems with the system. I digress because I wanted to point out that every system has its defects; nothing is perfect. You can make an electoral system do exactly what you want it to do. You can put constraints on turnout; you can put constraints on the additional Member system; and you could say to a party, "You cannot have a top-up candidate unless you have won at least one constituency". I was accused of being antidemocratic when I said that. You do not need a percentage turnout. If you cannot win a constituency, you are not entitled to a top-up. They said, "All that is bad for the Greens". I said, "Let them go and win a seat", and they have done that now, so they would qualify. You can do all those things; it is all techie.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="1012071000035"></a>I refuse to let my eyes glaze over, but when I am faced with the situation presented in this Bill, it makes me so angry because, at the end of the day, I will have to vote for first past the post, which really sticks in my throat. I am being forced to vote for first past the post because of what is in the Bill: the preference system, the turnout and all the issues which we discussed last week on which we can go into detail when we come to other amendments. Those matters make the situation more perverse and worse than the present system. That is a change I am not prepared to vote for. I am not prepared to vote for something on the basis of, "Vote for this and if we get it right at the next election, we will come back and get a bit of PR, AV+". Give me AV+ and I will vote for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="1012071000036"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McNally, would vote for AV+ but he cannot get the person sitting next to him in the Cabinet to support him. That is a bit like the Labour Cabinet. We were presented with exactly the same in the Bill that came to the House in March. People were not asked if they wanted to change. It was put together by a Cabinet, most of whose members did not want change at any price; they just stuffed AV in and thought they could get away with it because it is so close to first past the post. There were the same problems and I made the same speech when sitting on the Bench opposite.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="1012071000037"></a>I am annoyed because, at the end of the day, unless there is a major change to the Bill, I will have to vote for first past the post, which I do not think is very good. Also I think people will be misled during the referendum. Perhaps I can give an example: somewhere in the world it worked in a mature democracy and I think it could work here if we asked the people. I wish we were brave enough to do that.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="1012071000038"></a>I realise this was all cobbled together in a rush in the six days after the election. I understand that the pressures to get a deal were enormous. I will support the fixed-term Parliament, although I think four years is better than five but I will settle for five years. I accept that the only deal in town was the deal I am looking at now, but that means we should be mature enough to say, "Look, if there is something intrinsically wrong with the system, let us put the case to the people and ask them if they want a change".</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="1012071000039"></a>Think of the mandate you would have from that Front Bench, if you could persuade people that, yes, there is demand for a change. The first-past-the-posters would be run out of town and we could get to work on getting a change that people would accept and it might last for the 132 years that the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, keeps saying that first past the post has lasted for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="1012071000040"></a>I freely admit that you can all go home because I do not intend to push any of this to a vote, but I wanted to put it on the record that there is an alternative way of doing this. I beg to move.</p>

I always hesitate to disagree with my noble friend Lord Rooker, because, just as he said that the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, fills him with awe, my noble friend fills many of us here with awe. He was one of the most effective Labour Ministers and he is an even more effective Back-Bencher and debater, so it is always with some hesitation that we get up to disagree. But I come from a fundamentally different point of view, in that I think that first past the post is, as I argued earlier, the best system, for a range of reasons.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_103"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column 103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101206-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="1012071000045"></a>I wonder, though, whether he is right in using the New Zealand example as a precedent for us, for two and maybe three reasons. First, New Zealand has a unicameral Parliament, so there is only one Chamber and only one election takes place. They do not have, as we do, two Chambers and-as I said in relation to the previous amendment-the possibility of having two different systems, one of which produces the Government and the other which produces the balancing force, or balancing Chamber. That is very important.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="1012071000046"></a>Also, as far as I remember-and I am sure that my noble friend Lord Rooker will get up and correct me if I am wrong-the example that he suggested was introduced by the Labour Government in New Zealand. They thought that it was right to change the electoral system. I visited New Zealand a few years later and spoke to a number of Labour Party members who were very strongly of the view that they had made a mistake in introducing it. I know that my noble friend Lady McDonagh was General Secretary of the Labour Party and has contacts with the New Zealand Labour Party. I was there on a CPA visit and met them and they were very regretful that they had moved in that direction. Despite his deep knowledge and the detail that my noble friend gave us from the Plant report and the system in New Zealand, he was not able to answer my noble friend's question about the turnout, about how many people actually turned out to make these great changes in the two referenda that took place, and whether or not that could be justified.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="1012071000047"></a>That brings me to two final points. Someone suggested earlier that there was filibustering going on. There was actually a very good debate, which seems to me to be the purpose of these kinds of Chambers. I was pleased that quite a few Conservatives got involved in the debate.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="1012071000048"></a>The Liberal Democrats and some Labour people keep arguing that democracy is all about an arithmetical correlation between the number of votes and the number of seats, as exact a correlation as possible. That is democracy, they say-to get the nearest you can to the number of seats relating to the percentage of votes cast. I think there is another, perhaps even more important, aspect of democracy, which is accountability: that is the ability, first, of your party in the constituency and, secondly, of the electorate in the constituency to hold you to account. In my view, that can be done properly only by the first past the post system.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="1012071000049"></a>Earlier, the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, made a very strong argument about wasted votes. One aspect of that was dealt with by one of my noble friends. The argument was that there are safe seats that never change. Come up to Scotland and go to Edinburgh South, which was held by the Tories for generations and is now a Labour seat, or go to East Renfrewshire, which was held by the Tories for generations and is now a Labour seat. We used to think our votes were wasted, but we worked hard, we convinced people, we got people on to our side, they voted for us and we got a majority. Surely that is what democracy is about. It is about convincing people and changing people's minds. It is Gilbertian to think that because someone was born a Tory, they will always be a Tory or because

You can change people, you can convince people. If you will excuse me saying so, I was talking to my noble friend Lord Maclennan-I still call him my noble friend-earlier on. He won the seat through his campaigning, his personality and the Labour Party in Caithness. We had never held it before. We can win these seats and can convince people to change their minds. Surely that is what democracy is about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="1012071000050"></a>Although my noble friend Lord Rooker has very powerfully argued the case for his amendments, I do not find it totally convincing. I say to the Tories that I wish that more of them in this place would have the courage of what I know to be their convictions and would stand up as the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, did earlier today and say what they really believe: that first past the post is the best way of electing people to the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="1012071000053"></a>That shows that, when you ask the electorate what have been deemed in these debates to be complicated questions over the detail of various proportional systems, they actually understand what they are being asked and they are prepared to go out and vote and state a preference. The evidence is there in English-speaking New Zealand. It did it, and it shows the way forward. It is interesting to note, in the following pages in this section, that the turnout in New Zealand elections following the change in the electoral system in 1990 has consistently remained around the 80 per cent mark. That is almost as high as in my former constituency in one election, but it is vastly higher than the average within the United Kingdom. Again, we may have something to learn from New Zealand.</p>

Tina Day, a Director of the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust interviewed 21 MPs in the 2002-05 Parliament for her research. She argues in her 2005 paper Increasing the representativeness of parliament ... 186 that there has been a shift of power from the Executive to Parliament, with select committees (whose composition reflects the multi-party Parliament) assuming a very powerful role".</p>

That is an answer, but it does not deal with why AV has been chosen. There is a profound sense in this House that there are a range of options.

Unless no answer is forthcoming, there is no other option but for this House to debate which are the better options.

We believe that on an issue as fundamental as voting reform, the public need to be given a clear choice which will produce an equally clear result, and there are a number of ways in which these amendments would stand in the way of that.</p>

We might have assumed, given that the Labour Party had it in its manifesto, that it would support it. That is the first reason. How about this for a second reason? AV is the only system that allows a single constituency member to continue, which was an issue. AV+ includes additional members who do not represent constituencies. So AV maintains that link.

It was not whether we supported AV or not, but whether we supported a referendum or not.

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="1012073000017"></a>There are a number of ways in which the amendments proposed would get in the way of that clarity. Splitting the question in this way would risk making it unclear to people what they are really being asked to vote on. If someone was to vote no to the first question for example, why would they wish to answer the second question? Would their votes to the second question still count if they had said no to the first? As the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, pointed out, there is another disadvantage. The amendment allows for the possibility that people might vote yes to the first question but then not want any of the options presented in the second question, which would lead to uncertainty in interpreting the results as to what the voters really wanted.</p>

<a name="101206-0003.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="1012073000018"></a>Another drafting issue with the amendment is that it does not make it clear that it is a voting system for the UK parliamentary elections to the House of Commons. There is also no indication in these amendments about how any of the other voting systems would work. As I said earlier on, one attraction of the approach taken in our Bill is that, for all the arguments that might take place about how AV works, our Bill sets that out in Clause 9 and Schedule 10. Any questions about how AV works can be resolved by looking at the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="1012073000019"></a>In its report on the referendum question, the Electoral Commission noted that there was a great deal of uncertainty among the public about what the different voting systems were. The Electoral Commission will publish information on the different systems to address that. It is realistic to think that the commission will be able to address this sort of issue where there are two voting systems at stake. But in the context of the commission's observations, it is not realistic to think the same where five proposed systems are referred to in the question.</p>

In the Bill and in the referendum, we are asking them to weigh up the strengths and weaknesses of the first past the post system as against the alternative vote system and then make a choice. For these reasons I think it is much more straightforward if we pose the question in the way it is in the amendment and get people to actually choose the system they would prefer. I beg to move.</p>

I understand exactly the point she is trying to make-aiming to ensure that the best possible referendum question is posed to the public. I hope to reassure her that an options form of the question was considered and tested by the Electoral Commission when it carried out its assessment of the original question on the Bill. The commission's report concluded that there are potential drawbacks to using the options style in this

It went on to discuss it and concluded that, in the circumstances, it could not recommend the use of an options question in place of the more traditional yes/no question that meets our criteria for assessing a referendum question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="1012073000026"></a>The commission's report also noted that an options form of the question could quite significantly affect the nature of referendum campaigning as campaigns will not be straightforward yes and no campaigns but in favour of either option. The question in the Bill as it stands therefore reflects the recommendations of the Electoral Commission which tested the question through focus groups and interviews with members of the public, as well as input from language experts.</p>

Can I ask you to go back a little bit to the issue of the campaigns that you touched on? It would seem to me that the way I am proposing it would be much better for campaigns-all the subjects would get aired rather than what is going to happen.

With respect, she has been involved in a number of elections and referendums, as have a lot of us in this House. With no disrespect to the Electoral Commission, until recently it did not have anyone on it who had either been elected to anything or been involved actively in elections or referendums. It is only very recently, with a change in the law, that we have had people on the Electoral Commission who know what they are talking about in relation to elections and referendums. Surely the argument given by my noble friend is right. Yes is a positive argument and no is a negative argument. Therefore, yes is seen to be something far more attractive than no. If you are putting the option, you have to explain the option; you do not just go around sloganising. You have to explain in more detail what first past the post or the alternative vote is about. That is a much more sensible suggestion to put forward. I urge the Leader of the House to think carefully about that and not just to accept something because the Electoral Commission has said it. There is a tendency in both Houses for some people just accepting things because the commission says it. Now we have changed the commission's composition and added to it some people who know what they are talking about with regard to elections and referendums. Its suggestions in future will be better informed. But will the Leader of the House listen to my noble friend on this?</p>

<p><a name="1012064000003"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="1012064000082"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> My Lords, before moving on to Amendment 20, I shall make a couple of general remarks about how we have done so far. All sides want, I think, to make the Bill a success. That is not really a matter of political dispute. The Committee has already unearthed some serious failings in drafting. For example, on fiscal policy, the OBR is supposed not to regard a critique of economic policy as within its remit, but on the issue of judging the sustainability of fiscal policy the context of general economic policy is within its remit. What is it to do? Is it one way or the other?</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000004"></a>Then there is the question of Clause 5(3)-the clause with the inverse meaning, as I think of it now. Everybody thought that it was designed to prevent something from being done, but then we discovered to our amazement that it is all about what has to be taken into account. This sort of obscurantist drafting gives the law a bad name. There were also the statements in the charter, notably the reference to "intergenerational fairness", over which we have the grave suspicion that the person who drafted the phrase had not the faintest idea what it meant.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000005"></a>Yet none of these is a political issue. None of them really merits the instruction, "Resist". All of them are items to debate and to correct. This is a fine example of why technical Bills such as this should go to pre-legislative scrutiny. Be that as it may, my message to the Minister and to the anxious officials behind him is: "Loosen up". Let us use this Grand Committee for the constructive purpose that it was intended to have and try to do what we all want, which is to ensure that this Bill works, works well and works for the long term.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000006"></a>With respect to Amendment 20, the OBR has made a major step forward in recognising the uncertainty around the probabilistic nature of economic forecasting -and quite right, too. However, this has clearly not yet penetrated the thinking of government Ministers.  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>In the Chancellor's Statement last Monday, he boldly declared that the OBR had ruled out the possibility of a double-dip recession, when in fact it had done nothing of the kind. The OBR suggested that there was a 50:50 chance that the growth rate would be 2.1 per cent next year but that, at the same time, there was a significant chance of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent that growth would be zero-that is, that there would be a double dip.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000007"></a>However, while the assessment and presentation of the uncertainty of forecasts have been greatly improved, no progress has yet been made on the other risks embodied in the Government's overall fiscal position. For example, it is now clear that for the last decade-and I recognise that this was under the previous Government-tax revenues have been overly dependent on taxation of financial services. The severe problems in financial services contributed disproportionately to the fall in government revenues and to the growth of the deficit. This, which is a sort of all-eggs-in-one-basket problem, is a standard feature of corporate risk analysis and could, with value, be introduced into the analysis of public policy as well. Similarly, everyone is now aware that the UK economy has become seriously unbalanced, which is just the sort of issue that would be highlighted by regular and careful risk analysis. If the OBR were to extend its analysis of uncertainty to include a risk-sensitive analysis of the public finances, it would provide a complementary and extremely valuable service to policy-makers and align public policy-making with the best practice in private policy-making and private risk assessment.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000008"></a>Chapter 4.10.1 of the charter relates risks only to,</p>
<ul><a name="1012064000073"></a>"risks surrounding the economic outlook",</ul>
<p><a name="1012064000066"></a>but associates the economic outlook only with the forecast, not with the state of the economy as it  is. This amendment focuses attention on a wider concept of risk-the risk inherent in the underlying parameters of the fiscal and economic stance-and, by doing so, extends risk analysis into the areas of best practice that are now found in the private sector. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="1012064000009"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="1012064000083"></a>The Commercial Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Sassoon):</b> My Lords, I am happy to start by saying that I agree that we should, as far as possible, stick to the technical. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, for confirming that he would like to make this a technical analysis of the Bill.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000010"></a>I agree that it is critical for the OBR to assess the risk to the public finances and that that should be clearly set out. The amendment proposes that this provision should be in the Bill, whereas we propose that it should be in the charter, first focusing on the economic risks and secondly focusing on the fiscal risks. As the noble Lord said, there are references to risks in chapters 4.10.1 and 4.10.2 of the draft charter: the first relates to the economic forecast and the second relates to the forecasting of the public finances. I believe that together those two references to risk give the OBR a clear and wide-ranging remit. I will think about the specific drafting in the light of the points that the noble Lord has made, but I believe that the charter is the right place for this. Clearly, the drafting on the sorts of risks that the OBR looks at should not  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in any way constrain it from looking at the relevant risks, so I will have a look to make sure that, on reflection, we have got all the risks covered.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000011"></a>The OBR has, of course, a duty to act consistently with the charter, so it should not be necessary to include this provision in the Bill. However, we must get it right in the charter, which is where I think we should leave it. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="1012064000012"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="1012064000084"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> Gosh, that was quite a loosening up. I think that the noble Lord has taken the point. In my reading, the charter seems to confine risk analysis to the probabilistic analysis of forecasts-to the fan charts and so on. I want to stimulate the OBR to think about the risks inherent in the economic posture, if we may call it that, of the country at any one time. On the two illustrations that I gave, I think that if forecasters, particularly official forecasters, had been sensitive over the last decade to the excessive share of taxation coming from the financial services and had realised the risk of having all one's eggs in one basket or had been sensitive to the problems associated with the overall balance of the economy, which I know the Government wish to address, we might have had some danger signals hoisted earlier than they were. However, in the context of the Minister's assurance that he will look at this issue and perhaps amend the charter accordingly, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This is an important aspect. We are going into a situation where the Government have an official forecast, but a great many other forecasts will be produced at the same time. The helpful document produced by the Treasury, <I>Forecasts for the UK </I><I>E</I><I>conomy</I>, shows just how many other independent forecasts there are, but the OBR one will clearly have a particular and unique importance. If it is going to be compared with forecasts by other forecasters, we need to know the assumptions on which the official forecast is based, because we all know that the assumptions that are made essentially determine the outcome of the forecast.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000014"></a>I realise that the charter also refers to the assumptions being spelt out but it seemed more convenient in this instance to put that into the Bill. Indeed, I am inclined to think that this is so important that it ought to be in the Bill rather than in the charter. Since there seems to be general agreement in the draft charter that this should be so, however, I am not clear where these

It would be helpful if we were told exactly where the Government believe that these assumptions are being spelt out.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000015"></a>The other amendments also relate to what one might in simple terms describe as the "model". In this context, I am not clear precisely what model is being used. The Treasury had a model, of course, which was published and was used by various outside organisations, including the so-called ITEM group. Are we to understand that the OBR forecast will totally replace the Treasury forecast that used to appear in the Red Book? If so, is the OBR none the less going to use the same model that the Treasury used, or does it have a model of its own? In either case, it would be helpful if my noble friend could place in the Library, or publicise more widely, exactly which individual model is being used; we would then have a better basis for comparing it. Are we also to understand that if the Treasury model disappears, the ITEM group-for the benefit of <I>Hansard</I>, I should point that it is spelt out in capital letters rather than just being referred to as the "item group"-will go on using the Treasury model, or will there be a replacement?</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000016"></a>I agree with the opening remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, about the importance of getting the technical aspect of these matters straight. The technical arguments are important if the OBR's forecasts are to have the credibility that they ought to. I would be grateful if my noble friend could respond to those simple points so that we understand where we are going in the future. Perhaps he might point out to me where the assumptions are specified in the November document that was the first example of the OBR's work.</p>

<p><a name="1012064000017"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="1012064000087"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Peston suggested to me that I should follow the introduction of this group of amendments by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, by speaking now to Amendment 39. As noble Lords will be aware, this is simply an alternative means of achieving the objective that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, seeks.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000018"></a>One of the most important aspects of any piece of serious economic analysis is that it should be capable of being replicated. If the OBR's forecasts are to achieve the status that we on this side and, I presume, the Government hope for them, they must be capable of being replicated. This can be done only if full information is available at the time of publication.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000019"></a>The issue of replication is typically associated with the natural sciences, where replication of experiments is a fundamental requirement of any empirical scientific statement. However, the Minister may be unaware that it is now standard practice for any article published in a leading applied economics journal to provide the electronic address at which the data and other relevant information required to replicate the results in the article are available. In these days of large datasets and complex econometric models, data accessibility is critical to effective peer review-even effective assessment of whether any analysis or forecast should be taken seriously.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC5"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column GC5</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000020"></a>Amendment 39, in my name and the names of my noble friends Lord Davies and Lord Myners, will ensure that effective appraisal of OBR forecasts and other economic analyses are possible. As is made clear in the preface to the OBR report that we discussed last week, compiling the fiscal forecast requires detailed information from many government departments. That is why our amendment refers not only to data and methods but to costings, which the OBR are required by the charter to confirm. In other words, all the raw materials on the basis of which judgments have been made and forecasts have been constructed should be available for objective assessments of those forecasts to be made. This will not involve any significant extra burden on the staff of the OBR, since the data and costings must already have been assembled in electronic form for the OBR to do its work.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, raised an interesting point about the model that might be used by the OBR. We have been told that the Treasury will retain its own forecasting unit. We would like to know whether the forecasting model to be used by the this unit is to be the same as the model used by the OBR, in which case any differences in forecasts would simply be matters of judgment. That would surely be a ridiculous duplication. It would be much better to develop alternative perspectives, since they can often throw fresh light on difficult problems.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000022"></a>In supporting the general line that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has taken, I simply add that we want to be in a position where serious researchers can replicate the approach and findings of the OBR in order to be able to evaluate them effectively.</p>

<p><a name="1012064000023"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="1012064000088"></a>Lord Peston:</b> My Lords, noble Lords will be aware from my remarks last time in Committee that I would not have set up an OBR. I regard it as a waste of public money, to be perfectly honest, but I entirely accept that we are going to have an OBR, since the Government have a majority in the other place and in practice seem to have a majority in your Lordships' House. Therefore, I entirely agree with my noble friend Lord Eatwell that, if we are going to have such a body, we might as well make it a better one, rather than a worse one. Therefore, we have a duty to scrutinise the proposed legislation and come up with a variety of suggestions, in the hope of persuading the Minister that we could make a better fist of it than the Government have done so far. There I echo the remarks of my noble friend.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000024"></a>On this group of amendments, I repeat something that I said last week. The OBR's November economic and fiscal outlook report produced a series of forecasts that are not based on any recognisable or explicitly stated economic theory. This is forecasting without theory, which is slightly different from forecasting without a model, although the two are connected.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000025"></a>I have found it difficult to discover from the economic and fiscal outlook report what assumptions the OBR has made-and, presumably, will continue to make-about the way in which the economy works. The central issue as far as serious economics is concerned is whether it is assuming that the economy is a self-adjusting mechanism that will come to a full employment equilibrium-the kind of assumption that what I regard  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as obsolete economics used to make-or whether it is taking for granted, first, that the economy will not come to an equilibrium at all or, secondly, that there are multi-equilibriums and it does not know where the economy is going to go. Whatever the case, many believe that, wherever it settles, it is most unlikely to settle at anywhere recognisable as a place of full employment.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000026"></a>On a related matter about the facts and how seriously we should take the OBR forecasts as they are now, we have available, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, pointed out, the immensely helpful survey published by the Treasury of all the independent forecasts, to which I shall refer further on Report. I have analysed the independent forecasts statistically and it is interesting to note that, given the averages, standard deviations and the other statistical criteria, the forecasts of the OBR and the independent forecasters for 2010 and 2011 are much in step. However, it is extraordinarily interesting to note that the OBR forecast for 2012-that GDP will grow at 2.6 per cent per annum and will continue to grow at that kind of rate-is remarkably optimistic compared with the forecasts of the independent forecasters; it is statistically significantly different. The OBR has not discussed this matter, nor have outside commentators, but your Lordships-we shall return to this issue on Report-have to ask how the OBR has come up with this optimistic view.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000027"></a>There was a time when the Conservative Party believed in the free market-those days seem long gone-and would have taken it for granted that, as the independent forecasters overwhelmingly are in the business of making money from accurate forecasting, they have a tremendous incentive to forecast accurately. Therefore, if one had a choice, one's normal inclination would be to say, "If you believe in the free market, you will choose the free market forecasts as opposed to the OBR's forecasts". We shall return later to the significant issue of the optimistic OBR forecast for 2012 against the rather more pessimistic forecasts of the independent forecasters.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000028"></a>There may be two good explanations for the difference: first, many of the independent forecasters do not look that far ahead and we may have a biased sample of what we get from the Treasury; and, secondly, the OBR may have more information-for example, it may be better advised on government policy-than the independent forecasters. I am not saying that necessarily the OBR is mistaken; I am saying that the difference is, from any analytical and statistical point of view, noteworthy.</p>

<p><a name="1012064000029"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="1012064000089"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, I, too, speak in favour of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. Unlike my noble friend Lord Peston, I am in favour of the OBR. However, I share with my noble friend some anxieties about whether we need another set of economic forecasts. We should warrant another set of forecasts, in particular if the Treasury is going to produce its own, only if those from the OBR prove to be better and more accurate than those produced by commercial forecasters and other bodies. Therefore, it is important that we are able to analyse the forecasts made by the OBR, in order to understand the logic behind them and the assumptions that have been employed. That

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000030"></a>I have one question for the Minister. He has advised us that HMT will continue to produce its own economic forecasts. However, he has criticised HMT's forecasts on the grounds of their accuracy and the spin placed on them by politicians. If he believes that HMT was leant on by politicians, it would be interesting to hear some examples, because during my 18 months in government I saw no evidence of Treasury forecasts underlying government policy being influenced in any way by politicians. The Minister has also criticised the amount of content of HMT's published forecasts, including the fact that HMT did not publish forecasts for unemployment. Will he confirm that in future HMT will publish a full and comprehensive set of its own economic forecasts, which will in particular include forecasts for employment and unemployment?</p>

<p><a name="1012064000031"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="1012064000090"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> My Lords, this discussion has been interesting because it confirms how much material the OBR has already published, in its economic and fiscal outlook and alongside it, which enables us to have a richer discussion than we might ever have had in the past. I am grateful that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, is nodding. We have made considerable strides. I do not want to rake over old ground, as the noble Lord, Lord Myners, provokes me into doing, but we must keep coming back to the point that he makes by implication-namely, that we have employment and other forecasts in the 150-page economic and fiscal outlook document. We have many pieces of data that we did not have before and we will continue to have them in future.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000032"></a>I hope that we all agree that there is a huge amount of additional transparency. We have fan charts and all sorts of other things that make clear the basis on which the forecasts have been produced. These forecasts are in no way made or influenced by Ministers or their political advisers. I think that we all agree that transparency is at the root of what we are trying to achieve.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000033"></a>The amendments in this group seek to ensure that the OBR publishes the assumptions, economic analysis, data, methods and costings that it uses to compile its reports. We believe that that is absolutely achieved in the design of the structure that we have put forward. The OBR will have a statutory duty to act transparently. Chapter 4.8 of the charter states that,</p>
<ul><a name="1012064000074"></a>"the OBR is to act openly, setting out with clarity the assumptions and judgements that underpin its work. It should proactively seek to make available its analysis".</ul>
<p><a name="1012064000067"></a>Thus the general duty is in the Bill, which is backed up by the wording of the charter that expands on it.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000034"></a>We now have evidence from last Monday's document and the surrounding publications of the OBR about how it will do this in practice. Perhaps noble Lords have looked at the 20 Excel spreadsheets on the OBR's website. I suggest that these give convenient access to the forecast data in a way that has not remotely been done before. In addition to those spreadsheets, over 20 separate documents with supplementary information have been published by the OBR since August.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC8"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column GC8</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000035"></a>One of the tests of whether this meets the legitimate demands of the most sophisticated external forecasting bodies is what the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted earlier this year, which is that the OBR had by that stage already published more detail than ever before on the assumptions underlying its forecasts and on the impact that changes in those assumptions would have on revenues and spending. We have made a significant step change. A lot of the information is available in electronic form. The construct of the Bill plus the charter achieves what we all want from this.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000036"></a>I turn to the specific points raised, particularly by my noble friend. The OBR has complete discretion over the model that it uses and what methods go around the modelling. In its recent economic and fiscal outlook report, the OBR had already made some adjustments to the methods that it used in June, so it is moving the way in which it has adopted the Treasury model. The Treasury will continue to retain economic and fiscal forecasting expertise because ultimately Ministers need to be supported by a forecasting capability. That will include the possibility of the Treasury continuing to use its own model, but the official forecasts will be those of the OBR.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000039"></a>On the specific question of the ITEM Club and the model, the club will no longer have a statutory right to be given a copy of the Treasury model because that arose from the Industry Act 1975, which is being repealed. It will be for the Treasury to consider whether it continues to make the model available, but that will not be a statutory matter any more.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000040"></a>On how the arrangements between the OBR, the Treasury and other parts of government work, that will be set out in the memorandum of understanding, including use of the Treasury economic model, although of course it is entirely at the discretion of the OBR as to what tools, models and methods it uses.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000041"></a>On the question of where the assumptions are to be found, I can certainly find them littered throughout the document published last week, including, for example, table 3.6 on page 67, which as I read it is a mixture of inputs and outputs. There are other assumptions made right through the document.</p>

<p><a name="1012064000042"></a>On the critical question of the approach to economic forecasting raised by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, that is summarised in paragraph 3.7 on page 28. I am glad that people find the Treasury monthly report on the latest independent forecasts useful. It is intended that the Treasury will continue to publish that document and make it available on the Treasury website.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000043"></a>I think that the construct between the Bill and the charter covers all the issues on transparency, something that we all seek, and I suggest that the evidence so far of the OBR in practice means that we should have confidence in that construct. On that basis, I ask my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000045"></a>The point that has come up several times in our discussions concerns the balance between the Bill and the charter. The charter can be changed readily, as it is not primary legislation. We must give careful consideration to whether, for example, transparency as defined in the charter gives a sufficiently strong underpinning to the need to reveal information, or whether statements such as those in the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, or in those proposed by me and my noble friends, should be in the Bill. This has come up several times. It is an issue that we should take away and consider carefully before Report. Where should we strike the balance between an explanatory charter that gives guidance to the OBR and the statutory requirements? I do not have a firm opinion. However, on this issue I lean toward the idea that it should be in the Bill rather than in content that could later be amended. Of course, it would have to be put before Parliament-we know the charter procedure-but it can be changed. If we really care about this, perhaps we should put it in a form that cannot later be changed. This is a matter for future consideration.</p>

I will come back to an obvious and fundamental one. I am still not in the least clear why we will have both an OBR forecast and an official one from the Treasury that will be useful for Ministers. I simply do not understand this.</p>

<p><a name="1012064000047"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="1012064000095"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> Perhaps I may clarify that. There will be one official forecast, which the OBR will produce. The Treasury will retain a modelling and forecasting capability, but it is absolutely not the intention, and will not be the case, that there will be another official forecast from the Treasury. Ministers simply require the Treasury to retain that capability, so that if, in circumstances that we do not at all anticipate, the Chancellor or the Treasury want to take a different view from that of the OBR, they will retain the capability of doing so. There is absolutely no intention that there should be anything other than one published forecast, which will be put out by the OBR.</p>

If the Treasury is going to disagree, or at least have the capability of disagreeing, with a forecast put forward by the OBR, how can it do that other than on the basis of a forecast of its own? I note that the word "published" was slipped into the Minister's final sentence. Surely if the Treasury is going to have the capability of assessing and disagreeing with the OBR model, it must have some forecast of its own.</p>

I simply do not understand what the purpose of this forecast is going to be. Perhaps I may expand on that for a moment. We had an official forecast and we presume that the Government will operate on that basis, but apparently there is to be an internal forecast on which Ministers will base their decisions. The noble Lord is shaking his head.</p>

There will be the forecast of the OBR, but that does not mean that the Treasury should not have the capability to-and it will-look at underlying assumptions on which the forecast is based, to make sure that it understands where the OBR is coming from and feels comfortable with it. There  will not be some other internal official forecast; there will merely be a capability within the Treasury-and it is important that there should be such a capability-whereby Treasury officials can look at and understand the assumptions on which the OBR's forecast is made. That will not require, and there is no intention for, the Treasury to produce any separate forecast of its own.</p>

One of the corollaries of having an OBR that is properly independent and that we are all jolly keen to see in a separate building, with staff who are not too intertwined with the Treasury, is that the Treasury will have given away the ability to make some its own appraisals of the economic position. Clearly, it cannot leave itself completely denuded. It would be frankly ludicrous if, in setting up the OBR as a completely independent body to inform the public debate and to be the official forecaster, as my noble friend the Minister has repeatedly said, we left the Treasury with no internal capability to judge for itself whether or not it was happy with what was coming out of the OBR. It would therefore be entirely logical for the Treasury to retain some forecasting capability. In extremis, the Treasury may wish to rest its judgments on its internal forecasts, rather than those produced by the independent OBR, but even without those extreme conditions the Treasury will need to be satisfied that what is coming from the OBR is fit for the purpose of decision-making.</p>

The OBR will produce two forecasts a year. Between them, data will emerge, conditions will change and all kinds of things could happen in the world at large. The Treasury will need to take a view during that period of whether or not the events that are unfolding are consistent with the forecasts. The Treasury will want to prepare for future announcements of one kind or another. It is hugely important that it retains the capacity to monitor what is happening to the economy in the mean time, to make an assessment of whether unfolding events are consistent with the OBR's previous forecast and to prepare itself for the work that continually goes on. One of my worries throughout the establishment of the OBR has been that some capacity within the Treasury will inevitably be required if the Treasury is to continue to do the job that it does month by month. The Treasury has to prepare Ministers for speeches, answering questions and making observations on whether or not the economy is evolving in the way that it thought. The idea that there should be no capacity left in the Treasury to make this kind of analysis is frankly unrealistic.</p>

However, confusion was introduced into the discussion by references to a Treasury model and forecasts, which puzzled us all, as opposed to having a capacity to critique and develop the modelling of the OBR.</p>

<p><a name="1012064000056"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="1012064000104"></a>Lord Higgins:</b> My Lords, I understand the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Burns, and I should like to think further about what has been said on this issue.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000057"></a>Perhaps I may raise a further point in relation to the model. Over the past 80 or 90 years, we have had a huge difference of view as to whether one should adopt a Keynesian or a monetarist approach to these problems. My impression is that the OBR now has an essentially Keynesian approach and that the monetary aspect does not appear in the discussion at all, other than to say, "Well, of course, the Bank of England is targeting inflation", and let it go at that. However, as I have previously pointed out to the noble Lord, Lord Myners, and others, until we got into quantitative easing the Bank was concerned purely about the price of money-the rate of a single rate of interest-rather than the quantity of money.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000058"></a>I am not the least bit clear about the proposal as it now comes here and to what extent the OBR is taking monetary factors into account. Let me illustrate this by giving an example from many years ago. I am delighted to see that the basic approach to economic forecasting on page 28 is to decide on how much excess capacity there is and then to see to what extent aggregate demand gradually increases and absorbs that excess capacity. That was precisely the policy that we adopted in 1970 under the Heath Government. We said then, in the clearest terms, exactly what is being said now on page 28. Unfortunately, this was misinterpreted as a dash for growth and we were absolutely pilloried by those who said that the money

In fact there was a big difference between the money supply, the money supply figures and what was happening to aggregate demand. The point that I am seeking to make is that this does not take into account the effect of quantitative easing, for example, or, if it does, I am not clear where that would appear in these forecasts, although no doubt the Minister can enlighten us.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000059"></a>Given that we are told that the Bank of England is going to make yet a third, quite different, forecast in addition to the, I am almost inclined to say, surreptitious one in the Treasury-I accept fully the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Burns-I am worried that the fiscal and monetary side is not sufficiently integrated in the forecasts.</p>

<p><a name="1012064000060"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="1012064000105"></a>Lord Myners:</b> Further forecasts on the economy are made in government. I believe that the Department for Business also produces its own economic forecasts. Almost as many forecasts are produced in government as are produced in the private sector.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000061"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, makes an important point. This might not be the right forum in which to discuss this, but the balance of intent behind the decisions currently being made by the Monetary Policy Committee is more focused on the words that come after "and subject to that" in its remit than on controlling inflation-that is to say that, in an environment in which fiscal policy is reducing demand in the economy, the onus for sustaining demand is coming from monetary policy, with considerable risk, in my judgment, of inflation.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="1012064000062"></a>There is no recognition in the Keynesian thinking of this document about the importance of monetary policy. We have what the Americans call a saltwater analysis of economics rather than the freshwater or Chicago school analysis associated with the monetarist view.

However well intentioned or even self-critical an organisation might be, it is inevitable that self-assessment embodies a number of allowances, or perhaps things taken for granted that have become embedded in the organisation and are not made explicit, with the result that the sources of any underperformance are not articulated as clearly as they might otherwise be. That is why the provision in the Bill for self-assessment is ultimately unconstructive and even damaging to the reputation of the OBR. Far better to have an external assessment-I will propose a form of external assessment later-that confronts all aspects of the forecasting, such as methods, data, sources, judgments and presentation. The greater credibility and novel insights of such an independent appraisal would enhance both the performance and the reputation of the OBR. The self-assessment procedure is unsatisfactory and it would be a great help if this provision were removed from the Bill by our acceptance of Amendment 23. I beg to move.</p>

I stick by that view, for the reasons that the noble Lord has given. However, I cannot support his amendment because, without another amendment, it would take out of the Bill a requirement for any assessment of the accuracy of OBR forecasts. I do not understand why the noble Lord has not grouped this amendment with later ones that would set up a peer review committee to perform this function. It would be a retrograde step simply to take out of the Bill a requirement for an analysis of the accuracy of the OBR's fiscal and economic forecasts. I would rather have an unsatisfactory review than none at all.</p>

No doubt we shall come to the question of whether there is any other way of doing it later, when I might not be quite so keen on what she has to say. However, I certainly agree with her that it would be inappropriate to remove the requirement for an assessment of the accuracy of the forecasts. It is an important requirement that there should be such an assessment-</p>

They are going to be experts and qualified economists. Quite independent of what is in this Bill, if the forecasting is not working well, they will ask themselves why they got it wrong. There is no need for a requirement here unless you assume that a bunch of morons is going to be appointed to the OBR. If you get a forecast wrong, you immediately ask why you got it wrong. Why is there a need for a requirement to do something that would be a normal way of working?</p>

Where there was a strong wish to put certain things into the Bill that were not there, now it is being said that it is blindingly obvious that the OBR would assess its own performance, so no provision is needed. What goes in the Bill and what does not are matters of judgment. It is my view that this is a sufficiently important matter to justify being included. The noble Lord, Lord Peston, will no doubt be comforted by that, because he has already played back to me the fact that the OBR has stated in its document, <I>Analysis of </I><I>Past Forecasting Performance</I>, that it is,</p>
<ul><a name="1012065000023"></a>"fully committed to transparency, and each year will produce a full and detailed report analysing the accuracy of its economy and fiscal forecasts, and explaining the differences between forecast and outturn".</ul>
<p><a name="1012065000018"></a>It goes on to talk about giving further detail on its forecast methodologies. The office is going to do this anyway and I would like to think that it would be done without the Bill requiring it. However, it is sufficiently important that there should be absolutely no doubting the fact that it will be done.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="1012065000008"></a>This is not something that of itself is easy to do. The analysis of forecasting requires fiscal forecasting skills that are in scarce supply. To make the assessment requires access to and full understanding of the data. Critical to the whole process is that actually doing the assessment yourself makes it a learning experience. That goes to the heart of why Mr Chote and his team will do it anyway. We certainly expect to see the OBR doing this and the office has said that it will. However, in the Government's view the requirement should be on the face of the Bill. In the absence of a discussion that we have not yet had about alternative approaches, I suggest that this is where we need to leave it. For the moment, therefore, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

Everything that I have heard so far this afternoon in these brief debates confirms to me why my noble friend Lord Peston and I have been right to wonder whether the huge expense of setting up the whole of the OBR is worth it. In particular, this amendment relates to the whole issue and is central to it. Indeed, the only person whom I have heard using the word "audit" in relation to this 150-page OBR report is the Chancellor. He is worth quoting. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1012065000022"></a>"I can confirm to the House that the OBR and its new chair, Robert Chote, have audited all the annually managed expenditure savings in today's statement".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/10/10; col. 949.]</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="1012065000015"></a>My experience of auditing is now a bit out of date. Indeed, once you become a major partner in an audit firm, particularly a senior partner, you do not do a lot of actual auditing. Yet I did a little before that and I am bound to say that, when you give a clear audit certificate, there are no exceptions to it. How on earth can you give an audit certificate in relation to the OBR report? The fact is that it is just not possible to give a wholly unqualified audit certificate in relation to the OBR report. Perhaps I might give one or two examples of why it is impossible.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC16"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column GC16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="1012065000016"></a>The words "uncertain" and "uncertainty" go right through this report. Quite obviously, I am not blaming the OBR for that. If you are making, as it is, forecasts and assessments, there is bound to be uncertainty. It quite rightly admits that openly. It is not worth quoting all the examples when there are so many of them, but it refers, in the case of the central forecast, to significant uncertainty. Now if, in your report, you have a significant uncertainty that relates to the whole of the report, how on earth can the Chancellor say that everything that it has said is right and that it is all audited? Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, can tell me what it means. It is not clear to me. It is nowhere in the report, but it was at the heart of the Chancellor's Statement introducing the comprehensive spending review. He said that the OBR had "audited" the annually managed expenditure savings. In fact, the OBR report refers very often to "estimates". I assume that it will be accepted that you cannot audit an estimate. Page 25 talks about an "equal likelihood" of growth being up or down-it could be all kinds of things. To say that there has been an audit is clearly nonsense. It is done solely to let the public know that this great new independent OBR is giving the Chancellor an overall audit. However, it has not given him an audit, because it cannot. The report states that it is "difficult to draw conclusions", but the Chancellor says that there has been an audit. The report says that there are "expectations of interest rates"-I wish that the Chancellor would give me some examples of expectations that could be audited; I have never heard of one. I have not come across anybody who can give me a certain forecast of interest rates for tomorrow, let alone for five years, but those "expectations" are central to the forecast, which itself is significantly uncertain.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="1012065000017"></a>I worry about Robert Chote, who has taken on the job of chair of the OBR. It is clear that he is an independently minded man who did a great job with the Institute for Fiscal Studies. However, he is allowing the Chancellor to use him. I am very sorry to see it. The Chancellor is using the respected independence of Robert Chote, and now the OBR, to say what a great job he is doing. That is very worrying, because there is a clear danger of the very perception of the independence of the OBR being undermined. I have quoted previously from the foreword to the OBR's 150-page document, but it is worth doing so again. It states that,</p>
<ul><a name="1012065000024"></a>"we have also drawn heavily on the help and expertise of officials across government".</ul>
<p><a name="1012065000019"></a>It then lists the many government departments whose expertise has been used. Despite having asked Questions, I still have not heard from the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, or from anybody else how often, either formally or informally, the OBR has met the Chancellor and his colleagues. It is not unimportant to know these things. It is all part of the very perception of the OBR. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, will at least see that it is important to accept the amendment, because it goes to the heart of the independence of the OBR, which the Government want to have us believe. I find it hard to believe. I am sorry that the Government are using-I use the word carefully-Robert Chote and his colleagues to give the Chancellor the aura of being right, when it is clear that they cannot do so and are not doing so. I beg to move.</p>

The Statement made by my right honourable friend the Chancellor, to which the noble Lord referred, spoke of an audit of the annual managed expenditure savings. It was not an audit of anything other than one part of the totality of the package that my right honourable friend announced last month. The noble Lord has extrapolated from a relatively small use of the word "audit" into something much bigger that is not justified.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="10120612000002"></a>I agree, in a sense, that people such as myself, my noble friend the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, who have an accounting background, tend to think that the term "audit" is reserved for this statutory audit function, has a very specific meaning and applies only to the audit of financial statements. However, the term means only "independent examination", and in that sense I do not see any reason why the figure should not be used.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="10120612000003"></a>However, I say to the noble Lord that even when considering the audit of annual financial statements, those statements contain loads of assumptions and forecasts. To do an impairment review, you have to forecast cash flows for 10 years and choose discount rates and things such as that to calculate the figure that you put on your balance sheet. For your pension liabilities, you have to do even more complex calculations involving even more assumptions about the future. So even "audit" has to deal with these difficult areas of future estimation, even within the concept of statutory audit.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="10120612000004"></a>It would be helpful if the Treasury were to be reminded that the term "audit" has a rather technical meaning; it would be better to say something like "has independently examined". Perhaps the Minister could take back to the Treasury that its lexicon could have that amendment added. I come back to my basic point, though, that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, has gone a little over the top on this amendment.</p>

Perhaps I should declare my interest as a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. There is certainly a technical use of the word "audit" that we chartered accountants and other accountants are used to using. As my noble friend Lady Noakes has explained, my right honourable friend was using a more general use of the term. The Chancellor used the phrase in the very specific context of,</p>
<ul><a name="10120612000050"></a>"audited all the annually managed expenditure savings".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/10/10; col. 949.]</ul>
<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="10120612000006"></a>To be clear, there is no question of the OBR doing an audit in the sense used by, say, the National Audit Office. In the context in which my right honourable friend used the word "audit", it is completely clear that he was talking about scrutiny of those particular savings, as set out in the terms of reference given to the OBR when it scrutinised the Government's policy costings. If the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, wants clarity on the meaning of the word, the terms of reference are clear.</p>

As I say, all those details are on the OBR's website for people to look at.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="10120612000008"></a>The clarity over the OBR's role is provided for through the provisions in the Bill and the charter. There is no intention for the OBR to do an audit in the technical sense of the word. I hope that it has been useful to have had this short discussion to clarify that that is indeed the situation and, having agreed that, I do not think that we need to clutter up the Bill in the way that the amendment proposes. On the basis that it is not strictly necessary, I ask the noble Lord if he might withdraw it.</p>

If it would help the noble Lord, I can read out the key paragraph of the terms of reference for the Office for Budget Responsibility. Paragraph 4, entitled "Economic and fiscal forecasts", states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10120612000044"></a>"The Spending Review will allocate spending between departmental expenditure and annually managed expenditure within the envelope set at the June Budget.

I do not want to know the form; I want to see the actual scrutiny. Nothing in the big document includes that scrutiny. The Chancellor claimed, using the Minister's words, that the OBR had scrutinised all these expenditure savings. I should like to see the document which says, "We looked at this and this is our analysis". I want to see the scrutiny; I do not want to know how the office did it. I want to know that it was actually done. I have not the faintest idea of where to look for this scrutiny, but it is not in the big document-which is what I call it because I cannot remember its name. Where is it?</p>

If the OBR had any questions about the AME numbers, it would litter its document with commentary on it. However, it is quite clear from the terms of reference given to the office by the Treasury that it was required to and did scrutinise the AME numbers and was free to make any comments it felt like making on them.</p>

I am trying to imagine in my mind's eye the 12 or so employees of the OBR scrutinising annually managed expenditure. I am trying to imagine how they would look at the AME of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, let alone its subdivisions, or the AME of the Department for Work and Pensions. Can the Minister at least give us a flavour of how that work was conducted? That would whet our appetites before we see the full information on the website, as he has assured us we can.</p>

It is for them to say how they carried out their remit, and if the question has not been answered satisfactorily by the information already published on the website, I am sure that they would be happy to respond to further questions.

The Chancellor described this as an audit. He went beyond the language used by the OBR. We are asking the Minister of the Crown, based in the Treasury, to give us a sense of how this scrutiny was conducted. I am beginning to feel that the Minister does not know the answer. If that is the case, it would be helpful if he said, "I have no idea how this was scrutinised", after which the Committee could form its own view.</p>

The small phrase in the announcement made by my right honourable friend the Chancellor that there has been an audit of the AME savings is being considerably overinterpreted. As my noble friend suggested, it would be helpful if Mr Robert Chote were asked to say how he conducts this aspect of his work. I am sure that if there are then further questions that noble Lords wish to raise, they will be able to. It would be helpful if my noble friend references any material that is already publicly available. However, it is not reasonable to go beyond that this afternoon.</p>

If it does, that would be very disturbing and unfortunate: it would be like an old Soviet election. We would expect a degree of disagreement-perhaps not much, but a bit-which would give us confidence in the scrutiny process. It would be helpful if the Minister would tell us whether in the scrutiny process the agreement was 100 per cent or rather less.</p>

Of course the OBR scrutiny, as the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, acknowledged just now, will be based on challenging the assumptions underpinning the AME costings. How it then formed the judgments that it did is for the office, not me, to interpret. However, I am happy to point noble Lords towards what has been published and see whether there is anything else that the OBR thinks would be helpful to say on the matter after the discussion this afternoon. Clearly, the OBR will not sign off on its scrutiny of AME savings if it does not think that the methodology and the numbers are reasonable.</p>

I submitted a Written Question to the Minister asking when the OBR scrutinised these particular points. The Answer stated that the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, passed my question to Robert Chote, who quickly gave me an answer. He referred in particular to chapter 3 of the 150-page document. I went through chapter 3 very carefully. Like the noble Lord, Lord Peston, I could not see in the whole of the chapter any details about scrutiny-far from it. Chapter 3.2 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10120612000045"></a>"This is our central projection, or in other words, we believe there is an equal likelihood that growth will turn out to be higher or lower than we forecast".</p>

<p><a name="10120612000041"></a>How do you scrutinise that? Or perhaps you should audit it. Or perhaps I have been going over the top, as the noble lady, Baroness Noakes, said. If I really wanted to go over the top, noble Lords on the Committee would know that they have heard nothing yet.</p>

<p><a name="10120612000022"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, seems to think that she is still sitting on the Front Bench. I do not mind that. She was very good on the Front Bench. Occasionally she got it right. However, today she tells me that I am over the top. I wish someone, perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, would explain where I am over the top. I have said that Robert Chote is being used by the Treasury. That is undoubtedly the case, and all that this brief debate has done is emphasise that. Indeed, the Minister has still not replied, or perhaps he has accidentally overlooked replying, to my Question about how often since or before this report Robert Chote and his colleagues met the Chancellor and other Ministers.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, has now told us information that I confess I had not read on the website. It may be that every other Member of the Committee has read it on the website.</p>

Once again, Robert Chote is doing the job that the OBR is being set up to do-to tell the world how good the Treasury is. I had a little experience at the Treasury for five years. Officials are excellent, in my experience. I can see them over there, but they are not nodding, because they would not do that. The noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, can nod on their behalf. He is quite right; they are very good. I always found them to be excellent. However, that does not make the Chancellor right in saying all the things he says, either in introducing the comprehensive spending review or at any other time. I confess not only to being not over the top but to being too moderate in my remarks. I am very concerned.</p>

The key issue here, though, is to ensure that Mr Robert Chote and his two fine colleagues on the committee of the Office for Budget Responsibility are not put in a place where their words are taken to be saying more than they actually do.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="10120612000030"></a>As noble Lords know, I continue to express support for the creation of the OBR and of the appointment of Mr Chote and his two colleagues. I also commend the Government for the steps that they have taken to ensure that there is an independent process around appointments to the committee of the OBR. I regard the document published last week as being a significant improvement in financial governance in the country.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="10120612000031"></a>It is therefore perhaps somewhat churlish to say, "This is all very good but perhaps we should have a little more", but there was one thing missing last week in the Chancellor's Statement to another place. He put a lot of spin, to use tabloid language, on the OBR statement. He is not the first Chancellor to do that; his predecessor but one was particularly prone at times of the Budget and the Pre-Budget Report to putting spin on information contained in the Budget-indeed, to the point of often forgetting to mention things that were in the Budget which were subsequently regarded as being very important. I would not want to see the OBR used in the same way.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="10120612000032"></a>The purpose of my amendment is to seek to ensure that, when the report of the committee of the Office for Budget Responsibility is produced for Parliament by the Chancellor or by a Treasury Minister, there is a reasonable test of the completeness and the accuracy with which the report is described to Parliament. As the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, has already indicated, the report last week is replete with language about uncertainties, such as fan charts and the use of terminology to suggest probabilities and risks around central forecasting.</p>
<h5><a name="10120612000054"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="10120612000033"></a>Indeed, the Minister, in answering questions in the House and in other interjections, has referred on many occasions to significant improvements in the form of presentation including, in particular, the use of fan charts. Yet in the Statement made in the other place by the Chancellor, as repeated in our own House by the Minister, we were given the sense that this was an endorsement, a seal of approval, for the Government's economic strategy. There was little or no any mention of any of the risks and uncertainties around forecasts, and no sense of a complete picture. For instance, the OBR is clear that over the next few years there will be a significant squeeze on real incomes. The difference between the projected rate for the RPI and the rate at which earnings are to increase is significantly negative over the next few years. There was not a single word of mention about that factor, which is very important for many families in this country, in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Statement to the other place.</p>

<p><a name="10120612000034"></a>I am being fair and honest in my observation that I believe that his predecessor but one may well have been inclined to give a similarly high-level summary of the content of the OBR report, but I suggest that if the OBR was in a position to say that it did not believe that the way in which its conclusion was presented to Parliament represented a fair, balanced and complete presentation, that would be a significant endorsement of the independence of the OBR and would protect it from the danger that my noble friend Lord Barnett cited earlier-namely, that the committee of the OBR, in its naivety, may be used by politicians to project a different set of conclusions from those which the committee had in mind. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="10120612000035"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew64"></a><a name="10120612000078"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords, I am sure that all noble Lords wish that Chancellors were models of balance and completeness in the way in which they present figures, but the noble Lord, Lord Myners, is placing an unrealistic burden on the OBR if he expects it to undertake this task. For example, he uses the word "balance"; balance is not an objective fact but, to a considerable extent, is a subjective view. That goes equally for "completeness"-at what point does the failure to refer to the paragraphs on page 73 in the OBR report render the Chancellor's statement incomplete? When the Chancellor has made a political speech on the economy, to expect the chair of the OBR to audit it, to coin a phrase, in some way as the noble Lord suggests is, frankly, impossible. While I agree with the sentiments behind the amendment, I do not think that it is workable.</p>

<p><a name="10120612000036"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew65"></a><a name="10120612000079"></a>Lord Burns:</b> My Lords, I support the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Newby. The noble Lord, Lord Myners, knows that what he is asking for is impossible; we also know that he can be very good at creating a little bit of mischief every now and again and we have to see this amendment in that light.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="10120612000037"></a>The OBR can be responsible only for its own documents; it cannot possibly hold the Chancellor to account. That is a job for Parliament, including the Treasury Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee. I can think of nothing that would make the job of the OBR more impossible than to give it a task that began to resemble this. The key thing is that the OBR has to be kept out of the political debate but the noble Lord, Lord Myners, implies that he would like to plunge it directly into that debate. I am sure he has used the amendment as a vehicle to make quite sensible points about some of the practices that occur from time to time, but the OBR will not protect us from those.</p>

I offer no view, but agree completely with the noble Lord, Lord Burns, and with my noble friend Lord Newby, that his amendment would widen the OBR's remit into completely inappropriate and vastly different territory from that covered by the Bill. The very focused remit in the Bill covers forecasts and the sustainability of the fiscal position. I noted that the  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC24"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column GC24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Lord, Lord Myners, talked about the OBR commenting on the presentation of its report by the Chancellor-which would be difficult, for the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord Burns-but his amendment goes much wider and is concerned with commenting on major economic statements, which covers a huge range of things well beyond the OBR's focus. I come back to the concerns that were expressed by noble Lords at Second Reading about the critical importance of the impartiality of the OBR. For example, the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, said:</p>

<p><a name="10120612000043"></a>That is exactly where the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Myners, would take it-well beyond the sustainability of the public finances, which should be its remit. I ask him to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I have listened with great interest to the contributions of the noble Lords, Lord Newby and Lord Burns, and of the Minister. The Minister is correct that the wording of my amendment is very wide-wider than the OBR itself. However, I have often found it helpful in life to start wide, listen to the wise comments of others and narrow down. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, suggested that the word "balance" was capable of widely differing definitions, which would raise issues of implementation, and that possibly the phrase "absence of bias" might be better. I will reflect on that before Report. For the time being, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

What he emphasised most was the independence of the OBR and its ability to make up its own mind what it wants to do. I assume therefore that when I say it should be able to do this, he will get up and say that it can if it wants to. I do not think that I need to detain the Committee much longer, but I would like to hear the Minister confirm that the OBR can do what it wants. I beg to move.</p>

I agree absolutely that the OBR should have access to external expertise and that there should be appropriate transparency around this. The design of the OBR will allow it to have access to external expertise as it sees fit, and indeed the office held a range of discussions

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000002"></a>My only difficulty with the amendment is that the office would be required to publish the evidence taken from expert witnesses. I think that it should be for the OBR to determine what it thinks it is appropriate to publish. That is because we do not want to constrain freedom of exchange. The office has a general statutory duty to act transparently, within which context obviously it will think carefully about what it should publish. Further, although I hope that it will not be necessary, there is of course the backstop of the Freedom of Information Act to which the OBR is subject. I think we should leave it to the discretion of the OBR to choose to publish evidence from such experts as it consults.</p>

When I first looked at Clause 5(3), it seemed fairly straightforward. It states that if the Government's policies are relevant to the OBR's performance of its duties, the office should not look at any alternative policies; that is, it should not suddenly say, "We want to look at the policies of the Labour Party as well as those of the coalition and make a comparison between the two". That is what I understood it to say. The alternative proposed in one of the later amendments is rather more stringent than that, in that it effectively provides that the office should not look at any alternative policies at all, while the other amendment says that it should. So, in a sense, we have a choice. On balance, it is arguable that the Government, having reflected on this, came to the view that the OBR should not look at alternative policies, which might create a very confusing situation. Nevertheless, the subsection does seem to be unnecessarily restrictive.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000006"></a>To my surprise, during a discussion in our previous Grand Committee, it turned out that the clause was intended to do something quite other than what it appears in simple terms to do, and we had a lengthy discussion about that. I still do not understand either what the amended interpretation was supposed to do or how it would do it. It would be helpful if the Minister could give us some idea of that now, or alternatively could consider the matter further. However, as it stands, the provision seems to be quite straightforward. I beg to move.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC26"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column GC26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="10120613000066"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="10120613000007"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew74"></a><a name="10120613000075"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> My Lords, when I prepared my speaking note for a discussion of this series of amendments to Clause 5(3), I wrote the following: "The intention behind Clause 5(3) is clear and sensible". I now realise how enormously wrong I was in that observation, because, following our discussion last week, to which the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has just referred, it is apparent that Clause 5(3) is neither clear nor sensible. These amendments give us at least an opportunity to talk around the issues and provide some material for the Government to help them to bring forward-as I hope and am confident they will-their own amendment to Clause 5(3).</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000008"></a>Amendment 31 was prepared when I thought I knew what the clause meant: that the OBR should focus on developing a successful forecasting methodology and applying it to the evaluation of government programmes alone, keeping out of the arena of political controversy. The noble Lord quoted me on that just now and I stand by my belief that it should be the case. Even on these grounds, the clause is not well drafted. As I pointed out at Second Reading, it might be possible to conceive of opposition policies that do not impinge on government policies. My example was of an employment programme for which funding had been secured from the European Union so that there was no impact on the Government's fiscal stance. Such a programme would not be an alternative but an addition to anything that the Government themselves were doing. Therefore, there is a degree of ambiguity as the clause stands.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000009"></a>My Amendment 31 seeks to eliminate this ambiguity by stating explicitly that in so far as OBR reports include an assessment of the impact of policies, reference should be made to government policies alone. I believe that my redraft of Clause 5(3) unwittingly achieves with far greater clarity what we now know the Government were hoping to do with their subsection, which is rather messy-indeed, hopeless-at the moment. It embodies the positive statement that government policies should be taken into account, which is what we were told it was supposed to do last time, and ensures by the use of "only" that policies emanating from elsewhere will not be part of the appraisal or forecasting activities. I think that I have actually cracked the Government's problem for them.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000010"></a>It will be evident from what I have said that I disagree with the goals of the amendments moved by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, which would take this out altogether, or tabled by my noble friends Lord Barnett and Lord Peston. I say that the OBR should focus on the Government alone and that it would be unfortunate if it were turned into a sort of policy referee. It might be possible if economic forecasting was a precise science, but it is not and there will always be a certain amount of judgment involved. It is not like a measuring rod with which you can say whether something is accurate. That is not what economic forecasting is about. At an appropriate time, I will move Amendment 31. I believe that the Government will bring forward something like this to solve the problems that we have identified in this part of the Bill.</p>

It may be that my amendment simply leaves open the question, but we really want to clear it up.</p>

<p><a name="10120613000012"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew76"></a><a name="10120613000077"></a>Lord Peston:</b> My Lords, I speak to Amendment 32, which is in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Barnett. When I first saw subsection (3), I must say that I was appalled, in particular by the words "may not consider". This body is supposed to be independent and, unless we are to get a new form of thought police brought in here, can presumably consider anything that it likes. That does not mean that it should be involved in a report on itself. However, to tell a group-at the moment, a group of three expert economists-that what it can think about is limited by an Act of Parliament is absolutely absurd. I draw the Committee's attention to what "may not consider" means; that you cannot even think or talk about something and that it has nothing to do with you. This is incompatible with the group's independence and professionalism. I wonder what serious, self-respecting economist would wish to work under those circumstances. I would not, under any circumstances, be willing to work and be told that. I can remember the sad old days in the Treasury when everybody was told that under no circumstances were we ever to discuss or use the word "devaluation". It did not have any effect: we just did it privately or secretly, and so on. That was the worst example of this that I can remember.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000013"></a>I was appalled by this subsection and I thought that taking out "not" was the best way of dealing with it. However, the method proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is better still: take out the whole subsection. It may well be that we could put in another clause of a more positive nature. It is perfectly obvious that the OBR's job is to consider the whole issue in the context of government policy, because, as the Minister has emphasised-although I slightly disagree with his logic-the OBR is not a decision-making body, it is just a forecasting body. I do not entirely accept that distinction, as noble Lords are aware, but I can at least see the Minister's position. I accept what my noble friend Lord Eatwell and others have said; that forecasting is the OBR's main role. There should not be a clause in what will eventually be a statute telling the OBR what it may consider, unless the meaning of "consider" in the English language has changed. My general view is that the approach of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, was much better than mine or that of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. We should remove subsection (3).</p>

I suggested, out of frustration, that we were spending too long on this form of words, which, in slightly more words, actually had the same purpose as Amendment 31. We did not spend any time looking at it, because we were considering the amendments in order. However, Amendment 31 is clear and achieves the purpose that we sought to achieve in our debate last time, which was that the OBR, in making its assessments, obviously should take account of government economic and other policies. Equally, in the context of the second part of the subsection, the OBR's role  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC28"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column GC28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should not be what the noble Lord, Lord Peston, thinks it would be. It should not be able to stray and look at anyone's alternative policies-that way madness lies. The OBR must have a straightforward remit to look at what the Government are proposing and work on the assumptions that the Government are making in their policies.</p>

<p><a name="10120613000015"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew78"></a><a name="10120613000079"></a>Lord Burns:</b> My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Newby. I had hoped that the purpose of the clause was to restrict the activities of the OBR to avoid it getting into political trouble. There are two clear cases where I could see this happening. One is where it is asked to continue a practice that has emerged in the past 20 or 30 years, whereby a Government ask the Treasury to cost the opposition manifesto as an election approaches. That practice has been divisive and has not suited anyone. I had hoped that this clause, by restricting the OBR to consideration of government policies, would prevent the Government or anyone else-for example, the Treasury Committee-asking it what the effect would be of implementing the Opposition's manifesto.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000016"></a>The second thing that I had hoped would be avoided was getting into the sort of detailed arguments that took place in the summer about what the effects of particular packages of measures would be on economic activity, unemployment, the PSBR and so on. The remit given to the OBR by the Bill, as I read it, is to tell us what the effect would be on public finances of a whole set of government policies, taking into account the world environment and everything else, and whether or not the Government are on a sustainable path as a result of that collection of policies. That remains very challenging and is what the OBR's job should be restricted to. It is set out early in the Bill. I had assumed that this clause was there to prevent encroachment, or a widening of the OBR's remit to include a number of other things, all of which would lead us into a difficult area of political activity.</p>

However, I also support the spirit of Amendment 31, although I am a little concerned about the use of "effects", which could in future give someone the opportunity to ask to have particular subsections of government measures analysed for their effects on the economic outcome and on the public finances. I worry that going down that road could cause problems in future.</p>

We have discussed all these related issues at some length. The noble Lord, Lord Burns, has got it pretty much spot on in terms of what we are trying to achieve, but for the avoidance of doubt I shall restate it.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000019"></a>With regard to the core forecasting remit, the intention is that the OBR should consider government policies and not other policies. To take the point made the other day by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, we want to ensure that the OBR can take account of external shocks, for example, so in technical drafting terms his amendment would not quite work as it focuses narrowly on policy. We agree, anyway, that it is the Government's policies and not other policies that need to be considered. We must not leave out the fact that, in doing the forecasts, the OBR can look at scenarios and at other issues.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000020"></a>With regard to the noble Lord's specific question about an EU-related policy, either it has been adopted by the UK Government and is therefore included in government policies or it is not. Either the EU policy example has been adopted as policy in the UK or it has not, therefore it falls accordingly. That would get picked up, so that much is clear. Equally, it is the clear intention that the OBR should not be drawn into costing alternative policies, whether they are opposition policies or just other scenarios or partial packages of policies. That is what is intended by the construct in the Bill, and part of it is clarified by paragraph 4.12  in the draft charter.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000021"></a>Even though I am convinced that the Bill achieves what most, if not all, of us are trying to achieve in these various respects, I take to heart the fact that we have spent a lot of time going around the interaction of Clauses 4 and 5(3) and, to an extent, the relationship with Clause 1. Notwithstanding the fact that I think that the Bill works as drafted, I am listening carefully to all the points being made. I will go away and see whether anything can be done to make it even clearer in the Bill what the intentions are. However, it is difficult drafting. We should certainly not take out Clause 5(3) in its entirety, because, as the noble Lord, Lord Burns, pointed out, we want to make sure not only that the forecasts are concentrated on the right thing but that the OBR is not drawn into other political controversies.</p>

<p><a name="10120613000022"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew81"></a><a name="10120613000082"></a>Lord Peston:</b> Can the noble Lord give one clarification on that? We all agree that, if we are going to have an OBR, we must keep it out of political controversy, but do the "government policies" to which he referred include the behaviour of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England?</p>

<p><a name="10120613000023"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew82"></a><a name="10120613000083"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> When I talk about government policies, I mean government policies. What assumptions the OBR makes about monetary conditions, interest rates and so on touches on an issue about which my noble friend Lord Higgins asked earlier. I have undertaken to relay his request to see whether Mr Chote wants to say any more about how the OBR considers monetary policy issues. Certainly, while I said that the OBR should consider government policies, there are lots of other things that it needs to consider. It is clear that it is making assumptions about interest rates and so on that are taken broadly from what the Bank of England lays out.</p>

However, there is a degree of consensus that Clause 5(3), as currently drafted, does not achieve it. When we have concluded Committee, I intend to write to the Minister about this matter and a number of others where I think that we have total consensus on what we want to achieve and even perhaps to suggest meetings prior to Report to sort it out. That way, everybody can be clear about and comfortable with what we shall in due course pass into law. Having said that, I really do not see how Clause 5(3) can survive as currently drafted but, given that we are now really clear about what we want to do, we can sort something out.</p>

<p><a name="10120613000031"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew91"></a><a name="10120613000092"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> My Lords, Amendment 36 refers to Clause 6(1)(b) and seeks to remove the attempt to qualify Clause 5(2). I begin by confessing that, on close inspection, my amendment is imperfectly drafted. I did not wish to eliminate any guidance that the charter might provide with respect to the beleaguered Clause 5(3) because guidance is certainly needed there. However, if Amendment 31-or something like it-appears on Report, the qualification of Clause 5(3) will be unnecessary. The core purpose of the amendment is to remove the ability of the Government to use the charter to qualify Clause 5(2).</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000032"></a>Noble Lords may think that the terms "objectively", "transparently" and "impartially" are perfectly well defined by the <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I> and that no further guidance or qualification is required and, if they examined the draft charter, they would find that they were absolutely right to think that. Taking just one of the words which one would think would be easy to understand, I invite noble Lords to consider the charter definition of "objectively". Paragraph 4.7 of the charter states that this means that,</p>
<ul><a name="10120613000065"></a>"the OBR should not analyse or comment on the particular merits of Government policy".</ul>
<p><a name="10120613000057"></a>The problem is that the philosophical issue has been pushed on to another word because we now need a definition of the word "merits", as I will illustrate.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000033"></a>In Clause 5(3), which we have toiled over for some time, the OBR is required-as we all agree-to consider government policies that are relevant to its forecasting duties. Let us suppose that the OBR demonstrates that a particular government policy results in an increase in unemployment-and one must give credit to the Government and to the OBR for now publishing unemployment forecasts-then, as it is universally accepted that unemployment is a bad thing, such an assessment will inevitably reflect on the merits of the policy. If it increases unemployment, that is a bad aspect of the policy and is a comment on its merits; it cannot be anything else. Therefore the definition of "objectively" has been qualified in such a manner that it no longer has the generally accepted meaning of the word.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000034"></a>If we accept the guidance of the charter, the OBR could not comment on what is happening to unemployment because employment and unemployment are universally accepted as merits and demerits. Trying to define these words is simply an exercise in exclusion and limitation. The words have clear, commonsense meanings. Moreover, as the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, told me earlier, the word "impartiality" in government circles has already been defined by the Committee on Standards in Public Life. A definition of the word exists in government life and it does not require another  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC32"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column GC32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>one. If the Treasury definition were contrary to that of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, that would be very disturbing.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000035"></a>The question is: why do we need this? The fundamental danger in Clause 6(1)(b) is the possibility of further guidance distorting the normal meaning of words that are fully understood in common parlance. It is far better to rely on commonsense in understanding these words. The lack of qualification gives them strength; any qualification would seriously weaken their value. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="10120613000036"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew92"></a><a name="10120613000093"></a>Lord Turnbull:</b> I support the amendment, at least in so far as it relates to Clause 5(2), for much the same reasons as those set out by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. These words are meant to be drawn either from the seven tenets of public life set by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, or from the synonyms for them in the Civil Service Code. If there is any amendment to be made it is that Clause 5(2) should bring the words used into line with the accepted vocabulary that is used in these other documents. You would then dispense with Clause 6(1)(b) as it relates to subsection (2).</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000037"></a>At Second Reading, the most telling criticisms that were made on an occasion where this initiative was largely welcomed, was the sense that independence was being granted with one hand by the Treasury and that another clause subtly began to claw it back, and that this somehow undermined the sense of true independence. We can dispense with this and, if any changes are desired, the wording of Clause 5(2) can be brought into line with the vocabulary that is used in these other statements of the values of public life.</p>

<p><a name="10120613000038"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew93"></a><a name="10120613000094"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> My Lords, I find this interesting because what the noble Lords, Lord Eatwell and Lord Turnbull, have said exemplifies why we need some back-up explanation of these terms in the charter. That must be the right place for it because the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, started by saying that we could rely on the <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I> definition of the three terms but then went on to refer to the usage given to the terms by the Committee on Standards in Public Life. That in itself points out that, even on his construction of how these words should be used, there are at least two sources. I have neither the <I>OED</I> nor the committee's statement in front of me, but I would be surprised if they were precisely the same. Then the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, referred to the Civil Service Code.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000039"></a>In arguing for the amendment, the noble Lords have precisely explained the difficulty that we are in: however you do it, you go back to different sources for the meaning of these important terms. It is therefore important in the charter to try to tease this out. I agree that this could be done in a number of ways; it could refer to the <I>OED</I>, the Civil Service or a number of other things. However, this discussion has reinforced my view that somewhere we need to provide some guidance.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000040"></a>I shall give the Committee another example, very much in this space, about the kind of difficulty that  we can otherwise get into, and this relates back to one of our previous discussions. The US Congressional Budget Office has an impartiality remit, but it defines  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC33"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column GC33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>"impartiality" to mean that it has to include analysis of policy proposals made by all political parties. I think that we all agreed earlier that that is precisely what we do not want the OBR to do, and that suggests to me that it is a reason why we need to give a bit of guidance in the charter for what the three critical terms mean. Indeed, Robert Chote himself, following questions on impartiality, told the Treasury Select Committee:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10120613000062"></a>"I think you want to make sure that the remit of the OBR is agreed ex ante, rather than the subject of a contentious debate ex post on whether it is doing what people want it to do ... if it is left to the OBR on its own to draw the line, there will always be people just below the line who will be disgruntled ... which will reflect on the OBR".</p>

<p><a name="10120613000058"></a>That was in the context of a wider discussion about the virtues of, and the need for, clarity.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000041"></a>Nothing is set out in the charter that can undermine the Bill. The guidance can relate only to functions conferred by the Bill; it cannot add to or distort them. Further, as we have noted, the charter must be approved by another place before it can come into effect. I have listened carefully to the debate, which has suggested to me that even those who say that we do not need the interpretation of the charter are actually using different definitions. I think that the charter is the right place in which to provide the OBR with the clarity that it quite rightly seeks. For that reason, and because the noble Lord admits that the amendment does not quite work technically, I ask him to withdraw it.</p>

<p><a name="10120613000042"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew94"></a><a name="10120613000095"></a>Lord Eatwell:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord. If we get Clause 5(3) right, it may work very well, but we have been chewing this matter over perhaps to excess. The Minister made one point about the issue of impartiality with respect to the Congressional Budget Office. While there is some relationship between the CBO and the OBR, the Congressional Budget Office is actually a creature of Congress. That is different from the OBR, which is a creature of the Executive. It means that we have a very different issue before us.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000043"></a>I am still disturbed by the definition of "objectively". As I pointed out, the notion of merit and demerit is rather difficult in and of itself, and therefore, in preparing for the final draft of the charter, I would like the Government to consider whether the word "merits" conveys exactly what they want it to.</p>

<p><a name="10120613000044"></a><b><a name="101206-gc0001.htm_spnew95"></a><a name="10120613000096"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> I am not sure whether this will help, but just to be clear, we are expecting the OBR to assess the impact of policies on forecasts. So there is no question of merits and demerits, other than that we are trying to exclude all questions of merit and demerit and keep to the factual impact of policies. I am struggling a bit with any suggestion that we are somehow dragging the OBR into considerations of merit or demerit. The noble Lord took the example of employment and unemployment. All we ask of the OBR is that it should tell us what the factual situation is and absolutely not to comment on its merits or demerits. There is no question of enormity of judgment by the OBR in this or any other respect.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000045"></a>The basic underlying language here is the same as that which applies to the National Audit Office in the National Audit Office Act 1983. That is what all we are trying to replicate in this respect, even though this is scrutiny and not audit.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC34"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column GC34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

One peculiarity in the drafting of this Bill and of the charter is that everything is defined in terms of negatives. What we have in the charter is that the OBR should not analyse or comment on the particular merits of something. Why not say what you mean by using words such as, "The OBR should analyse or comment only on the impacts of Government policy", as the Minister has just said? Why is everything defined in terms of the negative? Why can we not say what we want to achieve in positive terms?</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000047"></a>The other problem with this is that I give the Government enormous credit for incorporating Clause 5(2) in the Bill. They deserve tremendous credit for doing that. However, subsection (1) weakens it, not necessarily as presented now, but it provides an opening for future Governments to change this guidance. That is what we do not want. It is unfortunate that this qualifying subsection is incorporated in Clause 5(2), which is tremendously to the Government's credit.</p>

<a name="101206-gc0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="10120613000048"></a>I shall take away the Minister's comments and think about them. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="10120613000059"></a>The amendment seeks to delete the words "aim to" so that it reads, "The Office must carry out its functions efficiently and cost-effectively". There would be a loophole if the office could simply say that it was aiming to do this when it may not achieve that objective. More sensibly it should be mandated to operate efficiently and cost-effectively, otherwise it may overspend its budget by an enormous amount and say, "Do not worry, these are unforeseen circumstances. We aim to do it". I beg to move.</p>

However, in reality the amendment would not change in substance the requirement on the OBR because, if it was ever challenged on this point, the challenge would be subject to what it would have been reasonable for the OBR to have done.

<p><a name="10120613000051"></a>At the risk of the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, jumping up again, I have to say that this is the same as the requirement on the National Audit Office, as set out in Part 2. It is not necessarily a good defence; I merely observe-</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="1012062000003"></a><b><a name="101206-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="1012062000087"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord Freud):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and Minister for Disabled People (Maria Miller) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="1012062000004"></a>I am publishing today <I>Disability Living Allowance Reform</I>, a formal public consultation on our proposed reforms to disability living allowance (DLA).</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="1012062000005"></a>We are already undertaking large-scale reform of the welfare system, for example the universal credit and our flagship Work Programme. Our welfare reforms are designed to protect people in the most vulnerable situations, including disabled people. We remain steadfast in our support for the principles of DLA, as a non means-tested cash benefit contributing to the extra costs incurred by disabled people.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="1012062000006"></a>However, DLA has not been fundamentally reformed since it was introduced in 1992. We now have a disability benefit that is confusing for individuals to understand, based on unclear criteria and often results in inconsistent awards, and since 1992 both the caseload and the cost of DLA have grown to a level that is unsustainable. Changes to DLA are long overdue and must address questions of fairness and value, whilst supporting disabled people to lead independent lives. We must ensure DLA better reflects the needs of disabled people today, rather than in the 1990s, and that it enables support to be targeted to those with the greatest need.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="1012062000007"></a>This is why I want to bring disability benefits into the 21st century by replacing DLA with a new benefit-the personal independence payment. This is an opportunity to improve the support for disabled people and enable them to lead full, active and independent lives. The personal independence payment will maintain the key principles of DLA, but it will be delivered in a fairer, more consistent and sustainable manner. It is only right that support should be targeted at those disabled people who face the greatest challenges to leading independent lives, and this reform is required to enable that, along with a clearer assessment process.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="1012062000008"></a>The consultation document sets out our proposals and seeks responses from disabled people and disability organisations. The document covers:</p>
the need for reform, including the rising caseload and expenditure and what we believe is wrong with the current benefit;our proposals for reform, including the new objective assessment, taking into account aids and adaptations, eligibility criteria, the treatment of children and over 65s, and signposting claimants to support to help them manage their condition; and

<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="1012062000009"></a>We welcome views from across Great Britain on the DLA proposals, conceived within the framework of a 21st century welfare system that is efficient, effective and above all fair.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="1012062000010"></a>Copies of the consultation paper are available in the Vote Office, and will be available shortly at <a href="http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/menu/cmd2010.htm">http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/menu/cmd2010.htm</a>.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="1012062000011"></a>The consultation period will be from 6 December to 14 February 2011. I will make a further Statement regarding the response shortly after the consultation period ends.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="1012062000013"></a>The social fund helps people to meet additional costs they may find it difficult to budget for.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="1012062000014"></a>This is why, in the forthcoming Welfare Reform Bill, we will introduce legislation to make Social Fund budgeting loans available to help families to buy maternity items or items for a new baby or to help them towards meeting some of the costs of a relative's funeral.

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="1012062000016"></a>This Government are a proud signatory of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), are committed to its implementation, and believe it is vital that children and young people have a strong, independent advocate to champion their interests and views and promote their rights. That is why on 12 July this year the Secretary of State for Education invited Dr John Dunford to undertake an independent review of the Children's Commissioner for England. Today the Government publish his report and recommendations, which I welcome. I know this  is an issue of great interest to many parliamentarians, and I have placed a copy of the report in the House Library.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="1012062000017"></a>In summary, Dr Dunford has concluded that there is a need for a Children's Commissioner if the Government are to meet their commitment to implement the UNCRC. He recommends a strengthened remit to promote and  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS3"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column WS3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>protect children's rights, with the role incorporating the responsibilities of the Children's Rights Director at the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) and also being able to assess the impact of new government policies on children's rights. Dr Dunford recommends greater independence, with the commissioner submitting an annual report, and any other reports, direct to Parliament as well as to government, rather than reports being submitted to Parliament through the Secretary of State for Education, as at present. It will be for Parliament to determine how else it would like to engage with the new Children's Commissioner. The full implications of Dr Dunford's recommendations will take some months to work through, but the Secretary of State and I are pleased to accept them now in principle and will consult in due course on legislative changes.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="1012062000018"></a>Dr Dunford was asked to consider the commissioner's powers, remit and functions, the relationship with other government-funded organisations carrying out related functions, and value for money. He has carried out a thorough review of the evidence, for which I am grateful. His call for evidence attracted over 200 responses from adult organisations and individuals and over 700 responses from children and young people. He has held extensive discussions with organisations that work with and for children and young people, MPs and Peers, and the Children's Rights Director's office. He has also visited the Children's Commissioners in all four countries of the UK and Ireland, and commissioned an academic review of the international evidence.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="1012062000019"></a>The conclusions that Dr Dunford has drawn are powerful. His review makes a convincing argument for the need for a Children's Commissioner, and I accept that without one there would be significant implications for children's lives and for the UK's international standing. Dr Dunford has assessed whether the role of the Children's Commissioner meets the Cabinet Office tests against which all arm's-length bodies have been reviewed, and I accept his view that it does so.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="1012062000020"></a>I have noted that despite some achievements on specific issues, the impact of the Office of the Children's Commissioner to date shows a clear need to reform its remit and operating model. I accept Dr Dunford's proposals that the role should be in accordance with the United Nation's Paris principles for human rights organisations, with responsibility for promoting and protecting children's rights on the basis of the UNCRC, and reporting directly to Parliament as well as to the Department for Education. I also agree with Dr Dunford that within these rights lies the responsibility for children to respect the rights of others, and that this should better enable children to act as young citizens and reinforces the proper exercise of authority by parents and other adults such as teachers.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="1012062000021"></a>The Secretary of State is clear that the Children's Commissioner must represent value for money in exercising its powers and functions, and Dr Dunford has identified opportunities in this regard. Whilst accepting that the commissioner needs to be adequately resourced to fulfil the role, I believe that all public funding should be used in accordance with the Cabinet Office's   


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS4"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column WS4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>efficiency guidelines for arm's-length bodies, and that this need not compromise independence or statutory powers and duties. Dr Dunford recommends merging the functions of the Office of the Children's Commissioner with the Children's Rights Director in Ofsted, providing the opportunity for greater coherence and impact, and scope for savings. I believe that this is a sensible way forward, and will discuss next steps with Her Majesty's Chief Inspector. Dr Dunford has also identified that the salary of the Children's Commissioner is excessive in comparison to others in similar roles and I will address this in setting up the new arrangements.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="1012062000022"></a>Dr Dunford's recommendations mean that the statutory basis and form of the Office of the Children's Commissioner must change. I will consult in due course on legislative changes. In the interim, the current role and functions of the Children's Commissioner will continue. This includes the commissioner's remit over non-devolved matters that impact on children and young people in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. I do understand the difficulties that the current position presents for the Children's Commissioners in the devolved Administrations. I will want to work with them to achieve a situation, within the devolution settlements, where the interests of children in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland can be fully represented by the commissioner for that jurisdiction.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="1012062000023"></a>Whilst it will take some time for any legislative changes to take effect, I am determined to act in the spirit of Dr Dunford's recommendations as soon as possible. The Secretary of State does not intend to use his current power to direct the Children's Commissioner to undertake an inquiry, and whilst the current legislation will still mean that the commissioner needs to consult him prior to undertaking an inquiry, the Secretary of State will be happy to offer his views but will not expect to have any role in how the commissioner then decides to proceed.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="1012062000024"></a>Dr Dunford recommends that a reshaped Children's Commissioner for England holds government to account against the UNCRC. I agree with Dr Dunford that for this to deliver benefits to children, government and policy-makers must be receptive to that approach and advice. I can therefore make a clear commitment that the Government will give due consideration to the UNCRC articles when making new policy and legislation. In doing so, we will always consider the recommendations of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child but recognise that, like other state signatories, the UK Government and the UN Committee may at times disagree on what compliance with certain articles entails.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="1012062000025"></a>In conclusion, Dr Dunford's recommendations should result in a Children's Commissioner who has a greater profile and credibility, and can better impact on children's lives. At the centre of this coalition Government's thinking is a determination to see children and young people achieve to their full potential, and the desire to empower individuals to shape their own future. I believe that reinforcing our commitment to children's rights, and creating a stronger independent advocate for those rights, is an important part of delivering on that ambition.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="1012062000027"></a>I am announcing today an independent review of the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="1012062000028"></a>Parents express real concern about children being pressured into growing up too quickly, to become consumers or sexualised adults earlier than is appropriate. The Government have therefore made a commitment to take action to protect children from excessive commercialisation and premature sexualisation.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="1012062000029"></a>I have asked Mr Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers' Union, to conduct an independent review of the issue and to make a full report with recommendations in May 2011. I should like the review to take a wide-ranging and independent examination of the evidence and provide recommendations that identify measures that will result in businesses collectively and individually changing their behaviour and which empower consumers to voice their concerns more effectively. To that end, I have asked Mr Bailey to consider the views of both consumers, particularly parents but also children themselves, and the business community, as well as drawing on the expertise of existing regulators and other experts in the field.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="1012062000030"></a>In undertaking his review, I have also asked Mr Bailey to build on the previous reviews conducted by Professor David Buckingham on the impact of the commercial world on children's well-being, by Dr Linda Papadopoulos on the sexualisation of young people, and by Professor Tanya Byron on child safety in a digital world. I have asked Mr Bailey to examine the evidence in these reviews and more recent research and to produce robust and challenging recommendations for the Government to consider in the following areas:</p>
risks of harm of commercialisation and sexualisation and barriers to parenting;principles (what is acceptable in this area and what is not);consumer voice; andcorporate social responsibility relating to children.

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="1012062000033"></a>I am pleased to announce that I will publish a national broadband strategy today. The strategy sets out how the Government plan to deliver their ambition to have the best superfast broadband network in Europe by 2015, and builds on the commitments I made in my Statement to the House on 8 June 2010.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2010" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS6"></a><b>6 Dec 2010 : Column WS6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="1012062000034"></a>A first-class broadband infrastructure is essential for creating jobs, opportunities and economic growth in the digital age. Our country needs a reliable and secure broadband capability that encourages innovation and creativity, supports the year-on-year growth of our digital industries-now worth £130 billion or 10 per cent of gross added value-and meets the growing demands of its 40 million users.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="1012062000035"></a>To that end, I was delighted to secure an unprecedented £830 million of public investment for broadband as part of the recent TV licence fee agreement.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="1012062000036"></a>The strategy published today will outline how Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK) will use the £530 million available in this spending review period to support broadband and stimulate further private sector investment. It sets out the goal of delivering a fibre point in every community in the UK by the end of this Parliament, bringing superfast broadband within reach of communities, urban and rural, and commits to ensuring that homes and businesses right across the UK are able to access a decent level of connectivity, even in the most remote areas.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="1012062000037"></a>The strategy includes:</p>
a mixed-technology approach with fixed, wireless and satellite all having a role. It is recognised that one technology is not suitable for all circumstances, although high-capacity fibre optic is likely to be a key feature of the UK's network;ensuring access to existing infrastructure, including BT's network of ducts and poles and encouraging owners of other networks to develop new revenue streams through selling access to their infrastructure; new guidance prepared in conjunction with the British Standards Institution and Building Research Establishment to builders and contractors on how to ensure new buildings are broadband-ready in the form of a publicly available specification (PAS 2016);a commitment to the liberalisation of the 800 megahertz and 2.6 gigahertz spectrum to allow the development of next generation mobile services; andworking with local authorities to clarify existing guidance on street works and microtrenching with the aim of reducing the cost of broadband rollout.
<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="1012062000038"></a>I will also be announcing my proposal to use £50 million of the £530 million allocated in the spending review to support a further wave of rural projects in addition to the projects already announced in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, Cumbria, Herefordshire and north Yorkshire.</p>

Much of the legislation applying to mutuals has existed for a long time and an up-to-date legislative framework is a pre-requisite to a successful mutual sector.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="1012062000042"></a>Mutual societies are under a number of statutory obligations to communicate with their members or the public in the conduct of their business. Today the Government published a consultation document that proposes to amend legislation that will facilitate the use of electronic communications, such as e-mail, by the mutual sector to discharge these statutory obligations and allow mutuals to reduce their administrative costs.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="1012062000045"></a>I wish to inform the House of the outcome of the review of the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="1012062000046"></a>On 8 July, I announced the review of the regulations and I asked all interested parties to make representations to me by 30 September. On the same day, I also laid a Statutory Instrument-the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfer) (Amendment) Regulations 2010-before the House, in order to defer the coming into force date of the regulations from 1 October 2010 until 1 April 2011.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="1012062000047"></a>During the period of the review, from 8 July to 30 September inclusive, I received 32 written representations and held three meetings with interested parties at their request.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="1012062000048"></a>In considering these representations, I have been left in no doubt that this is an important issue not only for the shipping companies who benefit from these practices but equally for local residents who have concerns about the potential impact of any accident on their coastline. In deciding how best to proceed, it has been necessary to strike a balance between ensuring that these operations are properly regulated while recognising the benefits of ship-to-ship transfer.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="1012062000049"></a>On the basis of the written representations and the points made to me in meetings conducted in the context of the review, I have drawn the following conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="1012062000050"></a>I intend to change the policy on ship-to-ship transfers outside harbour authority areas. Instead of a general prohibition, there will be a regime that will:</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="1012062000051"></a>I intend to maintain, without change, the policy of requiring oil transfer licences for harbour authorities. Harbour authorities that already have a history of hosting ship-to-ship transfers will of course continue to benefit from transitional arrangements.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="1012062000052"></a>I shall also take account, in reshaping the policy, of some specific instances where a type of ship or a type of activity needs to be treated in a way that departs from the general rules, or where the application of the rules needs to be adjusted to allow normal harbour activities to continue unhindered.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="1012062000053"></a>The department's officials will now proceed to draft the necessary amending legislation, on the basis which I have described. I shall be taking a keen interest in the progress which they make.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="1012062000056"></a>The Government are fully committed to tackling tax avoidance and will take necessary steps to protect the Exchequer and maintain fairness in the tax system.</p>

In that discussion document, the Government announced that they will adopt a more strategic approach to the risk of avoidance. By building in sustainable defences to avoidance we will reduce the need for frequent legislative changes and limit the cases when the changes are introduced with immediate effect.</p>

Section 418 was introduced to block schemes that involve the provision of intra-group finance through the use of convertible securities. In the schemes the debtor company claims tax deductions for larger amounts than the credits on which the creditor company is chargeable. The amendments ensure that Section 418 will apply where:</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="1012062000066"></a>The Government are introducing legislation that takes effect from 6 December to counter tax avoidance schemes involving accounting derecognition. This follows consultation on a technical paper published by HMRC on 6 July.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="1012062000067"></a>The proposed legislation amends Sections 311 and 312, and Sections 599A and 599B, of the Corporation Tax Act 2009. This legislation addresses avoidance schemes under which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP), amounts that are taxable under the rules on loan relationships and derivative contracts are not fully recognised in a company's accounts. In such cases, a company's corporation tax computations must be prepared on the assumption that all such amounts were fully recognised. The legislation currently applies only where a number of specific conditions are met, and has been amended on a number of occasions since its introduction in 2006, in response to new avoidance schemes that purport to circumvent the conditions.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="1012062000068"></a>As a result of persistent avoidance using derecognition schemes, the Government are announcing that the legislation will now apply as a general rule, without reference to specific conditions, wherever a company is a party to tax avoidance arrangements and, in accordance with GAAP, amounts are not fully recognised in its accounts. In addition, a company will be denied a debit for a loss arising on derecognition of a loan relationship or derivative contract, again where the company is party to tax avoidance arrangements.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="1012062000069"></a>Further details are contained in a draft explanatory note published on HMRC's website today, together with the proposed draft legislation.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="1012062000074"></a>Draft legislation will be published on 9 December 2010, alongside other draft clauses for the Finance Bill 2011, to counter avoidance involving changes in the functional currency of an investment company. The legislation will take effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2011. This will ensure that when a UK resident investment company changes its functional currency, no foreign exchange gains or losses arising from loan relationships or derivative contracts will be brought into account for tax purposes in the first period of account using the new functional currency.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="1012062000078"></a>The VAT Act will be amended to withdraw zero rating from printed matter where it is ancillary to a differently rated service, and where, if the service and printed matter had been supplied by a single company, the printed matter would not have been zero rated.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="1012062000081"></a>As announced in the June 22 discussion document <I>Tax Policy Making: A New Approach</I>, HMRC engaged informally over the summer with a range of interested parties to consider whether there was a case for a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) in the UK. Those discussions showed that there was some support for such a rule, but it was clear that there were also concerns that a rule would generate uncertainty about the tax treatment of business transactions and about how that uncertainty could be managed in practice.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a><a name="1012062000082"></a>I am setting in train a study programme to establish whether a GAAR could be framed to meet the objectives of deterring and countering tax avoidance in a fair way, while providing certainty, retaining a tax regime that is attractive to business and minimising compliance costs for businesses and HMRC and, if so, how the provisions of the GAAR might be framed.</p>

<a name="101206-wms0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="1012062000083"></a>This study will be led by Graham Aaronson QC, supported by a small group of experts.

<a name="101206w0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_52"></a><a name="1012068000089"></a>In May 2010, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Surveillance Authority (ESA) issued a formal notice to Iceland confirming that Iceland has a legal obligation under the deposit guarantee directive to ensure payment of the minimum compensation to Icesave depositors in the UK (i.e. an obligation to repay the UK for payments it made to UK depositors on behalf of the Icelandic compensation scheme). Negotiations to agree the terms of repayment are ongoing. Failure of Iceland to comply with this notice and reach agreement with the UK is likely to result in the ESA referring the matter to the EFTA Court.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_53"></a><a name="1012068000090"></a>The second part of the Question asked whether the UK would support Iceland's entry to the European Union (EU) regardless of whether agreement is reached on the repayment of moneys due.</p>

<a name="101206w0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_54"></a><a name="1012068000091"></a>As set out in the previous Answer, the UK continues to support Iceland's bid for EU membership. Like other candidates, Iceland must meet the EU membership criteria, including meeting the Copenhagen criteria and fully implementing its EEA obligations. The June European Council conclusions make it clear that Iceland must meet these obligations by resolving the Icesave issue during the negotiations.</p>

<a name="1012068000122"></a><b><a name="101206w0001.htm_spmin30"></a><a name="1012068000275"></a>The Commercial Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Sassoon):</b> At the June 2010 Budget, the Chancellor announced that the 2011-12 income tax personal allowance for those aged under 65 would be increased by £1,000 in cash terms, taking it from £6,475 now to £7,475 in 2011-12.</p>

<a name="101206w0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_71"></a><a name="1012068000123"></a>The increase in the personal allowance will benefit 75 per cent of the UK taxpaying population, and will lift an estimated 880,000 individuals out of income tax altogether. It is worth up to £170 a year for 23 million basic rate taxpayers, in other words any individual under 65 with income less than £42,475. The Government's longer-term goal is to raise the allowance to £10,000, with real-terms steps in that direction every year.</p>
