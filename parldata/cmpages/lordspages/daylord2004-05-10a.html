<a name="40510-01_head0"></a><h3 align=center>European Union Legislation</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Lamont of Lerwick </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What proportion of legislation put before Parliament in recent years has originated from the European Union.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My Lords, figures are not held centrally for all legislation. About half of all legislation with a significant impact on business, charities or the voluntary sector is introduced to implement European Union decisions with the proportion varying considerably from one policy area to another.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lamont of Lerwick: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness the Leader of the House for that reply which is slightly different from that on the Cabinet Office website which states that 50 per cent of all   major legislation starts in the EU. Is it not a remarkable admission that 50 per cent of major laws&#151;and presumably an even higher proportion of minor laws&#151;are made in the EU? Does the Minister agree that the relevant figure might become 60 or 70 per cent in a few years&#039; time? Given that much EU legislation cannot be amended and cannot in practice be rejected by Parliament, how can it seriously be disputed that parliamentary proceedings are increasingly becoming a charade, and that because so much legislation is coming from Europe, the EU is acquiring the characteristics of a government?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord will not be surprised to hear that I do not agree with him. As regards <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_2"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the degree to which the legislation of individual departments comes from the European Union, the position in December of last year with respect to the Home Office, for example, was the following. During the 2002&#150;03 Session it sponsored five Bills of approximately 868 pages. One of the Bills predominantly implemented EU requirements, another partially implemented EU requirements. The situation differs depending on the department. The 55   per cent figure related to Defra. The figures were very different for other departments. With respect to the noble Lord&#039;s point about amending or rejecting EU legislation, he will know that significant negotiation is conducted by our Ministers and others, usually in Brussels, before we reach the point where we agree anything.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, how many of the regulations to which the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, referred stem from the Maastricht Treaty to which he gave such strong support? As an alternative to the suggestions that he made, has my noble friend had any serious proposals to amend the present situation other than that Britain should leave the European Union?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is, of course, quite right in the sense that the party opposite negotiated the Maastricht Treaty. A significant proportion of regulations came out of that treaty. With respect to the current proposals for a constitutional treaty, our proposal is to negotiate because we believe that Britain&#039;s role is at the heart of Europe. So far as I understand it, the alternative being offered by the Leader of the Opposition is withdrawal from Europe.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, following the   perfectly proper question of the noble Lord, Lord   Barnett, will the noble Baroness the Leader of the House at least reassure us that in the current negotiations the Government really will support proper blocking powers for national Parliaments against inappropriate and excessive EU legislation; in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_3"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 3</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

other words, that they will adopt the red card and will not let us down on this matter as well as on some of the other red lines which they claim to defend?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, I do not know to what the noble Lord refers when he says that we have let ourselves down with respect to any red lines. The Government published a White Paper in which they made clear our red lines. My right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister have made it absolutely clear that those red lines will remain. We have been absolutely clear about the areas where we see some extension of qualified majority voting and those areas which have to retain unanimity.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept the figures regarding the percentage of British legislation that is shaped by international obligations such as those under the World Trade Organisation, the United Nations or other international and UN agencies? Does she further accept that even if Britain were to leave the EU, we would still be bound in our domestic legislation by a whole series of international obligations of this kind and that the experience of the one administration that has set out to declare that it is outside and above international law&#151;the Bush administration&#151;has not been entirely happy in disregarding its obligations under international law?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord makes a very important point. Of course, a great deal of our legislation is shaped and influenced by international obligations that go beyond the European Union. One of the difficulties in answering this Question is that when you begin to look at the shaping and influencing of legislation, it is sometimes much more difficult to pin down than is suggested by the way in which the Question is framed. The noble Lord is right to draw our attention to the fact that even if this country were to leave the European Union, which, of course, I and my party do not want to see, we would remain bound by some of its provisions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, will the Government now consider collecting these figures centrally? If they are not collected centrally, how are we to have an intelligent argument about what influence the European Union has on our legislation? My second question is the following. Since most of this legislation is automatically translated into British legislation, is there any longer a need for a House of Commons of 659 Members and a House of Lords of nearly 700 Members?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord   Stoddart of Swindon is, as usual, robust. With regard to collecting that information centrally, individual departments keep the information on the proportion of legislation that is introduced to implement EU decisions. It would be helpful if I reiterate the point that it would be wrong to see the issue as an imposition of regulations from outside. We <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_4"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

take a very active part in collective decision-making in the EU and information on that is kept by individual departments. The size of the House of Commons is a matter for the other place, but it is important that we have MPs representing the constituencies that there are. The size of the House of Lords is a matter that your Lordships may wish to look at and think about in terms of the future of House of Lords reform.

<a name="40510-01_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Carbon Emissions: Household Sector</h3>
<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="40510-01_time0"></a><h5></h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Ezra </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Why their document <i>Energy Efficiency: The Government&#039;s Plan for Action</i> lowers the expected savings in household carbon emissions by 2010 which were set out in the energy White Paper.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Whitty): </b>  My Lords, <i>Energy Efficiency: The Government&#039;s Plan for Action</i> contains an aim of securing carbon savings from household energy efficiency of 4.2 million tonnes of carbon per annum by 2010. The figure of 5 million tonnes of carbon in the energy White Paper was an initial indication of what might be delivered. But detailed analysis since the energy White Paper has led us to conclude that 4.2   million tonnes is a realistic figure to set as an aim for the household sector. Latest revisions of projected carbon savings from other sectors more than offset this recalculation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40510-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Ezra: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that Answer, but in view of the prime importance attached by the Government to energy saving, why was the anticipated shortfall not made up in other ways? Bearing in mind that the objectives for energy saving are now somewhat reduced, that the target for renewables on present trends is unlikely to be achieved, that the target for CHP has been reduced by 20 per cent and that the latest indications for emissions show that there has actually been an increase, do the Government still expect to attain their Kyoto and EU objectives by 2010?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040510/text/40510-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, there has been a recent and short-term increase in coal burn, which has accounted for the very recent increases in carbon use, but the overall Kyoto objective of 12.5 per cent by 2008 to 2012 will be achieved. We are confident of that. The Government also have a 20 per cent domestic target, which is more stretching and is one that we are confident that we can achieve, but with substantial intensification of those measures. Regarding energy efficiency, my point is that although the household component has been reduced, other sectors have been increased by more than that. Therefore, that contribution is still valid and robust.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Tanlaw: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister say how atmospheric carbon can be reduced to target in 2010 <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_5"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 5</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

by killing off nuclear power generation by 2007, or by supporting the Ministry of Defence&#039;s objections to the erection of wind turbines all across the country? If the Government cannot meet the objectives published in the energy White Paper for renewable energy sources, does the Minister intend to reduce atmospheric pollution with a new carbon tax on business and power generation, or will it be, in the words of his right honourable friend, by,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;taxing the motorist out of the car and on to public transport&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>or will it be a bit of both?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, every sector has to bear its responsibility, and fiscal measures are part of the way that that is achieved. We already have fairly high fuel taxation and the climate change levy has proved an extremely effective way of achieving carbon savings with energy efficiency in the business sector. The renewables target is ambitious but, we believe, is one that we can achieve. The run-down of nuclear power stations is unlikely to affect the situation for 2010, although renewables will have to begin to replace some of that, alongside other measures outlined in the White Paper, beyond 2010.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Lords, I can understand the Minister&#039;s optimism, even if I do not accept it with regard to the national situation. However, is he satisfied that we are not escaping from reality, because while we work hard in this country, we are still exporting to other parts of the world plant that generates a great deal of carbon dioxide?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, just as every sector in the United Kingdom and the EU needs to bear some responsibility for reducing carbon emissions, so does every country in the world, particularly the developed countries which have by far the largest element of carbon emissions. It is important that not only all EU countries meet their commitments&#151;although not all are currently on track to achieve them&#151;but that other countries such as the United States also meet those targets.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </b>   My Lords, what assumptions are the Government making about the contribution of nuclear generated power from France towards the reduction of our Kyoto targets?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, the presumption on importing energy from France is that that will continue at the present rate. Therefore, it does not affect the calculations of the reduction.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </b>   My Lords, was it not clear from the interesting speech made on Thursday by the Minister&#039;s colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, that the Government are now clearly having second thoughts about embarking on a new programme of nuclear generation? Is the Minister <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_6"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

aware that many of those who took part in that brief debate detected a marked change of emphasis on the part of that Minister?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, I was not present for that   debate but I am aware of what my noble friend Lord Sainsbury indicated, which is what we have indicated throughout the proceedings on the Energy Bill and before; namely, that we are keeping the nuclear energy option open but that we believe and are   confident that we can meet the targets outlined in the White Paper without new nuclear build&#151;but we would always keep that technology open as an option to help to meet both our energy requirements and our carbon reduction aims.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </b>   My Lords, neither the noble Lord nor anyone else in the Government have yet said what they are doing to keep the option open. Are they investing any money, because such options do not stay open automatically, they are not fixed open doors&#151;far from it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, I disagree with the presumption there. We continue to maintain a substantial nuclear element at present, which brings us technological advance, and we are funding significant amounts of nuclear research. However, in most respects, nuclear technology is known, available and can be established. Were we to require nuclear energy to meet our objectives, it would be possible for us to do so; we have the expertise, knowledge and research and engineering base here to do it.

<a name="40510-02_time0"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. In so doing, I declare an interest as an employee of Age Concern England.
</p>

<a name="40510-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>The Question was as follows:
</p>
<p>
<a name="40510-02_spopq0"></a><b>  </b> 

<a name="qnpa_2"></a> To ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government what plans they have to develop the work of the Criminal Records Bureau.
</p>



<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My Lords, the Criminal Records Bureau has recently published its strategic plan, which sets out its agenda for the three years 2004&#150;05, 2005&#150;06 and 2006&#150;07. The plan sets out four key aims, which are to improve quality and accuracy; to reduce costs and bureaucracy, including achieving self-funding status from 2005&#150;06; to develop capacity and to improve delivery times. Copies of the strategic plan have been placed in the Library.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. She will no doubt be aware that CRB clearance is currently taking between two and four months to process. In the light of that, does she agree <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_7"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 7</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that the relaxation of the requirement for people carrying out domiciliary care to be cleared by the CRB so that they are required only to have applied for CRB clearance potentially leaves vulnerable adults in their homes at great risk?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I certainly understand the noble Baroness&#039;s anxiety about that. She will know that there has been significant improvement in clearance times. I hear what she says about it taking two to three months; I cannot confirm that that is correct. She will know that the CRB&#039;s performance has been transformed since autumn 2002. Since June 2003, the CRB has, on average, been issuing 93 per cent of standard and enhanced disclosures within two and four weeks respectively, against a public service standard of 90 per cent. So I cannot agree with the noble Baroness that it is not doing well. I accept that safety is a matter of acute concern and we believe that the system that we now have in place is robust and working far better than it did before.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Greengross: </b>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that, despite the great improvements in timing, it still takes too long for many people&#151;employers, employees and would-be employees&#151;working in the social care sector? Would it not be possible for some portable, time-limited CRB check to be initiated for people who move from job to job within the care sector? I understand if people need a long check when they start working in the sector but, after that, existing employees might need only quickly to update their check, rather than to submit a new one.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I understand that that anxiety has been raised. The noble Baroness will know that we have taken steps to respond to the whole issue of portability so that, if someone moves from one job to another within a short compass or, for instance, has a CRB check for being a teacher and wants to be a Scoutmaster or mistress too, he or she can use the CRB check for the one purpose. Obviously, it will then be a matter for the employer whether that is sufficient or whether a new check needs to be made. We have given that matter a lot of consideration and think that the new arrangements have responded fairly well to the concerns raised.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40510-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, has the Minister considered the impact not only of the delay but of the   charges on voluntary organisations, especially charitable organisations, bearing in mind that the   income&#151;especially the core income for the appointment of staff&#151;of many such organisations has dropped? Will she please hold a discussion to ensure concessions for voluntary organisations, which provide such valuable services in this country?

<a name="40510-03_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, your Lordships will know that we have already taken steps to ensure that volunteers are processed without charge. That has been a significant benefit to voluntary organisations, which rely on the service of people who come forward with great generosity to help. That has been significant and, at present, we intend to maintain that position.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40510-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, will not the introduction of a national identity card make the whole process far faster?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40510-03_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, it will certainly make identification far faster and more secure, but whether it will change the need to have the CRB check is by no means certain, because the whole point of the CRB check is to discover whether there are criminal or other convictions or other material that needs to be taken into account before someone is given a job of some sensitivity.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40510-03_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, with regard to the matter of matching information against police computers, is the Minister still concerned about the number of instances when checks have thrown up apparent convictions of which the person has not in fact been guilty?
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40510-03_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, of course I am concerned about that, but the noble Baroness will know that the whole purpose of the CRB is to err on the side of safety and caution. What has happened, which is a matter of regret, is that where two people have very similar names and details, on occasion, a report of a conviction has been triggered that has not been founded. However, I hope that the noble Baroness will agree that it is better for us to be safe rather than sorry. Although we bitterly regret that that happens, we would prefer it to be that way round than for someone who is guilty of a fairly unpleasant offence to be allowed to look after vulnerable people.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="40510-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, the Minister will recall that in the Soham tragedy, one problem was a change of name, which prevented proper checks on one of the individuals concerned. Is she convinced that the new procedures take account of the ease with which people use different names as they move through the system?
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="40510-03_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, it would be foolish ever to say that we have honed the system so keenly that no further improvements can be made. I do not suggest that. What I say is that we have taken all the steps that we can at present to ensure that it is as   robust as possible. Of course, we must wait to see   what   the inquiry recommends. When those recommendations are to hand, we will take them very seriously indeed and consider what more, if anything, needs to be done.

<a name="40510-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I do not think that it is possible to make that breakdown of consumer debt, although I acknowledge that it is a legitimate question. Since my noble friend draws attention to mortgage debt, he will be aware that the Financial Services Authority is taking over responsibility for regulating mortgage business from 1 October this year. It seeks to control, among other things, the loan to value ratio. It wants to see to it that mortgage providers must take into account before concluding an agreement the purchaser&#039;s ability to maintain payments on the loan.

Digital to encourage people to go into debt? All sorts of attractive options are offered. Are the Government thinking of doing anything about that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="40510-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, there are a number of problems with personal debt which are identified in the consumer credit White Paper. One of them is advertisement, to which the noble Lord refers; another is the responsibility of trading standards officers in the enforcement of the law against loan sharks. Understandably, trading standards officers concentrate on issues of public safety. As a result of the White Paper, a pilot is setting up specialised teams of trading standards officers with enforcement officers, using the Proceeds of Crime Act to penalise those who are loan-sharking poorer people in particular. I hope that that, among other solutions, will make some difference to the problem that the noble Lord, Lord   Pilkington, rightly identifies.

<a name="40510-03_spmin2"></a><b>The Lord Bishop of Worcester:</b>  My Lords, further to the Minister&#039;s Answer to the noble Earl, is he aware of the experience of citizens advice bureaux and the huge burden on it in the amount of debt counselling that it must provide? Is there any sense in government that the escalating reliance on debt is a massive turnaround from the wisdom of earlier generations? Notwithstanding the prosperity that seems to support it, does not the Minister sometimes feel that we are getting to a point of corporate and social imprudence that we shall live to regret?

<a name="40510-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, as is appropriate, the right reverend Prelate takes a very long view. Of course, if we go back to a prohibition on usury, we could say that there has been a significant increase in indebtedness. In point of fact, in recent years there has not been an increase in indebtedness. Interest payments as a proportion of disposable income are now at 7.1 per cent, compared with an average in 1979 to 1997 of 9.4 per cent, with a peak of 15 per cent. In the shorter term, which I am obliged to address, it is not as bad as the right reverend Prelate thinks.

<a name="40510-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree with the FSA that the number of families facing financial difficulties has risen by some 15 per cent over the past 12 months to 6.9 million families, a very significant number? Many are poorer families who have found themselves the victims of aggressive marketing and then extortionate loan rates.
</p>

<a name="40510-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>The Minister has mentioned the consumer credit White Paper on several occasions. Will he urge his colleagues in the DTI to speed up the review of the consumer credit system? I understand that it could be three or more years before any new measures are introduced to implement changes to deal with these unsatisfactory current practices.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="40510-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, there are different ways of looking at the figures. The Bank of England, for example, thinks that some of the increased borrowing, particularly for mortgages, is from higher-income families rather than lower-income ones. It depends on the kind of borrowing in question.

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>As to the review started by the consumer credit White Paper, we should not assume that much of what is wrong is in the Consumer Credit Act 1974. As I mentioned when I talked about the role of trading standards officers, much of it is in the implementation. I assure the noble Lord that the Department of Trade and Industry is pressing ahead for reform without waiting for further legislation.

</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="40510-04_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>Page 1, line 9, after &quot;instruction&quot; insert &quot;and post-graduate studies&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>The noble Baroness said: This minor amendment relates to Clause 1, which sets out the objectives of the   Arts and Humanities Research Council. Looking at the objectives, I was struck that paragraph (a), as well as requiring the council to carry out research in the arts and humanities, also requires it to facilitate, encourage and support,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;instruction in the arts and humanities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Traditionally, research councils have not supported undergraduate teaching but are major supporters of postgraduate teaching. As is clear from the detail on the Arts and Humanities Research Board, around 50   per cent of moneys going to the board today support studentships.

</p>

<a name="40510-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>The wording of the first part of the Bill has been taken substantially from the wording relating to research councils in the Science and Technology Act 1965. That legislation was enacted 39 years ago, since when practice has changed. In particular, today we see in many universities both formal teaching of postgraduate students and the incorporation of postgraduate students into research teams to a degree that was not prevalent in 1965. The formal instruction of postgraduate students is an extremely important part of the function of the research councils. I felt therefore that it would be appropriate to have a reference not only to &quot;instruction&quot; but to &quot;instruction and postgraduate studies&quot;. That would reflect modern-day practice.
</p>

<a name="40510-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>I felt strongly that it was all very well to borrow from the 1965 Act, but we want to bring it up to date. It is appropriate, given the importance of the role of postgraduate support and teaching on the part of the research councils that such a reference should be included in the Bill. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="40510-04_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   If there is any doubt about the inclusion of postgraduate studies in the clause, I would commend the inclusion of the words recommended by <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 13</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the noble Baroness. As she says, such work accounts for getting on for half of the funding that goes through the present board.

</p>

<a name="40510-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Apart from that, I welcome the clause. It completes the Government&#039;s implementation of the recommendation made by a committee that I chaired in 1997 that there should be such a council. In welcoming that final stage of implementation, I must say, as we recognised in 1997, how important research in the arts and humanities is to the social and economic well-being of the country. We noted at that stage that the performing arts, fine arts,   literature and historic buildings&#151;even if narrowly defined&#151;employed twice as many people as the motor industry and as many as the building societies and banks put together. I hope that, as the council moves into its new life, the Government will ensure that the importance of the arts and humanities is borne well in mind.

<a name="40510-04_spmin2"></a><b>The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth:</b>  I am grateful to the noble Baroness for moving the amendment and for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. It is not an ideologically driven amendment, although it is an important one. I hope that the Minister will respond constructively. Well, she always is constructive, but I hope that she will respond positively to the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="40510-04_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   Whenever someone says that something is not ideologically driven, I feel an instinct to find an argument against it. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, has put her finger on an important point.
</p>

<a name="40510-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>I know that the Minister will have been told by her officials that the words suggested by the amendment are unnecessary because the meaning of the clause is apparent to all concerned. I studied the amendment, and it was not apparent to me that the meaning of the clause was obvious, so I hope that the Minister will think about the matter and table an amendment in similar terms, if this one is technically defective, which is the other piece of advice that she may be getting from her officials in the Box. It would be a very good thing to make it explicit in the Bill that there is a responsibility in respect of postgraduates as well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="40510-04_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I begin by saying to the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, that I did not get either of those pieces of advice from officials. I recognised the words that the noble Lord used from other discussions that I have had in the House and will have in Committee.

</p>

<a name="40510-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>I am pleased by the welcome that the introduction of the Arts and Humanities Research Council has had outside the House. I also feel that, although we may be debating some of the issues relating to the council today, the council has generally been welcomed. To the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, I say that I accept that practice has changed, but the basis of the legislation, albeit 38 or 39 years old, is still sound. It is important, as we will see when we discuss later amendments, that we make sure that the research councils can operate together, when that is appropriate. I also recognise that this is another example of how we are catching up at a later date with the noble Lord, Lord Dearing.

</p>

<a name="40510-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I appreciate the importance of the issue of adequate support for postgraduate studies. As noble Lords will know, Clause 1 defines the new research council as a body set up by Royal Charter and outlines its objectives. Postgraduate studies, although not explicitly mentioned, as noble Lords said, are implicit in paragraph (a)(ii) of Clause 1.
</p>

<a name="40510-04_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Noble Lords may have seen the draft Royal Charter, which we made available. It creates the Arts and Humanities Research Council and sets out its constitution in detail, along with the detailed objectives for which it is established and incorporated. I draw the Committee&#039;s attention to Article 2(1)(a) of the draft Royal Charter, which expressly states that one of the objects for which the research council is established is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;to promote and support by any means high-quality, basic, strategic and applied research and related postgraduate training in the arts and humanities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-04_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>I hope that that will reassure the Committee that the promotion and support of postgraduate training in the arts and humanities will be at the heart of the research council&#039;s role and remit.
</p>

<a name="40510-04_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>The Committee will be aware that the charter that creates the new research council will have the weight of law. It is the right place to spell out in detail the requirements on the council. We intend that the charter will be similar, if not identical, to the one that we have made available in draft form. I hope that, on that basis, the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="40510-05_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   I recognise that, but the Bill defines the function of the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Universities UK says that it is satisfied that the position is as near as possible to the funding of the other research councils. Is the wording taken from that applying to other research councils?

clear. If the noble Baroness is still not satisfied that the link is clear, after looking at the charter with reference to that part of the Bill, I will write to her and make it explicit.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="40510-05_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I apologise for coming back again on the matter. The Minister said that she had not had either of the arguments that I suggested put by officials. One of them was that the matter was already covered elsewhere in the Bill. She said that it was already covered in the charter. That is almost the same point.
</p>

<a name="40510-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Does not the charter also cover research in the arts and humanities and instruction in the arts and humanities? If we are relying on the charter, which I understand is not a legal document, to spell out the duties, why is it necessary to have sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii)? If it is all right to have those sub-paragraphs, why cannot they be amended in the way suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford?

<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="40510-05_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   When I said to the noble Lord that that was not the advice of my officials, I meant it. The particular reference that, I thought, the noble Lord was making was to advice about the specifics of the Bill. I saw the charter slightly separately. It is a nuance, but, none the less, I shall stick to it.
</p>

<a name="40510-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>As I understand it, the legislation has been drafted to ensure that what is in the Bill is appropriate to the establishment of the research council, linked to the legislation of 1965, to which the noble Baroness, Lady   Sharp of Guildford, referred. The detail is in a Royal Charter and has the weight of law because of that. My understanding is that, if the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, examines the detail in the charter, which has the weight of law, and links it back to the relevant clauses, she will see that all is conjoined in the right way. If that is not the case, I will, as always, write to the noble Baroness, copy the letter to the noble Lord and put a copy in the Library.

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, expressed precisely my feelings on the matter. The wording in the Bill is misleading. It implies that there is support for undergraduate instruction as well as graduate instruction. The emphasis on postgraduate studies on the part of research councils nowadays is significant. I accept that that is spelt out in the charter. But I come back to my point: as it appears in the Bill, the wording is slightly misleading.

<p><a name="st_69"></a>The noble Baroness said: In speaking to Amendment No. 2, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, which apply to Clause 3. They are probing amendments that relate to the relationship between the new research council and the Secretary of State. As in Amendment No. 1, they question whether the current wording of the Bill reflects present-day practice in relation to research councils and the desirability of giving research councils slightly greater autonomy and freedom of action than implied by the current wording of the clause.
</p>

<a name="40510-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I confess that I have put down those amendments because it is important that the Committee should have a chance to debate the detail of the Bill in relation to the setting up of the new research council. Like others, I welcome the fact that the current Arts and Humanities Research Board will finally obtain the status of a fully-fledged council. In no sense, do I want to detract from that achievement.

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>From the debate at Second Reading, it is quite clear that there is support for this research council on all sides of the House.

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>incurred in carrying out those functions. Yet, for some time, it has been the practice of the research councils to develop programmes of activities that reflect and balance the priorities of their different functions and the expenses that derive from these activities.
</p>

<a name="40510-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I would therefore argue that it would be more accurate for the Bill to lay down that the council should develop such a programme of activities and that the Secretary of State&#039;s role is to provide the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_17"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 17</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

funding for that programme. By changing the word &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot;, I am also arguing that while it is recognised in the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;such sums as he determines&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>that the Secretary of State has discretion to decide how much money he gives to the research council in respect of its activities, it is, nevertheless, his duty to pay something towards those expenses. The word &quot;may&quot; leaves to the Secretary of State&#039;s discretion not only how much shall be paid, but also whether he will pay anything at all. Implicitly, in setting up the research council, I would argue that the Secretary of State is willing that the activities described in Clause 1 should be undertaken. Therefore, he should accept an obligation to fund those activities&#151;hence, the word &quot;shall&quot; should replace the word &quot;may&quot;&#151;while retaining the discretion through that funding function to have some say over the scale of those activities.
</p>

<a name="40510-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 relate to subsection (3). As it stands, the wording is stark; that is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;The Council must comply with any direction of the Secretary of State as to the use of expenditure of payments made under subsection (1)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-05_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>The amendment would make clear the relative autonomy of the research council to determine its own programme while recognising that, ultimately, &quot;he who pays the piper calls the tune&quot;. But, on such occasions, that should be transparent. If the Secretary of State disagrees with the priorities developed by the research council and fails to persuade it of his way of thought, it is open to him to insist on his way, but only by issuing a direction to the research council that is open and transparent.
</p>

<a name="40510-05_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>The Minister may argue that this wording is no different from that in the Bill; that the research council is obliged to comply with any direction from the Secretary of State and that the word &quot;direction&quot; implies an open transaction. I would argue that by breaking the sentence into two parts&#151;making it clear the Secretary of State has to issue a clear direction and that the research council has to comply&#151;we are subtly endorsing the relative autonomy of the research council in relation to the Secretary of State. It does not have to do everything that the Secretary of State tells it to do. Where there is disagreement, the Secretary of State must be open and transparent about why he is insisting on his way.

</p>

<a name="40510-05_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>On reading the debate that took place in Committee in the House of Commons, the Minister may respond that the wording cannot be changed because it is taken from the Science and Technology Act 1965 and applies to all   research councils. As I have said before, much has changed since 1965. The whole function and relationship between government and research councils has changed. We now have a director general of the research councils sitting within government. In 1965, the research councils were set apart from government and were relatively autonomous with a board pulling together the workings of the research councils in a very loose way.
</p>

<a name="40510-05_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>That has now changed. There is a direct line of responsibility from the Minister to the director general of the research councils sitting in the Office of Science <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_18"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and Technology. It is a different relationship now, which should be reflected in the Bill. I would argue strongly that it would be a good thing to incorporate within the wording of the Bill that relative autonomy and that where there is disagreement the Secretary of State must issue a directive to the research council. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="40510-06_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   I am delighted to have an early opportunity to speak in favour of this part of the Bill. In so doing, I declare my interest as chief executive of Universities UK, which has long campaigned for the establishment of a research council for arts and humanities. We have been a partner in bringing forward these proposals.
</p>

<a name="40510-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Perhaps I may draw attention to the role of UUK&#039;s former president and the current president of London Metropolitan University, Professor Roderick Floud, who played an enormous part in pressing for the establishment of the AHRC. Together with a number of vice-chancellors, he felt passionately that research into arts and humanities should be treated in the same way as other research councils.
</p>

<a name="40510-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>I know that academics in arts and humanities have sometimes felt that their work is not taken as seriously by the Government as that in other fields. I am sure that, in her reply, the Minister will want to reassure them that the Government recognise the importance of research in these fields to our national and cultural life, as well as to our international reputation.
</p>

<a name="40510-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Research in the arts and humanities underpins our understanding of science and technology and their impact on society; that is, its history and the legal, ethical and social implications.

</p>

<a name="40510-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The current world climate convincingly demonstrates the need for experts in the arts and humanities. Like their counterparts in the sciences, our academics in the arts and humanities help us to understand the world in which we live in all its religious, cultural, geographical and historical diversity. This is not about window dressing; it is essential.
</p>

<a name="40510-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I should like to make one further point. In the past I and others have had some cause to criticise Ministers, in particular following the publication of the White Paper, <i>The Future of</i> <i>Higher Education</i>, for tending to assume that all research is like big science. It is not, and I hope that the Arts and Humanities Research Council will help to work, within the Office of Science and Technology, to redress the balance in government thinking.
</p>

<a name="40510-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>In my view, the legislative framework is sound. It closely resembles the framework for the other research councils contained in the Science and Technology Act   1965, and where there are differences between the structure used in that Act and what is set out in this Bill, the reasons for them are good. Therefore I do not support the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, although I am grateful to her for providing the opportunity to say that Clause 3 provides the right balance between the legitimate influence of the Secretary of State in directing the way in which public money should be spent and freedom of operation for the council.

<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="40510-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I hesitate to disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, after our love affair on the last amendment. I should say that I agree with her objectives. We have now a more centralising, control freak Government than we have ever had, or at least in my lifetime. Again and again we see the Government determined to bring power and control to the centre and to Whitehall. Therefore when I first saw the amendment, I thought that it marked a step in the right direction. Moreover, when listening to the noble Baroness introduce it, it is clear that that is what she has in mind. But I do not think that it does the job.
</p>

<a name="40510-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>To seek to change &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot;, so that subsection (1) would read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State [shall] pay the Arts and Humanities Research Council such sums as he determines&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>means that he could determine to pay the council nothing. The amendment would not meet the objective of securing for the council a degree of independence over the use of its funding. Although I have not tabled an amendment in my name, I think it would be better to be altogether more radical by proposing that the role of the Secretary of State should be to set out the broad strategic approach and objectives rather than that of issuing directions.
</p>

<a name="40510-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>Amendment No. 5 seeks to delete subsection (3), which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;The Council must comply with any direction of the Secretary of State as to the use or expenditure of payments made under subsection (1)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40510-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I say amen to that. Unfortunately, however, in a later amendment the noble Baroness seeks to put in something almost as bad, thereby defeating the object of the exercise. I do not know whether the noble Baroness will return to this point at a later stage in our consideration, but I think that she is on to something here, which is the need to set up a body, give it a clear set of objectives and let it get on with the job. Otherwise there will be a continual determination on the part of others to make changes&#151;I hope that that ringing is not from my telephone. No, it is not, although the ring tone is similar to mine, which is always alarming. As I said, there will be a determination to second-guess these bodies which have been set up with clear objectives and which are staffed with able people. That is true of all governments; it may even have been true of previous governments.
</p>

<a name="40510-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I do not know what the noble Baroness intends to do, but if she returns with a slightly more robust amendment that seeks a greater degree of independence for the Arts and Humanities Research Council, then we may be in a position to give her some support.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="40510-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </b>   I wish to endorse rather than repeat the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick of Undercliffe, on the importance of the research council. She made the case very well.
</p>

<a name="40510-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>I plead for one principle to operate in this area, which is that of consonance and congruity in the arrangements between the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Government, and other research councils and the Government. For a long <br>&nbsp;<br>

time the arts and humanities community has felt itself to be two or three steps behind the other academic areas and I see this part of the Bill as a move to change that situation. Whatever further amendments or changes may be proposed in due course by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, we must look for consonance and congruity between this proposed new research council and the other research councils.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="40510-06_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   It is clear that many noble Lords in the Chamber know exactly how research councils function because they have worked with them in various different contexts. However, we do not all do so and I am finding it hard to envisage exactly how this is to operate. Does Clause 3(1) mean that a research council should always hold discussions with the Secretary of State before embarking on any operation in order to ensure that funding will be provided, or is that not the case? What is the process here?
</p>

<a name="40510-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The subsection states that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State may pay . . .  such sums as he determines in respect of the expenses that the Council has incurred, or expects to incur, in carrying out the objects listed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>How would the council ensure that the Secretary of State will provide the necessary funding?
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="40510-06_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Morgan: </b>   I too strongly support the proposed Arts and Humanities Research Council and I am sorry that, due to circumstances beyond my control, I was not able to express that support at Second Reading. I should declare an interest as one who has spent the past 48 years doing research in the arts and humanities, and not much else. So I warmly endorse what was said by my noble friend Lady Warwick.

</p>

<a name="40510-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I do not think that the amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, are necessary. However, she has made an extremely important point; that is, to encourage the underlying autonomy and freedom of operation for the board. I say that for one particular reason: research in the arts and humanities is commonly different in character from that undertaken in the social and natural sciences. Most of us are single scholars. Broadly speaking, my own methodology has been that of the Venerable Bede, and I do not think that things have changed very much. I hope, therefore, that the new council will be encouraged to appreciate the different character of research in this area. It has been observed that this is   crucial work and we should not try to impose inappropriate models on it. Having said that, I warmly welcome the proposal in the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="40510-06_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   It has been 26 years since my membership of the Medical Research Council ended, so perhaps my experience is somewhat out of date. In those days the financial allocations made to the research councils were provided as a total sum by the government. The then advisory board for the research councils then recommended allocations to individual research councils. As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, observed, at that time it was quite clear that the research councils were totally independent of government and were absolutely autonomous in their decision making.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_21"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 21</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>However, the situation has changed. In those days we would not have accepted Clause 3(3) relating to a direction by the Secretary of State because independence was one of the principles underlying the activities of the research councils. However, today there is a Director General of the Research Councils who presumably is the agent of the Secretary of State and who may direct in this way. That, I think, was conceded many years ago.
</p>

<a name="40510-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Although I sympathise with the reasons why the noble Baroness has tabled these amendments, in retaining the principle of equity between the different research councils&#151;and I welcome very much the establishment of this new body&#151;it is reasonable to keep the clause as drafted.

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="40510-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   I rise to make a tiny point and in doing so I mean no disrespect to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. She has taken great trouble with her amendments to make sure that they observe the consequential order, but I observe that were Amendment No. 2 to be carried in Committee, I would move an amendment on Report that the words   &quot;Arts and Humanities Research&quot; should be substituted between the first two words of her amendment, and that the subsequent reference in line 7 to &quot;Arts and Humanities Research&quot; should be deleted.
</p>

<a name="40510-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>I appreciate that the words &quot;the council&quot; stand by themselves towards the end of Clause 2, but that is because the Arts and Humanities Research Council has already been referred to earlier in the clause. It is a purist&#039;s point, but it is sensible to be vigilant.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="40510-07_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   Let me begin by saying that it is interesting to see how keen noble Lords are to see this research council come into being, and I am very grateful for the support for the Arts and Humanities Research Council from all sides of the House. It is an important step.
</p>

<a name="40510-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>When we talk about the 1965 Act, and the underpinning that it gives this new legislation, it is important that we recognise that it is not precisely what is needed. That is why the Bill seeks to mirror that Act and to bring it up to date. It is important to recognise that that is a 39 year-old piece of legislation. When I was looking into this area of policy, I asked when we had last looked at the way the research councils were functioning, and how well they were functioning. I know that noble Lords in the Chamber will be aware of the quinquennial review in 2001, which found the system to be working well. It made a number of recommendations&#151;about the strategic framework, about working with other stakeholders&#151;but overall it was felt that the research councils were performing well. Adding this new research council is done on the basis that, in general, this is the right way to go. As the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, indicated, it is important, in setting up a new research council, to ensure a synergy of activity and the opportunity for councils to work together in areas where there is an overlap between the arts, humanities and science.
</p>

<a name="40510-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>We wanted to avoid a situation whereby, for example, the Office of Science and Technology&#151;to which the research council will report&#151;or even the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_22"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Department of Trade and Industry would need to offer different guidance to different research councils in advising them of their legal responsibilities. Nor did we want one reporting framework for some councils and another for the AHRC, which could make crosscutting programmes more difficult to achieve.

</p>

<a name="40510-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>So we have sought to mirror arrangements which we believe are working well, with the necessary updating of terminology. We will be setting out the detailed requirements for strategic and annual planning in the &quot;management statement and financial memorandum&quot;. That will be similar to that of other research councils and modelled on the guidelines applying to non-departmental public bodies.
</p>

<a name="40510-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>That is the backdrop to the approach that we have taken on these amendments. Amendments Nos. 2 and 4, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, are inter-linked. They would require the council to develop a programme of activities consistent with the objects set out in Clause 1. The Secretary of State would then be obliged to fund the carrying out of those activities. We   looked very carefully at the effect of these amendments, and I can reassure the Committee that the development of a programme of activities is already implicit within the research council&#039;s fulfilment of its objects, as outlined in Clause 1. That is the advice I have received. I hope that that will satisfy the noble Baroness.
</p>

<a name="40510-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>I am mindful of the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, on Amendment No.   3 about the way in which the research council will operate in terms of receiving its grants within the strategic overview that the Government will set. There are good examples of research councils receiving additional moneys for specific, additional special projects that the Government may wish them to look into. That has worked successfully in the past.
</p>

<a name="40510-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>We believe that the way in which research councils function&#151;receipt of their grant, strategic overview, reporting, because this is public money, but with autonomy over whom they choose to support&#151;is the right balance. If the noble Baroness would like more information, I would be more than happy to write to her and set that out in greater detail.

</p>

<a name="40510-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>In Amendment No. 3, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, suggests that we replace &quot;may&quot; with &quot;shall&quot;. I understand the objective of ensuring that the council is properly funded, but the existing &quot;may&quot; ties in with the discretionary power being given to the Secretary of State to determine how much she pays in respect of the expenses of the Arts and Humanities Research Council. The word &quot;shall&quot; would imply that the Secretary of State was obliged to pay the money and this would sit awkwardly with her discretionary power under this clause to determine how much she pays.
</p>

<a name="40510-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I am categorical in saying that the Secretary of State   has every intention of supporting the AHRC financially, and would certainly wish to pay the sums that are determined to be paid. Pending this Bill gaining Royal Assent and the secondary legislation gaining approval in the Scottish Parliament, and both in this House and the other place, we will be ensuring <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_23"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 23</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that there is a once-and-for-all transfer of funds to the Department of Trade and Industry. This will be from the departments responsible for the funding councils in Scotland, Wales and England as well as the Department of Education and Learning in Northern Ireland. Our objective is to ensure that the proposed Arts and Humanities Research Council is able to operate from 1 April 2005.

</p>

<a name="40510-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>Turning to Amendments Nos. 5 and 6, I want to establish a point of principle with regard to the funding. It is, as your Lordships will be aware, taxpayer&#039;s money. It will be important, as I have indicated, that there is   accountability for the use of that money. The seven science research councils work in support of the Government&#039;s strategic objectives for science and research, under the auspices of the Office of Science and Technology. Taken together, Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 would replace the existing subsection (3)&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, has indicated&#151;with similar wording which would have the same effect. We see no additional benefit gained by the proposed wording. I noted that the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, mentioned amendments that might come at a later stage in this area. We shall see, and I look forward to them if that is the case. We believe that the use of the Royal Charter is a means by which we can ensure that the research councils operate in an autonomous way within the strategic objectives that have been laid down.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="40510-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   Perhaps I did not make myself very clear, as I was distracted by someone&#039;s telephone. Could the Minister perhaps give us an example of when and how Ministers might wish to use the power contained in Clause 3(3)? In what circumstances would Ministers use this power to give a direction? What concerns me is the possibility of having a government which did not like some research which had been commissioned. We are not talking about pure science. It could be social research which went against the flagship policy of a particular government. There is always a worry that politicians might be tempted to use their power in a way which would minimise their embarrassment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="40510-07_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   It is hard to find an example of such behaviour on the part of Secretaries of State, although I am prepared to dig and find any that might be pertinent. The general way this clause would apply is if, for example because of changes in technology or because of a particular issue of great import to the nation, the Secretary of State felt it right and proper for the research council to undertake some research, then the Secretary of State would provide additional moneys and would direct the research council to undertake that research in whatever manner the research council felt was best. That is the normal usage to which this power has been put. If I am able to indicate some circumstances beyond that, I will of course write to the noble Lord, and place a copy in the Library of your Lordships&#039; House.

That is not an example of using the power of direction. If the Minister cannot think of an example where the power would be required, would it not be better to take it out of the Bill?

My clear understanding is that that is the case. If my understanding is wrong, rather than prolong the noble Lord&#039;s concern, I will of course put that right in a letter in the Library of the House. I have before me a couple of examples that may help the noble Lord and no doubt help the Minister as well.

<a name="40510-08_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   One concern which may arise relating to Clause 3(3) is not so much that the direction should invite or direct the research council to carry out research in a particular field&#151;there have been many examples of that in the Medical Research Council, and in the other research councils, over the years; I could cite the example of HIV/AIDS and very many more&#151;but that the Secretary of State may direct that certain research given priority by the research council should not be carried out. I think that that is the concern we would like to have allayed.

It is very clear to me that there are no indications from the work of the research councils or from the quinquennial review that the issue is of concern in the actuality of the circumstances, if I may put it like that. However, I undertake to look at it again on the understanding that the Government are clear about our intentions. However, I have heard the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Walton.

believe that this amendment could make the situation less clear. There is a risk, albeit a small one, that the addition of &quot;details&quot; could be interpreted as narrowing the scope of information provided within &quot;programmes and estimates&quot;.

</p>

<a name="40510-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>With those provisos, and on the understanding that I shall write to noble Lords on any points not covered&#151;and I pick up the comments of the noble Lords, Lord   Forsyth and Lord Walton, about ensuring that the wording entirely reflects our desires&#151;I hope that the   noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<a name="40510-08_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I thank the Minister for her response and other noble Lords for their contributions&#151;although they have not wholly supported my amendments.
</p>

<a name="40510-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I turn to the issue of examples and where it might be appropriate to give an explicit directive. The example that I had in mind, although it relates not to the research councils but to one of the funding councils, occurred about a year ago when the Minister put pressure on the Higher Education Funding Council to withdraw funding from those rated &quot;poor&quot; in the research assessment exercise. There was a dispute, as I understand it, and it became explicit in hearings before   the House of Commons Select Committee on Education and Skills that the funding council leadership was not too happy at that time to comply. I believe that an explicit letter was exchanged.

</p>

<a name="40510-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The point I was trying to make is that on these occasions it is better that the situation comes out into the open and there is an explicit letter of direction, as distinct from the Minister simply putting pressure on the research council chief executive and compliance behind the scenes. In the interest of public accountability we want to know about these matters. Implicitly, what I was trying to get at is that where such a direction is issued it should be an explicit direction in the form of a letter that goes to the research council and to which the research council has to respond. I think that most noble Lords understand that my wish in these amendments is to try to reinforce a degree of relative autonomy. The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, thought that I had done completely the opposite. Perhaps we can get together and think about how to come up with something better.
</p>

<a name="40510-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>I was not clear about one aspect of the Minister&#039;s reply. I had understood that the wording in Clause 3 was precisely that used in the Science and Technology Act 1965 and that one reason it could not be changed is that this wording applies to all other research councils. As the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, said, we do not wish to have separate rules relating to separate research councils. I would argue that this is an opportunity to update the rules of the research councils to bring them partly up-to-date with current practice. That was another reason why I tabled the amendments. Perhaps the noble Baroness can write to me on whether it is the 1965 Act. She implied that it had already been updated, but I did not think that that was so.

<a name="40510-08_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   We took the 1965 Act and updated the legal terminology, for example. As noble Lords have indicated, that legislation was passed 38 years ago. However, the thrust of what we were trying to do was to put the research councils on an equal par. Based especially on the quinquennial review, we were content that the research councils were   functioning very satisfactorily. That was the underlying principle. Off the top of my head I cannot remember whether the words exactly mirror the earlier ones, but I am happy to write to the noble Baroness. However, I think that the principle to which she alluded is right. We want these research councils to be the same. They work well. We believe it would be wrong for the Bill to change in any way the underlying way in which they work.

The issue must surely be whether the arrangements that are in place are working well. I have not heard any serious criticism from the existing research councils that the relationship with the Government, in terms of the kind of powers of direction that exist, is in any sense a problem. Were it one, then I think that we should be pressing the Minister to make changes. However, I honestly do not believe that there is an issue.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>My only question is on the drafting of the last provision of Clause 3. I think that it is improved by including &quot;details of&quot;.

<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
   &quot;ACADEMIC SALARIES REVIEW BOARD


<br>
<a name="amdtpar_0"></a>(1)   The Arts and Humanities Research Council shall set up an Academic Salaries Review Board (&quot;the Board&quot;) whose purpose is to report to the Council and through the Council to the Secretary of State on the level of salaries of teachers and research staff in higher and further education institutions in the United Kingdom and to advise on issues of parity&#151;


<br>
<a name="amdtpar_1"></a>(a)   by comparing the level of salaries of teachers and research   staff in the arts and humanities with those in other disciplines, including the biological, economic, engineering, environmental, medical, physical and social sciences, and


<br>
<a name="amdtpar_2"></a>(b)   by comparing academic salaries with those of other professions and fields of employment as they were in 1945 and in successive decades up to the present.


<br>

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_17"></a>(4)   The annual report of the Board shall be included as an appendix to the report which the Arts and Humanities Research Council gives the Secretary of State on the performance of its functions after the end of each financial year.


<br>
<a name="amdtpar_18"></a>(5)   When the Secretary of State lays the annual report of the   Council before each House of Parliament, as provided under section 4(3), he must accompany it with a statement indicating the measures which he may undertake in response to the advice of the Board.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_94"></a>The noble Lord said: With Amendment No. 8 we move away from the detail of the working of the Arts and Humanities Research Council, to which we shall no doubt return in Amendment No. 9. Like all noble Lords who have spoken, I welcome the upgrading of the status of the Arts and Humanities Research Board to that of a research council.
</p>

<a name="40510-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>I have wondered how to address a matter which is not explicitly referred to in the Bill, but which is one of deep concern to all who have an interest in higher education. At this point I declare an interest of a different kind; namely, that I am remunerated as a professor, but that is not the point I seek to make. My point is one to which many noble Lords addressed themselves in their Second Reading speeches which is   the issue of academic salaries. I ask myself, first, why there is no explicit mention of the issue in the Bill. As the matter is not addressed substantially in the Bill, it is very difficult to address in an amendment. The amendment could find a place, with a modification in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_29"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 29</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the wording, elsewhere in the Bill. I would be happy to consider that if the Minister felt that that were more appropriate.

</p>

<a name="40510-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>Many noble Lords feel that one of the great problems, which is not directly addressed in the Bill and scarcely addressed even indirectly, is that of academic salaries. That means that there is nothing that an amendment to the Bill can do to rectify the situation on academic salaries, but it is one of the most substantial problems in our universities today. An important component of the decline of our universities, which I and other noble Lords believe is taking place, is the decline in the level of academic salaries in comparison with other professions. I believe that the matter should be highlighted and kept constantly under review.
</p>

<a name="40510-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>That is why I believe that it is appropriate to propose that there should be an academic salaries review board which should report annually to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of State should be obliged to bring those comments before both Houses of Parliament annually, together with his observations on how he would seek to do something about the situation. I do not see how, by amendment, one can do more than that with the Bill, but I believe that that would be a useful step.
</p>

<a name="40510-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>The amendment needs little explanation. I remind the Minister that it was her noble friend Lord Eatwell who drew comparison between the level of academic salaries and the level of ministerial salaries, including her own&#151;very much to the detriment of academic salaries. The duty of setting up an academic salaries review board is here assigned to the Arts and Humanities Research Council simply for convenience. It could equally be set up as an independent entity and perhaps it should be. The main point is that it brings in a range of expertise and experience concerned with academic salaries and that it will report, as proposed, through the AHRC to the Secretary of State, who is obliged to lay it before Parliament, along with his comments.
</p>

<a name="40510-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>My intention is not to argue for parity of salaries among and between academic institutions; I want to bring into scrutiny the way in which, over the years, professional&#151;or non-manual salaries in general&#151;have risen much more than academic ones. The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education referred in their written evidence to the House of Commons Education and Skills Select Committee, as published in <i>The</i> <i>Future of Higher Education</i> to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;the 45% relative decline in [academic] earnings compared to non-manual income over the last 20 years&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>I am reasonably confident that if one made the comparison over the past 30 years the decline would be   more than 45 per cent. That is the problem to which the amendment seeks to draw attention in a systematic and, I hope, constructive way. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="40510-09_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   I am glad that the noble Lord has recognised in his address that if there is to be such a mechanism this is not the appropriate place. I suggest that a body concerned with research in the arts and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_30"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 30</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

humanities is not constituted to assess, nor would it be entirely disinterested in assessing, the levels of salaries in those areas. In fact, we had a review of the whole situation through the Betts Committee after my report several years ago. There is absolutely no doubt at all that academic salaries have fallen well behind comparators. I endorse the kind of figure that the noble Lord indicated, but if that is so well known I am unsure that there is a need to set up a committee to declare again that academic salaries are far lower than comparators. We need the funding to do something about it. I believe that through this Bill we can explore new sources of funding so that the employers, with whom this responsibility resides, can do something about it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="40510-09_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Morgan: </b>   I entirely endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, has said. However, the noble Lord is to be congratulated on raising the matter of academic salaries, which have been a scandal in public life for many decades. We have rehearsed the points in previous debates. The starting salaries are very low; the basic spine is very long; it takes a long time to receive a decent stipend; the people who enter academic life are commonly older, having done degrees; and women are likely to be in their late 20s, rather than mid-20s, and they have not been able to exert the kind of industrial muscle that others have.

</p>

<a name="40510-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>So there is a real point, which is deeply worrying, that the extra funding that universities will have is liable rightly to go into academic directions to provide for bursaries, access and so on, and that university teachers therefore will not benefit. However, I absolutely agree that attaching it to a body for funding research in humanities does not seem to be appropriate. The determination of stipends and the fostering of research are quite different entities. In determining academic stipends, a whole range of considerations applies&#151;the abilities of teachers and colleagues and the ability to innovate, other than, of course, the primacy given to research. I therefore hope that this issue can be dealt with in another place.

This does not seem to be the right place for the amendment, nor do I believe that it would provide the clout to change matters at all within the universities. Moreover, the composition of this board would not seem to be adequate for its purposes. While that may seem to be special pleading&#151;and I raised the issue at Second Reading&#151;at present there is a major problem within the medical schools whereby there is no parity and an increasing gap between National Health Service salaries and academic salaries.
</p>

<a name="40510-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>If one is to have representation, one would need to include representation from the Academy of Medical Sciences.

I am sure that my noble friend the Minister does not need any arguments from the Back Benches as to why she will not be able to accept the amendment. It is unfortunate that we have a Higher Education Bill that deals with the funding of higher education but does not contain any provisions for improving academic and related salaries. It has been said today, and was said at Second Reading, that it is a disgrace. It is only because of the dedication of the staff in the universities that they continue to produce the excellent, first class work that they do.
</p>

<a name="40510-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>When the Minister responds to the amendment, will she indicate whether there are any plans in her department to deal with this particular problem?

<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="40510-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </b>   I, too, appreciate the intention behind this amendment. I declare a former interest as someone who used to teach philosophy and discovered that philosophy was not very well rated in the marketplace but tended to be at the very lowest end of the salary scale in the university system. Nevertheless, I believe that this amendment is misplaced, for two reasons. First, we have here not even a baby Arts and Humanities Research Council, but an embryonic one. The prospect of it being redirected from its main objectives and effectively becoming the salaries review body, with a sub-committee that is the Arts and Humanities Research Council, is considerable, because that is what would get all the attention and publicity, and that distraction would annul the main point of this part of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40510-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>Nevertheless, will the Minister reassure us that if such a research council took the view, I believe quite properly, that the salary levels in this area of the academic world were so low that they imperilled the contribution made in Britain to this kind of research, it would be perfectly proper for such a research council to constitute a panel to review them and to make a public report, and that there would be no risk of it being told that it was <i>ultra vires</i> or that the Minister did not like it? Such an indication would reassure me immensely that the intention here, which is perfectly proper, can perhaps be realised within the existing proposals.

As a chancellor of a university rather than someone who works in one, I am in some respects perhaps somewhat semi-detached. I am proud to be the chancellor of the University of Bath.

</p>

<a name="40510-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>For anyone who has earned his or her living in other fields of endeavour, the level of salaries in the universities is perfectly shocking; there is no other word for it. When I consider the quality of people whom I   meet at the University of Bath or at Cambridge, to   which I am also attached as chairman of the development committee of my old college, Caius, and compare it with the quality of people whom I meet in the financial sector or in other areas in which I have earned a living, it seems to me that the discrepancy between the quality of such people on the one hand and their remuneration on the other is blatant to a degree that one would not have believed possible.
</p>

<a name="40510-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>As some Members of the Committee have said, it may be that this is not the ideal place in which to deal with the point raised by my noble friend Lord Renfrew, as he himself recognised. However, it seems to me to be symptomatic of the problem with which we are confronted that we can have a Higher Education Bill of this importance, including, in my view, a number of desirable and quite radical propositions, which makes no reference whatever to the question of remuneration. If in any other walk of life one tried to undertake serious and far-reaching reforms designed to improve the performance of the operation, the issue of remuneration would invariably be considered. That one can have a Bill of this kind, which makes no reference to academic salaries, seems to me to indicate the way in which they have fallen not only so far below the level at which they should be fixed but also so far outwith serious consideration.
</p>

<a name="40510-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>I hope, therefore, that the amendment tabled by my noble friend will lever out of the Government a counter proposition. I hope that the Minister will feel able to express a view about where academic salaries will fit into the Government&#039;s overall approach to improving the status and performance of the universities. In response to what my noble friend has said about the amendment and what other Members of the Committee have said in opposition to it, perhaps the Minister will also indicate how she will confront the issues about which concern has been expressed. In that spirit, I very much hope that the Government will give serious consideration to my noble friend&#039;s amendment.

Indeed, I feel passionately about salaries for academic-related and support staff as well.
</p>

<a name="40510-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>There is no doubt that as the noble Lord, Lord   Renfrew, said, along with just about every other noble Lord who has spoken, salaries for academic and support staff have fallen woefully behind those for <br>&nbsp;<br>

their comparators elsewhere. A university&#039;s key resource is its staff. Staff pay accounts for 58 per cent of universities&#039; expenditure, and if they cannot pay their staff adequately, all our universities will struggle to recruit and retain the best and the brightest.

</p>

<a name="40510-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>Universities have worked hard to make the initial academic careers of newly qualified researchers more secure. Noble Lords will know that the Universities and Colleges Employers&#039; Association&#151;the employers&#039; association for the higher education sector&#151;has just agreed a new pay framework for higher education with the seven trade unions, which will result in pay increases totalling at least 7.7 per cent by August 2004. However, calculations show that a total of &#163;602 million of additional investment will be needed over the next spending review for human resources in England and Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40510-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>That said, the amendment, as others have said, is not really the answer to the problem. The Bill is an important step in the right direction, addressing the overall funding needs of universities. If there is also adequate public investment so that the fee income which the Bill will guarantee is indeed additional, as we have been assured is the case by the Secretary of State, then universities will be in a position to begin to reverse the relative decline of university salaries. I hope that the Minister might take the opportunity to confirm this in her reply.
</p>

<a name="40510-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>Research staff in humanities departments will continue to be supported by funds other than those applied by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, which will fund research on a project basis. Researchers will be financed through the university&#039;s general resources from the Further Education Funding Council&#039;s funds and fees, not from research council grants. UCEA already provides a single employers&#039; association for the higher education sector and a framework mechanism through which universities can negotiate pay for all their academic and support staff, taking account of the overall resources that can be made available for salaries.
</p>

<a name="40510-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>Since, as other noble Lords have said, the amendment would radically extend the functions of the AHRC, giving it a role far greater than its funding responsibilities, I do not believe that it would be helpful to the research council&#039;s functioning, and consequently I cannot support it. However, like other noble Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, for providing the opportunity to debate this issue.

<a name="40510-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I, too, congratulate my noble friend on his ingenuity in raising this matter. I do not think that the amendment is in the wrong place; I think it is perfectly legitimate for us to discuss the issue in this context. However, I think the noble Lord, Lord   Sutherland, hit upon the kind of example which might tempt a Secretary of State to use his or her powers, which we discussed earlier, under Clause 3(3). If the research council were to set up the equivalent of a pay review body, I think that those in the Treasury would have a heart attack, and a direction would come from the Secretary of State. That is one of the reasons I still worry about the clause as it stands.

</p>

<a name="40510-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>My noble friend is right to draw attention to the problem of academic salaries. There is no one in this House who does not feel strongly, indeed passionately, about it. However, the fact is that nothing will be done about it until the universities have the resources with   which to pay people. The noble Baroness, Lady   Warwick, talked passionately about her concerns, but she has supported a government who have seen the unit of resource fall in real terms. So all this talk about how we need to do more on academic pay is just hot air unless there is a way of increasing resources. Tearing up the Bill would save the taxpayer &#163;200 million&#151;it will cost &#163;200 million more than it will raise in revenues from fees&#151;which would be well spent, I suggest, on academic pay.
</p>

<a name="40510-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>I do not think that the solution lies in having a salaries review board. All kinds of pay review bodies have come and gone with their recommendations and, ultimately, it is a political decision about the priorities of government. The reason that academic pay is so scandalously low is that the continual decline in the unit of resource for universities, coupled with expansion plans, which have seen lecturers have to teach smaller and smaller classes, has not been funded. It was not funded properly by the government of whom I was a member&#151;I freely acknowledge that&#151;and it is funded considerably less well by the present Government. That is why this continues to be an issue and the Bill does not in any way address it.
</p>

<a name="40510-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>I congratulate my noble friend on raising this matter and drawing to our attention the fact that the Bill makes no progress in this direction. If he did not make this point, then I certainly shall: the Bill actually makes the problem worse by spending scarce resources on paying for the financing of a fees regime, which we will no doubt discuss when we come to Part 3 of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40510-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I believe that pay among academics has actually fallen by about 40 per cent since 1980. In his speech on Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Winston, drew attention to something extraordinary&#151;if you visit institutions overseas, again and again you see some of our brightest academics. Why are they there? Because they are able to pursue their research and teaching interests with a degree of freedom and because their salaries are considerably higher. What is needed is a much broader view about how to restore excellence and standards in our universities and find the very considerable resources that will be needed to achieve that.

<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="40510-11_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Blackstone: </b>   I should like to declare an interest at this point, as I am both a visiting professor at the London School of Economics&#151;unpaid&#151;and the Vice-Chancellor designate of the University of Greenwich, where I will be paid.

</p>

<a name="40510-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>I am a little worried about the tenor of this debate. Like others, I share the view that academic salaries have   fallen far too much relative to many other similar   professions. I admired what my noble friend Lord Eatwell said on Second Reading; it was a very interesting rhetorical gesture to suggest that the Minister was overpaid compared with academics. I want to come in on the side of the Minister, since she is, in my view, not <br>&nbsp;<br>

terribly well paid, and not terribly well paid compared with a lot of senior people in management in universities. However, that is an aside.
</p>

<a name="40510-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>My real concern is that although it is ingenious to introduce an amendment relating to the Arts and Humanities Research Council about academic pay, this really is not the right place to introduce an amendment for an academic review salary board, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, admitted. I remind the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, who I think has just admitted this, that it has been the view of not only this Government but previous governments that it is not really appropriate to set up a review body of this sort. I was, incidentally, extremely surprised to hear my noble friend Lord Sutherland&#151;my old sparring partner in the University of London&#151;suggest that the AHRC should be allowed to set up a committee to look at academic salaries among people who work in the arts and humanities. I think that that would be an inappropriate use of the time of members of that research board. They should be focused on the real issue of funding excellent scholarship and research in the fields for which they are responsible.


</p>

<a name="40510-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>My main reason for being concerned about this debate is that a number of noble Lords have forgotten that this Bill will bring about a substantial amount of additional funding through fee income which will allow universities to pay higher salaries if they so choose. I make that point to my noble friend Lord   Morgan.
</p>

<a name="40510-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>In the spending review that followed the Betts Committee&#039;s report, some additional public money was ring fenced for academic salaries. I make that point to my noble friend Lady Lockwood. However, governments should not do that too often because it jeopardises the autonomy of universities.
</p>

<a name="40510-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>It is up to universities&#151;and to people like me in my next job&#151;to ensure that at least some of any additional funding that comes through either as fee income or as proper public support for universities should be shared with academics who work so hard across our university system. They deserve to be paid better. I remind your Lordships that this House is normally very concerned about preserving the autonomy of universities, and, in the last resort, it is for them to decide what they pay their staff.

<a name="40510-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>My point is that an arts and humanities research council may well properly say that the quality of research&#151;and the quality of people whom we recruit <br>&nbsp;<br>

to research in these areas in the UK&#151;is declining very sharply. One of the reasons may well be that the salaries in this area of the academic world are very bad. If that is so, I would have thought that it is a perfectly proper interest for a research council to have.
</p>

<a name="40510-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>There is a precedent in this context. I was chairman of the postgraduate studentships committee in the arts and humanities, which was an earlier predecessor of what it is now hoped to bring to birth. At that stage we looked at postgraduate scholarships. They were evidently very low&#151;lower than in some of the other areas&#151;and we hitched ourselves up, firstly on the back of the Science Research Council, and above them, the Medical Research Council, and above them, the Wellcome Trust. It was a proper issue for us to discuss at that stage, and I hope that, in extreme situations, an analogy with that would be possible for such a research council.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="40510-11_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Blackstone: </b>   There is absolutely no problem with the suggestion of noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, that the Arts and Humanities Research Council should comment on the position of researchers or more senior academics in teaching posts. This includes the numbers of good people coming forward and the possibility that this may be related to pay. When he spoke for the first time, I think he suggested that it would be reasonable&#151;and that the Government should accept&#151;that the AHRC should set up a special committee to look at salaries. That would not be a sensible use of its time, nor would it be appropriate for one research council alone to start doing this. The other research councils would then feel they had to follow, and that would be a distraction from their main task.

<a name="40510-11_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   In my notes against this amendment I have written, &quot;Support in spirit, but it&#039;s the wrong place&quot;. I therefore fall with the majority of noble Lords who have spoken in this debate: we are all very well aware of the erosion of academic salaries in real terms, and would like to see a solution to that issue.
</p>

<a name="40510-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat, spoke about those coming from other walks of life. This morning I had a meeting with the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge who, as many noble Lords know, has just come back from America. She said that she had not realised how drastically academic salaries had fallen in real terms in this country, and how difficult it was to recruit people&#151;young people, in particular&#151;to academic jobs these days. As we know, they have to face substantial house prices. If they wish to move to somewhere in the south-east of England it is very difficult for them.
</p>

<a name="40510-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>We should be aware of this, and of the degree to which this erosion took place over a long period of years. Some Noble Lords may know that I was an active member of an organisation called Save British Science in the 1980s and early 1990s. When we talked about the problems that the erosion of academic salaries would create in the recruitment of new postgraduate students, we were called &quot;moaning Minnies&quot;.

<a name="40510-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   I will be brief. If your Lordships will forgive the medical analogy, it is true that the state of academic salaries has been a running sore which has continued to fester for decades. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, for raising this issue, but I agree with other Members of the Committee who have said that the function of a research council is not to be a salary negotiating body.
</p>

<a name="40510-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, said, the establishment of a salaries review body might well give the Secretary of State a heart attack. Part 4 of the Bill deals with student support. Is there not a case for having a new part 5 for staff support, in which the issue of a salaries review body to look at the state of academic salaries could be considered? I raise that in a purely speculative sense.
</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="40510-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Eatwell: </b>   Since my noble friend Baroness Blackstone referred to my contribution at Second Reading, I should clarify what I said. I did not say that the Minister was overpaid. I said that the salary of her post in 1980 corresponded to a middle-ranking to senior university lecturer at that time. Her salary now is &#163;30,000 per year more than that person.
</p>

<a name="40510-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>In summing up, the Minister said, &quot;I think I earn my salary&quot;. I think that university lecturers earn her level of salary too. What has happened over this period is that for a variety of reasons university salaries have fallen dramatically behind.
</p>

<a name="40510-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>However, I did not rise simply to clarify that point. We must be very careful about spending the money that we generate by this Bill over and over again on different things. That is what I have heard today.
</p>

<a name="40510-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>I hope that the Minister will not claim that the fee income which will be generated from the fee proposals in the Bill will solve the problem of salaries, because it is not. I hope that the fee income generated in this Bill will be invested in excellence&#151;excellence in teaching and excellence in research&#151;and providing equipment for researchers in universities. The salaries problem is so serious that it requires an entirely separate endeavour. It requires to be considered in and of itself and not to be rolled up for us to be provided with the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="40510-12_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I hesitate to rise again, but perhaps the Minister could deal with that point when she replies to what has turned out to be a wide-ranging debate. I noticed that the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, was attempting to spend the money on pay. She said that the additional funding of &#163;900   million would help with pay, and that we had forgotten it. However, north of the Border there will be no increase in tuition fees, which means that if any of the money were to be spent on salaries it could not be spent in that way north of the Border.
</p>

<a name="40510-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Certainly, north of the Border, there is widespread concern among academic staff that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, is predicting, some of the money will be used on pay and that there will be a salary gradient between Scotland and England. In that case, some of the most talented brains in the country&#151;being Scottish&#151;would move south towards the lure of extra cash, which would be extremely damaging to the universities.
</p>

<a name="40510-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, made the point that there was a separate issue here&#151;the problem of university salaries. The Bill will make that problem urgent. Will the Minister say, in responding to this cleverly worded amendment, whether the Government might commit themselves to addressing the problem? The integrity of the institutions north of the Border could well be damaged by being kept in the same position as those south of the Border, which have been damaged already by having insufficient funds to meet their salary needs.

<a name="40510-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>My noble friend&#039;s new clause is worded in such a way as to provide it with a locus in the Bill. The arrangement for settling these matters was different in the early 1980s, when I was parliamentary secretary to the late great Sir Keith Joseph and had to deal with the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, when she represented the AUT. However, I had to respond, not statutorily but spontaneously, to a revisit by the Brookings Institute to its very comprehensive UK report of 1968. In it, the institute criticised engineering and scientific salaries in the UK, which it said were so distorted as to cause jobs of one discipline to be done by the other and vice versa, to the detriment of the national interest. In the early 1980s, it reported that no serious or significant change had occurred in the intervening 15   years since the first report.

comments made by other Members of the Committee. I wholly support the curiosity of the noble Baroness, Lady Lockwood, which my noble friend&#039;s new clause has provoked, about what the Government&#039;s general intentions are in these matters. It seems to me that the subject cannot be raised too often, so no harm whatever has been done by having this debate.

<a name="40510-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, expressed anxiety about philosophy salaries, but I can give him one word of comfort. My late noble kinsman read philosophy at Balliol and was interested when his philosophy tutor, at the beginning of World War II, was made metals controller for the United Kingdom. He asked him what   his qualifications were&#151;to which his former tutor replied that his qualifications were unique and incidentally invaluable. First, as a philosopher, he was trained to ask questions, and the metal industry was one with a great many questions to be asked about it. Secondly, everybody else in the industry besides himself had an emotional involvement in one metal or another&#151;whether wolfram or tungsten. His unique contribution was that he had no emotional involvement in any of them.

Perhaps there could be a couple of people from the real world, as the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat, said. We should not have chairmen of research bodies on the board&#151;they do not know anything because they are equally low paid. There should be some outside people&#151;not academics.

Indeed, I see that on the list of priorities of the Conservative spokesman, Mr Letwin, universities do not feature. I do not believe that the money is going to come from any government. That is why I find the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, rather strange. He said that the free income, which is an essential part of the Bill, will be used on many things rather than salaries. Judging by the institutions with which I have talked, I believe that the first claim probably will be salaries. In that I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone&#151;the money will be used to stop the brain drain.
</p>

<a name="40510-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>The noble Lord believes that the problem with salaries is so great that it requires a great deal of attention, but I do not know who is going to give it that attention. No government will come forward and give enormous sums of money to the universities to catch up for the past 30 or 40 years. It is unrealistic to believe that that would happen.
</p>

<a name="40510-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The fundamental part of this Bill will give universities an alternative source of income, in fees which over the years will build up and will give them an opportunity. Ultimately, one wants not a salary review body but freedom for the universities. That is the golden vision on the hill&#151;that universities should be free to teach what they want, recruit whom they want and charge what they want for the services that they provide. This Bill is a hesitant step along that road. Until we get to that point&#151;and it will take some years and perhaps a decade or two to overcome that deficiency&#151;we have to start out along that road.

<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="40510-13_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The issue of academic pay has quite rightly caused great debate in the Chamber. I am most grateful to all Members of the Committee who participated in it, and especially to the   noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, for tabling the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40510-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>I can assure my noble friend Lord Eatwell that when I said in my closing remarks that I thought I earned my money, I did not wish to suggest for one moment that academics or many other people involved in working life do not earn theirs. My privilege and pleasure is to stand before this Chamber, and I am overpaid for the privilege of so doing. I would not wish to suggest anything about anyone else in what was meant to be a moment of levity. That will teach me!
</p>

<a name="40510-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>As Members of the Committee have said, academic salaries have increased by an average of only 20 per cent since 1980, while average earnings have increased by about 60 per cent and graduate earnings by even more. I recognise that the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, in seeking to put the amendment within the remit of the Arts and Humanities Research Council, has done <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_41"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 41</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

so primarily to ensure that it falls within the scope of the Bill. I shall seek to address the issues of generality in the noble Lord&#039;s remarks, rather than the specifics relating to the Arts and Humanities Research Council. I believe that is what the noble Lord intended.
</p>

<a name="40510-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>I can tell my noble friends Lord Sutherland and Lady Blackstone that, if the research council wished to consider this issue, it would not be <i>ultra vires</i> to do so. It could commission such a report. It would fit within its responsibilities to provide advice but it would have   to relate specifically to the research council&#039;s responsibilities, that is the arts and humanities. But I agree with my noble friend that this is not the best focus for a research council, especially in the early stages. As noble Lords have indicated, salaries are the responsibility of individual institutions as employers. However, if the research council felt that it was an appropriate report to commission, because it was relevant to work that it was undertaking, it could do so. It is important that I say that immediately.
</p>

<a name="40510-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>We recognise that there is much to be done to improve academic salaries but it is not for the Government to regulate them or to dictate what they should be. As my noble friend Lady Blackstone has indicated, we believe very strongly that educational institutions are independent, autonomous bodies that must have the power to manage their resources as they see fit. As employers, they are responsible for determining the level of pay for their staff through negotiation with the staff and the relevant unions. I am sure that noble Lords would agree that, in principle, institutions are the best judges of how to deploy the resources made available to them.
</p>

<a name="40510-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>However, as noble Lords have said, public funding levels indicate what institutions can pay their staff. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat, that the fact that this is not specifically within the Bill does not mean that its importance is not recognised, nor that we do not wish to see this debate take place in your Lordships&#039; House on this and other occasions. It is an important issue, but it is not one for legislation. Inevitably, in looking at issues around the White Paper on higher education, the Bill focuses only on issues where legislation is required.

</p>

<a name="40510-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that overall funding for higher education will reach &#163;10 billion a year by 2006. We have provided a total of &#163;330 million to improve institutions&#039; human resource capabilities between 2001&#150;02 and 2003&#150;04. A further &#163;167 million will be provided between 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 through the Rewarding and Developing Staff in Higher Education initiative. The intention of this funding is to help institutions recruit and retain staff by improving their human resource capabilities. As noble Lords will be aware from their involvement in universities, recruiting and keeping staff is an issue that often does not come down to pay alone. It is important that we support universities in all the ways in which they try to ensure that they have the right staff at the right level. However, the noble Lord, Lord Baker, with his knowledge and deep experience, is right about the issue of academic pay. We hope that, with the additional resources available to institutions, there will be opportunities to consider the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_42"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 42</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

issue of academic pay because it is such an important factor in the quality of universities. The Office of Science and Technology and the research councils take this issue very seriously and they have mechanisms in place to respond to the requirements of their respective research communities.

</p>

<a name="40510-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>As a direct response to the Roberts review of the supply of people with science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills, <i>SET for Success</i>, which has been discussed in your Lordships&#039; House, action has been taken to encourage the best scientists at undergraduate level to continue their studies and to pursue careers in research and development in the UK. As noble Lords are aware, this has included increasing the PhD minimum stipend from &#163;8,000 in 2002&#150;03 to &#163;12,000 by 2005&#150;06 and creating 1,000 new academic fellowships to provide attractive routes into academia.
</p>

<a name="40510-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Noble Lords will also know that in further education we are planning an additional investment of &#163;1.2 billion in 2005&#150;06, a real terms increase of 19 per cent compared to 2002&#150;03. In 2002&#150;03 the total planned FE expenditure allocated to the Learning and Skills Council was &#163;4.4   billion. This will rise to &#163;5.6   billion in 2005&#150;06.
</p>

<a name="40510-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I share the concerns of noble Lords about academic salaries. I have listened very carefully to all the comments that have been made by noble Lords today, but I do not believe that it is the Government&#039;s job to dictate the level at which they are set. Noble Lords will not be surprised to hear me say that monitoring academic salaries is not an appropriate role for the research council. Our proposals for higher education are intended to empower institutions to use their freedom to ensure that they flourish, doing what they do best. We do not wish to micromanage universities, rather we want to give them the support that they need.
</p>

<a name="40510-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Baker, spoke about a matter that has been raised on many occasions by noble Lords: the issue of the brain drain of UK academic staff to overseas institutions offering higher pay. Noble Lords have often indicated individual cases, which I am certain are correct, where individuals have been attracted to posts elsewhere. However, we have no evidence to suggest that this is a trend. Indeed, the evidence suggests that the UK is a net beneficiary of the increasing migration of science and engineering talent, which is the area about which we have information. However, as this is important, I can assure your Lordships that the Office of Science and Technology is looking at what further work can be done to obtain better evidence on this subject, not least in view of the comments that have been made by noble Lords about their experiences.
</p>

<a name="40510-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, specifically spoke on the situation north of the Border in Scotland. The noble Lord has already indicated to me that this is an issue that is of particular importance to him. He will not be surprised to hear me say that it is the job of the   Scottish Executive to determine fees in Scotland. Under the Barnett formula, they will have resources equivalent to those available in England to address the needs of higher education. The Scottish Executive have choices to make about what to do with that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_43"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 43</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

resource and are in the middle of looking at a report. I gather that we will have some conclusions on it in June, no doubt in time to discuss it in your Lordships&#039; House during the passage of this Bill.

</p>

<a name="40510-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>It is the responsibility of the sector to monitor its own salary arrangements. Noble Lords referred to the Bett report, conducted by Sir Michael Bett. It has just finished its first full year and we look with interest to see where it will develop in future. My noble friend Lady   Warwick of Undercliffe described in some detail how the 10 negotiating arrangements have been replaced by a national council and the importance of that change, so I shall not repeat it. We believe that we will be able to obtain better data on staffing in higher education through the Higher Education Statistics Agency. As noble Lords will know, it currently covers only academic staff working 25 per cent or more of a full-time equivalent. From 2003&#150;04, this will be extended to all academic staff and will include non-academic staff for the first time so that the basis upon which information is available will improve. Sir   Michael Bett&#039;s work is under way and should be given an opportunity to develop. The negotiating councils have come together into the national council and I believe that these are opportunities to address some of the concerns that have been raised. I argue that it is a better way of addressing the issues that have been raised than that suggested by the noble Lord&#039;s amendment.
</p>

<a name="40510-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>It is absolutely true that the unit of resource in higher education is lower than it once was. The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, will not be surprised to hear me say that between 1989 and 1997 it was cut by 36 per cent in real terms. But we are raising funding by 7 per cent in real terms between 2002&#150;03 and 2005&#150;06. I know that we will have the opportunity to debate all of these issues in more detail later, but I want to state categorically that we are committed to the funding of higher education. I say to my noble friend that, in terms of this being additional money, she need look no further than to the Chancellor&#039;s comments in his Budget Statement, which I shall be happy to supply to noble Lords to make that point absolutely clear. I look   forward to any proposals that the noble Lord, Lord   Forsyth, may wish to put forward in the course of our discussions about higher education funding to see what he might wish to offer to noble Lords and to the institutions represented here. I await his proposals with great interest.

</p>

<a name="40510-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>All in all, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord   Renfrew, for a very important debate. I understand and agree completely with the sentiments that have been expressed. It is right that academic salaries have slipped badly behind. It is the purpose of the Bill to try to gain additional resources for the sector. We recognise the importance of autonomy within institutions. Although I support the sentiments behind the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, I do not support it and on that basis I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw it.

<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="40510-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Winston: </b>   Before my noble friend sits down, she made the assertion that we may be a net beneficiary of the brain drain. I wonder whether that is true of the sciences. Will she undertake to publish metrics to demonstrate whether or not that is the case and where the evidence for that lies because it is a very important issue for British universities? Perhaps we could look at those figures in the full light of day.
</p>




<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="40510-14_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The Roberts review concluded that while there is anecdotal evidence of top scientists being tempted to work abroad by better pay and conditions, there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the UK is suffering from a serious brain drain. Indeed, the report&#039;s conclusions were that we appeared to be a net beneficiary. However, as I indicated, not least because of the experience of many noble Lords, including my noble friend, work is under   way at OST to consider what further work needs to be carried out to gather more substantial evidence to address the concerns that the noble Lord has indicated. If figures are available to be put in the public domain, I shall with pleasure ensure that that is done.
</p>




<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="40510-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn: </b>   I am very grateful to noble Lords who have taken part in the debate. I am also grateful to the Minister for her sympathetic response. I meant to say earlier that I was grateful for her letter after my speech at Second Reading in which she made one or two relevant points.
</p>

<a name="40510-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>If there is one point on which there is general agreement, it is that my amendment is in the wrong place. I see the truth of that point. Since tabling it, I have been advised by people competent to advise that I may have been over modest in seeking an umbrella, as it were; that is, in seeking to establish the Arts and Humanities Research Council as an umbrella body. I am advised that it may well be possible for me to set down such a proposal as a freestanding item rather in the manner which the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, suggested.
</p>

<a name="40510-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>I shall not try to respond to every point that has been made. However, given that the amendment probably is in the wrong place, two general sentiments have been expressed. The first is that there is a serious problem which is not being adequately addressed. I felt that the second sentiment was present, for example, in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. I thought that it contained an element of complacency, if I may be so bold as to say so, in the sense of saying, &quot;We know this   already. Do we need to say it again?&quot; I am not at all happy with that position. Likewise, I am not happy   with the position that I felt was expressed on behalf of Universities UK by the noble Baroness, Lady   Warwick, who suggested that the matter is being addressed by the present Bill. I hate to disagree with my noble friend Lord Baker, but there was an element of that in his speech.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_45"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 45</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>I do not believe that the position is being effectively addressed by the present Bill. As I understand it, in reality the money raised in top-up fees and so forth&#151;some of it, of course, will be paid in other ways, for example, in bursaries to reduce the net income to universities&#151;will cover about half of the recurrent deficit of many university budgets. That means that universities will probably be worse off in the near future than they are now. It is clear from what is happening at my university, Cambridge&#151;I believe that this applies to many others&#151;which is looking seriously at current deficits that a number of posts will be blocked when they become vacant. I do not know whether there will be obligatory redundancies. I hope that that will be avoided. I do not see any prospect in the present climate of academic salaries being significantly enhanced. I should be interested if anyone connected with the finances of the university world could speak to the contrary.

</p>

<a name="40510-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Tugendhat for speaking as one who comes to the university world from outside, although he has a distinguished role in it as Chancellor of the University of Bath, and is astonished at the disparity between academic and other salaries. I very much take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Desai, that if there is to be such a board as I propose, it would do well to have some outside opinions on it. That point was very well made.
</p>

<a name="40510-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>I do not consider that the problem is going away. I am not optimistic that an academic research board, even if properly set up and set up in the right place, would do very much about it, but if the Secretary of State were obliged to comment annually on the matter to both Houses of Parliament, it would at least give the matter some of the attention which it deserves. I shall read speeches with care and take further advice. I may seek the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, not only in the spirit but also in the letter on Report. In the mean while, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="40510-14_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   Before the noble Lord sits down, may I dispel my complacency? I totally agreed about the facts; I said that what we wanted was action.

<a name="time_9"></a>
<a name="40510-14_time0"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="40510-14_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Bach): </b>  My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence earlier this afternoon in another place on Iraq, the current security situation and allegations of mistreatment. The Statement is as follows:
</p>

<p> 
<a name="40510-14_spopq0"></a><b>  </b> 
<a name="qnpa_4"></a>&quot;First of all I would like to bring the House up to date in relation to the current security situation in Iraq.


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_5"></a>&quot;Recent weeks have seen British forces, our coalition allies and the Iraqi police facing violent attacks in southern Iraq. This weekend saw the most violence so far, with more than 100 engagements between violent insurgents and coalition forces. Eleven British soldiers and one Dane were injured in these clashes. Our forces have captured a very large quantity of arms and ammunition from the Muqtada militia. The insurgents are armed with mortars, rocket propelled grenades and a wealth of automatic weapons. We have captured 10 multi-launch rocket tubes, 300 mortar rounds and three wire-guided missiles over this weekend.


</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_6"></a>&quot;This upsurge in violence appears to have followed calls at some Friday prayers for attacks against the coalition. Many of those who responded have a violent and criminal background that predates the arrival of the coalition in Iraq last year. They are thugs, not freedom fighters. They do not enjoy the support of the majority of people in Iraq who welcome the strong security action we are taking. These attacks against Iraqis and Iraqi institutions are a challenge to the rule of law, an attempt to disrupt reconstruction efforts and an   attempt to deliberately damage the transition to a democratic Iraq. No sensible person can condone these attacks&#151;everyone should support our efforts to deal with them in the interests of the Iraqi people.


</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_7"></a>&quot;The situation in both Basra and Al Amarah remains tense, but Iraqi police are patrolling and are engaged in other security tasks. Further violence is likely in the coming days. British and Iraqi forces will continue to confront such challenges. As ever, they will do so with the minimum necessary use of force and with great care to avoid an unnecessary impact on the wider population.


</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_8"></a>&quot;Last week my right honourable friend the Minister for Armed Forces made a Statement about allegations of abuse by UK forces in Iraq. I would like to deal with developments since that Statement.


</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_9"></a>&quot;There have been further details and images of abuse by US forces, and further claims against British soldiers published mainly in the <i>Daily</i> <i>Mirror</i>. Last week my right honourable friend made clear that if allegations are found to be true, then those responsible for damaging the otherwise excellent reputation of our Armed Forces will be rooted out and dealt with.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_47"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 47</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>

</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_10"></a>&quot;The unauthorised actions of a very few must not be allowed to undermine the outstanding work of tens of thousands of British soldiers and civilians who have served with distinction, compassion and sensitivity in Iraq now for over a year. We regret the shadow that has been cast across the excellent work being undertaken, under very difficult circumstances, to establish security and to rebuild Iraq.


</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_11"></a>&quot;The UK requires its forces to act at all times within the UK law, which means that they must comply with   the Geneva Convention and international humanitarian law. Allegations of improper behaviour will be thoroughly investigated. We are not in any way complacent about such allegations.


</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_12"></a>&quot;The 33 cases of Iraqi civilian deaths, injuries and ill-treatment, which my right honourable friend mentioned last week, that have been or are under investigation, testify to our determination. These investigations were not begun in response to the ICRC, to Amnesty or as the result of media pressure. We investigate ourselves through the Royal Military Police Special Investigations Branch immediately evidence is to hand.


</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_13"></a>&quot;In these investigations it is essential that the integrity of the criminal justice process is maintained. This can involve detailed and lengthy processes, but these are crucial to allow the necessary impartial evaluation of the evidence. I can confirm today that two cases have reached an advanced stage with decisions on prosecution pending.


</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_14"></a>&quot;Obviously, it is important that the legal processes should be completed independently, but I want to say on behalf of the British Government that we unreservedly apologise to any Iraqis, where the evidence shows they have been mistreated&#151;whether, as Amnesty has set out in recent correspondence, in the general interactions between British troops on the ground in Iraq, or in the more specific issues raised by the ICRC about Iraqis detained in British controlled facilities.


</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_15"></a>&quot;The confidential report from the ICRC to Ambassador Bremer in February dealt with detention issues. We have always maintained a close and constructive relationship with the ICRC in Iraq. My   right honourable friend the Minister of State for   the Armed Forces had a meeting with Dr Jacob Kellenburger, ICRC President, in May last year, and officials in the Ministry of Defence met the ICRC in April 2004.


</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_16"></a>&quot;It has been the practice of the ICRC to keep these reports confidential&#151;not simply to maintain a positive working relationship between governments and the ICRC, but also to protect those mentioned in the reports. It is important that this confidentiality is respected. Roland Huguenin-Benjamin of the ICRC said at the weekend:




<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;We usually do this in direct confidential contact with the detaining power. We do not believe very much that there is a lot of interest for the prisoners themselves of having those kind of issues exposed in the public domain&quot;.</p>
</ul>
</p><p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_48"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 48</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


<a name="stpa_172"></a>&quot;The interim report in February dealt with ICRC visits to coalition facilities between March and November last year. It raised three specific concerns in respect of British forces treatment of prisoners and internees. Since these issues are already in the public domain it is appropriate for me to comment further.


</p>

<a name="40510-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_17"></a>&quot;The first is in respect of the death in custody of Baha Mousa, also known as Baha Maliki, in September last year. A Royal Military Police investigation was launched at that time. The case has featured frequently in the media since then and was raised by the honourable Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr during an adjournment debate in January this year. It was also the subject of an Amnesty International letter writing campaign. My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces wrote to Amnesty about the case on 11   November and again on 27 January. It follows that, by the time the ICRC referred to the case in its February report, a thorough investigation was well under way and the Government had made frequent public comment about it.


</p>

<a name="40510-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_18"></a>&quot;The second concern raised by the ICRC related to the United Kingdom was in respect of the routine hooding of prisoners. This practice had already ceased in UK facilities from September last year, and this change has also been confirmed publicly.


</p>

<a name="40510-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_19"></a>&quot;In the third case a detainee had claimed that his car was confiscated. We were not able to shed light on the   case. The individual was briefed on our claims procedure and provided with a claim form, but nothing more has been heard from him.


</p>

<a name="40510-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_20"></a>&quot;The interim ICRC report was not seen by Ministers until very recently. This was because it was an interim report to Ambassador Bremer, passed to the UK in strict confidence. A follow-on UK-specific report was, in any event, anticipated; and, in these cases relevant to UK forces, the action necessary to address the ICRC&#039;s concerns had been taken some five months before the report was issued. In February, therefore, officials at permanent joint headquarters judged that there was no action that Ministers needed to take, at least until any further reports were received.


</p>

<a name="40510-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_21"></a>&quot;Since the programme of ICRC visits last year, we have opened a new divisional temporary detention facility in southern Iraq. The ICRC visited the site before it opened, has visited twice since&#151;in February and April&#151;and is due to visit again next week. We remain committed to consultation with the ICRC and comply fully with its requests for access. The ICRC has yet to submit a formal report to the Government in respect of the two visits it has carried out, but has provided working reports to our forces in theatre. It is fair to say that the ICRC is generally satisfied with our approach and that it described conditions of internment as, &#039;fairly good&#039;. We will continue to work closely with it to ensure prisoners&#039; concerns are addressed.


</p>

<a name="40510-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_22"></a>&quot;There have, in addition, been representations made by a number of other groups, including Amnesty International, making allegations about incidents, of some of which the Ministry of Defence <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_49"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 49</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

was not previously aware. These incidents do not involve allegations about detainees. We will always take any such credible allegations seriously. Consequently, at the beginning of March, we began the process of a thorough trawl of the records of units produced in Iraq since the commencement of operations last year. This is a considerable task which we expect to last a few more weeks yet. But I can assure the House that if it reveals further examples of incidents that merit formal investigation, then those investigations will follow. And in turn, if British forces are found to have acted unlawfully, then the appropriate action will be taken. That has happened in every single case so far.


</p>

<a name="40510-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_23"></a>&quot;Those thorough and detailed investigations have also been necessary in relation to the photographs published by the <i>Daily Mirror</i> some days ago. These photographs are central to accusations concerning the behaviour of British troops, in particular, the Queen&#039;s Lancashire Regiment.


</p>

<a name="40510-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_24"></a>&quot;I can tell the House that as a result of those further investigations the Special Investigations Branch has informed me that there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in Iraq during the relevant period. Additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this fact.


</p>

<a name="40510-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_25"></a>&quot;The SIB have interviewed at length the soldier described by the <i>Daily Mirror</i> as &quot;Soldier C&quot;. We are grateful to &quot;Soldier C&quot; for coming forward. However, I can assure the House that the allegation at the centre of his evidence, which is once again the case of Baha Mousa, has already been investigated and the case is currently with the Army Legal Services for consideration. When interviewed by the Royal Military Police, &quot;Soldier C&quot; did not have any new evidence to add to what was already known as a result of our own investigations. Indeed, as I have already mentioned, these allegations were widely covered in other newspapers many months ago. I leave it to the House to judge why they have been recycled in this particular way.


</p>

<a name="40510-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_26"></a>&quot;In conclusion, we are determined to see through the task in Iraq according to the normal behaviour set out in the Geneva Convention and international humanitarian law. We will not hesitate to act where these high standards are not followed and we will investigate when allegations are brought to our attention. But we should not lose sight of the fact that thousands of our service personnel continue to serve their country with great distinction in Iraq and around the world. We are appalled at the allegations made against an unrepresentative small number, but that will not diminish our admiration for, or our respect and our pride in, those who continue to serve their country with such distinction&quot;.

<a name="40510-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Astor of Hever: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement and for bringing the House up to date on the current security situation and allegations of mistreatment. Given the current atmosphere of public <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_50"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 50</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

disquiet over the continuing and apparently deepening involvement of British troops in Iraq, the Government had little alternative but to make a Statement to both Houses.
</p>

<a name="40510-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The Statement is right to say that the possible unauthorised actions of a very few must not be allowed to undermine the outstanding work of tens of thousands of British soldiers and civilians who have served with distinction, compassion and sensitivity in Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40510-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>There are no circumstances under which the brutal humiliation of disarmed and helpless prisoners can be excused. The replaying of these images day after day has the potential to undermine the significant gains that have been made towards the goals of peace, stability and freedom in Iraq. But it is very important to separate fact from opinion and rumour. We are bound by the Geneva Convention and the protocols. Our interrogators are scrupulously trained in tactical questioning and interrogation. They do an excellent job, often under the most trying circumstances, of producing relevant and timely human intelligence. That &quot;HumInt&quot;, which must by its very nature remain secret, contributes significantly to the operational effectiveness of our forces in Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40510-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The House will be aware that Britain ratified the additional 1977 protocols to the 1949 Geneva Convention six years ago, and that Article 75 of the first protocol significantly prohibits,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment . . .  and any form of indecent assault&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>I understand that Amnesty International reported to the MoD on several occasions since May last year alleging that abuses by British soldiers were taking place in Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40510-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>I have a number of questions for the Minister. When did Her Majesty&#039;s Government first see those reports? What steps did the Government then take, and what actions were taken by the chain of command to deal with them? Since the document has been published today in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, will the Government now officially publish the ICRC report in full on this side of the Atlantic? Can the Minister confirm that the ICRC brought its concerns to the attention of the coalition forces on several occasions, orally and in writing, throughout 2003? When were British commanders in MND South East first made aware of the alleged abuse of prisoners by British forces? Finally, given the seriousness of the cuts in the military training programme, is the Minister entirely satisfied that British troops deployed to Iraq, including members of the TA, were given a full and detailed training package in handling prisoners and in the obligations of the Geneva Conventions?

<a name="40510-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. In reference to the 33 cases of civilian deaths, injuries or ill treatment, the Statement says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;These investigations were not begun in response to the ICRC, to Amnesty or as the result of media pressure&quot;.</p>
</ul>

<a name="column_51"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 51</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>That may be the case, and we support the ongoing processes of the Royal Military Police and its investigations in Iraq. However, why did the report of the International Committee of the Red Cross not cause alarm bells in government? Although the report was an interim one, and it was some months before the final report was to be viewed, its allegations are so serious that I find it difficult to believe that Ministers did not read it. Like many others, I downloaded it from the web today.
</p>

<a name="40510-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>Although the word &quot;confidentiality&quot; is used far too often to describe information coming from Iraq, that confidentiality obviously could not include Ministers. It is therefore worrying that no Minister, as we are to believe, read the report or even had it brought to their attention until a few days ago. As I understand it, the report gives the impression that, although some of the abuses highlighted were stamped down in Iraq, it appears that the Red Cross believed that they were going on in a routine manner between May and September last year. That would cause considerable concern.
</p>

<a name="40510-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>The British Army has an enviable reputation for its training and discipline. However, it is unfortunate that, although the Army is there to bring stability and peace to Iraq&#151;it is not an army of occupation&#151;the Government have not accepted that the European Convention on Human Rights should be applicable in Iraq. I find it strange that, when I raised that question last week, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;It is our belief that, strictly speaking in law, it does not apply in Iraq. Whether it does or not may one day be tested&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 4/5/04; col. 1030.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>That is a rather unfortunate attitude to take as regards the convention and whether it applies to British soldiers.

</p>

<a name="40510-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I had planned to ask many of the questions that the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, has already put; I shall not repeat them. Has there been a review of British methods of intelligence gathering and interviewing prisoners? It has been quoted in the press&#151;I do not know whether it is true&#151;that techniques have been shared between US forces and British forces. Considering the fundamental abuses that have taken place under US soldiers&#039; administration of prisoners, have joint operations procedures been reviewed? Have the Government requested urgent talks with the Americans about the abuses carried out and about remedial or any other training to be given to American forces in the future?

<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="40510-15_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to both noble Lords for their remarks and questions, which I shall do my best to answer. I agree very much with the noble Lord, Lord Astor, that there cannot be any circumstances in which the behaviour alleged, if proved, is acceptable&#151;no circumstances at all. I think that that is very much the view of all Members of this House, which is why the allegations are so serious and need to be sorted out.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40510-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>I also agree with the noble Lord, if I may, that we must separate fact and rumour in such cases. We must understand that not every allegation is necessarily true. That does not mean to say that we do not have a duty to investigate each and every allegation, but as anyone who knows the criminal law in this country will be aware, not every allegation turns out to be true. It is a matter of common sense. I do not deny for a moment the seriousness of the Statement that I have made and the questions that have been asked about it.
</p>

<a name="40510-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor, asked questions about Amnesty International. We have received from Amnesty, not so much reports, but a number of letters, starting in May 2003. As the Statement said, there was a letter-writing campaign about the death of Mr   Mousa, which my right honourable friend the Minister for the Armed Forces replied to and made public. We have looked into and are investigating every inquiry that Amnesty has made.
</p>

<a name="40510-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>As concerns the ICRC report, we are not hiding behind confidentiality as Ministers. We are asked to publish it because it has appeared on a website on the other side of the Atlantic, but I must remind the House, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, that the report belongs to the ICRC. It is the committee&#039;s report, and, unless it wants to publish it, we cannot do so. Those are the conditions of the good relationship between the ICRC and us. If the committee is prepared to give its permission to publish, we would be minded to do so. It is known that the report is now on a website, and noble Lords have quite properly taken advantage of that.
</p>

<a name="40510-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, asked&#151;more rhetorically than in fact, I think&#151;whether Ministers had seen the ICRC report, when they say that they had not. I assure him that Ministers did not see the ICRC report; that is, the interim report that was sent to us in February. The reason, as was set out in the Statement that I read out a few minutes ago, is that the three matters relating to alleged British wrongdoing had all been looked into&#151;off our own bat and at our own instigation&#151;five months before the latest matters. The three matters raised in that report had all been looked into and investigated. That is why the decision was taken at PJHQ not to send the report to Ministers. That is why Ministers did not see the report until very recently.
</p>

<a name="40510-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>There was a query about whether we were satisfied that there was sufficient training. I shall make the position clear: the Armed Forces are aware of their obligations under international law. I repeat to the House what I said last Tuesday: they are given thorough, mandatory training that includes specific guidance on handling prisoners of war. All personnel must attend refresher training every year. Before going to Iraq, all personnel are briefed on the rules of engagement and procedures for dealing with prisoners of war or other detainees. Each combat unit is required to have eight senior non-commissioned officers trained in handling prisoners of war. All units responsible for the routine handling of detainees <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_53"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 53</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

conduct further specialist training. So, I am satisfied that we train our Armed Forces sufficiently in that regard.

</p>

<a name="40510-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, asked about intelligence gathering. The training in methods of questioning is of a high standard and is well within the terms of the Geneva Convention. The joint services intelligence organisation&#039;s training documentation states   that the following techniques are expressly and explicitly forbidden: physical punishment of any sort; the use of stress privation; intentional sleep deprivation; withdrawal of food, water or medical help; degrading treatment, including sexual embarrassment or religious taunting; the use of what is called &quot;white noise&quot;&#151;I understand that to be very loud noise&#151;and torture methods such as thumbscrews. I repeat: all those are expressly and explicitly forbidden.

<a name="40510-16_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Boothroyd: </b>   My Lords, my concern is the breakdown of the reasonable relationships that were building up between British service personnel and the Iraqi people. In view of the damage done by the horrendous photographs and videos that have been displayed continuously throughout the Muslim world, what steps are the British authorities taking to make it clear to the Iraqi people that no effort is being spared in investigating the allegations and that, if the allegations are well founded, those concerned will be dealt with through the rule of law?
</p>




<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="40510-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is right: one of the effects of the allegations, whether or not   they are true in every case&#151;something that newspapers might want to consider&#151;is that the relationship that has been established over the previous months between British troops and Iraqis, particularly those in the south of the country, is put in danger. Even more obviously put in danger, perhaps, are the lives of British troops.
</p>

<a name="40510-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>We are making every effort to get across to the Iraqi people our disgust at any case of this kind that is proved and our view that such behaviour is completely unacceptable. The Prime Minister has spoken on the matter twice, I think, in the past two or three days. The very reason that we went into Iraq was to stop not this sort of treatment but any treatment of this kind taking place. We wanted to stop it for good. In answer to the noble Baroness&#039;s question, I say that those who are found to be responsible will be punished. We are using all the methods that we can to get that across to the Iraqi people, but the noble Baroness and the House will know that there are people in Iraq who will do their best to pervert the message that we are sending.

<a name="40510-16_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that we are not dealing with a nicety? We are dealing with the criminal law, which is on trial. Does not the burden of proof in all cases fall on the prosecuting authorities, however grave the allegations? Will my noble friend also underline the fact that the proposed defendants are entitled by our law to be treated as innocent, until the jury finds them guilty? Is it not right <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_54"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 54</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that, as is customary, the burden of proof should fall on the prosecution? All I ask is that there should be a fair trial. Does my noble friend agree?
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="40510-16_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend speaks with huge experience of such issues. He knows that I agree with him. It is essential that the interests of all parties in criminal matters are considered fairly and evenly. That includes the interests of potential defendants, which is why the system that we adopt in the Armed Forces is designed to make sure that independent bodies&#151;the Army Legal Services and the Army Prosecution Authority, which are not part of the chain of command in the normal way&#151;are obliged to examine the result of investigations to see whether it is appropriate for a charge to be made. If a charge is made, it is essential that a fair trial should follow.
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="40510-16_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hurd of Westwell: </b>   My Lords, I refer the Minister to the earlier part of his Statement, which dealt with the security situation. Understandably, he dealt only with the part of Iraq that is under the direct control of British troops, but does he not agree that experience tells us that the security of that part of Iraq&#151;Basra and the surrounding towns&#151;depends crucially on decisions taken and words spoken elsewhere? I refer, for example, to Imam al-Sadr&#039;s remarks on Friday, which the Minister mentioned, but also to American decisions made in Baghdad. They affect our troops crucially. Is the Minister satisfied that we have sufficient influence, day by day, on those decisions?
</p>

<a name="40510-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>It is now 10 May. On 30 June, there will be a transfer of power to a sovereign Iraqi government. In the Minister&#039;s particular sphere, is it the view of Her Majesty&#039;s Government that if the powers to be transferred are to be at all credible to other Iraqis and the region, they need to include Iraqi command of Iraqi security forces and some at least effective Iraqi day-by-day say in the major military decisions of the coalition?
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="40510-16_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I disagree with nothing that the noble Lord has said. Of course, what happens in the south is affected to an extent by what happens elsewhere in Iraq. In discussions with our coalition partners&#151;in particular, the Americans&#151;we are satisfied that they are doing their jobs elsewhere in Iraq, which, it must be remembered, is sometimes extremely difficult in certain parts of the remainder of Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40510-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>Of course, 30 June is now less than two months away. From a recent, if very short, visit that I made to Iraq about two weeks ago, I know that our minds are set very much indeed on what will happen on 30 June and on the days afterwards. Of course, it is intended that security should be handed over to the Iraqis on that day. But the vast majority of them would say that they want and need a coalition presence in the following weeks and months to ensure that security is satisfactory.
</p>

<a name="40510-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>There is a huge amount of effort being made by the Americans, who can speak for themselves, and us in order to ensure that the various parts of the Iraqi <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_55"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 55</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

security forces are being trained and made up as best we can. It is a hard job, but we are very conscious that if 30 June is to mean anything it must involve some transfer of security influence to the Iraqis.
</p>




<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="40510-16_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hooson: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the Red Cross report was potentially extremely embarrassing for this country? Who took the decision that the report should not be disclosed to Ministers? Who took the decision that it should not be disclosed to the Prime Minister? Potentially, the report was a time bomb. It is not a question of a prosecution being brought or anything like that. It is exactly the same as a newspaper potentially reporting a possible crime, but not the prosecution of the crime. Therefore, there was a time bomb under the Government. Yet, there was a procedure whereby this report and its implications do not seem to have been disclosed to the Cabinet.
</p>




<p><a name="st_132"></a>

<a name="40510-16_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I do not have any idea. I shall repeat myself. The three issues to which that interim report referred in relation to British troops had all been investigated&#151;not because we were asked to investigate them but because we chose to do so many months before the interim report arrived&#151;and were being investigated at the time the report reached the Government. So all three issues have been dealt with, each of which was set out clearly in the Statement that I have just read.

<a name="40510-16_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord Bishop of Worcester:</b>  My Lords, I am sure that the Minister is aware that no one in this House or in the country would expect the Government to do other than they are doing in taking these allegations extremely seriously. We would expect no less. There is a high level of trust that the Government are doing no less than they should. That support will come from people irrespective of what they thought about the original decision to engage in the coalition&#039;s campaign.

</p>

<a name="40510-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>However, those who opposed the campaign are bound to feel that allegations and divisions of this kind in our country and the evidence&#151;if such there be&#151;of particular, however small, numbers of soldiers crossing the boundaries of acceptable behaviour are a consequence that too often follows from contentious and divisive decisions. Were the Government aware that that might happen and that this type of military activity had a particular propensity to cause that kind of thing to occur? If the Government were aware, do they understand that there are many people in the country who will feel that what so far as we can tell currently has happened&#151;I absolutely agree with the need for a fair trial in individual cases&#151;is some indication of the fragile support that there was for this event?

divisions in this country about whether we should have gone to war with Iraq, which were expressed as legitimately as they can be in a democracy.

</p>

<a name="40510-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>We must be realistic about this. I doubt that there has been a war, a conflict or a post-conflict situation in history, whether it involved disagreement or agreement about whether it was sensible to enter into, in which there has not been some examples of bad behaviour by armed forces. There always has been. As I think that I have made absolutely clear to the House today, none of it is acceptable. But I really do not see that that is in any way connected to the fact that this particular conflict divided the British people.

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>First, I should like to have the Minister&#039;s assurance that, in future, reports from the Red Cross&#151;the ICRC&#151;or Amnesty International will reach the tables of Ministers at once.

<a name="40510-17_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn: </b>   My Lords, I am surprised that the noble Lord does not know who made the decision that they should not. At a later stage, will the Minister inform the House at what level that decision was made?

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>Secondly, with reference to the Geneva conventions, can the noble Lord confirm reports that, initially, prisoners and detainees in UK care were being interrogated hooded and whether that is in line with the Geneva convention? I believe that practice has now ceased.

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>Thirdly, in the very good report by the American general on the situation in Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, a note was made of very curious incidents of so-called &quot;ghost detainees&quot;.

Can he give a categorical assurance about &quot;ghost detainees&quot;&#151;people detained outside Iraq and brought into the country for interrogation&#151;that this has not happened under British supervision and jurisdiction?

<a name="40510-17_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his questions and I shall do my best to answer them. The answer to his first question is that I do not think that this situation will arise again. I suspect that, in the future, any report will be put in front of Ministers pretty quickly. That is my guess.
</p>

<a name="40510-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord should not be surprised that I am not prepared to name the person who decided that Ministers should not see the report. In this House we are not in the habit of talking about individuals in that sense. His question about the level of the decision is a much better inquiry and I shall do my best, if I am able, to find out and inform the House.
</p>

<a name="40510-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I turn to the matter of hooded detainees. That practice ended in the autumn of last year. I have read the same stories in the newspapers about &quot;ghost detainees&quot; as has the noble Lord. So far as I am aware, there is no question of that happening under British supervision at all.
</p>




<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="40510-17_spnew6"></a><b> Viscount Falkland: </b>   My Lords, all Members of your Lordships&#039; House will be extremely disturbed by the allegations and rumours that have been spreading about British troops in Iraq. Will he take it from me that among those most devastated by this are those who at some stage have themselves had military training, who have served in Her Majesty&#039;s Armed Forces, or whose fathers, sons or other close relatives have done so? Indeed, that would include many in your Lordships&#039; House. They will be aware of the traditional saw within the British armed services that the fish rots from the head.
</p>

<a name="40510-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>If there is any truth in these allegations, then sooner or later we shall have to get to grips with the old standards which now seemed to have slipped. A famous commander once observed that there is no such thing as the British Army, rather it is a collection of regimental families. In the regiment in which both I and my son served, it would be unthinkable that such things could take place. If soldiers have been responsible for this kind of behaviour, then their officers are ultimately to blame. We have heard no mention of officers in any of our exchanges in this House. We have heard only generalities about a drop in standards overall, including among the Americans. I do not care what the Americans do&#151;or at least I do care about it, but we have no influence over that.
</p>

<a name="40510-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>If these allegations are true, can the Minister say whether Members of this House will have a chance to discuss what has happened to that great family, the British regiment, and the ways in which the honour of the regiment is maintained?
</p>




<p><a name="st_144"></a>

They will be as upset as anyone at the suggestion that there has been mistreatment of the kind described.

<p><a name="st_152"></a>Clause 8 [<i>Activities outside United Kingdom</i>]:</p>







<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="40510-17_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn </b>   moved Amendment No. 9:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>Page 3, line 29, at end insert &quot;nor prevents the Council from making grants in response to applications from properly accredited and publicly supported British research institutions operating overseas, including those institutes and research schools, which are funded principally by the British Academy&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>




<p><a name="st_154"></a>The noble Lord said: Unlike Amendment No. 8, this amendment is tightly focused and does not address the generality of an issue. It seeks to rectify a serious anomaly which falls squarely within the scope of research councils, in particular the Arts and Humanities Research Council. It would put right an anomaly in the funding for research carried out by British research institutions overseas, and specifically by those overseas institutes and societies which are represented on the British Academy&#039;s Board for Academy-Sponsored Institutes and Societies, generally abbreviated to BASIS. These include the research schools in Ankara, Athens and Rome, as well as the Egypt Exploration Society, the British Institute in Eastern Africa, the British School of Archaeology in Iraq&#151;currently in eclipse&#151;the British Institute of Persian Studies and other such bodies. At this point I declare an interest as chairman-elect of the British School at Athens.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_59"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>First, perhaps I may remind noble Lords of the splendid gaffe committed by my right honourable friend Kenneth Clarke when he had recently become Secretary of State for Education and Science and about which, with refreshing candour, he told me himself only a couple of days later. Noble Lords will be aware that these research institutions are active in the fields of archaeology, anthropology, and study of the history and geography of the lands where they are situated, and so forth. The British School at Rome also has an excellent and well respected scholarship programme for visiting artists. In general they are used by British research scholars.
</p>

<a name="40510-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>When the secretary of the British Academy raised with my right honourable friend the matter of the parlous financial position of the British schools overseas at the time&#151;he had not been terribly well briefed by his officials&#151;his bluff and well meaning reply was, &quot;Well, can&#039;t they put up the fees?&quot;. Noble Lords will realise that these institutions do not charge fees. Their work is based on research; they do not run courses such as those organised by the British Council in various countries.
</p>

<a name="40510-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>The institutions are used in the main by research workers from British universities, including doctoral students and academic staff, but they do have some highly qualified personnel of their own. The director of such an institute has roughly the status of a university professor. It is thus highly anomalous that the current regulations of the research councils apparently prevent those councils receiving grant applications from such staff or then awarding research grants to them in the same manner as they are able to do for the staff of all British universities. I am told that they follow this negative practice on the grounds that these institutes are based overseas, even though they are funded principally by the British Academy in London and so, ultimately, by the Office of Science and Technology. This is a serious matter, for research is the lifeblood of such institutions. Most postgraduate research in Britain is funded through the research councils.
</p>

<a name="40510-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>I should stress that this is not a matter just for the Arts and Humanities Research Council. It would apply with equal force to the Economic and Social Research Council or to the National Environmental Research Council. Perhaps the Minister can reassure the Committee that if the amendment were carried, so that it applied to the Arts and Humanities Research Council, its effect in eliminating the present restriction could apply with equal force to the other research councils.
</p>

<a name="40510-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>Indeed, perhaps the Minister could inform the House&#151;I hope she received my fax saying I would ask her this question&#151;precisely where the objection lies to the British institutes overseas, and personnel such as their directors, receiving such funding from the research councils. Is there really some obscure law preventing research councils dispersing grants to suitable applicants with alpha-grade projects in the same manner as they would to applicants from UK <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_60"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 60</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

universities? That is the message the British Academy gets from the research councils when they raise the matter on behalf of BASIS.
</p>

<a name="40510-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>This may therefore be regarded as a probing amendment. If the Minister would inform me that the amendment is entirely unnecessary, and that a simple instruction from herself or the Office of Science and Technology would set the matter right&#151;and if she will give an assurance that such an instruction will be rapidly forthcoming&#151;I shall happily withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40510-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>Perhaps I might ask the Minister in passing whether there is the possibility of some additional funding, once the situation is calmer and safer, to set the British School of Archaeology in Iraq on its feet again. These institutions can create a great deal of good will in the countries in which they operate, and do so in a way which is entirely non-political and which respects and often enhances the cultural heritage of the countries concerned. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="40510-18_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Perry of Southwark: </b>   I offer this amendment my support. As this is the first time I have spoken in Part 1, I would like to add my welcome to that of many other noble Lords to the establishment of the AHRC. My own experience was as a member of the Economic and Social Research Council, which has many areas of overlap with the humanities, particularly in areas such as geography and economic history. It was often very difficult to have them operating under two different kinds of legislation.
</p>

<a name="40510-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>I would like to support what my noble friend Lord   Renfrew has said, because this was drawn to my attention some time ago. There is a real problem in research councils being able to fund applications for grants from very distinguished people, working in institutions of very high international repute. I hope that, as we put our probing amendment to the Minister, she will be able to tell us that what is already on the face of the Bill will be sufficient to cover the points we make.
</p>




<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="40510-18_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Morgan: </b>   I would hope that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, is, as he says, superfluous. It is an enormously worthy cause. I am a fellow of the British Academy, so&#151;if I have to&#151;I declare a kind of interest.
</p>

<a name="40510-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>First, the value of these British schools abroad goes far   beyond the purely academic. They have been an enormous factor in establishing a British cultural presence, particularly in the Middle East, in a way that has been wholly beneficial for this country. Secondly, if we do not support these areas of research&#151;which are very often very meagrely financed as the noble Lord explained&#151;many areas of study, such as Egyptology and papyrology, might actually disappear. I am sure that my noble friend the Minister does not wish these important subjects to disappear, and I am sure she will be supportive.
</p>




<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="40510-18_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Neill of Bengarve: </b>   I too declare an interest as a fellow of the British Academy. I believe that these are astonishingly economical programmes, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_61"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 61</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which have a very high cultural impact and a high impact on cultural diplomacy. When I was on the council of the British Academy, it was breathtaking to see how little money was available to run these programmes. One of the important things about them is that they are very long term, ensuring that we have experts and scholars in this country who have spent long periods of time in the relevant places, and who understand not merely their own subject, but the cultural politics of those societies. They understand the ways in which research can be most usefully conducted and how it can be focused, as well as the delicacies of conducting certain kinds of research. It is not only the scholars in the various schools, but also those who visit them occasionally who benefit from that expertise and sensitivity. I hope that the Government may be disposed to support this amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="40510-18_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   Is the Minister aware that the Medical Research Council has funded research overseas for many years? There have been a number of units funded by the MRC, and there is currently a very active one in the Gambia. Is giving grants different from actually funding established units? Surely the principle is the same?
</p>




<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="40510-18_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Stewartby: </b>   I would also like to add a word in support of my noble friend Lord Renfrew. I share the   privilege with him of being a member of the archaeology section of the British Academy. As the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill of Bengarve, has just said, there are many people, including myself, who have been able to take advantage of the facilities provided by the British schools abroad during their student days. I do not think there is any doubt about their value&#151;there is a doubt about their price. We need to ensure that they can get this sort of support.
</p>

<a name="40510-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>I suppose it is not outside the realms of possibility that the Minister will be so sympathetic to this amendment that she will accept it on the spot. But, just in case that is not the situation, I hope she will be swayed by the power of the argument which has been put forward by many distinguished Members of your Lordships&#039; House. We shall see that the purpose of my noble friend&#039;s amendment is achieved, even if not by this precise route.
</p>




<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="40510-18_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Blackstone: </b>   The Arts and Humanities Research Board, which is being replaced by the AHRC which is still being set up, and indeed the British Academy before that, funded these institutions abroad. I cannot understand quite what the need for this amendment is, since Clause 8 allows the AHRC to do just the same.
</p>




<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="40510-18_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn: </b>   Perhaps I might respond to that point. It is the case that BASIS, which is the group of these research institutes operating with the British Academy, has on many occasions sought to persuade the research councils, and the Arts and Humanities Research Board, to take applications for research projects in just the same way that they take <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_62"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 62</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

applications for research projects by scholars in universities. Again and again, the British Academy has been advised that the research councils cannot take such applications because the British institutes overseas are not UK universities, and they receive the response that they are prevented by regulation or by law&#151;and I am looking forward to clarification from the Minister as to just where the impediment lies.
</p>

<a name="40510-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>Like the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, I am bewildered by the situation, but I can assure her that it is the case. I believe I am right in saying that no member of staff based at one of the British schools or institutes overseas under the umbrella of the BASIS board at the British Academy has ever had an application for a research grant accepted for consideration.
</p>




<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="40510-18_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Winston: </b>   Will the Minister not agree that this amendment is useful in that it allows a certain amount of reciprocity? A number of us in this country have been in receipt of grants from the American Government to pursue research under the National Institutes of Health, for example. The other advantage of this approach is that it allows a degree of mutual interaction and collaboration between academic units which may not be primarily based in Britain. That must be, in the long term, an advantage to our academic system.
</p>




<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="40510-18_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   I rise to support this amendment, if it is needed. Having read the clause, nothing in this part restricts such activities, and I would hope it is not needed. There is a sense in which, although I am happy with the amendment up to a point, the amendment itself could be a bit restrictive. Therefore, I hope the Minister can tell us it is not needed and that these opportunities exist.
</p>




<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="40510-18_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, for that. I can say to the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, that my intention in responding is to make him a happy Peer. I am grateful to him for writing to me. I know he is a keen advocate for British research institutions overseas; that is obvious from his contribution. I pay tribute to his distinguished record in supporting and championing those bodies. I understand that he is due to take on the chairmanship of the British School at Athens later this year. I wish him all the best in that role.
</p>

<a name="40510-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>I understand the noble Lord&#039;s concern about the position of these institutions as regards access to UK public funds for arts and humanities research. At present, because of restrictions on the use of funding from the UK funding councils, the AHRB is unable to   fund the British overseas research institutions. However, I can reassure the noble Lord that his amendment is entirely unnecessary. Indeed, while trying to clarify the scope of the AHRC, it is possible&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, indicated&#151;that the amendment might inadvertently restrict its activities outside the UK.

</p>

<a name="40510-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>As the AHRC will no longer be funded by the UK funding councils, but&#151;as we discussed in earlier amendments&#151;by the Office of Science and Technology, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_63"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 63</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

it will no longer be subject to the same restrictions. As   noble Lords, including my noble friend Lady   Blackstone, have pointed out, Clause 8 already makes it quite clear that nothing in the Bill restricts the AHRC&#039;s activities to the UK or to any part of it.
</p>

<a name="40510-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>It is our intention, as I have indicated, to establish the Arts and Humanities Research Council on an operational basis and underpinning framework that are broadly similar to those of the science research councils. That will extend the range of organisations and institutions eligible to apply for support. The noble Lord will not be surprised that it will be for the AHRC to determine the eligibility criteria for institutions applying for funding, consistent with enabling it to deliver its strategic objectives and research priorities. This funding will be allocated, I am sure, on the basis of merit and excellence, irrespective of the institution that applies.
</p>

<a name="40510-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Once in operation, the AHRC will establish a transparent process for determining, on a case by case basis, whether organisations such as the British institutes referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, should become eligible to apply for AHRC funding. I understand that the British Academy has not yet approached the Office of Science and Technology or Research Councils UK. However, the British Academy has indicated to the Office of Science and Technology that it is considering raising this issue when it is appropriate to do so.
</p>

<a name="40510-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>As I have already emphasised, nothing in the clause as it stands will prevent the AHRC from determining where in the UK or overseas it is most appropriate to fund research activities in fulfilment of its objectives and priorities. I hope that that offers the reassurance that the noble Lord is seeking and that he is able to withdraw his amendment.

I recognise that these are but enabling powers, and no doubt it can be argued that they may not be taken; but to that I respond simply that there is nothing to stop them being taken. I am particularly concerned as we are dealing with a Government who, we can safely argue, have a track record for pushing up spending on central units, task forces, teams and advisory bodies.
</p>

<a name="40510-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>No doubt the Minister will, in her reply, give such deserving examples of advisory bodies as the Scottish Science Advisory Committee or the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission. I am the first to admit that an increasing number of ethical issues have arisen in the past 10 years on which the Government and indeed the public have sought detailed guidance. However, does the setting up of such bodies simply delegate responsibility to the research councils under which these bodies will fall? They add another layer in the decision-making process. It can be all too easy to set up organisations of experts to think about questions and so delay the answers.

<a name="40510-19_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   In speaking to Amendments Nos. 10, 11, 12 and 13, I should like also to refer to Clause 10 itself. This is the clause that also says that the Secretary of State may carry out and support research, disseminate and so forth. It is worth putting that in the context of the clauses to which my noble friend Lady Sharp referred in speaking to Amendment No. 2 onwards. She was rightly trying to achieve an arm&#039;s length council that is not pushed around. This provision, however, almost ought to say that, regardless of setting up that body, the Secretary of State can still do something that is not appropriate for that council or tell it to do something that he wants it to do although it does not particularly want to do it.
</p>

<a name="40510-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>We do not oppose the fact that the Secretary of State, a Scottish Minister or Northern Ireland Minister or one of the devolved institutions may decide to do a certain piece of work. However, I should hope that that would be a largely one-off objective. If advisers are needed to do that work, it might help some of those with depleted salaries to serve on those bodies&#151;but perhaps not. It seems right that if it is appropriate for there to be advisory bodies&#151;in some circumstances it will be and in others not&#151;it may be appropriate for them to be paid. We do not believe that there is any harm in leaving this matter there. It is worth stating that this would be direct work carried out by the Secretary of State alongside the arm&#039;s length work carried out by the council.

<a name="40510-19_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Morgan: </b>   These amendments are unnecessary. I hope that the Government will not accept them. It seems to me that they are not in place of the Arts and Humanities Research Council, but a supplement to it. I can think of all kinds of matters in the humanities&#151;for example, the history of architecture&#151;where research has been fostered directly by departments. I also hope that advisory bodies will be allowed to remain. They will almost certainly consist of academics and from what we have heard they will, therefore, come cheap. They will not be paid; they will give their expertise in the way that I did for many years in Wales on the Board of Celtic Studies. I do not recall becoming rich out of that kind activity, of which there are many. I hope that the Government will simply adhere to the terms of the clause as it stands.

research councils with huge amounts of money&#151;hundreds of millions of pounds a year was spent. Therefore, there was a solid flank of support for or criticism of or doubts about the proposals that came from the various bodies. In the case of the humanities and the arts, the voices were not raised because the sums involved were exceedingly modest.
</p>

<a name="40510-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>I would not want the disposition of research funds to be entirely in the hands of the Secretary of State. One thing that we know about the present incumbent of the office of Secretary of State is that he is against medieval history. I studied medieval history and found it a fascinating and immensely worthwhile subject. I recommend to anyone who wants to embark upon a political life that a close study of the Wars of the Roses is invaluable. I do not want the Secretary of State to be able to strike out something and say, &quot;I don&#039;t support that&quot;, or the Welsh Assembly to be able to say, &quot;We don&#039;t actually approve of that in Wales&quot;, or &quot;we have no research on castle building&quot;, or something of that kind. While the councils get going, they will need a body of support to guide them in the right way and to marshal the various lobbying groups in the various humanities and arts and so on. I think that would be quite a useful body.
</p>

<a name="40510-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>I do not know whether such bodies will be paid. Nobody knows yet. Perhaps some research can be done on that. The noble Lord on the Liberal Democrat Benches said that this may be one of the few ways in which academics can receive a little more in the coming years, which will please the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew. On the whole, I think it will be helpful.

<a name="40510-19_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   The Bill applies only here and there to Scotland. Curiously the part of the Bill that affects Scotland most&#151;we shall come to it later&#151;is Part 3. Universities are devolved under the Scotland Act and so the legislation in Part 3 of this Bill relating to fees does not apply to Scotland. Yet it will have an absolutely devastating effect on Scotland. Scottish students who want to study in England will find it extremely difficult to do so because they will not be supported in the way that English students will be. English students who want to study in Scotland will find universities will be greatly depleted of funds compared with the universities that they have left at home. Every university in Scotland will suffer. That is a point to which we shall turn later and it is a very big matter. At an earlier stage, the Minister said that her Secretary of State was at that moment discussing the matter in Scotland. It is pretty strange that it had not been discussed before that. That is very worrying indeed.

</p>

<a name="40510-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>The clause applies to Scotland, as it does to Wales and Northern Ireland. Research councils under the Scotland Act were left to Westminster. I was one of those who fought for that before the Scotland Act came into being and my late noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40510-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>I do not understand why it is necessary to have this clause. Is there anything to stop a Scots university, if it wants, conducting some research on a matter that is in the hands of the research council? The noble Lord on the Front Bench, who understands this matter very well, is shaking his head. There is no reason why they should not. Why is this clause in the Bill? I do not understand.
</p>

<a name="40510-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>The idea that someone could prevent there being a committee of academics in Scotland to advise the Scots Parliament on research is very strange. The research councils are reserved&#151;not research itself. No one knows where research begins and ends anyway. Surveys are often claimed to be research when they are simply surveys carried out by the Scots Parliament to find out something. I do not understand why the clause is in the Bill. If it has to be in the Bill, and if the Scots Parliament can set up only a committee of the kind described in the Bill, I would have thought that that was rather strange too.
</p>

<a name="40510-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>As my noble friend on the Front Bench said, this is a very expensive way to do things. It should be for the Scots Parliament to deal with such matters without necessarily setting up a committee. I hope that the need for the clause will be explained by the Minister. If it is necessary, then I certainly support my noble friend.

It is somewhat strange to see that England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are to have the same duties of carrying out research in the arts and humanities, but they are optional as far as the devolved assemblies are concerned. Surely, there must be a connection that has not been defined at all between the UK council, with its entire UK remit, and the regional governments with similar duties.

Therefore, trying to reply silently, I gave the noble Lord, Lord Baker, the wrong impression, for which I apologise.

</p>

<a name="40510-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, quite rightly said, under the provisions of subsections (1)(e), (2)(e), (3)(e) and (4)(e), the appointed members of such bodies &quot;may&quot; be paid, as the noble Lord, Lord Walton, clarified for us, and as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, has just reminded me. Thank you so much for that intervention in my ear. The option for payment is therefore available, though many noble Lords will know that they have served on such bodies and have not received payment. However, the noble Lord, Lord   Walton, is right that, in the nature of such bodies, payments are made in the form of attendance allowances and so on.

</p>

<a name="40510-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, set out the purpose behind the amendment, which is to limit the power of the Secretary of State and the devolved administrations to establish and fund any advisory body that is needed on issues associated with the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Noble Lords have queried from the beginning the way in which the amendment is tabled in the Bill. I should point out&#151;I hope that it will help the noble Baroness, Lady   Carnegy&#151;that these measures were based on legislation passed in 1965. Of course, there was no devolution in 1965. Under the 1998 devolution legislation, the other seven boards were covered. The amendment is therefore tabled in that way to mirror what has already occurred with the other seven boards.
</p>

<a name="40510-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>To link to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord   Roberts of Conwy, the research councils are UK-wide and have been put together, as the noble Lord knows, with the support of the Welsh Assembly, Scotland and Northern Ireland. They will operate in that way. We need to enable those bodies in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to carry out additional, complementary research of the kind that I shall describe. That is why the amendment is tabled in this way, which I hope will clarify the matter for the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy. I hope to clarify more points as I continue.

the UK council? Secondly, will the devolved administrations be expected in any circumstances to contribute financially to the UK body?
</p>




<p><a name="st_177"></a>
<a name="40510-20_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   It depends on what the devolved administrations think. It will become clear as I explain what kind of bodies I am talking about. For example, if the Welsh Assembly wanted to undertake some research, I am sure that it would consult with the UK-wide Arts and Humanities Research Council in order to establish whether it was necessary and appropriate. I hope that the noble Lord will be assisted when I come to explain the kind of body that we are describing, and I am sure that he will come back to me if I fail to do so. We have established, I hope, the purpose behind the clauses, why they are there and the fact that they mirror what we have done within the devolution legislation.
</p>

<a name="40510-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>It will come as no surprise to any noble Lord that the Government and the devolved administrations receive scientific advice from a variety of sources. Their powers have already been put to good use so far as science and technology is concerned. For example, the premier scientific advisory body for the Government is the Council for Science and Technology, originally established in 1993 to provide independent, high level   advice on science and technology policy. It was re-launched in March of this year after review, with new terms of reference and a new membership, to include, according to my brief, &quot;more softer sciences&quot;. I shall have to seek an indication of what a softer science is. I would interpret it to mean social sciences. Even in a previous incarnation, of course, the body took an interest in arts and humanities research, considering in its report in 2001, which I found very interesting, the question of the division between the arts and the sciences and how it could be reduced, which, of course, included the recommendation for the Arts and Humanities Research Council.

</p>

<a name="40510-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, indicated, there are a number of highly valuable, strategic scientific bodies. The Human Genetics Commission and the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission were specifically mentioned by the noble Baroness. The membership of those bodies, which is also important and partly addresses the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy,   concerning the differences and synergies between those bodies, consists of consumer, green and other interest groups, media experts, social scientists, lawyers, philosophers and scientists. They consider the bigger picture issues of ethical and social questions as well as the sciences. I believe that they are very important. In another place, Mr Thomas drew attention to the specific role that   the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission has played in advising the Government on GM crops, which I know is a matter of great significance in your Lordships&#039; House, in another place and elsewhere. Those are some examples of very important bodies that have played strategic roles in offering advice on some very big questions that face both the Government and the scientists.

</p>

<a name="40510-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Neither the Government nor the devolved administrations have any intention of creating bodies for the sake of it. As my right honourable friend the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education indicated, we would not have thought a decade ago that genetically modified crops, cloning, ethical issues and post-mapping of the genome would have become such important issues in our economy. I believe that it is appropriate for those powers to exist in order to have the kind of strategic advice that I have indicated.

</p>

<a name="40510-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>I understand that the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, is anxious that we should not create unnecessary bodies   with additional resources. However, I think that there   would be some undesirable consequences of the amendment. It would remove the opportunity from the Secretary of State and the devolved administrations to secure the kind of strategic advice that I have indicated is very important. I also believe that it would undermine further our intention to set the Arts and Humanities Research Council on the same footing as research in science and technology and to create the best possible framework for it.
</p>

<a name="40510-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>It is probably also worth saying that the Office of Science and Technology has just published guidelines that address the role of government departments in the process of obtaining and using scientific advice. Those draw on key principles enunciated by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, in his BSE Inquiry report and are consistent with those underlying the   Government&#039;s drive for evidence-based policy. Though primarily aimed at individual departments, those principles have applications in wider fields and to issues beyond science.

</p>

<a name="40510-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>To reassure further the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, among the key messages is that the department should actively seek a wide range of advice from the best sources to support policy making and development; namely, that reliance should not be placed on a single source. It would be too easy simply to go to the research councils, important, valuable and critical institutions though they will be. I believe that it is important to have an ability to look beyond them and to involve the kind of groups that I have indicated have been used previously.
</p>

<a name="40510-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>I have attempted to explain, first, why the clauses are expressed in the Bill in the way that they are; secondly, the critical role that some of the advisory groups have played in the past; thirdly, the principles that resulted from the findings of the BSE inquiry under the chairmanship of the   noble Lord, Lord Phillips; and, fourthly, the critical relevance of having flexibility within the devolved administrations, who are very supportive of this part of the Bill, and within the Secretary of State&#039;s cross-government to be able to achieve the kind of strategic advice and support that is needed. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

Subsection (3) simply repeats what the situation is under the Scotland Act 1998. The noble Baroness has said that; when the universities became a devolved matter, Scotland could do all these things. The research council was not devolved but all these things became possible for Scottish Ministers, and I expect they are doing them.
</p>

<a name="40510-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>I am not saying that the provision should not be in the Bill. However, it seems rather strange to repeat a part of the Bill simply to remind people that under the Scotland Act, the Scots Parliament can make these provisions. That is how I see the matter. In fact, if paragraphs (d) and (e), the subject of a further amendment, were removed, it would make not the smallest difference because the Scots Parliament can do this anyway. 
</p>




<p><a name="st_181"></a>
<a name="40510-21_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I shall clarify my understanding of this and am happy to write further and clarify it again if it is not right. In 1965, when the research councils were established, there was no devolution. In 1998, the research councils already in existence were covered in the Scotland Act to make sure that this would apply. Because we are creating a new research council, it is not covered by the 1998 Act. Therefore, this provision is to give it parity with the other research councils. It is not an unnecessary provision; it is necessary to ensure that we make this clear. The noble Baroness is right that this provision exists for all the other research councils. However, it does not exist for this one, and it would not if we removed this part of the Bill.

If the devolved administrations feel it is necessary, they should have the right and the power to do so, as they have with the other research councils. I am quite sure that on a number of these issues, as the noble Baroness has indicated, the work will go through the Arts and Humanities Research Council, which will be a key player in determining what happens.

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>Similarly, later the Bill provides that there &quot;may&quot; be a Welsh corporate body to deal with students&#039; complaints and there &quot;may&quot; be a separate system of approved plans on which student support will be <br>&nbsp;<br>

based. I stress &quot;may&quot; because the Bill is largely permissive rather than prescriptive as far as the National Assembly is concerned, and I believe that that is generally true of Scotland and Northern Ireland as well.
</p>

<a name="40510-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>My noble friend Lady Seccombe is absolutely right that multiple duplication of this kind always comes at a cost. So let us be clear that the Government&#039;s justification for that extra cost is devolution rather than education or any of the real subjects of the Bill. I am bound to say that much of the unity of the higher education system in the UK will go out of the window in the process of implementing the Bill.

</p>

<a name="40510-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>Some of the clauses relating to Wales are straight copies of English clauses. For example, Welsh Clause 26 is almost a straight copy of English Clause 23, except that the power to impose conditions for student fees is derived in Wales from the National Assembly and in England from the Secretary of State. At the end of the day, I suppose, it all comes from the same Treasury pocket.

</p>

<a name="40510-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Because the funding of higher education in Wales comes from the National Assembly it is, I suppose, understandable that the Government should seek to implement their principles in the dualistic fashion proposed in the Bill. However, there is a complication, as I have implied. Under the Bill, the National Assembly is   not bound to implement its provisions and there is evident reluctance in the Assembly government to do so. The Assembly has decided that it will have its own independent review of higher education funding under Professor Teresa Rees, and her report is not due until   April of next year. An interim report is due in February. Let us assume that they will eventually toe the central   government line. The consequences will be that differences will inevitably emerge in the support given to students depending on where in the UK they come from.
</p>

<a name="40510-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>The Explanatory Notes tell us on page 11 in paragraph 61:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;The Assembly intends in practice to make regulations affecting students who have a prescribed connection with Wales when they start their course, regardless of the location of the institution at which they are studying and of their place of residence after graduation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>In short, there are to be special measures to support students who have the good fortune to have the prescribed connection with Wales, however that connection is finally defined. That will not be an easy task.
</p>

<a name="40510-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>There is nothing new in such geographical differences in student support. Some of your Lordships, like myself, will remember the old county scholarships, whose plenitude and value depended on the wealth and generosity of the county where people received their secondary education. Although the National Assembly&#039;s intentions may be to favour Welsh students, the extent to which it will be able to do so will depend on the resources available, which may not always be as copious as they appear to be today.
</p>

<a name="40510-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>The underlying question is whether this geographical consideration is appropriately placed in the UK scheme of things in relation to educational <br>&nbsp;<br>

merit and the ability to benefit from higher education. The same applies to access, which appears to have supreme pre-eminence in the Government&#039;s thinking.
</p>

<a name="40510-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>A substantial proportion of higher education students in Welsh institutions&#151;over 40 per cent&#151;are from outside Wales. How will the Bill affect them? My noble friends on the Front Bench have put down a new clause to prevent discrimination against them in the charging of fees. Whether the Government will accept the new clause remains to be seen.

</p>

<a name="40510-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>There are to be no variable fees in Wales until 2007&#151;a year later than England&#151;and an undertaking to that effect has been given by the Welsh Assembly government. Will there be a sudden influx of students to Wales from the rest of the United Kingdom for that reason? One of the reasons why Professor Rees is not to report until next April is to enable her to take account of the effect of variable fees in England. That was said by the Minister for Lifelong Learning in Wales.

</p>

<a name="40510-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>If variable fees are not introduced in Wales and an alternative stream of alternative funding is not provided, Welsh higher education institutions will be financially disadvantaged compared with their counterparts in England. The Ministers on the Front Bench opposite look a little mystified, but I can tell them that that fear was expressed in a report by the Council and Academic Board of the University of Wales to a meeting of the University Court on 16 April.
</p>

<a name="40510-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>Will there be an exodus of the best academics to better-paid posts in top-up institutions in England as is feared in Scotland, as we have already heard?

</p>

<a name="40510-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>The blatant fact is that there will be differences in the   extent and method of support for students and   institutions, and where there are differences, discrimination will creep in.
</p>

<a name="40510-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>We are assured on page 17 of the Explanatory Notes that, &quot;There is no discrimination&quot;, at least within the terms of the European Convention on Human Rights. But I suspect that that will not be the end of it.
</p>

<a name="40510-21_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>I am bound to tell the noble Baroness that there is a great deal of confusion, not only within the terms of this Bill, but in attitudes towards it, particularly in the devolved administrations. Its practical implications and consequences have not been thought through, and this is as apparent in Wales as elsewhere. Great uncertainty prevails. If I may mix my metaphors, this Bill has all the hallmarks of a dog&#039;s breakfast.
</p>

<a name="40510-21_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>I have given a foretaste of debates to come, and your Lordships have been very tolerant. With regard to this specific amendment, can it be right that arts and humanities research has the imprimatur of statute and Royal Charter in the UK, but appears to be optional&#151;it is a &quot;may&quot; situation&#151;in parts of the UK?

</p>

<a name="40510-21_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>We have not had a clear answer to the question of what the relationship is going to be between the regional bodies established for arts and humanities research and the UK body. It seems odd that all the Minister can say is that she would expect the regional bodies to consult the UK council. I would have thought that there would have been a closer connection than that, and that that connection would have been defined in the Bill.

He pointed out the disadvantages that Welsh universities have in the new regime. In view of his presidency of the University of Wales College of Medicine, does he favour the introduction of variable fees in Wales?
</p>




<p><a name="st_194"></a>
<a name="40510-22_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   I certainly do. But at the moment we are prohibited from having variable fees, and therefore we are going to be at a considerable disadvantage to England. That situation is inevitable, because there is a pledge given by the Assembly government that variable fees will not be introduced before 2007.
</p>




<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="40510-22_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Morgan: </b>   I would like to confine myself rather narrowly to Amendment No. 11. This may seem parochial and pedestrian, but my friend, the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, built up a mighty edifice of Welsh eloquence about this and ranged over practically the whole of the Bill. He succeeded in eliciting my disagreement the more he went on.
</p>

<a name="40510-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>The point he makes concerns something that is constitutionally improper. It is a devolved matter. It is a remit of the National Assembly to handle all aspects of education, and that applies to research in the humanities as it does to everything else. Therefore to propose it is constitutionally improper, if not illegal.
</p>

<a name="40510-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>The noble Lord raises the important point of the essential need to have research in the arts and humanities fostered in Wales, and on that basis there is no reason for concern. There is every sign in every organisation that I know that the National Assembly takes its duties&#151;in history, in archaeology, in the social sciences&#151;extremely seriously. One reason for that is the Welsh language. It is a prime consideration of the Welsh Assembly to foster study of the culture and language and literature of Wales, and, necessarily, research in those areas follows.
</p>

<a name="40510-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>The noble Lord raises the question of the interconnection of research in Wales with other parts of the United Kingdom. Of course they will interlock <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_76"></a>

and collaborate, because&#151;and I speak for myself&#151;Welsh historians do not only work on Wales; they work on collaborative matters. History and other subjects know no boundaries, so necessarily there is a community of operation within Wales and the other parts of the United Kingdom.
</p>

<a name="40510-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>Broadly speaking, we should not discuss Amendment No. 11 at all.

<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="40510-22_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   It appears to me that the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, is trying to introduce compulsion. &quot;Thou shalt carry out research in Wales&quot;. That is what the amendment is about, regardless of the speech that he made. Whichever way one looks at it, the proposal is either a backstop or an opportunity. If a Member of the National Assembly for Wales was contemplating research in this area, the research council may well undertake that research&#151;or it may not. It may be that the Secretary of State in this Parliament decides to undertake some research.The backstop is that if there is a burning desire for that research to take place in Wales, the proposal would permit it to take place. We have been told that, although we have devolution, this little bit has not been devolved yet. That means that it can be done in that way. I should have thought that the National Assembly for Wales would be more appreciative of legislation that says that it &quot;may&quot; do things rather than legislation compelling it to do something.
</p>




<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="40510-22_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I was rather against devolution, and I must say that the impact of devolution has exceeded all my expectations. Listening to my noble friend move his amendment, I was struck that he ranged a little beyond the focus of Part   1.
</p>

<a name="40510-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>Incidentally, I may have misheard the noble Lord, Lord Morgan, but, given that he suggested that we were discussing devolved matters, he may want to take a look at the Explanatory Notes. In the summary of Part 1, they say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;As with the existing research councils, the new council will operate throughout the UK and will be a reserved matter for the purposes of the Scotland Act 1998 and the Northern Ireland Act   1998&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>One difficulty is that we have different degrees of devolved power throughout the United Kingdom, with Wales probably having the least. When I was in the Scottish Office as Secretary of State, I operated very closely with the Secretary of State for Education. That was essential, because we recognised that it was important to have a common policy on research and students throughout the United Kingdom. I do not want to follow my noble friend into subjects that are matters for later debates in the Bill, but that does not seem to be happening. Even at this late stage with the Bill, we do not know what the arrangements will be for Scottish students. The Minister answered some of my questions about what will happen to Scottish students who go to English universities with the statement that that is a matter for the Scottish Executive.
</p>

<a name="40510-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>I have sympathy with my noble friend&#039;s amendment, because he is trying to tease out what is happening. We are going to have a whole set of new bodies. In my <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_77"></a>

experience, if one tells a bureaucracy that it may set up a new bureaucracy, it tends to do so. If a whole new range of bodies is competing with a body that has United Kingdom responsibilities under charter, a whole load of people will argue for their research to separate bodies, playing one off against the other. In the end, the authority of the United Kingdom body will be damaged.

</p>

<a name="40510-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>My noble friend is wise to put the proposal down as a probing amendment. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s response, although the response to the probing question from my noble friend Lord Baker did rather give the game away. The situation is an odd one. We have one party in power in Wales and England, using the votes of people throughout the United Kingdom but apparently pursuing different policies and justifying them out of conviction.

<a name="40510-22_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   Half my blood is Welsh, and my grandfather played scrum half for the principality, so I am delighted to speak in support of the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord Roberts. He seems to me to be a harbinger crying in the wilderness. He has given us a clear indication of where his logic will take him at a later stage, and has achieved the remarkable accomplishment of tabling a probing and a paving amendment simultaneously. It will be very interesting to hear what the Minister has to say&#151;and I am quite certain that my noble friend will take it down to use in evidence against her.
</p>




<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="40510-22_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </b>   The debate has brought out an infelicity in the wording of the Bill, and asked whether it should say &quot;may&quot; or &quot;shall&quot;. I should perhaps share with Members of the Committee the amendment that I had thought of tabling. Transferring the logic of this amendment to subsection (3) and the Scottish Ministers, it might read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;The Scottish Ministers shall . . .  carry out . . .  research in the arts and humanities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>With all due respect to the Scottish Ministers, some of whom I know very well, I cannot really conceive that they should be required to carry out research, other than in their spare time, on Sunday mornings or after retirement. Even suggesting that they &quot;may&quot;, other than on Sunday mornings or after retirement, that seems to be going a bit far. I presume that there is some dreadful legal reason that I do not understand for the clause being worded in such a way.

<a name="40510-22_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am sure that there is some dreadful legal reason, but I fear that it escapes me at this precise moment. Clearly there are Ministers and representatives in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland&#151;and indeed, there is the noble Lord, Lord   Baker&#151;who would be perfectly capable of carrying out research on that basis, and I would not wish to suggest otherwise.

I do not propose to broaden my response very far this evening, mainly because I want   to read with great care what the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said and ensure that when we get to the areas of the Bill when there is a need to discuss those issues in detail, we are able to do so. However, I do not want to underestimate the strength of feeling within the Chamber about addressing these issues. I am very keen that we should have a full and wide-ranging debate on them as the opportunity arises. The noble Lord, Lord   Roberts, has indicated through his amendment the aspects that he wishes us to consider.

<p><a name="st_202"></a>
<a name="40510-23_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I think that is a bit off. Sometimes I am very capable of putting things well in my eloquent prose.
</p>

<a name="40510-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>There are no Welsh equivalents to the Arts and Humanities Research Council. There are advisory bodies   to the Secretaries of State for the devolved administrations. The administrations may choose, or not, to set up bodies that they feel are appropriate. It is not as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, described it&#151;that if one tells a bureaucracy that it can set something up, it automatically does so. There are good examples over the years of research councils, when those bodies have been set up. I have not heard anyone involved in those research councils say, nor have I seen anything to suggest, that the process has been in any way contradictory or inappropriate. The focus of the bodies is on different issues, working closely on specific and wide-ranging points of interest, not only to the Government but to society at large. An acknowledgement should be given that the Welsh Assembly should be able to do that, if that were what it wished to do.
</p>

<a name="40510-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>It is appropriate for the Arts and Humanities Research Council to ensure that there is interconnectivity in the United Kingdom, with the Welsh Assembly in discussion with the UK body. The matter is now reserved, as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, indicated. The process should take place with the support of the devolved administrations to ensure that research is carried out in the right way and that the advisory bodies work appropriately in advising the Welsh Assembly. There would be no need for interconnectivity between a body considering a specific issue of concern to the Welsh Assembly and a body considering a specific issue that concerned the Scottish Parliament. The interconnectivity would not exist in that way, but would exist in the role of the strategic Arts and Humanities Research Council.
</p>

<a name="40510-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>The purpose behind the provisions is to enable each of the devolved administrations to fund the work that they consider important in promoting research into <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_79"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 79</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

cultural aspects of their parts of the UK. As I have indicated, that will be different in each devolved administration. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, is aware that his amendment makes that mandatory rather than discretionary. We believe that that cuts across the discretionary powers of the National Assembly to determine priorities and activities. If this were on the face of the Bill, it would be obliged to put activities in place, regardless of the need for such activities and in the face of changing strategic requirements. I appreciate the intention, but it is important that the Assembly should be able to prioritise resources as it sees fit.
</p>

<a name="40510-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>For example, the Arts Council of Wales is responsible for funding and developing the arts in Wales and advises the Welsh Assembly on issues associated with the arts. Through the council, the Welsh Assembly has demonstrated its commitment to the furtherance of the arts and, of course, it is very committed to maintaining a strong cultural identify for Wales and has a strong commitment to the Welsh language, as my noble friend Lord Morgan indicated. This is an area in which it might be very appropriate for the Welsh Assembly to wish to do further research or work.
</p>

<a name="40510-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>So, on that basis, we can recognise the importance for the individual administrations of being able to set up appropriate advisory bodies. As I have indicated, this works extremely well with the other research councils and I see no reason to suggest that it would work any differently. On that basis, and with the proviso that, as I have indicated, we will be looking at the broader issues raised by the noble Lord as we proceed with the Bill, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_203"></a>
<a name="40510-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   I am very grateful to the Minister, not least for appreciating the point I was making: that my simple amendment, which substitutes &quot;shall&quot; for &quot;may&quot;, could be inserted into the Bill at any number of points, converting a permissive attitude, as far as the regional assemblies are concerned, into an obligation. I am very grateful to her for appreciating that point. I am sure that she also appreciates the point that if we do not impose an obligation upon the regional bodies to act in accordance with the Bill we shall have a very variegated pattern of higher education in the United Kingdom. That has all kinds of implications.
</p>

<a name="40510-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Morgan, is well aware of the point that is often made in devolution circles: that it is all very well now when we have the same party in government in Cardiff as in London. In fact, even when the same party is in government in both places, differences of view can occur&#151;I see the noble Lord, Lord Morgan, smiling. That is the case as far as higher education is concerned. As far as I can judge, the whole system suggested by the Bill is being set aside for the time being by the Assembly, pending further researches by itself. It may be that the Government in Whitehall are happy with that situation but I dread to think what the consequences may be.

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>Within the further education sector student complaints are handled in the first instance by internal college procedures, just as in the higher education sector. If the complaint is not satisfied the appeal may go first to the local learning and skills council, which is the financing organisation for the college, and then, if still unsatisfied, to the national Learning and Skills Council. If still not resolved, the student may finally raise the complaint with his Member of Parliament and the Member of Parliament may, on behalf of the student, take it to the Parliamentary Ombudsman.
</p>

<a name="40510-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>The second two stages&#151;to the local learning and skills council and then to the national Learning and Skills Council&#151;are not, strictly speaking, independent because the Learning and Skills Council is the funder of the college sector. But resort to the Parliamentary Ombudsman does satisfy the requirement of Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 that there should ultimately be an independent arbiter of disputes. In raising this issue, I am in no way impugning these procedures. The Association of Colleges rightly points out a very high degree of satisfaction with the current position among its students. When questioned, 95 per cent of its students said that they were satisfied with the complaints procedures as they exist at the moment.
</p>

<a name="40510-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>But there are ambiguities about the position of students who undertake higher education courses within the further education sector. Given the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_81"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 81</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government&#039;s plans, the scope of these ambiguities is likely to increase. The present position is that 11 per cent of those who are studying for degrees are already in the further education sector, not the higher education sector. As we know, the Government are planning a very substantial expansion in these numbers. An extra quarter of a million students are likely to be taken on between now and 2010 and, if the Government&#039;s plans are fulfilled, quite a number of these will not be studying for a three-year degree at a university but for a two-year foundation degree, many of which will be taken within the further education sector and many on a part-time basis. So we are likely to see a considerable increase in the number of students who are studying for a higher education qualification within the further education sector.
</p>

<a name="40510-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>The present position is that any further education institution that has more than 55 per cent of students in the higher education sector comes under HEFC and would therefore be covered by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator. Clause 11(d) says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;A designated institution, as defined by section 72(3) of the 1992 Act&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>applies to these institutions. In discussion in the other place, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State revealed that there were already some 23 such institutions covered by Clause 11(d). Clearly, given government plans for expansion, there may be an increase in the number of these organisations. Otherwise, as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;If someone is studying an HE course in a further education college, and the complaint has to do with the actions of the further education institution, it would not be a matter for this&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>in other words, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;complaints procedure, but if the complaint referred directly to the course of study which is the responsibility of the higher education institution, it would be covered by this complaints procedure&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee H, 10/2/03; col 77.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>The problem arises if there is a dispute or, indeed, uncertainty about whether the issue is about the quality of teaching within the further education institution, or whether it derives from the content of the course set by the higher education institution. There is, indeed, much room for dispute on such issues.

</p>

<a name="40510-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>In addition, it seems to me that there is a wider issue here. What I have been saying illustrates the increasing blurring of boundaries between higher and further education, but it also highlights the degree to which tertiary education, comprising both higher education and further education, is expanding, and is likely to go on expanding fast. Indeed, it is big business. It is one of the most profitable export businesses that we are running in this country. With the increasing &quot;marketisation&quot; of the sector, we can expect consumers to be more demanding and complaints to increase. We must have a robust complaints procedure and that is one of the reasons we are seeing the setting up of the Office of the Independent Adjudicator instead of relying on the archaic visitor system within the university sector.

<a name="40510-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I must confess that I am slightly confused by this amendment, but before I explain why I should say that I had a vocational education. All afternoon I have been surrounded by noble Lords who are either currently connected with universities, or have had a university education. I am not one of them. The further education system, as opposed to the higher education system, indeed conducts research. I remember at college years ago conducting research into naturally occurring root-producing hormones in willows and poplars. Therefore, the moment that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, raises the question of further post-16 education, I immediately take notice.
</p>

<a name="40510-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>This amendment opens the possibility of appeal by further education students to an independent adjudicator. That is fine. The White Paper states at paragraph 4.11:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;Reforms to give students a greater voice must include providing them with a fair, open, and transparent means of redress when things go wrong&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>That clearly is an unexceptionable statement with which we all agree. Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of Clause 11 cover universities and constituent colleges, schools or halls in universities and,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;an institution conducted by a higher education corporation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>We must be clear about our use of terms. The second page of the White Paper states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;the word &#039;university&#039; is frequently used, for reading ease as a substitute for &#039;higher education institution&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>It is important that students are clear about whether they are to have access to this new complaints procedure or not.

</p>

<a name="40510-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>My confusion with the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment concerns the Association of Colleges which made a clear statement that further education colleges have established effective complaints procedures and that the scheme, as the noble Baroness said, is approved by the Learning and Skills Council. It also says that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;it would be extremely unsatisfactory for FE colleges offering HE to be subject simultaneously to two different complaint regimes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>It argues basically that if it is not broken, why fix it? As I understand it, that is what the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment proposes, unless, of course, she is proposing the removal of the system currently in place in further education colleges. I am sure that the noble Baroness will tell me that in a moment.
</p>

<a name="40510-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>However, the amendment allows me to ask the Minister various questions; namely, whether the Government wish the provision in the Bill to relate to higher education and all higher education students, including those who are pursuing higher education courses in further education colleges. What we need to know, and, indeed, what I believe is important, is that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_83"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 83</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

whatever the new system is, it should be well publicised. The whole of the further and higher education sector&#151;students, staff and everyone else&#151;should know all about it at the soonest possible moment. Will the noble Baroness explain what steps will be taken to publicise the new complaints arrangements once, as I assume will happen, they are given Royal Assent? Will she also assure us that clarification will be provided to students and practitioners about who is and is not to be covered by the new arrangements because clearly neither the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, nor I is clear on this matter as we stand, or, indeed, sit, at the moment?
</p>




<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="40510-24_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   It might help the noble Lord if I were to clarify my position. Under the Human Rights Act an independent appeals procedure is required. Within the Association of Colleges within the FE sector at the moment that independence is given by appeal to the Parliamentary Ombudsman. What this suggestion would amount to is that rather than the ultimate appeal to the Parliamentary Ombudsman, through the college sector students should apply to what in effect would become a tertiary education ombudsman.
</p>




<p><a name="st_208"></a>
<a name="40510-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   I seek clarification. I was not clear whether in all further education institutions a student pursuing a course of higher education would have access to some independent person. I have the impression that in the great majority of cases someone pursuing an FE course would have that access. In certain FE institutions where there is a high proportion of higher education, that would apply. However, the noble Baroness left me unclear whether a small minority of HE students in FE institutions would have access to an independent person. If they do, I should be content with matters as they are. If that is not the case, it is essential under the human rights provisions that they have such access. I wonder whether the noble Baroness can clarify the position.
</p>




<p><a name="st_209"></a>
<a name="40510-24_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I shall see whether I can help the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, on this issue. Two slightly separate issues are raised here.

</p>

<a name="40510-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>As I understand it, where more than 55 per cent of the students in a college are studying for FE courses, that is covered by paragraph (d) of Clause 11. Therefore, it would be covered by the office of the independent adjudicator. However, there are potential problems. If the student is pursuing a higher education course in an FE college, it depends whether the complaint is about the quality of the teaching&#151;which is the responsibility of the FE college&#151;or about the quality of the curriculum&#151;which is usually the responsibility of a higher education institution because it is usually subcontracted from a higher education institution. If the complaint is about the quality of the teaching, it goes through the college procedures. If it is <br>&nbsp;<br>

about the way in which the subcontracted university has set the thing up, it would go through the office of the independent adjudicator.
</p>

<a name="40510-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>I was making the point that there is already room for ambiguity here. Given the expected expansion of foundation degrees and the role that further education colleges are likely to play with regard to foundation degrees, there is likely to be much more room for ambiguity. Perhaps the simplest solution would be to have just further education covered by the same procedures.

<a name="40510-24_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I should start by following the convention of the House in declaring past and present interests. I shall do that only once for the duration of the Bill and that should save time in the long run. I worked as an academic for many years at universities in the United Kingdom, where I was poorly paid, in the United States where I was rather well paid and, briefly, in India where I was hardly paid at all, but it was a wonderful experience. Like my noble friend Lady Warwick, I have also served as General Secretary of the Association of University Teachers, from 1993 to 2001, and I currently hold unpaid posts as Visiting Fellow in Economics and Fellow of Wolfson College at Cambridge University. I am also Senior Associate Fellow in the School of Engineering at the University of Warwick.
</p>

<a name="40510-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>This amendment would extend the scope of the reviewer, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has said, to consider complaints from students at further education colleges. It is common ground that the noble Baroness and, mostly, everyone else, agree that the present position on student complaints in higher education is thoroughly unsatisfactory. That is why we are seeking to give legislative underpinning to a scheme that has already been established in the higher education sector for the review of student complaints. It is not as though the sector has been inactive on this question.
</p>

<a name="40510-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>We have made clear that we intend to designate the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education&#151;the OIA&#151;which has the support, not just of the sector but the National Union of Students, as the approved operator. I pay tribute to the NUS, because its support and assistance has meant that this has been launched in probably as effective a way as possible. Our aim is to give a better right of redress to current and former students of higher education institutions.
</p>

<a name="40510-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>The amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, proposes that students in further education should also have access to the same independent reviewer. There was, as noble Lords have already mentioned, an interesting discussion in the other place on the complaints procedures for further education students and whether the independent <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_85"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 85</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reviewer&#039;s remit should be extended to cover such students. One of the key arguments that was made by Mr Phil Willis in the other place was that it would be helpful if there was some connection between the two. He described the connection as &quot;a scaffold&quot;, but which was an unfortunate term. None the less, he argued for a link.
</p>

<a name="40510-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that students at further education institutions have an established means of redress when things go wrong. The noble Lord, Lord   Skelmersdale, mentioned that a few moments ago and he is right. Local learning and skills councils are the appropriate route. They have procedures in place to deal with and resolve issues that are brought to their attention about the learning providers that they fund. Of course, the Learning and Skills Council is not an independent body. It falls under the Parliamentary Ombudsman&#039;s jurisdiction and that is why there is a further recourse beyond its own machinery, where a student can take a complaint to the ombudsman.
</p>

<a name="40510-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>Both the NUS and the Association of Colleges support the view&#151;strongly, I understand&#151;that it is inappropriate for the arrangements that are being underpinned in this Bill to be extended to cover further education students. There are fundamental differences between the further education and higher education sectors. For example, unlike most higher education institutions, further education institutions are learning providers and are not awarding bodies for qualifications. It is also true that where students at FE colleges have a complaint about the franchising or validation arrangements of a qualifying institution, say a university awarding their degrees, then they will have access to the reviewer.
</p>

<a name="40510-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>I shall briefly dwell on that point, because it is about the point of redress and the distinctions, which have been mentioned by a number of noble Lords. I do not think that Ivan Lewis, in another place, could have made the point more clearly. The scheme that is envisaged will straightforwardly ensure that where a complaint relates to a university&#039;s degree, which is being taken in a further education college, the student will have recourse to this complaints system. I can understand that it might be argued that there could be ambiguities around some marginal issues&#151;and they would be relatively marginal&#151;but the LSC and the OIA would be able to advise students on the most appropriate route and they are fully prepared to do so.
</p>

<a name="40510-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>That brings us back to the important point about publicity, made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. Of course, none of this would be of any use at all if people did not know about the scheme and did not know how best to use it. The scheme will require higher education institutions to inform students about their right of access to the OIA when they have exhausted the internal procedures. There will also be publicity through the NUS, which is developing a sophisticated scheme to ensure that everyone is in a position to act appropriately.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_86"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 86</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>If we added the further education system into that system, there would be a sea change. There are currently about 1.8 million students in higher education. There about 3.9 million more students&#151;on a head count&#151;in further education. There are 109   relevant institutions in higher education and 347 relevant institutions in further education. If we were invited to extend the system to ensure that it was as seamless as possible, I suppose that we would look, as we have been invited to, at tertiary education and begin to look at sixth form colleges&#151;and the relations that sixth form colleges often have with sixth forms in mainstream schools. I do not know where that boundary would ever then be drawn. I do know that the system would be inoperable. It could not cope with that. In the other place the Official Opposition pointed out that it would be likely to break the system before it ever had the chance to establish itself.
</p>

<a name="40510-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>I can see that there may well be further work required on how to reach a consensus about the handling of complaints from students in further education colleges and that is a matter which I am sure needs to be addressed&#151;and will be; but not in this context and not without doing insurmountable damage to the complaints procedure that is envisaged. In that, I hope, sympathetic light, I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

He said that what the Minister said in the other place could not be clearer: if it was a higher education course it would be dealt with by the OIA and if it is further education it would go through their own procedures. However, as I pointed out, he also said that if someone is studying a higher education course in a further education college and the complaint related to the actions of the further education institution, it would not be a matter for the   OIA. But if the complaint referred directly to the   course of study, which is the responsibility of the higher education institution, it would be covered by the OIA.

</p>




<p><a name="st_218"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I should like to thank the Government and all your Lordships for taking part in this important debate. The United Nations remains the only global institution, with a membership of 191 member states, which has truly universal principles. The main objectives of the United Nations charter, being drawn up and coming into existence in 1945, were conflict prevention; to promote human rights, justice and respect for international obligations; and to promote social progress and better standards of life. The UN has evolved to deal with the challenges of peacekeeping roles as well as humanitarian work in times of conflict and during natural disasters.
</p>

<a name="40510-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>The task for the United Nations is enormous, but the resources somewhat limited. Since 1945, its membership has increased from 51 to 191 and the world population has increased from 2.5 billion to more than 7 billion. The challenges of dealing with poverty, hunger and disease, such as HIV/AIDS, have also increased. Along with those problems, there have been many conflicts that have cost millions of lives in Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans, Kashmir, Chechnya and the Far East.
</p>

<a name="40510-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>In my view, the United Nations Security Council is now facing the biggest challenge, which is its perceived lack of legitimacy since its birth. At least during the Cold War, debates took place within the Security Council, although with many vetoes been used by both superpowers. However, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, slowly, the role of the United Nations has been diminishing and recent events in the Middle East have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_88"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 88</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

proved that the sole superpower can and does ignore the United Nations&#151;or at least, that is how it is perceived.

</p>

<a name="40510-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>Much of the United Nations&#039; work gets little publicity in relation to social development, gender equality, environmental protection, human rights, economic development and co-operation, international organised crime and other bodies such as UNHCR, UNICEF, UNESCO, the IMF, the WHO&#151;the list goes on of the successful work carried on by those UN bodies. The recent successful work of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Iran has been important and deserves to be commended.
</p>

<a name="40510-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>The United Nations&#039; credibility in preventing wars and genocides is also seriously damaged since the massacres of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995 and the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994. We have witnessed massacres of near-genocidal proportions in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Liberia, where the United Nations&#039; response has been hesitant and slow. Much of the reason for that could be said to be due to the fact that the UN does not have available a rapid reaction force for peacekeeping and preventing wars and genocides.
</p>

<a name="40510-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>The UN&#039;s ability to implement many outstanding resolutions is also seen as selective. Resolutions on the right of self-determination in Kashmir, for example, are outstanding from 1948 and 1949. The suffering of the Kashmiri people is continuing, with more than 80,000 deaths while both India and Pakistan continue to waste money on nuclear weapons rather than using their valuable resources for the eradication of poverty, which is desperately needed in both countries. India has more than 300 million people living below poverty, with half of Pakistan&#039;s population also living on less than two dollars a day.

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>The United Nations&#039; biggest failure has been in relation to the Middle East, where the United States has vetoed resolutions in the Security Council in its support of Israel; and actions in Iraq have further undermined the authority of the Security Council.
</p>

<a name="40510-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>There is a danger of the UN becoming ever more irrelevant in matters of world security, as did its predecessor, the League of Nations. If so, the job of stopping wars and genocides and of constraining tyrants would become even closer to impossible. For all those reasons, we must support the strengthening of the United Nations and help to regain its legitimacy. Otherwise, many countries will increasingly feel free to take unilateral action against perceived threats, further undermining world security.
</p>

<a name="40510-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>I wholeheartedly support the Government&#039;s commitment and support for the reform of the UN in their Command Paper. I welcome the latest round of the Secretary-General&#039;s programme of reforms, launched in September 2002, entitled, <i>Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for further change</i>. I also   welcome the Secretary-General&#039;s appointment of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, to a high-level panel examining the ways in which the UN handles threats to international peace and security. I am delighted to see the noble Lord&#039;s name on the speakers&#039; list and look forward to hearing his contribution.

<a name="40510-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>Reform of the UN is inevitable and necessary. It must be democratic, less bureaucratic and more modern in all its services. The non-aligned movement must feel equal to the developed world; as the OIC and the Arab League must also feel as important as the European Union.
</p>

<a name="40510-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>The question now being asked is how we can strengthen the United Nations. That is a vital and significant topic of debate which needs strategies and answers to avoid future problems. The UN must not lose its integral authority, importance and respect as an international forum. People&#039;s confidence in the council is weakening, and we must focus on the meaning and significance of what it is to be a part of the United Nations. As British citizens as well as international neighbours, we must be proud and confident that we are helping those in need.
</p>

<a name="40510-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>Thousands and thousands of individuals and organisations around the world are working hard to control and manage issues of international peace and security. Many organisations have been extremely effective in protecting human rights and exposing gross violations wherever they have occurred, even in the past few days. Reforms need to be instigated to ensure that UN resolutions are strictly followed through and that international peace and security is looked at thoroughly and dealt with in the best way.
</p>

<a name="40510-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>It is important that the United Nations states clearly the difference between Chapters 6 and 7 resolutions&#151;although, in my opinion, all United Nations resolutions, from whichever chapter, are important and should be implemented. We must also ensure that countries such as Israel cannot defy and ignore UN authority time after time. If it is good enough for Mohamed El Baradei of the IAEA to go into Iran and Libya, it must be right for him to go into Israel to investigate its nuclear capabilities and weapons of mass destruction.
</p>

<a name="40510-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>I support the Government&#039;s proposal for the expansion of the Security Council membership from 15 to 24, including some additional permanent members. It makes sense to include Germany and Japan as well as countries from Africa, Latin America and Asia. However, we must not support membership of any countries that have outstanding UN resolutions with which they have not complied.
</p>

<a name="40510-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>We must also consider making the Security Council more inclusive and relevant to modern challenges. Seventy per cent of the wars and disputes are related to the Muslim world, whether in Nagorno-Karabakh, Sudan, Chechnya, Kashmir, Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq or the Balkans. Therefore, it makes sense to include at least one permanent member from the OIC or the Arab League to ensure that there is representation from this section of the world community.
</p>

<a name="40510-25_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>Another major challenge to us all has been international terrorism. We must fight it together whenever it threatens our national security and interests. We must be prepared to condemn state terrorism also. Many countries now abuse UN Security Council Resolution 1373 of 2001, which is binding on all member states to combat terrorism by all means&#151;that is, threats   to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. Resolutions 1377 and 1373 of 2001 have a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_90"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 90</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

far-reaching impact on international human rights and humanitarian law, particularly in cases where the pursuit of human rights may be confused with the animation of   terrorism. I quote the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;An effective international strategy to counter terrorism should use human rights as its unifying framework. The suggestion that human rights violations are permissible in certain circumstances is wrong. The essence of human rights is that human life and dignity must not be compromised and that certain acts, whether carried out by the state or non-state actors, are never justified no matter what the ends. International human rights and humanitarian law define the boundaries of permissible political and military conduct. A reckless approach towards human life and liberty undermines counter terrorism&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-25_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>We must ensure that a war on terrorism is not perceived as a war on Islam or Muslims. We must give special attention to people&#039;s rights of liberty and security, the right to be free from arbitrary arrest, the presumption of innocence, the right to a free trial, freedom of opinion, expression and assembly, and the right of self-determination.

<p><a name="st_219"></a>
<a name="40510-26_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </b>   My Lords, this brief debate is extremely timely. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, for raising the need to strengthen the UN.

</p>

<a name="40510-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>In my experience, support for the UN in this country is broad but also tends to be rather shallow. There is a tendency to expect too much of the UN and then, when it fails to deliver, to assume that it is a hopeless case, a noble aspiration but not one that will play an effective role in achieving global peace, security and development as its charter requires. There is an unwillingness to look beneath the surface of our failures and to analyse our own joint responsibility for those failures. The UN is, after all, an intergovernmental organisation; it is not some disembodied entity, sent to rule the world. When it fails, it often does so because its stakeholders, the member states, have failed to give it the resources and political backing that it needs to carry out the tasks it has been asked to undertake.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>For the UN, 2003 was a bad year. Its Security Council was divided and paralysed in the run-up to the war in Iraq; its leading members lapsed into acrimonious public dispute; and then, in August, it lost some of its finest public servants in an outrage in Baghdad designed to ensure that it did not play the essential role that was needed if Iraq was to move towards peace, democracy and prosperity. So the Secretary-General was surely right to sound the alarm when he spoke to the General Assembly in September last year and to argue that we were at a fork in the road, where we could either lapse into unilateralism, with the risk of an increasingly insecure world, or summon up the collective will to make the UN more effective at facing up to the threats and challenges that we face. To give him advice on all that, he set up a panel, on which I have the honour to serve, and we are due to report to him in December.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>What are the threats and challenges that we face? They are certainly not the same ones as we faced during the Cold War. The failure to think through the post-Cold War agenda in a systematic and purposeful <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_91"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 91</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

way is one of the explanations for the UN&#039;s patchy performance over the past 15 years. During that time the UN has had its successes. It reversed an aggression by Iraq against Kuwait; it wound down a fair number of the proxy wars that had sprung up during the Cold War&#151;in Namibia, El Salvador, Cambodia, Mozambique and, eventually, in East Timor.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>But it had some serious failures too&#151;in Somalia, Bosnia and Rwanda. Those failures and others that followed&#151;in Kosovo and in Iraq last year&#151;reveal basically two types of failure: one of execution and the other of concept. It became clear during the 1990s that the UN was not equipped to handle enforcement operations and that its member states were not prepared to equip it to do so. Nor were they prepared to step in and do it themselves with UN authority, except in the one case of Iraq&#039;s attack on Kuwait. The failure of concept arose over what to do when Security Council resolutions were defied, as they were in Kosovo and Iraq, and where fundamental disagreements over the use of force paralysed the Security Council.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>Of the new threats that we now face, clearly international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and, worse still, the possibility of the combination of those two threats are real and present dangers. But they are not the only ones, and they are not the ones that seem most pressing in many parts of the world. The collapse of states, leading sometimes to genocide and often to regional mayhem, extremes of poverty, pandemic diseases such as AIDS, environmental degradation and unequal opportunities for trade all represent threats, even if indirect ones, to peace and security.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>So we need a broad agenda, not a narrow one. We must not neglect old, festering problems such as those in Palestine and Kashmir, to which the noble Lord referred. They are, if anything, even more dangerous now than they have ever been before, and their neglect leads to legitimate accusations of double standards.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>It is clear that the responses to those threats and challenges must be policy-driven. It makes no sense to believe that simply tweaking the institutions in New York will somehow bring of its own volition a substantially better outcome than we have already. But it is surely just as unwise to believe that you will have no need to adjust institutions to make them capable of handling effectively the policy prescriptions for the future.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>The two aspects are really two sides of the same coin, and both will need to be addressed. We will need to look at ways of preventing states failing and learning to marshal the joint efforts of the international financial institutions and the Security Council to that end. We will need to consider how the UN can work in tandem with regional and sub-regional organisations. In some parts of the world&#151;Africa for example&#151;regional and sub-regional organisations are showing a welcome willingness to engage in conflict prevention, peacemaking and peacekeeping. But they lack resources. They need help in training, logistics, the civilian aspects of complex operations and, above all, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_92"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 92</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

money. The European Union is showing the way by earmarking 260 million euros of assistance for the African Union, but more will need to be done.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>We will need to strengthen the organisations working against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In the case of biological weapons we will need to break the impasse over an intrusive inspection regime. We will need to intensify our co-operation against terrorism through shared intelligence and police work and the denial of safe havens for terrorists.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>At the end of this year it will be up to the member states to decide what to do with the panel&#039;s report and the Secretary-General&#039;s recommendations on it. As always at the United Nations, implementation and follow-up are matters for governments, not for panels of experts, however expert they may be. I hope very much that the British Government, as both a permanent member of the Security Council and a leading member of the European Union, will play an important and proactive role in the handling of the report. In the first half of 2005, with a newly elected or re-elected US president in office, we will discover whether the attempt to build a new consensus around a more effective UN has any chance of success. I would argue that no country has a greater stake in the success of that venture than Britain, and I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us something of the Government&#039;s thinking.

<p><a name="st_220"></a>
<a name="40510-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Parekh: </b>   My Lords, I begin by thanking my noble friend Lord Ahmed for raising this important subject this evening.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>In international affairs, the United Nations, unlike the League of Nations, which preceded it, enjoys considerable moral and political authority and has, over the years, become a major source of legitimacy. The actions of a state are generally accepted as right and carry a good deal of authority, if they are authorised by the United Nations. Why is that so? There are several reasons. When a state&#039;s actions are authorised by the United Nations, that state acts not in an individual capacity but on behalf of and in the name of the international community. Its actions are publicly debated and approved and therefore carry broad global consensus. They are also deemed to be lawful and just.

</p>

<a name="40510-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>As the United Nations is so important as a newly emerging source of international legitimacy, everything should be done to respect and nurture its authority. If its authority were to be undermined, we would be in a state of anarchy in which might could become the sole criterion for right. Although that is generally accepted, as it ought to be, the United Nations can be only as good as its members, and their record, sadly, has not always been honourable.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>Many United Nations resolutions have been selectively enforced, even when they fall within the same chapter. The latest incident&#151;the war on Iraq&#151;shows how much the authority of the United Nations has been undermined. The way in which the United States went about buying up small, non-permanent <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_93"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 93</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

members of the Security Council is an example of that. Resolution 1441 was interpreted as if every state were free to consult its own lawyers and decide whether the war was lawful. The United Nations should have been consulted, and a body of international jurists should have been asked to decide whether Resolution 1441 authorised action without a further resolution. The work of the United Nations inspectors was cut short, without the approval of the United Nations. In other words, we went to war in the name of upholding the authority of the United Nations, but we did everything in our power to undermine that authority and to expose that organisation to public ridicule.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>There is a grave danger that the United Nations might be reduced to a moral fig leaf for the dubious and aggressive designs of powerful states. The question is not just one of strengthening the United Nations. We could strengthen it, so that it could be used as a moral fig leaf only by certain powers. Thus, the authority of the United Nations would become a veil behind which the aggressive designs of a particular country might be pursued. It is a question of restructuring the United Nations in such a way that it enjoys the respect of world opinion and can exercise independent authority.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>How should we restructure the United Nations? We should rely on three criteria. The first is, &quot;How can we make it more representative?&quot;; the second is, &quot;How can we improve the quality of debate?&quot;; and the third is, &quot;How can we increase its independence and capacity for collective action?&quot;. Those are the three criteria by which I would judge any proposal made for the restructuring of the United Nations.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>There is no shortage of proposals for restructuring the United Nations. I shall not take the House through the whole syllabus, but I shall suggest three or four that are of great importance. Everything possible should be done to increase the power of the General Assembly and to make the Security Council accountable to it. In so far as it resembles a parliament, the General Assembly has a certain representative legitimacy that the Security Council does not have. No war or act of humanitarian intervention should be undertaken without authorisation by the General Assembly. In short, we should increasingly think about making the General Assembly more like a world parliament.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>Secondly, the Security Council needs to be more representative, and its powers must be carefully rethought. It is extraordinary that the five permanent members of the Security Council should include two European powers, one Western power and a half-European power&#151;Russia&#151;while the rest of mankind, by accident of history, is represented only by China. The current structure of the United Nations simply freezes the state of the world as it was in 1945. But the world has moved on: either we should get rid of the veto or it should be regionally distributed, so that every major continent has, in one form or another, a right to exercise the veto. Alternatively, the veto could be overridden, either by an ordinary majority on the Security Council or by the General Assembly.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_94"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 94</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>Thirdly, the Secretary-General should have the right, as the representative of the United Nations, to require troops or such other help as is needed from member states to carry out the resolutions of the United Nations.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>Fourthly, the United Nations, as its name indicates, is really a trade union of nation states. It is a closed shop. Only the states can speak in the name of their citizens, and many important voices, such as the voices of ordinary citizens who are critical of the policies of their government or the voices of civil society and the NGOs, are simply not heard.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>It is unacceptable that the state or government should be the only spokesman for all the citizens of a country. There are many ways in which that can be changed. It should, for example, be possible to devise bodies in which non-official bodies can be heard. Lots of proposals have been made. One is that there is no reason why the Secretary-General should not consult representatives of NGOs, civil society and other associations that are accredited to the United Nations and recognised by it. Nor is there any reason why unofficial organisations such as the World Social Forum or others may not be given the facility to meet from time to time and express their views, which, although not binding on the Secretary-General, would have powerful moral authority.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>In other words, what should we do? We need to find ways of ensuring that the United Nations does not simply function as a trade union of the states and simply strengthen the power of the states vis-&#224;-vis their own citizens or unofficial bodies.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>I should like to think that this debate could not have taken place at a more appropriate time. The Iraq war and what has happened subsequently give us the opportunity and the incentive to restart the debate on how the United Nations should be transformed. The war was conceived in secret, based on deception and manipulation of world opinion, conducted in a legal void and created a culture of lawlessness, the consequences of which we are witnessing even now.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>If one embarks on a war without clearly knowing why one is embarking on it, and on the basis of alleged practices that are themselves suspect, a climate is created in which people feel free to take the law into their own hands. What has happened in Iraqi prisons, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere are simply&#151;I am almost tempted to say&#151;moral entailments of the very climate in which the war was conducted and legitimised.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>In this country and elsewhere, we have all been ashamed by what we saw in Iraqi prisons at the hands of our soldiers. I readily concede that it involved an extremely small number of soldiers. Nevertheless, that it should have happened or should have been allowed to happen for several months is a matter of disgrace to every sensitive citizen here and elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="40510-26_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>Therefore, it is very important that we should rethink what the United Nations should and could do in such situations. I should have thought that as one small, tentative step to restoring authority, it might not be a bad idea to ask the United Nations to conduct an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_95"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 95</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

investigation into what has gone wrong in Iraqi prisons and at Guantanamo Bay. That would be one way in which we could recognise the authority of the United Nations and create a climate in which we can think more intelligently and sensitively about where we should be going in this increasingly chaotic world.

<p><a name="st_221"></a>
<a name="40510-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, we are very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, for giving us the opportunity to discuss the reform of the United Nations. As he said, its tasks are enormous. It is impossible to do more than scratch the surface of the subject in the few minutes that we have at our disposal.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>I want to pick up the point that the noble Lord made about the credibility of the United Nations having been severely damaged by some of the failures, to which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has also referred, and, in particular, the failures that we suffered in Rwanda and Srebrenica. Your Lordships may remember that four years ago we had a debate on the lessons to be learnt from the reports that were commissioned by the United Nations on its operations in Srebrenica and Rwanda.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>Recently, we have been commemorating the 10th   anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda. There was an event in Portcullis House at which the First Lady of Rwanda spoke, as did the Secretary of State for International Development. As people do on those occasions, they said that such an event must never be allowed to happen again. The problem is that people were saying that for years after the Holocaust, and it did happen again. The genocide in Rwanda is a reminder of the fact that we failed the purposes of the United Nations when it was first established, which was to prevent that kind of thing occurring.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>A key recommendation of the report on Rwanda was that the Secretary-General would initiate a plan of action to prevent genocide, which would involve the whole UN system. There was to be an effective early-warning system involving NGOs and academics, as well as the secretariat itself. The UN, and in particular the Security Council, were to be prepared to act to prevent genocide or gross violations of human rights. But all that we have done so far is to create better systems for picking up the pieces after the event.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>It is true that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has no doubt been strengthened in the wake of the Brahimi report. I was pleased to see that the Security Council is to conduct a debate on 17 May on the recent surge in demand for peacekeeping operations and to evaluate the progress that has been made on the Brahimi recommendations. I am proud to say that the UK is involved in 14 peacekeeping operations and we have played a leading part in the reform process. We are also closely involved in the Secretary-General&#039;s examination of the way in which the UN deals with threats to international peace and security. I think that that is the biggest challenge of all. We have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, on the way in which this is being approached by the panel of which he is a distinguished member.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_96"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 96</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>Under the charter, there are only two circumstances in which any state can intervene in another&#039;s territory with military force; that is, first, in self-defence, under Article 51, and, secondly, in pursuit of a resolution of the Security Council, under Article 42, which almost invariably is preceded by a declaration that a threat to peace exists under Article 39.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>Now there is also said to be,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;a clear justification in international law to protect people where they are threatened by an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>That was said by the Secretary of State for Defence in evidence given to the Defence Select Committee, and was the argument for the intervention in Iraq in 1991   and, more recently, in Kosovo. The Foreign Affairs Committee wanted the principles governing humanitarian intervention to be established in the United Nations, and that problem still remains. If, in all the cases not explicitly covered by the charter, the judgment of risk is entirely a matter for the state concerned, there is no law. The essence of the rule of law is that the actors, whether they be individuals in the case of domestic law or states under international law, submit to the jurisdiction of their peers. I therefore respectfully suggest that the Secretary-General&#039;s commission should concentrate on formulating a set of rules to cover the circumstances that have arisen or may arise where, in the opinion of the member states, or a majority of them, intervention is justifiable.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>I accept that it is not possible in practice to amend the charter. What might be considered by the Panyarachun commission, of which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, is a distinguished member, is a set of guidelines to be applied voluntarily by states in considering whether to use force under the humanitarian rubric, which I have quoted, or in self-defence under Article 51, and particularly where action is to be taken against a threatened rather than an actual attack. If at some time in the future two-thirds of the UN member states had adopted these guidelines, they could then be approved as a form of secondary legislation to extend the charter.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>I do hope that the mechanisms that are to be developed as a result of the Panyarachun commission will confirm the principle that intervention is justifiable against the wishes of the state concerned to prevent an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe. The examples mentioned by the noble and learned Lord the Attorney General in the debate held last month on UN action, and which have cropped up again this evening&#151;Somalia, eastern DRC, East Timor, Sierra Leone and, most recently, Haiti&#151;were all cases where the state concerned had agreed that the UN did have a role.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>However, I want to mention the case of Darfur, where Sudan has not agreed to UN involvement. We are now 30 days into the 45-day humanitarian ceasefire. Although ethnic cleansing is still in full swing, there is not even the international monitoring mechanism which has been identified as necessary by everyone from the acting UN High Commissioner for human rights downwards. Outlining an action plan to   prevent genocide last month, and specifically <br>&nbsp;<br>

mentioning his deep foreboding over the reports from Darfur, the Secretary-General said that the one legacy he most wished to leave to his successors was an organisation better equipped to prevent genocide and to act decisively to stop it when prevention fails. That is our objective too. As Bill Rammell said in another place last November:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;Action should be taken only to prevent genocide or major loss of civilian life that could destabilise other states and threaten international peace and security&quot;. [<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 11/11/03; col. 207.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>That situation has now been reached in Darfur. US AID warns that perhaps 30 per cent of the affected population, some 360,000 people, could perish over the next nine months. Ten years after Rwanda, 60   years after the Holocaust, Britain must do everything possible to prevent this catastrophe and to see that the action plan to prevent genocide proposed by the Secretary-General is not just a piece of paper.

<a name="40510-27_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, like others, I am deeply grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, for promoting this debate. He speaks with authority and feeling on this issue and we are all indebted to him. It is difficult to be optimistic about the immediate future of the United Nations, but I believe very strongly that it is necessary and possibly, as the noble Lord, Lord   Ahmed, said, more necessary than ever in the past.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>To begin where we are, everyone is now looking to the United Nations to step into Iraq and somehow stabilise the situation as it enters its most critical post-war stage. But the question hangs in the air: is the United Nations either capable of performing this role,   or willing to do so? If there is hesitation at the UN headquarters in New York, that is entirely understandable. As has already been mentioned, the last chief official of the UN, the late and brilliant Sergio de Melo, was murdered by a bomb. Most of the non-governmental agencies such as Oxfam and the Red Cross are now leaving Iraq, not going in, and in the current frenzied atmosphere it seems that UN personnel are themselves regarded as agents of the coalition in some distorted way, and therefore just as much enemies of Iraqi extremists and terrorist groups as are the Americans. Indeed, the Secretary-General himself, Kofi Annan, has been named by some Shi&#039;ite extremists as the target for assassination, along with Mr Paul Bremer and other leading members of the provisional administration. How can the UN send its officials and workers back into this sinister maelstrom, and who is going to volunteer to go? This questions have to be addressed. One cannot just assume that hope will solve them. It will not.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>The Iraq drama has raised even bigger questions behind those. The main question is whether an organisation which includes every recognised state on Earth&#151;all 191 of them&#151;which was constructed more than half a century ago in totally different conditions, is capable of policing a turbulent world. Is it capable of meeting the sort of threats that the noble Lord, Lord   Hannay, mentioned in his very authoritative speech, such as global terrorism, when there are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_98"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 98</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

disputes even on how to define terrorism and on what is, or is not, a rogue state? Is this asking too much of the organisation?
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>The list of where it has totally failed to engage is, alas, a long one: Chechnya, Rwanda, Kosovo, the lethal Arab- Israeli dispute and, of course, Iraq itself. Its failures in Bosnia, notably the appalling massacre at Srebrenica, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord   Ahmed, led to probably the lowest point in the inhuman treatment of humans in the 20th century. Certainly it was the lowest point in Europe since the Holocaust.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>We all know the current structure of the UN is archaic, as the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, emphasised. It is perfectly obvious that major nations like Japan, Germany and India ought to have a similar status to the existing permanent five Security Council members, even if the overall status of those nations has to change. Furthermore, the UN&#039;s membership includes some of the world&#039;s worst dictatorships and, regrettably, these unsavoury regimes play an active role in the UN&#039;s activities. It still strikes me as very odd that Libya&#151;where, I read this week, some nurses are currently being threatened with execution&#151;chairs the Human Rights Commission, even if it has recently declared itself to be a more responsible nation. Sudan, which is currently conducting murderous attacks on tribal minorities&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, constantly reminds us&#151;is a member of that committee, along with Syria and Cuba. That cannot be right.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>It gets worse. The entire UN organisation is now mired in a gigantic scandal, arising from the former Oil for Food scheme, which was meant to help Iraq&#039;s starving and dying children while Saddam Hussein still ruled in Baghdad. The cynicism and cruelty of that operation is breathtaking, and it seems that all those protestors who were raining down curses on Western governments for making the innocent Iraqi populace suffer were aiming at the wrong target. Suspicion now   points not only at the former Iraqi dictator&#151;who no-one trusted anyway&#151;but at officials in Moscow, Paris and, alas, in New York, in the UN itself. Until this stain on the UN is removed, as I hope it can be, it obviously has to be asked how anyone can expect that organisation to fulfil the massive new governing tasks being asked of it, or to carry out, proudly and credibly, its supposed role as the source of all international legality and justice.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>Yet, having said all that&#151;and I know it is negative&#151;what could conceivably replace the United Nations? For all its obvious faults, it is a great deal better than nothing. After all, many of its numerous agencies&#151;although not all&#151;do superb humanitarian work, as noble Lords have already said, and are staffed by amazingly dedicated and brave people. I have to say that some of the agencies raise questions somewhat when one looks at them. I am not sure that UNCTAD has fulfilled its role. I have never quite understand what UNIDO&#151;the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation&#151;is up to in Vienna. And I am not sure what the UN Economic Commission for Europe, which is a sort of left-over of the era of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_99"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 99</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Marshall plan and the Cold War, gets up to nowadays. But no one questions the superb work of the UNHCR, nor of the UNDP; nor, of course, of UNICEF, which is a marvellous organisation.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>Currently, the UN has 13 authorised armed forces wearing the famous blue helmets operating in peacekeeping situations around the world. People compare it with the old League of Nations, but it is quite different; unlike the League of Nations, every single nation state on earth is a member. So for all its glaring faults&#151;and we must be realistic about those&#151;it is probably the best kind of global assembly that can be brought together in today&#039;s novel, difficult and sometimes terrifying conditions.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>In my view the real enemies of a stronger UN are not those who express scepticism or concern about its potential, but those who would overload it with almost divine powers and promote it as some kind of world government which it can never be. Many coalitions and policing operations are bound to continue outside the UN purview. Many ugly perversions of human dignity and rights are bound to continue unchecked by such a diverse and rambling construction.

</p>

<a name="40510-27_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>I believe that the best way to see the UN is as a mirror of the world as it is, a reflection of both our high hopes and of course our disagreements. That amazing man Dag Hammarskjold had a marvellous phrase when he said that it was created not to take mankind to paradise but merely to save it from hell. I thought that a very good summary, made many years ago, of course, before his untimely death. That is probably about right. What does it mean? It means continuing to work patiently to reform the UN, but not to demand or expect too much from it, as the noble Lord, Lord   Hannay, warned us. Dozens of plans for streamlining and modernising the structure, and particularly the Security Council, have been tabled in recent years, including proposals from our Government&#151;indeed from successive governments&#151;in their White Paper and on other occasions. Dozens more will have to be put forward to ensure that there is real improvement.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>As for the Iraq situation, with which I began, it is going to be resolved only by the Iraqis themselves, notably by the moderate Shia majority. The sooner they are handed proper sovereignty, and the sooner they state quite clearly what kind of coalition and which security forces they want to stay at their request in their country, the sooner that the poisonous extremist factions will be driven out. The task appears to be too complex for the Americans alone; I have always thought that. But it is also far too tough a task for a UN administration magically to solve, whether the UN is reformed or unreformed and whether it has the capability and the will or not. Other countries, including very much our own, I am afraid, will now have to take not only the strong lead we have taken but a still stronger lead.
</p>

<a name="40510-27_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>Realism, not idealism, is the best friend of the United Nations. That is the approach that will enable it to work as well as possible in a highly imperfect and very dangerous world.

<p><a name="st_223"></a>
<a name="40510-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the whole House is grateful to my noble friend Lord Ahmed for securing this debate. I congratulate him on his powerful advocacy of the role of the United Nations. He was somewhat more optimistic about the future of the United Nations than perhaps was the noble Lord, Lord Howell. However, the whole debate has balanced the need for reform, based on optimism and what the United Nations can do to improve the situation in the world by means of resolution conflict and in so many other ways, with realism about past failures and weaknesses which need to be addressed.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>I assure the House that the United Nations is at the heart of the Government&#039;s foreign policy and that strengthening it to face the future is a government priority. This debate is particularly timely as the Secretary-General&#039;s High Level Panel on the UN response to threats to peace and security is now fully under way. I shall say a little more about the panel later. I am very grateful that we had a contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, who serves on that panel. He has given the House some very judicious insights about the challenges that we face and some constructive indications about how the work may proceed.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>When discussing the strengthening of the United Nations, we should not lose sight of the fact that there is much that the United Nations already does well. In introducing the debate, my noble friend suggested that the Security Council has been increasingly ignored. That is not entirely true. The Security Council has never been more active than recently; for example, in the past two years we have seen the deployment of an   effective peacekeeping operation in Liberia, and UN   support for the formation of a transitional government in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, offering hope and the chance of peace to millions of people. Sierra Leone, East Timor and, despite recent problems, Kosovo are UN success stories.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>I understand that those accomplishments may appear minor compared with some of the very major threats that we all recognise exist in the world at present. I would be the last to ignore the importance of the points that have been raised on all sides of the House in this very well informed debate, but it is also right that we should keep in mind some balance in regard to the achievements of the UN.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>In recent years the UN has played a leading role in the fight for justice to be meted out to the perpetrators of the worst international crimes: genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The International Criminal Tribunal, set up by the Security Council to deal with the atrocities in Rwanda and the Balkans, has convicted dozens of perpetrators of such crimes.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>I turn to the point emphasised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that we need to act in time to stop such horrors, rather than deal with justice after they have occurred. I shall seek to answer many of the constructive points that he made. Nevertheless, we should also recognise that those who perpetrate such crimes against humanity have clear signals sent out to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_101"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 101</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

them that the United Nations and the international community will play their part in bringing to justice those guilty of such horrors.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>In 2002 the World Food Programme provided assistance to 72 million of the world&#039;s poorest people, while the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees provides support to the world&#039;s estimated 45   million refugees. Such matters are not trumpeted widely; those are not the headline-grabbing issues that we see in the newspapers&#151;the great conflicts play that role&#151;but they are solid achievements of the United Nations and they should not be underestimated.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>As noble Lords including the noble Lord, Lord   Howell, have pointed, despite those successes, there are many areas where the United Nations is not succeeding as well as we would want. Estimates suggest that over 60 per cent of African nations emerging from conflict return to that state within five years. Despite the many excellent examples of peacekeeping operations, it would clearly be better if the international community, through the UN, could prevent conflict, rather than take action after conflict has broken out.

</p>

<a name="40510-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>In the past few years we have seen the emergence of new threats to our security. My noble friend Lord Ahmed emphasised the issues of international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Issues as diverse as the spread of HIV/AIDS and environmental degradation are beginning to have a potentially devastating impact on the lives of millions of people, particularly those in Africa. Those issues were simply not envisaged as global threats to security when the UN charter was written. If we consider the threats to the quality of life, even to the continuance of life for so many people in the world, we have to recognise how significant the issues are.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>The UN has, however, started to take effective action to counter the threat of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Security Council sent out a clear message immediately after 11 September that terrorism is a threat to peace and security and that those supporting or harbouring terrorists could therefore expect Security Council action. The Counter Terrorism Committee, set up by the Security Council to monitor action taken by countries to suppress and prevent terrorism, has been strengthened and revitalised. A new executive directorate will make it more effective to act against those states that fail to meet their obligations. On the bright side, I should also mention that it is encouraging that Libya, although not under the auspices of the United Nations, has changed its perspective in relation to such issues. We should derive some satisfaction from that.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>Similarly, we have recently seen a breakthrough with the adoption of a resolution by the Security Council on Counter-proliferation. All states will be obliged to act to prevent weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of non-state actors. The Security Council will set up a mechanism to monitor states&#039; actions in this area, which the Government welcome.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_102"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 102</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>Strengthening the United Nations is possible without changes to institutions. However, some areas will clearly benefit from institutional reform. The UK has long been a firm supporter of enlarging the Security Council. My noble friend Lord Ahmed made it an important part of his contribution, and I believe that it probably was the main theme of my noble friend Lord Parekh, that an institution that was set up against the power relationships of 1945 needs to change in the light of new relationships in a modern and very different world.

</p>

<a name="40510-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>We believe that there should be new permanent members. We have supported the candidatures of Japan and Germany for many years. We also support the creation of permanent seats for Africa, Asia and Latin   America, and we believe that India and Brazil are pre-eminent candidates from the latter two regions. We also believe that there should be new non-permanent members. That model would significantly increase the representation of the developing world, but the council would not be so large as to be inefficient. The point was forcefully expressed that it is not representative of the modern world while developing countries are unrepresented on the inner councils of the United Nations.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>It is important to stress that the strengthening of the UN is about more than expanding the Security Council. The General Assembly has a vital role to play in allowing all member states to debate and vote on a wide range of important international issues. I heard my noble friend Lord Parekh emphasise the significance of the General Assembly&#039;s role. The UK supports the efforts of the current president of the General Assembly to improve the workings of that body.

</p>

<a name="40510-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>Reform of the UN secretariat is also important. The UK is a strong supporter of the UN Secretary-General&#039;s reform programme, which he set out in September 2002. Despite those proposals for reform, the Government feel   that a more comprehensive approach is required to strengthen the UN&#039;s capacity to deal with new challenges. That is why we greatly welcome the Secretary-General&#039;s initiative in establishing the High Level Panel to which the noble Lord, Lord Hanhay, is making a most distinguished contribution. How fortunate it is that this House is able to debate such a significant developing institution and have one of its representatives present to make his contribution to our deliberations.

</p>

<a name="40510-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>The panel was established in November 2003. It is tasked with identifying threats to global peace and security and with making recommendations to improve the international community&#039;s responses. Peace and security are broadly interpreted to include both traditional threats   and those posed by underdevelopment, economic instability, poverty, environmental degradation and social inequality. We consider that an essential task for the panel is to agree on the full range of threats. If UN reform is to be successful, all member states must feel that their security fears are being addressed.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>A common theme throughout the debate, possibly expressed most cogently by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, was that we need an improvement in the UN&#039;s capacity for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_103"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 103</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

threat analysis and early warning so that threats to international and human security can be dealt with at an early stage when it is likely to be most effective. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, emphasised that point in respect of Rwanda.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>To reply to one other point made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, we are making a positive response to the Darfur crisis. He will know that we are very concerned about this. Ministers will raise it directly with the Sudanese Foreign Minister tomorrow, seeking immediate and concrete improvements. It is particularly important in relation to the threat of genocide that action is taken early. That is what we hope to see arising from the reformed structure of the United Nations.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>This has been an all-too-brief debate on such an extensive and significant topic. I am grateful to all noble Lords who have participated. They have done what I think the noble Lord, Lord Howell, enjoined us to do&#151;to balance an element of optimism in an area in which we could be constructive with the realism that there are crucial difficult areas which need to be tackled and where early results will not be produced. It is the Government&#039;s role to play their part in ensuring that we pursue as constructive a strategy as possible for the reform of the United Nations, which is all we have in terms of representing all the nations of the earth in reconciling each to the other.
</p>

<a name="40510-28_para18"></a>

<p><a name="st_227"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of Amendment No. 16 is to extend the remit of the Office of the Independent Adjudicator to cover staff complaints as well as student complaints. This amendment is supported by both the AUT and the NATHFE, but not by Universities UK.
</p>

<a name="40510-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>The key issue that is acknowledged on all sides is that the visitor system that pertains is archaic and needs to be brought up to date. The office of the independent adjudicator is to provide a modern framework for students which meets the requirements of Article 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, which grants the right to &quot;fair and public hearing&quot; of disputes.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40510-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>Staff disputes have also been subject to the visitor system, yet as far as they are concerned nothing has changed. Why should it be expedient to remove the visitor system from the students and yet not from the staff?
</p>

<a name="40510-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>Let me make clear at the outset that we do not seek to broaden the adjudicator system. Those working at   universities&#151;both academic and non-academic staff&#151;are covered by employment law and have rights of appeal under the employment tribunal system for issues that relate to employment. They are also protected in making complaints by the Public Interest Disclosure Act.
</p>

<a name="40510-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>We do not seek to overturn those rights, but there are issues&#151;such as those relating to academic freedom&#151;that are covered by the current visitor system but are outside the employment area where the right of appeal to some independent arbitrator is necessary.
</p>

<a name="40510-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>This was acknowledged in discussion in Committee in another place when the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State stated,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;there is a problem with the role of visitors and whether that prevents people&#039;s ability ultimately to go to court . . .  In a small number of cases, there is some ambiguity. The Government do not believe that the status quo is acceptable, or that the independent route that we are establishing for students is necessarily an appropriate route for staff complaints&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee H, 12/2/04; col. 93.]</p>

<a name="40510-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>I shall quote from an intervention in the same debate by the Member of Parliament for Leeds East, Mr   George Mudie. He recalled how, when he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the then Department for Education and Employment in 1998, the issue of how best to deal with student complaints had arisen and the universities were given 12 months to sort it out. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;We let the timetable of 12 months&#039; notice extend to five years, and only now we are legislating. I suspect that we are legislating only because of human rights issues. If we let the matter go, it would be challenged in Europe. Indeed, the explanatory notes suggest that strongly.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>Mr Mudie went on to urge the Secretary of State to act now on staff complaints. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;The solution cannot be left to the universities, and we will not get another chance to introduce fresh legislation for a long time. We should grasp the opportunity now.

<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>Let me conclude by saying that it cannot be right that the current visitor system contravenes the Human Rights Act for students and not for staff. Mr Phil Willis, my honourable friend in the other place, withdrew his Motion in the hope that the Government would do as Mr Mudie suggested, and take the opportunity to come forward with some positive ideas. As far as I know, no further proposals have been forthcoming from either the Government or Universities UK or other parts of the university sector since that debate.
</p>

<a name="40510-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>I raise the issue again because I believe Mr Mudie to be right: it is high time that reforms were on the table. Universities have been dragging their feet for too long. <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 105</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

It will be a long time before we have another opportunity to legislate on these issues. If the Office of the Independent Adjudicator is not the appropriate vehicle, let us have some other positive suggestions that we may get on to the statute book. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_228"></a>
<a name="40510-29_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   The amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, which would bring staff within the operation of the Office of the Independent Adjudicator, would very much broaden the scope of that office, as I believe she has recognised. I cannot support that, as I do not believe that it would be helpful to extend the OIA&#039;s remit so radically, and certainly not at this stage.
</p>

<a name="40510-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>The Office of the Independent Adjudicator was created in response to a need identified by the Committee on Standards in Public Life and subsequently by the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, demanding an independent element in student complaints procedures. That is what the proposal delivers. I am of course aware of the concerns raised by the Association of University Teachers that in some areas, outside employment-related issues, university visitors will retain exclusive jurisdiction for staff complaints&#151;for example, in matters when it is alleged that an institution has failed to follow up on its own internal rules.
</p>

<a name="40510-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>It has been argued that the exclusivity of the visitors&#039; jurisdiction is contrary to Article 6 of the Human Rights Act, which specifies that a hearing should be conducted by someone who is independent. The problem here is the exclusivity, and it may be helpful to discuss that issue further, but to react to it by making all staff complaints subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudicator seems to take rather a large sledgehammer to crack a nut.
</p>

<a name="40510-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>Most forms of university staff complaint were removed from the jurisdiction of the visitor by the Education Reform Act 1988, which also established the university commissioner&#039;s model statute. That provides for an appeal to an independent third party when internal complaints procedures have been exhausted&#151;although that is of course restricted to academic and academic-related staff.
</p>

<a name="40510-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>Notwithstanding the areas in which the visitor retains exclusive jurisdiction in pre-1992 universities, we should not lose sight of the fact that staff and students are in essence and in law very different categories. The relationship between higher education institutions and their students is distinct from the relationship between those institutions and their staff. All staff have the same legal rights and protections available to any other employee under existing employment law. If there is any dissatisfaction with the outcome of internal complaints procedures, these can be deployed so that staff have recourse to the Employment Tribunal Service to get independent, binding and, indeed, financial redress. For these reasons, I cannot agree that all staff complaints should be brought within the jurisdiction of the adjudicator, or indeed that the adjudicator is the appropriate forum <br>&nbsp;<br>

for those complaints. Therefore, while I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue, I oppose the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40510-29_para13"></a>

<a name="40510-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I would really prefer it if the noble Baroness would wait until I have moved those amendments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_230"></a>
<a name="40510-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I long for the moment when Universities UK has a disagreement with the Government on any issue. I am bound to say that I found these remarks quite inexplicable. There was a long debate in the House of Commons Standing Committee about this. The Minister admitted that there was confusion and a former Education Minister indicated that he had thought that this would be sorted out in 12 months, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has pointed out.
</p>

<a name="40510-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>As I understand it, it is not uncommon for people to be both staff and students in the university sector. Reading the proceedings in the Commons, it was not clear into which category they would fall. If someone was a member of staff and also a student he would presumably have access, although it was not clear to me what the position was. Perhaps in her response the Minister will say what the position is for the admittedly small number of people in this hybrid category.
</p>

<a name="40510-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>What I understood to be the genesis of this was the Government&#039;s decision to incorporate the European convention in the 1998 Act and the need to act in respect of students. For the life of me, I do not see why that should not apply to staff. This seems to me to be an eminently sensible amendment and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has indicated, a very considerable period of time has elapsed in which people could have thought about some of the difficulties. I find it quite extraordinary that we are told that the university visitor system is anachronistic and does not stand the tests required by the European convention so that it is necessary to make a change in respect of student complaints, but that it is not necessary in respect of staff complaints. I hope that in her response the Minister will give us some indication that at a later stage in the Bill the Government will get their act together and come forward with proposals.
</p>

<a name="40510-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>Things may have changed in government since my day, but we would not have been allowed to present a Bill to the House of Commons by L Committee without these matters having been resolved. We used to sit in the Star Chamber and cross-examine on the details of a Bill. Quite honestly, I think that it is quite unacceptable for the Bill to have got to this stage, despite the proceedings in the Committee stage of the House of Commons, and for the matter to be unresolved. It is very disappointing that Universities UK is taking such a laid back view of an absurd   anomaly, particularly in the light of the representations that are being made by other bodies that represent the interests of staff in the universities. <br>&nbsp;<br>

More to the point, several people on the other side of the House in the other place, with experience as Ministers in the department, also felt uneasy about it.

<a name="40510-30_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   Perhaps I should thank the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, for his intervention here. Although I framed my amendment in terms of adding staff to the office of the independent adjudicator, I expressly said that this situation is not satisfactory. Four months ago in Committee in the other place it was agreed that the situation was not satisfactory and that new ideas needed to be put forward. I do not think that either Universities UK or the Government have moved an inch on this one since that time.

</p>




<p><a name="st_232"></a>
<a name="40510-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   Let me start by trying to set out where I think most of the routes to redress lie and then see whether we have a pattern that would be acceptable in the legislation as it is described.
</p>

<a name="40510-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>First, it is worth recalling&#151;this point came up on Second Reading&#151;that legal protections in relation to academic freedom have been expressed in legislation introduced by the previous government and by the present Government. The present Government are a signatory to the UNESCO normative instrument on academic freedom and the rights of academic staff&#151;indeed, the rights of academic staff form part of the title of the relevant UNESCO convention. I do not think it can be said that there is neither a right that is operable nor a means of dealing with that right. Having represented people who had issues of academic freedom that they wished to present to their universities, I always believed that the trick was to try to do so in a way which also protected the independence and the autonomy of the universities under their charter or act of government. Broadly speaking, one of the great protections of academic freedom is that the institutions themselves are protected from governments of whatever kind, and from interventions of governments to direct them to do things which might be politically expedient when they might wish to take a course of action which was unpopular, not politically expedient or whatever.
</p>

<a name="40510-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>The visitor system, which no doubt has its defects and is based in antiquity, was none the less a rather interesting historic compromise which produced that balance. I can say from first-hand experience that many of the cases where issues of academic freedom were to be tested were tested in that rather odd environment of the visitor, and tested extremely vigorously. For the most part, I believe that that resulted in the protection of academic freedom. Another scheme is not necessary for that purpose.

</p>

<a name="40510-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>I do not believe&#151;although I believe that one or two trade unions do believe it&#151;that protection is needed in the sense that this amendment suggests in relation to whistleblowing. There is perfectly competent legislation on whistleblowing. The way of judging that is to see whether people blow the whistle from time to time in universities, and get a hearing, and get the issues that they <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_108"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 108</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have raised resolved. I would be interested to hear of examples where someone has been a whistleblower but has failed to get the issue resolved. Many of the other kinds of complaints are routinely brought to the trade unions of members of staff. Those unions represent them on those questions, particularly on procedural matters.
</p>

<a name="40510-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>But having said all of that, I entirely understand the arguments that there may be procedural matters, or defects in procedural matters, which are not fully covered by any of the mechanisms that I have described, or, in employment law, by the right of going to the employment tribunals, or, indeed, to the courts. I want to try to look at the matter with that as a background sketch of the processes that exist because I want to start from the point that we are not living in a world quite so defective as perhaps has been suggested.

</p>

<a name="40510-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, and I would agree that the current position regarding some complaints is not wholly satisfactory and that there are other issues which need to be resolved in that area. If there are to be other forms of resolution, should they override all the existing arrangements and, indeed, the arrangement for the adjudicator in relation to student complaints? In the previous discussion we considered whether further education students should have the same right of access to certain provision. I imagine that not everyone was agreed about the outcomes of that discussion but none the less we had a very non-partisan discussion. We weighed the merits of doing one thing or another.
</p>

<a name="40510-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>I made the point, which not all noble Lords agreed with, that changing the parameters in which the adjudicator worked to include vastly more people in the many different types of institutions would not be a satisfactory way of launching the adjudicator&#039;s role. I suspect that trying now to introduce the adjudicator&#039;s role into this narrow area, in which I can understand that staff may feel that they do not have adequate redress, would hardly improve the position. I put that point to the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, who has supported the amendment, in what I hope he will accept are objective terms. I am simply asking whether this is the right way to achieve that objective.
</p>

<a name="40510-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>Universities UK and the standing committee of principals consulted widely on the establishment of an independent reviewer to deal with unresolved complaints of all kinds. Across the higher education sector there has not been, as yet, a clear agreement about what should and should not be done about an unusual and narrow set of examples that may have fallen through the lattice work that I have described.
</p>

<a name="40510-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>I shall not continue at much greater length about the matter, because a number of the points about the other areas in which people may seek redress have already been made. However, I wish to answer a specific question on the issue of where the jurisdiction lies when a student is also teaching or conducting research as an academic. The situation is perhaps clearer than noble Lords have suggested. When someone brings a complaint about the handling of their position as a student, there is no doubt that the independent adjudicator is the appropriate person to address. Where someone brings a complaint as a member of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_109"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 109</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

staff, I hope that I have suggested that there is a set of well established places to which that objection can be taken. I have been trying hard to think of any cases that I knew about, or know about, which might not have fitted that description, that might have given rise to ambiguity. Although my imagination can be fanciful on occasions, I really cannot recall any.
</p>




<p><a name="st_233"></a>
<a name="40510-30_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for giving way and I am sorry that he cannot think of an example. Perhaps I am being slow, but could he explain why he thinks that it is acceptable that someone who is both a student and a member of staff has to sit down and work out, &quot;Am I making this complaint as a student or as a member or staff?&quot;. If he decides, &quot;I am making the complaint as a member of staff&quot;, he then goes to a visitor&#151;and the visitor system is one which the Government consider to be anachronistic and not effective, which is why the change is being made. Can the Minister not see that it seems a rather odd position for the Government to take? I agree that there may not be consensus, but the bad news about being in government is that one has to take a decision and work out what is best. Are the Government not guilty of taking the easy way out and leaving something of a muddle?
</p>




<p><a name="st_234"></a>
<a name="40510-30_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   That is a strange characterisation of events and I shall try to say why, because I have, plainly, not been able to describe adequately thus far the different propositions that are involved in this matter. For the most part, those students who are also teaching or involved in research tend to be people who are at least postgraduates and, in many cases, are taking their PhDs or taking a course of study which is, at least, at that level. I have yet to encounter such a student who was unable to work out objectively the circumstances about which they were complaining. They tend to be quite bright. The distinction which I believe that they will find easy to make is that if one is giving a lecture and one feels that there is something about the conditions of one&#039;s employment that is fundamentally wrong, it is clear that that is not a problem that arises because one is a student.
</p>

<a name="40510-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>If one has process issues that are wrong, or other significant issues that have arisen in the course of one&#039;s postgraduate study or one&#039;s doctoral research, then it is clear that they are wrong as a result of being a student. It would be very hard to mistake the two sets of conditions.
</p>

<a name="40510-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>I apologise if I have not already said that there are known remedies in almost all the classes of cases that one might face as a member of staff. In the case of employment issues there is a remedy through employment law and the tribunals. There are remedies relating to academic freedom, which, for good historic reason, have involved visitors and continue to do so. As I indicated, there is a class of cases that may not fall into either category and that may give rise to the difficulties that, I accepted, could occur, particularly with regard to human rights legislation.
</p>

<a name="40510-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>In that light we certainly will be prepared to look at that area, where there may be a lack of definition that is precise enough to meet the objections made.

<a name="40510-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Baker of Dorking: </b>   I was rather encouraged by the Minister&#039;s observation that he could think of no examples that did not betray a degree of ambiguity in this area. Two such cases occurred to me. One arose during my watch as Secretary of State. At one university there was a don who had no students. His courses were advertised&#151;I think it might have been philosophy, but I would not want to put a slur on the subject.
</p>




<p><a name="st_236"></a>
<a name="40510-31_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Neill of Bengarve: </b>   That is unlikely; it is a rather well subscribed subject.

<p><a name="st_237"></a>
<a name="40510-31_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Baker of Dorking: </b>   I do not want to insult any subject, particularly those of the humanities. Let us forget the subject. The don had no students. He was always photographed lounging against pillars as if he was waiting for his students to arrive. There was no redress. That is one reason that led me to try to do something to limit academic tenure. The university could not dismiss him, yet he was using resources that other academics felt should be spent on their courses of philosophy&#151;or whatever it may be. I do not know whether such an issue would ever arise today. No employment tribunal would be involved in such a situation, because the don would have certain rights.

</p>

<a name="40510-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>The other example is a little older. It occurred at my own college, Magdalen, at the turn of the last century. The clerical dean at college, Dean Thompson, who was immensely popular with the other college dons, wrote a pamphlet questioning the existence of miracles. The other dons liked him so much that they overlooked it. When he wrote another pamphlet questioning the virgin birth, the dons liked him so much that they kept him still in post. Then he turned to the resurrection. It was only after he had published a pamphlet questioning the resurrection that the visitor appeared&#151;the Bishop of Winchester. He suggested in the mildest terms that it was a little irregular for a clerical dean of Magdalen College not to believe in miracles, the virgin birth or the resurrection, whereupon the dons of the college liked him so much that they kept him on as a history don. He became the most famous historian of the French Revolution. During my time at Oxford the key book was <i>The French Revolution</i> by Thompson.
</p>

<a name="40510-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>I do not know whether the adjudicator would deal with such a case; all I know is that the visitor dealt with it marvellously.
</p>




<p><a name="st_238"></a>
<a name="40510-31_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I never had the opportunity to represent anybody before the Bishop of Winchester, but having heard the noble Lord&#039;s account, I greatly regret it. I would probably have won more cases.

</p>

<a name="40510-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>I shall say a few words on the two sorts of cases. In the case of the lecturer who had no students, I shall deal with the absence of the students rather than the question of whether anyone took exception to his lounging wherever he lounged. I imagine that after a period he would have been thought to be redundant had it been any other line of work. However, this is not so much a staff complaint as an absence of work. The noble Lord, Lord Baker of Dorking, will recall that it was his government who introduced redundancy as a reason for which academics <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_111"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 111</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

could be dismissed, even if they had tenure. That was contested hotly for some years but was resolved in the direction that the then government wanted. With great respect, I feel that, with the noble Lord&#039;s example, we are looking through the opposite end of the telescope.

</p>

<a name="40510-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>As for the miracle of getting away with not believing in miracles, the virgin birth or the resurrection, I do not feel that I could properly comment. It is really not for me. However, people enjoy the right to academic freedom in the United Kingdom because we have sought to protect people in the academic world who have unpopular or unfashionable views. We have tended to think that, on occasion, they will turn out to be an exceptional history don, make a breakthrough in science or whatever else that academic freedom could lead to. That is why we protected it in law, and that is why the system for protecting it was bound to be rather strange. It is such a strange entity, but it is none the less of real importance to the university world. I would be surprised if, in general, people outside in some other form of review were able to deal with the situation as easily as somebody who was content to understand the core of the issue and defend the right of individuals to hold unpopular, unfashionable or anticlerical views.

During the war, he was confronted by a lecture theatre composed almost entirely of women. He spied one gentleman at the back and began, &quot;Gentleman, . . . &quot;.

<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>Perhaps, for the convenience of the Committee and because it will apply to all the amendments relating to this part of the Bill to which I speak, I should give the Committee a little background. I come fresh from what I found to be the extremely bruising experience of taking a student whom I helped to mentor through an appeal against dismissal from an undergraduate course. Looking back, I feel that I failed, that the student was failed and that the university concerned behaved abominably. Everybody has ended up bruised and unhappy.

<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>The particular problem that relates to these words is that, on the part of the course concerned, marks had been given.

</p>

<a name="40510-31_para12"></a>

Rather than being given something else to do or some way in which she could half complete what she was being asked to do, she was required to sit out in those particular sessions. She was marked zero, but that zero mark counted towards her failure. No deduction was made from the score that she was supposed to have to meet.

&quot;academic judgment&quot;. To say that a student has scored &quot;<i>x</i>&quot; in a particular paper must in the bare words &quot;academic judgment&quot; bear that meaning. It does not seem to me that that is what it should mean in this Bill. To my mind, in this Bill it should mean what I have put in the amendment. What should be protected is the,

<a name="40510-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   In speaking to Amendment No. 17, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 18. I believe that the words &quot;academic freedom&quot; are liberating, but I am fearful that the words &quot;academic judgment&quot; are a hiding place. The noble Lord, Lord   Lucas, has carefully crafted his amendment in order to get the right turn of phrase by referring to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;judgments reasonably made as to the academic performance of a student&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>As regards this Bill and the whole issue of fees and loans, we will be in the business of value for money. More and more people will be saying, &quot;Am I getting value for money for this course? Is it working out?&quot; I, too, can recall circumstances where a goodly number of people embarked on a course at a certain university.
</p>

<a name="40510-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>Three years later, a handful remained on the course and did not get very good degrees. Perhaps something was wrong with the course and the teaching. That would be something appropriate to complain about. The complaint would not necessarily concern one individual with a specific degree at the end, but something is wrong if one sees an abundance of students at one end of the course, but only a handful at the other. Given that, I worry about making the point about one particular student rather than about matters of academic judgment which, as I have said, is some form of hiding place.
</p>

<a name="40510-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>In speaking to Amendment No. 18, I repeat my concern about academic judgment acting as a hiding place. As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has mentioned, there are disabled students for whom the reason to make the complaint is not made in terms of the academic result; it is not about the work that they may or may not have produced, but about the circumstances in which they are able to perform not being correct. We believe that Amendment No. 18 would flush that out. There would be no hiding place behind academic judgment.
</p>

<a name="40510-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>It has been suggested to us that there may be ways in which the Minister can indicate how, perhaps in terms of a code of conduct, the adjudicator will be able to perform when considering disabled students. If that is the case, it would be helpful to have it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_244"></a>
<a name="40510-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, for raising the issue of interpretation in his probing amendment. Several noble Lords may have had experience of students in distress over decisions reached by an institution. I am concerned that the term <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_114"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 114</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

could be used by a university as a refuge when it did not want to investigate a matter. It would be helpful if the Government could guide the adjudicator into an interpretation which would admit rather than shut out the consideration of a complaint.
</p>

<a name="40510-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>I shall give one or two borderline cases. Two concern a course where academics had defined the work. On the basis of that definition of the academic content of the course, two students came at very considerable expense from foreign lands to take the programme. I recall that, at the end of the first term, one found it so distant from what he thought it would be that he went home to South Africa. That cost him a great deal of money. Another student, having travelled from Australia, abandoned a different course.
</p>

<a name="40510-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>There was also a case of a student who complained that the lecturer had taken it into his head to say that, given the kind of work on the course, he did not need to turn up. That was put to the student as a matter of the lecturer&#039;s academic judgment. In another case, it was alleged that the lecturer told the students the questions that they would face in their final examination. One student did not think that was quite right, but his complaint was not sustained.
</p>

<a name="40510-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>It is rather important for the adjudicator, in his interpretation, to be able to take a broad rather than a narrow view of what the term means.
</p>




<p><a name="st_245"></a>
<a name="40510-32_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Perry of Southwark: </b>   I too should like to record my support for both of these amendments. Perhaps I should declare an interest, having just completed a six-year term serving on the appeals committee at the University of Cambridge. The committee, the Septemviri, is rather misnamed as it includes at least two women rather than seven men.
</p>

<a name="40510-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>There is a very real danger that the phrase &quot;academic judgment&quot; could become a secret garden embracing so many areas that it would be impossible for a student to query a judgment. The phrase suggested by my noble friend Lord Lucas is a much better provision that covers what a student may need to complain against; that is, the judgment that is made&#151;it has to be a reasonable judgment&#151;about the performance of the student rather than an overarching academic judgment.
</p>

<a name="40510-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>In subjects such as English it is all too easy for a lecturer to retreat into safe territory by saying, &quot;It is simply my judgment that the answer was not satisfactory. I cannot give the criteria or reasons for my decision. I made an academic judgment&quot;. If the original lecturer simply stands on this magic academic judgment, it makes it extremely difficult for a student to prove his case, even though he may have got three or four other perfectly competent English specialists to say that his paper was worth a very different mark. Of course, the same is true for the provisions to alter the assessment process for students who have particular handicaps. I hope the Minister will consider carefully my noble friend&#039;s suggestion of much more precise wording of what will, and will not, be safe territory for the person against whom the complaint is lodged.

<a name="40510-32_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Neill of Bengarve: </b>   We must all have some sympathy with the purposes behind this amendment, but it is fatally flawed. It suggests we replace matters of academic judgment with,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;judgments reasonably made as to the academic performance of a student&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40510-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>Anybody may make a &quot;reasonable judgment of performance&quot;, and it is very important in any complaint or appeal procedure that the independence of those who judge the case be secured&#151;but not at the expense of their being informed about what they are judging. You can see the difficulty that can arise, when you consider that a student may feel extremely disappointed that he or she does not get the class of degree to which they aspired.
</p>

<a name="40510-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>The process of judging whether the examinations were competently done and executed is one that requires a certain expertise, as well as independence. I do not dispute that we need the independence, but I think it will be fatal if we remove the expertise. I have served as external examiner in a number of universities&#151;the University of Ulster, the University of London, the University of Bristol&#151;and in each case it was a very long process of judging quality. That is, after all, why there is an external eye there, all the way from the initial stage of discussion of examination questions in the light of opportunity afforded, to the final judgment of degree class. If we open this to the thought that it is a reasonable judgment of academic matters, I believe that in the attempt to get an independent eye on it, we lose the question of getting the appropriate level of information and expertise where it is required.
</p>

<a name="40510-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>Many of the examples we have heard come from a bygone age. I live in a world in which the amount of information available to students about their courses&#151;how and by whom they will be assessed&#151;is not deficient, but arguably quite excessive, and extremely burdensome to the students concerned. We have to beware adding yet more appeals procedures to the appeals procedures of one sort or another that are already all round the shop. There may be a deft way to do it, but I do not believe that substituting the notion of reasonable judgment for academic judgment will play fair by the people in the business of maintaining quality control in our universities.
</p>

<a name="40510-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>We only have one true system of maintaining quality control: the external examiner system. It has been eroded and underfunded for a long time. We have substituted other systems for it, like the late and unlamented TQA, which did not secure quality of teaching. We need to think much more carefully before we move in the direction that this amendment suggests.

<a name="40510-32_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   I indicated that I would like to comment on Amendments Nos. 17 and 18. The debate so far has demonstrated how thorny this issue of academic judgment is. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, proposes to replace matters of academic judgment with,

</p>

<a name="40510-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>Ironically, it seemed to me that the very case to which the noble Lord referred might not be affected by this change. There are many cases where it would be   legitimate to take into account extenuating circumstances and their effect on performance. For example, it may be necessary to make the very kind of judgment that he was hoping to achieve about a student&#039;s probable performance in parts of an assessment where the student was, for example, prevented from competing by either illness or accident. Another example might be where an exam is disrupted by fire or flood or some other event and it would be unreasonable to ask the student to resit. Those are actual examples. I think that to restrict this to actual performance would be potentially to burden adjudicators with matters on which they could not reasonably expect to be able to adjudicate.
</p>

<a name="40510-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>I also find myself in disagreement with the noble Lord, Lord Shutt of Greetland, whose amendment seems to me to fail to distinguish between the assistance a student might need to take an assessment and the need to undertake the assessment or complete a task which is necessary if that student is to gain an award. For example, a student who is not physically able to undertake a chemistry practical assessment might be aided by an amanuensis, but would have to be able to instruct the assistant precisely in the setting up of the experiment and its conduct. A dyslexic student might be asked to prepare an essay but allowed some aid such as a keyboard or spell-checker or might be given extra time.
</p>

<a name="40510-32_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>In short, I think we have raised several problems that I do not think are addressed by either of the two amendments. There clearly are, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, said, examples that are slipping through the net. But I do not think that either of the two propositions are going to help us in those cases.

<p><a name="st_248"></a>
<a name="40510-33_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Baker of Dorking: </b>   This is a very interesting debate. My noble friend Lord Lucas has raised an issue that, if the amendment succeeded, would considerably extend the role of the adjudicator of complaints. At the moment, under Clause 12, the adjudicator deals with,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;an act or omission of a qualifying institution&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>This issue takes us into the area of academic judgment, and that, as the noble Baroness said, is a Pandora&#039;s box.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>I am by no means clear about what is the best solution. However, I remember a case that I had as an MP, more than 20 years ago, which has remained with me. A young woman came to see me who had been studying as a post-graduate for a DPhil. Her subject was the novels of Fanny Burney, an 18th century writer. She did not get a DPhil; she got a BLitt. She was very hurt by that. She claimed that she knew more than the examiner did about the novels of Fanny Burney and asked whether I could help her. I went to the university and put the complaint. It may well be that complaints procedures are better now than they were 20 or 25 years ago. I got absolutely nowhere. The ranks of the profession absolutely closed. I even read a few of the novels of Fanny Burney to see whether I could   understand my constituent&#039;s case better. I got <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_117"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 117</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

absolutely nowhere with the vice-chancellor. I was not allowed to meet the examiner or to question the matter at all. That has always rankled with me as I have always felt that I had let down my constituent. I was never satisfied that she had justice, but I could never prove it one way or the other.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>All I can say is that, in the future, as the years roll on, once one sets up an adjudication of this sort, that sort of problem will become more and more of an issue for the adjudicator. I think that students will say, &quot;We have an adjudicator. Why cannot we extend it further?&quot;, in the way that certain Peers have suggested today. As I said, I have no answer to that, but I think that the Government should think about it quite carefully.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>It would be interesting if the Government could collate some statistics on it. In how many cases do university students claim they do not have the right level of degree? I do not know whether such statistics exist. Will this be a huge extra burden? Will more people be excited to do it? It comes down to academic judgment, which is a very fine matter. The claims might be meretricious in most cases, but in some cases they will not be. It is a very difficult and interesting issue and I hope that the Government will reflect on it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_249"></a>
<a name="40510-33_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   It seems to me that this group of two amendments is rather like Gaul. Noble Lords will remember,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>The three parts into which this group is divided is the operator under Clause 13 behaving reasonably, academic judgment and disabled rights. They have all been lumped together in the discussion that we have just had.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>Therefore, my first question is on reasonableness&#151;what a horrible word, but it will do for this time of night. The department and the Secretary of State are subject, if they behave unreasonably, to judicial review and therefore the Wednesbury test applies. Will the operator, when he or she is created, be subject to the same regime? Also on reasonableness, I am unsure, even after the discussion, what criteria will be used to consider the matter and by whom it will be considered? Will it be the operator again or someone else? Perhaps my noble friend has given this some thought or even the noble Lord, Lord Shutt.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>I also have a problem with academic judgment and the complaints thereon. For example, recently I have done a certain amount of work with student nurse placements, which involve the integral teaching and practical development tools of what will become, loosely speaking, their trade. Should complaints on the issue, should they have them, be taken to the new designated operator, as provided for in the Bill, or to the NHS establishment where the placement is completed?
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>On a similar note, my son undertook a four-year course at university, one year of which was a year in industry. If he had problems, or if another student in the future has problems, where should they raise their complaints in relation to the placement or to treatment <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_118"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 118</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

while on placement? The Government and myself are keen on the Erasmus scheme which is even worse because that takes us into the far reaches, certainly these days, of eastern Europe. That is a problem.

</p>

<a name="40510-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>I am no expert on disability rights, but I believe that the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 covers disabled students in higher education institutions to a greater or lesser extent. I understand that their ultimate recourse is to the courts. One of my noble friends who is not in his place at the moment has a research assistant who came out of a four-year course at university totally unsupported by parents, grandparents or anyone else and ended up with a debt of &#163;30,000. That is under the current system. We shall come to what may happen under the system envisaged in the Bill possibly on Thursday and possibly later on in the month. However, I cannot imagine a student who is already in debt finding the finance to take an institution of higher education, further education or whatever to court.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>I accept that many of these matters are likely to be matters of process rather than academic judgment, but even so, surely the Minister of State&#039;s comment that they are likely to be qualifying complaints is germane. Of course, ultimately, the reviewer would have to judge the merits of the case. None the less, I believe that SKILL and the RNIB&#151;lobby groups as they are&#151;have a very good point as regards Amendment No. 18. I would accept with them, and indeed the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, that a student should not be able to complain when he or she has received a low mark for a poor piece of work. But they posit the case that a visually impaired student might have failed an exam because of the university&#039;s failure to provide papers in, say, Braille or some other suitable format. I believe that that should be a qualifying complaint.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>That leaves me with support for the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, and, as I said at the beginning, with questions about the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Lucas.

<a name="40510-33_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I thank all noble Lords who have so far spoken in this debate for their contributions. I am deeply impressed by the way in which people have brought to the debate their very real experience or knowledge of what has happened to particular students. It is difficult not to be moved by many of the accounts that have been given, and I share that feeling. I therefore welcome the discussion and hope that I shall be able to do justice to it.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>As we are all aware, the issue concerns what constitutes academic judgment and how it is to be dealt with. I begin first with Amendment No. 17, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. I shall then develop some of the issues that have been raised to discover whether we can see through to the heart of the matter.

</p>

<a name="40510-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>After Second Reading, my noble friend Lady Ashton wrote to Lord Lucas about his particular concerns relating to cases of discrimination. I am glad to be able to place on record for Members of the Committee our views of complaints that fall within the remit of the scheme. I believe that that is the best starting point. However, I add <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_119"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 119</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

an immediate observation of my own. It seems to me that any attempt by any institution to say that its procedures were secret and could not in any circumstances be questioned must inevitably fall within the remit of the scheme. Were that to be the case, it would be impossible for anyone to proceed in any kind of process, which would have to be sufficiently transparent for people to become involved in it.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord   Lucas, has two effects. First, it seeks to narrow the exclusion of academic judgment complaints to those relating to, &quot;the academic performance of a student&quot;. Secondly, it introduces the notion of judgments having to be made reasonably. I shall deal with the issue of academic judgment head on. Taking first the concept of academic judgment, compared with academic performance, the noble Lord will be aware that traditionally the visitors and the courts have not intervened in matters of academic judgment. This legislation would continue that practice. As matters stand, it would not change the practice. Academic judgment is genuinely difficult to define. I understand why the noble Lord seeks to define the exclusion more narrowly. However, I believe that it risks drawing into the remit of the reviewer matters that are unsuitable.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>Before any noble Lord draws the conclusion that I, too, simply for these purposes would choose to hide behind words that are difficult to define, I should say that I strongly agree with the noble Baroness, Lady   O&#039;Neill, about the fundamentals of the way in which the system currently works. I know of no institutions that are immune from multiple scrutiny of the marks that are awarded for completed coursework in achieving a degree. If in any particular case, whether or not with a disabled student, there was no mechanism to provide a rigorous check of that matter, I would be deeply alarmed about what had happened in that institution.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>I wholly accept the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, that the external examiner system is probably not as strong or as well staffed as it once was. However, it was and should remain fundamental to the best practice. On examiners&#039; boards, double or multiple marking were the norm in my working experience. As the noble Baroness, Lady   O&#039;Neill, quite rightly says, external examiners have an expertise which is vital&#151;even if one goes away and reads the novels oneself later&#151;born of many years of study, reflection, writing and being criticised by one&#039;s peers and having to argue one&#039;s case. Those are the ways in which we try to ensure that the notion of academic judgment is more sustainable than it would be if a single individual were simply expressing an opinion upon a matter. Indeed, in many cases where the external examiner system was the fundamental basis, there were also moderator systems, in which the external examiners routinely met to make sure that their view across a range of universities in which they were external examiners bore comparison with one another. All those factors are fundamental.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_120"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 120</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-33_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>Although judgments about a student&#039;s academic performance is what is usually meant by academic judgment, there are occasions on which academic   judgments are made which are not directly related to the student&#039;s academic performance. For example, a student and a lecturer might quite genuinely have a difference of opinion over an academic issue such as a scientific hypothesis, and the student seeks to complain about the lecturer&#039;s academic opinions. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, would bring such issues within the remit of the scheme. I do not think that that is what he intends, and I think he would accept that it would not be desirable.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>I would add one final point, which arose from the very telling account given by the noble Lord about the experience he had and that a student had. I am sure that he would accept that that is the student&#039;s account, not the institution&#039;s. It would be extremely important in such circumstances to know whether the course content as described in the prospectus would have led someone to conceive of any circumstances in which they might be excluded from a module which was being marked, and awarded a zero mark because they had some difficulty which made it impossible for them to take that module. If they were put in a position where they had a reasonable expectation that they could do the course and they were denied that opportunity, that would plainly be grounds for a complaint. It could not be covered up in any way.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>With regard to a lecturer&#039;s non-attendance, when students had been led to expect that they would be taught and would have access to teaching&#151;which is, in my view, the norm&#151;I believe that that must be covered by issues of the provision of the service. An institution which was negligent on that matter would be found to be negligent and would have to be found to be negligent.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>The judgments must, however, be reasonably made. That is why I can confirm to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, that they would be subject to judicial review.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, asked whether unreasonable judgments, made unfairly, on a discriminatory basis, would be open to challenge. They certainly would be under the scheme in the Bill. Were that to fail, they could potentially go through to judicial review.
</p>

<a name="40510-33_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>I can reassure noble Lords that students who believe that procedural errors have resulted in unfair decisions would and must have access to the scheme. When students are unhappy with the way in which decisions have been made in relation to their academic performance, institutions should have their own internal procedures for appeals to be made. It is the job of the institution&#039;s academic or examination appeals panel to ensure that decisions are made reasonably and in accordance with the institution&#039;s procedures. Robust systems within an institution, far more than anything that exists outside, will always be the cornerstone when it comes to ensuring quality in the first instance.

<p><a name="stpa_490"></a>The independent reviewer will be able to review complaints where such procedures were faulty or the outcome of the appeal was clearly unreasonable. Where students&#039; complaints are about the academic or examination appeals panel, examples of the type of complaint that will be admitted to the reviewer include where the panel is improperly constituted; where it fails to take account of relevant information provided by the student; where, as my noble friend Lady Warwick has said, some calamity has occurred in the course of the examination which has meant it is very hard for a student to do as well as she or he could; or where it fails to give the student the opportunity to make appropriate representations on his or her behalf. These are complaints that the independent reviewer can consider.

<p><a name="st_252"></a>
<a name="40510-34_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I will come to that point in a few sentences and I hope that that will lend some coherence to what I have said.

<a name="40510-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, was concerned at Second Reading that some institutions may not have adequate procedures for dealing with student complaints and appeals. I can reassure your Lordships that such issues are also capable of being referred to the reviewer.
</p>

<a name="40510-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a>I turn now to the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. Dame Ruth Deech, who as we all know has been appointed as the independent adjudicator is an academic of enormous experience and an administrator of superb experience. We could have hardly dared hope to have somebody better in the position and more able to make the judgments about how things fall in and out within the guidance that is provided. Along with Michael Reddy, who has been appointed as the deputy adjudicator, she will be in a position to do exactly that.
</p>

<a name="40510-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a>I will deal briefly with the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. The operator of the   students complaint system which we believe will be the office of the independent adjudicator will consider unresolved complaints against HE sector institutions. Any complaint should relate to the responsibilities of the institution, so for HE students on placements the respective responsibilities of the institution and the placement provider&#151;which might be an NHS trust for a nursing student, an example that was given earlier&#151;should be set out as clearly as possible in the standard part of the placement arrangements.
</p>

<a name="40510-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a>These responsibilities will determine the route taken in pursuing the complaint. If it relates to something which the provider is responsible for, then they should complain to the provider. If their complaint is against the HE institution, then that is where they should lodge their complaint if it is not resolved. The student will have recourse to the student complaint scheme, <br>&nbsp;<br>

the OIA. The intention is that the guidance documents and the forms that would be available and the publicity that we touched on in an earlier part of our discussion should make those routes very clear and help to guide people through them, as I believe they must.
</p>

<a name="40510-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a>Turning now to Amendment No. 18, I welcome the opportunity to respond to the important issue of the arrangements that institutions make to meet the needs of disabled students and whether complaints about these arrangements will fall within the scheme.
</p>

<a name="40510-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a>By way of background, I should first mention that the Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education, the right honourable Alan Johnson, wrote to the Royal National Institute of the Blind confirming that complaints relating to examination procedures&#151;such as whether an institution has complied with its policy on exam arrangements for disabled students&#151;would be matters of process rather than academic judgment and therefore will fall within the scheme. I hope this gives a degree of reassurance to those who have raised similar points.

</p>

<a name="40510-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a>In debate on a similar amendment in another place, the Government also committed to look further at this issue. Officials from the Department for Education and Skills subsequently met with RNIB and Skill and confirmed that the Government would be happy to put on the record, through an exchange of correspondence, any particular services, arrangements and adjustments for disabled students that they wanted confirmed as being within the scheme&#039;s coverage. I am happy to repeat that commitment to noble Lords today and to commit to write to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, on these issues.
</p>

<a name="40510-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>Institutions should have clear procedures setting out the adjustments disabled students can expect to meet their needs. If a student has an unresolved complaint about their institution&#039;s compliance with the procedure, it will fall within the remit of the reviewer. That is a reassurance which should give some comfort. No doubt everybody will study the text to make sure if it does or does not.
</p>

<a name="40510-34_para8"></a>

performance was the marks. There were no backing documents, there was nothing on which to base a judgment and no willingness to discuss the matter. I imagine, under those circumstances, that the independent adjudicator would be happy to have a conversation about the process, and we would not be blocked by a statement that the academic judgment of the institution or the people concerned was that it was unnecessary to provide the student with any information as to how she had done on any particular occasion or the basis on which the marks had been awarded.

<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>I heard the Minister in his remarks mention the words &quot;judicial review&quot;.

<a name="40510-34_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>We have already touched on the issues under the amendments that I tabled to Clause 12, which suggested the reasons why we favour an ombudsman with a wider remit than the more limited remit of the independent adjudicator. The model being established was proposed as a self-regulating one, to be financed by the university sector itself. It was proposed by the UUK, the employers&#039; voice in the universities, after considerable prodding from the Government, and the question is why the Government have simply backed them in their choice rather than exploring other models.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_124"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 124</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-34_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>The advantages of introducing an ombudsman system are straightforward. First, it would be provided outside the university system and financed by the Government, not the universities and, secondly, it would be in line with other ombudsman services in local government, health, financial services and Parliament. Thirdly, the tertiary education sector is already large and is expanding fast, and the FE sector is already using the Parliamentary ombudsman as an arbiter of last resort. Here we are setting up legislation to set up an arbitration system of last resort for universities, but it deals only with student complaints and does not cover the whole sector, because a number of large and influential universities have not signed up to it. That leaves some students still subject to the archaic procedures of the visitor system, and it leaves, as we have seen, the whole problem of staff complaints which are not appropriately handled by employment legislation. Discussion on this issue in Committee in the other place was cut short by time. In his response, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State explained his confidence in the procedures that had been established and paid tribute, as I do, to the board&#039;s choice of adjudicator, Ruth Deech. But he did not explain why it was that the Government opted for this limited self-regulating service, rather than for the broader-based ombudsman service. The proposal for an ombudsman model had the widespread support of the general public, students and academic staff. We have a right to know, if I may say so, why the Government prefer this more limited model. I beg to move.

<a name="40510-35_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   This seems to be a very sensible set of amendments. I have nothing to add to what the noble Baroness has said, except that the only explanation that I can see for not moving towards an ombudsman is that perhaps somebody in the Treasury thought it was a very clever way to avoid paying half a million pounds. If that was the case, then I urge the Minister to stand up to the Treasury.

<a name="40510-35_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has rightly said that the National Union of Students, as well as NATFHE and the Association of University Teachers, support a proposal for an ombudsman. Perhaps I should also point out that the NUS worked very closely with Universities UK in creating the office of the independent adjudicator and establishing it on a voluntary basis.
</p>

<a name="40510-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>Perhaps I can remind the Committee that the proposal for an independent forum for reviewing those student complaints that have exhausted an institution&#039;s internal complaints procedures emerged from the recommendations of the Nolan report and were supported by the 1997 report by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. Universities UK and the Standing Conference of Principals consulted extremely widely on these proposals so I warmly welcome the Government&#039;s decision to legislate to build on the self-regulatory framework that the sector had already established and which is operating with great success. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_125"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 125</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The Office of the Independent Adjudicator has won the wide support of the sector. It seems preferable that the Government should choose to build on something that has established a successful track record rather than to bring forward an entirely different scheme that would need to seek wide support. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator will be a real benefit to students and to institutions.
</p>

<a name="40510-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>Perhaps I can correct a point that was made by both noble Lords. It was in fact Universities UK that pressed the Government to put a statutory framework onto the voluntary scheme in order to address the very real problems that have been identified in this House in relation to the role of the visitor and to establish a more consistent approach, which several noble Lords have urged. Universities UK very much pressed the Government and I am delighted that they moved swiftly to incorporate in the Bill the means of introducing this scheme. The statutory framework requiring all higher education institutions in England and Wales to participate will ensure a much greater degree of equality for all students. Although the OIA is not a regulator, it can make recommendations about how HEIs might handle complaints internally. I think that this is the right approach and that it is the right tool for the job. I commend the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_259"></a>
<a name="40510-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The amendments suggest that the Secretary of State should appoint a person, which could be either an individual or a company, rather than a body corporate as the operator. As we have said, and as my noble friend Lady Warwick has just said, the operator that we intend to designate is the Office of the Independent Adjudicator. The OIA has been set up as a private not-for-profit company limited by guarantee and it is a corporate body. Its board consists of representatives from the higher education sector and the National Union of Students as well as a number of independent members.
</p>

<a name="40510-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>During debate in another place, and as proposed by Amendment No. 29, there were calls for an alternative approach: an individual higher education ombudsman who would be appointed by the Secretary of State. There are two reasons why we favour our approach to that of an individual ombudsman. First, the Secretary of State is not involved in the appointment of members of the OIA board. Before the operator is designated, we will require that its board of directors should have a majority of independent members. In Schedule 1 we have said in the conditions to be met by the operator of the scheme that the body corporate is a suitable person to be designated the operator. This would include the majority of independent members. This ensures both independence from the Secretary of State and that sector interests do not dominate. Secondly, the Secretary of State will have no say in the independent reviewer who looks at cases. We believe that these arrangements will give greater confidence to institutions and students regarding the independence of the scheme than a Secretary of State appointed ombudsman.

</p>

<a name="40510-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>However, that is not to say that the OIA and the reviewers will not operate in a manner similar to other ombudsman schemes. No doubt there will be much common practice. Indeed, organisations such as the National Union of Students have previously used the term &quot;ombudsman&quot; as a general characterisation of the arrangements that we are proposing&#151;of which they are also fully supportive&#151;and which this legislation is designed to underpin. They have supported it in the sense that they took part in establishing it. I congratulated them on that earlier.

<p><a name="stpa_515"></a>I shall withdraw the amendment, but in doing so I suspect that in the course of time we may well find that we need to have a broader ombudsman working in this sector. I come back to the points that I made earlier; namely, that the borderline between what is further education and higher education will become increasingly blurred. We shall have to find some sort of system to cover staff complaints as well as student complaints.

people, four of whom are university appointees, you will very rarely find the five going against the four. This needs to be a board that can stand up screaming to the universities when the adjudicator has dealt them a painful blow or two.

That goes without saying, but it would be a somewhat different matter to say that it should be wholly independent of the entire sector. Even if we move away from the contentious area where academic judgment may be involved, much more routine and more common matters that require no academic judgment&#151;for example, complaints that student residences were not adequately heated or that security on campus was not up to what it might have been&#151;may, nevertheless, reasonably need people who have some experience of what campus life is like nowadays, what is normally provided in student residences and the like. So, I am slightly puzzled at the suggestion that the board should be wholly independent of the HE sector, as opposed to the institution against which a complaint is brought&#151;with which I fully agree.

<p><a name="st_266"></a>
<a name="40510-36_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I was intrigued by the idea that if there was a board of nine, of which four were from the universities, those four would be likely to agree with each other. That falls wholly outside my experience.

<a name="40510-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>Thus far, we have covered the first steps that have been taken in setting up the current arrangements. However the OIA is now up and running and we believe that it has to be independent and that its board of directors is vital to the credibility of the scheme.

<a name="column_128"></a>

require that the operator can demonstrate full independence. We would expect the operator seeking designation to have a majority of independent members on its board. It is probably true that as long as there is a genuine majority&#151;and it is often unlikely that everyone else will stick together in one position&#151;the body is unlikely to be towed around as an individual group by the universities.
</p>

<a name="40510-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>I can understand the concern that the OIA&#039;s current board does not meet that requirement and that one might wonder why it has been designated as the operator. However, I can reassure the Committee that the OIA board has agreed that it will move to the new position before it seeks designation from the Secretary of State. The change will have been made. The board is currently in the process of increasing the number of independent members and is considering reducing the number of representative members so that an independent majority is fully achieved.

<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>I do not agree with the argument that no members of the body corporate should have connections with qualifying institutions. It is important that the sector has a degree of representation on the board, which implies connections to higher education institutions. What is crucial is that they do not dominate; I fully understand the feeling behind that view. The process for appointment will be independent; it will meet the criteria that we would now expect of independent appointment processes, of which there are a good many that are routinely discussed in the Chamber, to which the Nolan principles have been applied.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_3"></a><center><b>&quot;Guidance</b></center>

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_19"></a>   Condition B(1) is that the scheme shall include guidance for the conduct of internal procedures for the review of complaints, and for the terms of such procedures, and shall prohibit the placing by such procedures of any limitations on access to the scheme.&quot;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_129"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 129</b><br>&nbsp;<br>




<p><a name="st_269"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 32. Amendment No. 31 arises from the requirement that students should have been through the procedures laid down for the individual institution before they can have access to the independent adjudicator. Under those circumstances, there should be some degree of connection between the two sets of procedures. To start with the back end of the amendment, there should be nothing about an institution&#039;s internal procedures that make it difficult to reach the independent adjudicator.
</p>

<a name="40510-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a>So far as the first part of the amendment is concerned, I hope that we will have an independent adjudicator who feels able to spread good practice among universities.
</p>

<a name="40510-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_532"></a>One problem I had with the case to which I referred was that the university concerned, immediately on telling the student concerned that it intended to dismiss her from her course, banned all her tutors from talking to her and said that they could not help her in any way to understand what had gone wrong or to make a reasonable judgment of what she should therefore do next by way of her career or otherwise, unless and until she abandoned all appeal procedures. In fact, having now reached the point where she has abandoned all appeal procedures, it still will not let her talk to any of her tutors.
</p>

<a name="40510-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a>As I said, that ended extremely unhappily. One reason for that is that the course that she was on is one where her tutors are likely to have an effect on her future career. She should have been studying something sensible, such as history, where all the students go off to be merchant bankers. Unfortunately, the academics on the course that she chose are in close contact with the people who are likely to employ her afterwards. Being a talented individual, she wishes to pursue that course.
</p>

<a name="40510-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a>So I am very concerned that we should have some mechanism to deal with such bad practice. It seems to me that the best way is to have someone who understands good practice able to pass that good practice down to the institutions&#151;especially, of course, when a complaint comes through and it is clear that something has been wrong with the institutional practices below.
</p>

<a name="40510-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a>I have expressed that in the language of guidance; it should probably not be that formal. I want to ensure that the independent adjudicator feels that he has the power and position to make suggestions and do whatever is necessary in the context of university structures to spread good practice and indicate that unless individual institutions&#039; complaints procedures comply with a reasonable set of criteria, the complaints that reach the adjudicator are more likely than not to fail because the student has been badly dealt with beforehand. As I said, that goes back to the difficult experiences through which I have been.
</p>

<a name="40510-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a>Amendment No. 32 is simply a suggestion. It is based on the ordinary experience: if you go to court and lose, you pay more than if you win. I do not see why institutions that neither lose cases nor produce <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_130"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 130</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

students who have been badly done by should pay as much as those that produce a stream of students with complaints that are upheld. I certainly would not dream of pressing the amendment if it did not appeal to the Minister. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_270"></a>
<a name="40510-36_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   Perhaps I may take the opportunity to raise a matter on Amendment No. 31, so that peradventure I could return to it on Report. I am particularly concerned not to limit severely access to the adjudicator by a complainant at an institution where there is no access to a visitor, or where it is very limited, and where internal procedures having been exhausted the only resort is to the courts. A student simply cannot afford to take a case to the courts.
</p>

<a name="40510-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a>In dealing with such a case, the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, said to a Member of the other place in a letter of 5 February this year that the Government agree that it is inequitable that there should be access from some institutions but not for others. That is particularly so when the institution has no provision, not only for a visitor, but for any external person whatever, and all cases are handled in-house.
</p>

<a name="40510-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_538"></a>I hope that as a matter of practice rather than through legislation the adjudicator will be encouraged to take a lenient attitude to considering cases where it seems that perhaps the procedures have not been entirely fair, and where a case, although it is out of time, has been rumbling on&#151;the one that I have in mind has done so for several years and has still not gone away from my e-mail. Perhaps the adjudicator would be prepared, provided that a case was supported by one, or perhaps two, Members of Parliament or the National Assembly for Wales, exceptionally to consider the matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_271"></a>
<a name="40510-36_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Neill of Bengarve: </b>   I have enormous sympathy with the aims of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, in that all universities should have student complaints procedures. However, I would like to know whether the intention of the amendment is that all the procedures that universities have been required to construct over a number of years must now be revisited.

</p>

<a name="40510-36_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a>I had taken it that in this construction we aimed to create the apex of a system whose infrastructure was already in place. Who is to say that every bit of that infrastructure is as good as it should be? However, in my experience, student complaints procedures are now ubiquitous and elaborate, possibly over-elaborate. If the Office of the Independent Adjudicator is there, any procedure constructed under existing guidance and requirements will be found out if inadequate. I do not believe that we need to rebuild the whole infrastructure.
</p>

<a name="40510-36_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a>The same goes for the handling of student disability, where, in my experience, for 25 years universities have used the sorts of procedures that have been discussed. They are now very much in the hands of disability advisers. Negotiations are conducted with students who declare a disability before they come on campus, so that one knows what adjustments are needed, and so that they can be provided. There is a problem about undeclared disability. I do not think that institutions <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_131"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 131</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

can prepare themselves to deal with a disability if it is not disclosed either upon application or, quite often, until a late stage. So far as I am aware, where a student is disabled and discloses it at the admissions process, every institution is required to build that in. That includes time allowances on assessment. Similarly, complaints procedures are now there.

<p><a name="st_272"></a>
<a name="40510-37_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I start with the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. It can be dealt with relatively rapidly. It will up to the scheme to decide when it wants to lift the time limit. There will be exceptional cases in which it may wish to do so, but, by definition, exceptions are exceptional, and it is hard to build the legislation to reflect that. The OIA can do that. Anything or everything can be put to the OIA, and it is for the OIA to decide whether to exclude it, even if it is clouded in history and e-mails
</p>

<a name="40510-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_541"></a>The amendments would add another three conditions to the minimum conditions that would apply. I shall deal with guidance first. I agree that getting the internal complaints procedures of universities and other institutions up to standard in the first place would alleviate many of the problems that we are trying to deal with and reduce the need for appeals. In some circumstances, we could probably avoid the problems altogether. So, I understand the noble Lord&#039;s desire for a scheme that includes guidance about the conduct of internal complaints procedures. However, it is for individual institutions to determine their own procedures for handling student complaints. We have recognised in other contexts and emphasised that they are independent, autonomous institutions. In devising their own procedures, they need to take account&#151;most of them already do&#151;of guidance issued by sectoral representative bodies and the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.
</p>

<a name="40510-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_542"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, may wish to note that the QAA has issued a code of practice on student complaints and academic appeals. I would be happy to send it to him, so that he can see whether it deals with the issues that he has raised. The code sets out clear guidance to institutions on handling student complaints and, although there may be a case for the experience of the OIA informing future development of that guidance, it does not seem sensible to duplicate the QAA guidance.
</p>

<a name="40510-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_543"></a>When dealing with a student&#039;s complaint, the independent reviewer can also make specific recommendations to the higher education institution about the effectiveness of its internal procedures. Where appropriate, we would expect the reviewer to set out aspects of the procedures that were flawed and say how they might be improved. That would be useful guidance. The reviewer may also make general observations about the institutions&#039; complaints procedures in the annual report, and that will be useful guidance to the sector as a whole because it will be available to the sector as a whole.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_132"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column 132</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_544"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, also suggests that the scheme should ensure that institutions do not prohibit students from accessing the operator&#039;s scheme for reviewing student complaints. I assure the noble Lord that it will do so. Clause 15(1) requires the institution to comply with any obligation imposed upon it by the scheme. Paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 requires that the operator must provide a scheme for the review of qualifying complaints that meets all of the conditions in Schedule 2. In order to comply with that requirement, the operator of the scheme will have to ensure that all qualifying complaints are capable of being referred to it. That is also in Schedule 2. The operator will need to place an obligation on the institutions to that effect, and we anticipate that that would be in the rules of the scheme. In the unlikely event that higher education institutions made it a contractual term that students were not to refer complaints to the OIA, they would be in breach of their duty. They cannot do that.
</p>

<a name="40510-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_545"></a>The noble Lord should also be reassured that, under the voluntary arrangements currently operated by the OIA, participating institutions are required to issue a completion letter to students when the institution&#039;s procedures have been exhausted. The letter must provide information on how to get access to the OIA, if the student remains dissatisfied with the handling of the complaint. The student will know when the process has come to an end and what steps can be taken beyond it. That ensures that students are clear about the routes of redress.
</p>

<a name="40510-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_546"></a>Amendment No. 32 would mean that the operator should charge fees in relation to the outcome of the case. I can understand the amendment. The Bill does not prescribe how fees payable by institutions will be apportioned. That gives flexibility to the operators to decide on a fair and reasonable fee structure while preventing the operator charging excessive fees above the costs that are incurred. It is not a profit-making organisation. That kind of flexibility is already there.
</p>

<a name="40510-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_547"></a>We understand that the OIA is also considering a fee structure that might be introduced at a later point, which includes a mixture of a fee based on the size of institutions plus a fee per complaint referred from the institution. That is another flexibility in the charging system. So those kinds of options are open. I suspect that, in due course, the scheme will be able to codify them in a way that should be helpful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_273"></a>
<a name="40510-37_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I am grateful for that explanation, which, again, I shall read carefully. As usual, the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, is right. Most institutions&#151;certainly all my academic colleagues to whom I talked in this place when I was having difficulties&#151;said that the schemes that they operate would not run into those difficulties. None the less, it is extremely difficult to know what to do when you run into something where the documentation is all there, but what is happening in practice is a travesty. There does not seem to be any way in which this can be made to work better at the moment.

Somehow, the gremlins got in and I am afraid that the amendment appeared as it was originally sent to me.
</p>

<a name="40510-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_554"></a>I am moving this amendment on behalf of the Association of University Teachers. Its main purpose is to amend Schedule 3, which relates to the duties of the adjudicator in relation to requirements of the annual report. The amendment would ensure that in the annual report the names of all individuals involved in any arbitration procedure should not be revealed.
</p>

<a name="40510-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_555"></a>University staff and the AUT have very strong concerns at the apparent lack of thought in the Bill about the impact on and implications for those staff who are directly affected by or implicated in cases that are referred to the adjudicator. Whether we like it or no, in any such adjudication the full facts of the complaint will inevitably be aired. We assume that the adjudication will therefore involve hearings, written evidence and other details of the original complaint, including the names of those involved.
</p>

<a name="40510-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_556"></a>That will mean that the annual report, which has to include information about the complaint itself and the decisions and recommendations made, will also potentially include details of named individuals. That provides considerable scope for someone&#039;s reputation to be damaged and for potentially groundless complaints to be repeated in an important public document.
</p>

<a name="40510-37_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_557"></a>We are asking therefore that the names of the individual staff involved should not be revealed in the annual report so as to protect their reputations, professional credibility and employment rights. Parliament will still be able to hold the adjudicator to account, but without damaging the staff involved. I beg to move.

<a name="40510-37_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   Over recent weeks, we have had quite a lot of exchanges on this subject in regard to the medical profession, which I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Winston, will recall. I cannot see any good reason why an annual report&#151;or, indeed, any report&#151;of this particular organisation should name and shame, so to speak. The noble Baroness, Lady   Sharp, is absolutely right. It could get into the press and could do great damage, not only to staff, as she mentioned, but also to students.
</p>




<p><a name="st_277"></a>
<a name="40510-37_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Neill of Bengarve: </b>   I strongly support this amendment. Indeed, it may not go quite far enough. I think that I am more aware of the possible damage caused to students than to staff. If names of either party were revealed, it would lead to immediate attention of the sort that will spread an account of the case that may not cover all the nuances. However, one has to recognise that where a case is thought to be lurid or interesting, because they imagine that they have an unqualifiedly good case, there will be a temptation on the part of one or both parties to reveal the name of the other party. In addition to anonymity in the report, it may be as well to consider whether those who bring complaints should not have to agree not to reveal the name of the other party or the details of the case.

<a name="40510-38_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The amendment proposes that individual parties should not be named in the designated operator&#039;s annual report. Of course the parties concerned are students and the governing bodies are the institutions. I can assure noble Lords that we agree that the operator should not name individual students in its annual report. However, we do believe that the reviewer should be able to comment on the extent to which the governing body of an institution has followed the reviewer&#039;s recommendation. This would involve naming an institution. The amendment would prevent the reviewer from, for example, highlighting in its annual report an institution which has not complied with its rulings. We do not want to limit the reviewer in that way.
</p>

<a name="40510-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_558"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will agree that a degree of public accountability for their response to decisions is important to the success of a non-binding scheme of this kind. I can also assure noble Lords that such practice is common in other ombudsman-type schemes. For example, the Local Government Ombudsman names individual local authorities and councils, but does not name individuals. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education has made it clear in its guidance that it will only ever publish cases in an anonymised form&#151;I believe that the word does exist, and I am now the second person to use it. All correspondence between the OIA and the parties to a complaint will be treated in confidence and only shared between the parties involved.
</p>

<a name="40510-38_para1"></a>

That does not imply necessarily that one disagrees with it; it is simply a means of seeking to establish the precise meaning and intention of a clause. So there is no automatic implication that the fact that we are seeking to leave something out means that we are against it; on the other hand, we may find at later stages that it means exactly that.

It is not unusual to complain from the Opposition Benches that what ought to be on the face of the Bill is not there but in regulations and so on. With regard to a large amount of the content of this Bill, that is certainly not the case; there is a most extraordinary degree of detail. Indeed, it seems almost to recast the whole of existing legislation with regard to marriage into a form applicable to the Bill. On the other hand, as the committee on delegated legislation pointed out, the provisions with regard to social security are extremely wide and the provisions with regard to tax&#151;an issue we shall come to on a later amendment&#151;have previously not appeared.

First, it may be that a relationship already exists between two people and a civil partnership will not necessarily alter that fact, although it may of course follow after it. Secondly, the kind of relationship is not specified and could be one that is not a civil partnership. The clause as it stands states that,

It is also unclear, for example, whether a civil partner is or is not a spouse, but that is another point that we may pursue later. The amendment seems to be entirely appropriate.

I had the honour of being elected, for some reason, as a fellow of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. As I shall speak only once for a few minutes today and as I was not at Second Reading, I shall make one or two other points. First, I am delighted that my Private Member&#039;s Bill has borne fruit in the form of the Government&#039;s admirable Bill. Secondly, I regret that Lord Williams of Mostyn is not alive and here today, because, as Robin Cook&#039;s memoirs show again and again, they were both particular supporters of the idea of civil partnership.

minorities in society. It is a pleasure to see the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, in charge of it, as, unlike me, she is a great expert on family law. However, I regret that the Bill does not protect opposite-sex couples who are unmarried in the way that it protects same-sex couples. Although I shall oppose other ways of trying to widen the Bill, I shall explain why that omission is regrettable.
</p>

<a name="40510-38_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>In 1995, the Supreme Court of Canada had to consider whether there was unjustifiable discrimination in Canadian law between unmarried heterosexual couples and married couples. By a clear majority, significantly led by its two women members, Claire L&#039;Heureux-Dub&#233; and Beverley McLachlin, the Supreme Court decided that there was no justification for treating unmarried heterosexual couples less favourably in law than heterosexual married couples. Both of the leading majority judgments emphasised that women in particular tend to be the victims of not being able to persuade their partners to marry them and to give them the full protections that they would otherwise have. They explained in ways to which I do not wish to devote time today why they considered that there was a denial of equal protection.
</p>

<a name="40510-38_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>It was the judgment in a case called <i>Miron</i> <i>and</i> <i>Valliere</i> v <i>Trudel</i>, where the court decided that there had been a breach of the charter of rights, that led the legislator in Canada to begin to reform the country&#039;s cohabitation law so as to make it possible for unmarried heterosexual couples to be protected in the same way that married heterosexual couples.
</p>

<a name="40510-38_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Although I well understand why the Government cannot possibly carry out those reforms in time to get this Bill through, I very much hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that the Government will put their weight behind law reform in that area and will not simply educate unmarried heterosexual couples about the fact that there is no such thing as common-law marriage protected in law. That seems to me to be a really pressing reform.
</p>

<a name="40510-38_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>However, I do not think it right or sensible to use these proceedings to carry out general law reform. It seems to me that we need to confine reform to the mischief with which the Bill seeks to deal&#151;that is, the mischief that homosexual couples cannot marry and are unprotected in a variety of ways, especially in relation to their property rights.
</p>

<a name="40510-38_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>It is because the principles on which the Bill is based concern the loving, continuous and, it is hoped, permanent relationships between same-sex couples that I think the amendments that we shall consider later are misconceived when they seek to treat other relationships in the same way. I understand the arguments. If the Bill were conceived of simply as a property Bill, there would be a good deal to be said for widening it in that way. But, in my view, the Bill rightly concentrates on the continuing loving relationships which are analogous to those of heterosexual couples&#151;especially those who marry. Therefore, I do not consider it sensible to support that widening, although no doubt there will be a debate on one part of it.

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights, on which I serve, has not yet scrutinised the Minister&#039;s compatability statement to see whether it is entirely compatible, and I have no idea what I and my colleagues will, in due course, say about that. But&#151;we shall see what my colleagues think&#151;I should have thought that there was at least an argument for requiring the Government to justify the different treatment maintained between unmarried and married heterosexual couples and, for that matter, between gay, lesbian and heterosexual couples.
</p>

<a name="40510-38_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>I turn briefly to the first amendment, introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. One answer to that amendment was given in the same Supreme Court case in Canada, where Justice L&#039;Heuvreux-Dub&#233; said the following. It is the only quotation to which I want to refer now but it is quite telling:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;In my view, the decision of whether or not to marry can, indeed, be one of the most personal decisions an individual will ever make over the course of his or her lifetime. It can be as fundamental, as momentous, and as personal as a choice regarding, for instance, one&#039;s citizenship or even one&#039;s religion. Although certain rights and obligations follow from each one of these three diverse choices, it does not render any of these choices justice to reduce them to a question of contract. I highly doubt, for instance, that people enter the institution of marriage because it strikes them as offering an attractive package of contractual rights and obligations. By the same token, people who make a conscious decision not to subscribe to the institution of marriage may very well be motivated by very personal beliefs which have nothing whatsoever to do with the contractual rights and obligations that incidentally attach to that status&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-38_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>In so far as Amendment No. 1 is designed to define a civil partnership as a contract rather than as a relationship involving a change of status, I know that that is not the intention behind the movers of the amendment, but I believe that turning them into contracts downgrades the loving, committed relationships of homosexual couples. It runs against the purpose of the Bill, which is to recognise and celebrate the validity of same-sex relationships.
</p>

<a name="40510-38_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Amendment No. 1 may be a paving amendment to achieve a wider change dealing with siblings and other home-sharers, enabling them to enter into a civil partnership, and other amendments seem to do that. For the reasons I have given we would not support that. Family law is based on bundles of rights and responsibilities, not on contractual obligations. In my view, a civil partnership is not to be treated as a contract. A contract analogy is unsuitable. I hope I have explained our general approach to the Bill and why we cannot support the amendment.

I say to the noble Lord, Lord   Higgins, first in relation to the commitment of the Bill, that this is a government Bill. It has the whole-hearted support of the Government and it is expected that those who sit on our Benches will fully support it.

As this is the first amendment, I should be grateful if I could take a little time to explain why we see this as so important. It is the intention of the Government, in bringing the Bill to the House, to allow same-sex couples to gain legal recognition of their relationship. Civil partnerships would be a new legal entity, and the Bill provides us the opportunity to set out clearly what we hope to achieve by it.
</p>

<a name="40510-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>I accept straightaway that a marriage is a contract, as the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, said, but marriage is also an expression of a relationship. It has been acknowledged for many hundreds of years. What same-sex couples seek now is an acknowledgement of their relationship, not, as the noble Lord, Lord Alli, says, simply a recognition of a series of contracts. At Second Reading, we heard of many difficulties that same-sex couples can face. They face them because their long-term, mutually supportive relationships are, at the moment, invisible in law. They have chosen to share their lives together, emotionally and financially, separately from other family ties, but as same-sex couples are unable to marry. That is the acknowledgement that we have to make.

</p>

<a name="40510-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The formation of a civil partnership would be a very serious commitment for those who chose to enter into it. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, said at Second Reading that civil partnerships should come with a health warning. I respectfully agree. Registering as civil partners of each other would mean that the couple would accept onerous responsibilities that were not easily excused. We are not talking about an arrangement or relationship that should be entered into lightly. For example, the ending of civil partnerships could occur only by death, dissolution or annulment. In the case of dissolution, responsibilities do not end there; questions of financial support will often continue.
</p>

<a name="40510-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>The rights and responsibilities are those set out in the Bill. There is no second option to legal recognition for same-sex couples; there is no &quot;civil partnership-lite&quot;, with fewer duties and obligations for which people can opt. It is not a pick-and-mix affair. Couples who choose the relationship and its legal consequences are highly unlikely to do so unless they have good reason to believe that their lives would remain closely entwined.

If one wishes to get out of the legal consequences that the state now seeks to imply by virtue of that registration, the first option is to annul it. In that instance, it should never have been formed in the first place due to a fundamental flaw, meaning that it was a nullity and was not capable of being recognised in law. For example, if someone is already married, fails to declare it and then enters into a civil partnership, the civil partnership never existed; it was a nullity. The other option is to dissolve the partnership, there being grounds set out for the basis of dissolution. Those are the two issues.
</p>

<a name="40510-39_para9"></a>

I do not share that amusement, but there we are. In the Government&#039;s view, a civil partnership is a legal relationship which is formed when two people register their names as civil partners of each other. It is that simple but solemn procedure which brings a civil partnership into being. By taking the step of entering into that relationship the couple would gain rights and undertake responsibilities which are set down by the law, not chosen by agreement between them.
</p>

<a name="40510-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>We do not see that relationship as being based on a contract. It is a fundamental part of a contract that you can put anything in that you like and have any limitations you like. You can cut it and turn it any way you wish. That is not what we propose here. For those who enter into this relationship and then have their agreement to so enter registered, there will be state-identified consequences which they cannot get out of. That is very clear, and that is the difference.

Does she agree&#151;this might be helpful to the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit&#151;that in the old days there was something called an action for breach of promise to marry, as in, &quot;I&#039;ve promised to marry you and I break the promise and you sue me for breach of contract&quot;? That was a contract to marry. However, in a civil marriage the position is that the registration of the marriage is a registration of evidence of the relationship, not of a contract. The contract has been entered into by being registered but the registration is the act which is then annulled if the marriage breaks down. To the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, that may seem like a legal nicety but I wonder whether I am right in saying that that is approximately the position in family law, including marriage law.

As regards the contract being cut whichever way one would like, if there are to be regulations for drawing up the registration, can there not be the same regulations for drawing up the contract? I do not understand how a contract and a legal registration differ as there can be a legal registration of a contract, or am I completely wrong? I should like clarification.

bound to each other. That happens at the point of registration. Once there is registration, the legal consequences of that registration are all those things which are contained in the Bill. The noble Baroness says it is a contract. We say that it is a recognition and registration of the reality of relationships.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>The breach of the terms of the registration may be brought into question. Of course, there are issues as to the way in which one can get out of the relationship; that is, by annulment, dissolution of the registration, and so forth. However, the acknowledgement that this is a valid relationship is at the very core of what the Bill seeks to do. Failure to acknowledge that these relationships are valid is the cause of much pain and distress over the years as anything else. If we were simply to refer to this as a contract without acknowledging the inherent nature of the relationship which brought it into being, we would do a great disservice to all those who seek the acknowledgement.

Indeed, in the Women & Equality Unit&#039;s <i>Civil Partnerships</i> document, I read about the creation of a new legal status.

the noble Lord that there is a fundamental distinction between status and contract and between contract and status.

However, for all I know, the priest may have been referring to a contract or a covenant with God in a religious form of marriage&#151;I have no idea. But it is not legal nonsense; it is absolutely clear that, when one marries, one is changing one&#039;s status. A marriage contract may be made between the parties concerning how they are to share the loot and so on. As I said, in the old days, actions could be taken for breach of promise of marriage. However, in my view, the Minister is completely correct about the legal position. If anyone has any better view, I should be interested to hear it.

I certainly was very much influenced by it but, alas, one cannot legislate for love. That is why, I presume, no amendment has been tabled in respect of that issue. Therefore, to read as much into the word &quot;relationship&quot; as has been read into it is rather to exaggerate the situation.

The reality is that we shall be seriously in need of legal advice on many of these clauses. For example, on the point with which he seems extremely preoccupied&#151;namely, the state of the law with regard to co-habitation&#151;we shall be very much in need of advice.

She also seems to be reading into the word &quot;relationship&quot; far more than its natural meaning would imply. Loving relationships exist not only between couples of both sexes and couples of the same sex, but in many other human relationships as well. To suggest that love is somehow restricted to this or that particular category seems to be a mistake. However, again, I express a personal view.

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>We shall need to consider further the points that have been made, but my own feeling is that the amendment, if accepted, would improve the Bill rather than in any way downgrade it or undermine it. However, having said that, at this stage of the Bill, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40510-40_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain </b>   moved Amendment No. 2:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>Page 1, line 4, after &quot;relationship&quot; insert &quot;between two people in the categories set out in section (Additional categories of civil partners) or&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 2, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 10, 15, 19, 35 and 36 which are grouped with it.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>Under the Bill, same-sex couples are to be given all the legal rights of married couples. It is, therefore, I submit, a highly discriminatory Bill. A daughter who nurses her elderly mother for 10 years will not benefit from the Bill; neither will two sisters who have lived together all their lives; nor two pensioners who share a house; nor a carer who looks after a disabled person. The discrimination arises because the Bill creates a marriage-like state and provides that only same-sex couples may enter into it.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The focus of these amendments is solely to widen the pool of those who benefit from the right that the Bill creates. I shall seek to address the similarities with marriage in later amendments. We have all heard the cases cited by those who supported the Bill at Second Reading and we all have sympathy with them&#151;some cases definitely elicited our sympathy&#151;but the hardships that have been cited for those in homosexual relationships also arise in other kinds of relationships&#151;for example, two sisters who live together, or friends in a platonic relationship who share a house on a long-term basis.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Let us suppose that two friends share a rented house for 20 years. If one dies, the other could be evicted; there is no right to inherit the tenancy. If the Bill becomes law, a homosexual couple could have next-of-kin rights to the tenancy, but not the two friends. I suggest that this is unjust.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Take another case of two sisters who live together after their respective husbands die. On the death of one, the other must pay inheritance tax. A niece moves into her uncle&#039;s house to nurse him because he suffers from a degenerative disease. She sells her house and gives up her career to look after him. She has no right to inherit the tenancy. She also has to pay inheritance tax.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Those who support the Bill have cited cases where estranged family members can suddenly be treated as next of kin, while the person closest to the victim is ignored&#151;yet that situation is not unique to homosexual couples. Sadly, I have had an all-too-personal experience of it. Many people are estranged from their families, to varying degrees, for all sorts of reasons&#151;religious reasons, cultural reasons, and misunderstandings. If one&#039;s only relative is a brother from whom one has been estranged for many years, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC11"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC11</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

one might not necessarily want him to make life-or-death decisions about one&#039;s medical care or, indeed, to inherit one&#039;s estate.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>The issue of next-of-kin rights could have been dealt with in legislation that helps everyone, not only homosexual couples. The Government have chosen not to do that. They have chosen only to address those in a homosexual relationship. Only homosexual couples will escape the hammer blow of inheritance tax under this Bill.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>At Second Reading, I made my outright opposition to inheritance tax itself very clear. I pointed out that someone who moves into a flat to care for a friend with a long-term illness may still face a swingeing inheritance tax bill, even if he or she lived in the same flat for 20 or 30 years. Two unmarried sisters who live their whole lives in the same family home would also be liable. The surviving sister may well lose the home as a result. If the legal rights of married couples are to be handed to others, there is surely a legitimate public debate to be had about who should receive the benefits.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The Bill addresses only those in a homosexual relationship, and completely ignores the needs of families, friends who care for each other and elderly people who spend their twilight years looking after each other. I have tabled amendments to cater for each of those categories. I accept that not every possible case is covered, but the purpose of the amendments is to provide a fair way to help those friends, relations and long-term house sharers who are in the same kinds of difficulties as those cited in support of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>If the Government reject my amendments, the message will be sent out that homosexual relationships are much more important than the platonic and caring relationships of long-term house sharers, be they pensioners, relations or disabled people and their carers. According to the recent census, there are up to 4.6 million house sharers in a non-sexual relationship, compared with only 80,000 homosexual couples who share a home. Those data were provided in recent Parliamentary Answers in the Commons <i>Hansard</i> on 24 March 2004 at col. 844W, and 31 March 2004 at col.   1411W. For many specific cases of hardship experienced by a same-sex couple&#151;there are such cases; we have heard about them&#151;there would be almost 60 times as many cases among house sharers in a non-sexual relationship. If the rights and benefits of marriage are to be extended because of cases of hardship, that must be done in a fair and consistent way.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Amendment No. 10 inserts a new clause after Clause   1, to extend civil partnerships to family members, disabled people and their carers, and pensioners. In each case, there is a requirement that the parties have lived together in the same house or flat for seven years. That ensures that we benefit only highly committed relationships that have endured over time. Unlike the rest of the Bill, which is wide open to tax avoidance, that requirement would prevent people using civil partnerships as a tax avoidance measure. If a father gives his property to his son, capital gains tax <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC12"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC12</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is avoided only if the father dies seven years after the gift has been made. The Inland Revenue believes that a seven-year period is a sensible precaution against tax avoidance and that is why I have followed this logic in my amendment.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Amendment No. 35 is consequential. It allows for regulations to assist in determining whether the applicants pass this residence test for a minimum of seven years living together.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>I turn to the details of my new clause. The first category in paragraph (a) is close family relationships. The list of relationships simply mirrors the existing list in Schedule 1 to the Bill, which is the prohibited degrees. These are the very people who are expressly excluded from civil partnerships. The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun of Abernethy, made the point strongly at Second Reading on 22 April, col. 413.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>The category in paragraph (b) is disabled people and their carers. It is not uncommon for two friends to live together because one of them is disabled. In fact, the costs of having live-in carers at home is usually so exorbitant that few people who want to keep their loved ones at home can afford it. The able-bodied friend effectively becomes a full-time carer. This is one of the most selfless and loving relationships I can think of, yet the Bill does not recognise it. Under my amendment, if the carer and his or her friend live together for seven years, they can register and gain recognition for their friendship.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>In both categories, my amendment requires the parties to be aged over 25. The seven-year qualifying period must relate to their adult lives. Any period of sharing a house while one of the parties is under the age of 18 does not count.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>The third category in paragraph (c) relates to people over 70. The age of 70 is chosen in order to focus on those cases where the greatest hardship could arise. If two friends in their 70s have lived together in a relationship of mutual companionship for more than seven years, most people would think it unfair if they would be penalised by inheritance tax when one died, solely because they were not in a homosexual partnership.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>My amendments do not require the parties to be of the same sex. Amendments Nos. 15 and 19 amend Clause 3 to make clear that the ban on opposite-sex partnerships and partnerships between relations does not apply to those who fall within the three categories I have outlined.
</p>

<a name="40510-40_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>In conclusion, I express the hope that the Minister will not seek to oppose these amendments on merely technical grounds. I know that there will be other issues to address on what would happen to a civil partnership between two sisters if one wished to marry. The answer is that the partnership could be dissolved automatically on entering into a marriage or on expressing an intention to do so, but these are details. I hope that the Minister will recognise that there is a problem of fairness and be willing to consider ways of dealing with that problem. I beg to move.

<a name="40510-41_spnew0"></a><b> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </b>   I support the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, in her amendment. We cannot vote on amendments in Grand Committee, but if she tabled her amendment again on Report, I would vote with her.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>The Treasury is not keen on widening the scope of the Bill to include the categories of people listed in Amendment No. 10. As the law presently stands, where a wife inherits a life interest in her husband&#039;s estate no death duty or inheritance tax is payable&#151;she gets the estate. However, when she later dies, the Treasury gets the tax. My goodness, it gets it&#151;in spades.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40510-41_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   I certainly support my noble friend&#039;s amendments, although I have tabled some later amendments that would accomplish the same and a little more in a rather simpler, cleaner fashion. The basis of the amendment is surely what is recognised in the Women & Equality Unit publication issued by the DTI. To what the DTI has come since my day as Secretary of State, when we used to think that it was our business to support business and commerce in the British interest. Paragraph 2.6 of this curious document states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;The creation of a new legal status that is open only to same-sex couples and not to opposite-sex couples would amount to a difference in treatment. However, the Government believes that this difference in treatment is justified because it would remedy an inequality that already exists between opposite-sex and same-sex couples&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Two wrongs make a right, do they not? It is apparently a well established principle of legislation these days.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Let us consider, however, that the central argument of this Bill is that same-sex couples would be prohibited entering into marriage so there should be something for them. The Bill provides it. What about those who are still prohibited; for example, a mother and a daughter? Why should they not be able to register a partnership in order that they may benefit from the same tax concessions as would be granted in this case? There is no way in which the mother and daughter can achieve those advantages. Nor can brothers, nor sisters, nor father and son. Those are all expressly excluded. They are all brushed aside. They are a difference that does not matter, because the Bill remedies one inequality. By so doing, it creates an another enormous inequality. I absolutely support my noble friend Lady O&#039;Cathain in seeking to improve the Bill by making sure we do not have a new category of people who suffer disadvantage&#151;a disadvantage from which they cannot escape.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40510-41_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Alli: </b>   I knew that all things were possible in this House, but there were parts of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, at which I was nodding my head in agreement. The noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, raised two important issues. The first was cohabiting couples. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, raised it in his opening remarks. There is indeed much work that needs to be done to protect couples who find themselves in relationships and who believe that they have a degree of protection which they clearly do not. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC14"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC14</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The second issue raised by the noble Baroness was, quite properly, that of inheritance tax. Huge hardship is suffered, particularly by mothers, daughters and sisters. One has to look only at property prices. There are huge issues surrounding inheritance tax at which the Government need to look seriously again.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>However, while those are important issues, this is the wrong Bill. That is the essence of my problem with the amendments. It is a bit like taking a Bill designed to help the water companies and turning it into a Bill for other utilities by amending it in Committee or on Report.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>All I am saying to the noble Lord and the noble Baroness is that what you are trying to do here is very difficult and I do not think it will work. I believe that we should ask the Government to consider these issues much more seriously&#151;they would have many more friends in the House&#151;and to take action on them but, I stress again, not in the Bill. This is not the place for these arguments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40510-41_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I make the same point as the noble Lord, Lord Alli. The purpose of the amendments in this group is to extend the Bill to cover relationships of an entirely different kind: those between a carer and the person who is cared for; those based on co-residence, such as that of a daughter who is looking after an elderly parent or two siblings or elderly friends who are living together for companionship and cheapness.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>In our view, that has nothing to do with the purposes of the Bill. The central purpose of the Bill is to give public and legal recognition to the relationship between two gay or lesbian people. That relationship will be one of love and commitment and one which it is hoped will last for life.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40510-41_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   I thank the noble Lord for giving way. I thought that I had read the Bill thoroughly. Where does it say that those entering into a civil partnership must be homosexuals?
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40510-41_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   It does not, any more than the laws of marriage require marriages to be between a heterosexual couple who intend to have sexual relations. However, I do not suppose that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, disagrees that it is clearly the intention behind the Bill to provide a status for a legal recognition for homosexual couples. The essential point concerns the changes in provision that the Bill contains, for example to the law on inheritance tax and other kinds of tax, to pensions and to social security where a couple living in a civil partnership will suffer rather than benefit. All those changes are consequential on the creation of the new status and absolutely not the reason for it.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Alli, said, there is clearly a case for changes to the tax and pension systems in relation to carers and co-residents but that is a matter for another Bill on another day. There are obvious defects in the amendment, which must have been seen by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain. What about trios? What about a daughter who is looking after both <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC15"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC15</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

parents? After all, she cannot enter into a civil partnership with both of them, but it may be the wrong one who dies.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40510-41_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   I thank the noble Lord for giving way. I did not spell it out, but I did say that there are other areas to the amendment. Surely, if a daughter was looking after a mother and father, when the father died or the mother died, the estate would go straight to the other surviving spouse and it is only when the second spouse dies that the daughter would have to pay inheritance tax. There would be no inheritance tax payable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40510-41_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   That is the sort of point which, frankly, discredits the whole idea behind this situation. It makes clear that this is merely what I would call a tax avoidance scheme. I suppose that one might call it a tax reduction scheme.
<a name="time_2"></a>
<a name="40510-41_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40510-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>Again, would the daughter looking after her mother wish to enter into a contract that she would then have to break in order to enter into a marriage with a man? The noble Baroness did say that in that case you could write into this Bill that the civil partnership would come to an end automatically when she married. That seems to me to make this whole idea of a civil partnership ridiculous.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>It is nothing more than a tax reduction scheme. If tax reduction is desirable under the circumstances, it should be based on the fact of co-residence and not on the adoption, or entering into, of some special contract of this kind. Furthermore, the contract that the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, envisages, does not extend to the case of those who probably need it most&#151;that is the unmarried, heterosexual couple who could, under this amendment, only claim on each other&#039;s death either if one was disabled and the other was caring for them, or if both were over the age of 70.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>The defects of these amendments are so obvious that it is clear that the motive behind them is to undermine the whole scheme of civil partnerships, so that they will cease to hold any attraction of special legal recognition for homosexual couples and will simply become a vehicle for tax avoidance. In those circumstances, my noble friend and I have no hesitation whatever in offering no support to these amendments. We shall oppose them as strongly as we can.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40510-41_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   There used to be a very popular undergraduate or sixth-form debate on, &quot;the line must be drawn somewhere&quot;. That is essentially what this debate is about. I have a great deal of sympathy for the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lady   O&#039;Cathain, but I fear that I have problems with it. The problem with it is that it does not go far enough.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Also, I have considerable difficulty with Amendment No. 10, which seeks to specify a number of specific categories. I am not the least bit clear why the additional categories should include only two persons over the age of 70, rather than over 65. I am a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC16"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC16</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

little clearer why they must be over 25. In either case, it is not right to specify the categories in the way that has been suggested. There are other problems with it. I am not the least bit clear about why, under one of the categories, they should have had to live together in the same house. It would be rather odd if, for one reason or another, they happened to have moved house in the mean time. One can go through this list. I will not be tedious and do so. It seems to me that specifying categories in this way is not a sensible way of proceeding.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in a sense put his finger on the exact point when he said that it does not say that this is a homosexual rights Bill, or whatever one might call it&#151;it does not. That is why it is not the least bit clear why the line will be drawn where the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, would like to see it. If one is going to exclude the other categories that the noble Lords, Lord Alli, Lord Goodhart and Lord Lester, would like to exclude, at that point one must establish whether there is a sexual relationship. We shall come to this point on some of the other amendments.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>It seems to me that once we are going down the road that this Bill takes us down, it will not be possible to draw the line where those noble Lords would like to draw it. That would mean that one would run into all the problems that one does, for example, with cohabitation and social security, of having people sitting outside front doors, saying, &quot;Is there a sexual relationship going on in that house or not?&quot;. That is not a practical way of proceeding.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>As I understand it&#151;I may be sadly surprised and perhaps disappointed&#151;the Government are not saying that categories such as the classic two spinsters living together will not be able to form civil partnerships. It seems to me that they will and that no one will know whether or not they have a sexual relationship. Therefore, in practical terms, the restrictive way in which the noble Lord, Lord   Goodhart, and others are trying to operate is not a way in which it is possible to operate the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I believe that I have support on this view from the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. It is a question of what is practical. If you wish to go down this path, drawing the line where they want to is not practical. We shall come to this issue on later amendments.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>It seems to me that if the tax privileges&#151;and it is not clear what they are at the moment but, again, we shall find out on a later amendment&#151;are to be extended to those forming a same-sex sexual relationship, they will inevitably apply to those in the kind of category, but not exclusively so, to which the noble Baroness referred in moving the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40510-41_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Perhaps I may also say in parenthesis that, so far as concerns the inheritance tax provisions, unless you get a serial civil partner going through a series of individuals, from the Treasury&#039;s point of view it will be a cash flow problem, not a loss of revenue. Be that as it may, there are very real problems. I hope that one will draw the line where I have suggested.

<a name="40510-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>Let me try to simplify this issue into concepts that at least I can understand. As I understand it, the starting point for the Government is this: gay and lesbian couples cannot marry; because they cannot marry we are going to allow them a relationship which will not be a gay marriage in the full sense&#151;for all kinds of reasons, good or bad&#151;and treat them, as far as we possibly can, as though they were heterosexual so far as the recognition in law of their relationship is concerned.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>This does not mean that we will give them special benefits that married couples cannot have. Gay and lesbian couples will be subjected to the burdens as well as to the benefits that married couples now enjoy. For example, in social security, those who register will be worse off. We will not give them any special tax advantages. This is not to be a tax avoidance scheme and they will be taxed exactly the same as married couples. We will prohibit various individuals from entering into this relationship for the same reasons as they are prohibited from marrying as heterosexuals. By that, I basically mean the prohibitions against incest and matters of that kind.

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>It is true, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and others have pointed out, that there is no reference to sexual love or the need for sexual relations in the Bill. That may be for a very good reason, which is that one does not want those who are to be registered to have a state official inquiring into their sexual relations, in the same way as no one asked my wife or me before we got <br>&nbsp;<br>

married whether we intended to have sexual intercourse once we did marry. It would be entirely inappropriate on grounds of privacy so to do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="40510-42_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   That raises precisely the point that I seek to make. If two spinsters live together, are we to understand from what the noble Lord says that they will get the tax concessions if they have sexual relations, but not if they do not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="40510-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   Let me not get side-tracked. The noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, said early on that the Bill was discriminatory. If the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, moves some of his amendments later, I will quite agree that there is a strong argument for saying that it discriminates between same-sex unmarried couples and homosexual couples who want to marry. That is because one can make a fair comparison between couples who wish to live together in a marital state. We shall later look at why there may be discrimination of that kind.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>The idea of discrimination envisages a difference of treatment between people in comparable situations that is not justifiable. The noble Baroness says that hardship is the criterion, and if people live together and suffer hardship they should be put into the same position as gay and lesbian couples who suffer hardship. However, the fallacy is that the comparison to be made is between gay and lesbian couples and heterosexual married couples. The mischief with which the Bill is designed to deal is nothing to do, as the noble Lord, Lord Alli, said, with the wider issues, such as that in the example he gave of utilities and water companies. It is to remove that particular kind of discrimination.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>My only concern, which is why I have great sympathy with the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, is whether, in removing that source of inequality we do not create another as regards other couples in other similar relationships. However, that is a much broader question. I hope that my comments have clarified matters rather than obscured them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="40510-42_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said. I also listened with great attention to what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, and the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, and noted the emphasis on rights. I never once heard &quot;responsibilities&quot;. I want to say very clearly that those who enter into civil partnerships will have rights, but also onerous responsibilities in relation to their partner&#151;responsibilities of care, support and providing succour. Those will be legal responsibilities.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>The noble Baroness will probably not recall it, but there was a time when mothers and daughters were held to be responsible for each other&#039;s support. In terms of social security, in the 1930s, a household means test was applied that enabled a daughter to be held responsible for her father and for others who lived in that household. That caused a huge amount of dissent and fractured relationships, because siblings did not want to be responsible financially for each <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC19"></a>

other or, indeed, their parents. One could argue whether that was a socially responsible attitude, but it was the reality.
<a name="time_3"></a>
<a name="40510-42_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40510-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>We are not trying to conflate the relationships between siblings and parents and others. As the noble Lord, Lord Lester, made clear, we are trying to right a wrong and to address the current mischief of there not being a capacity to recognise and acknowledge the reality of a relationship that exists between a couple of the same sex. It is not all about finance. It is about the acknowledgement of a relationship. It is not simply about the money in the pocket, just as marriage is not about pounds, shillings and pence. There are those who say that if it were, they would never enter that estate. Many choose not to enter the estate of marriage because they care more for the pocket than for the person. That is a choice that same-sex couples will now have the capacity to make&#151;either to commit to each other or to commit to the pocket.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>If one looks at how the Bill is constructed, it is clear that it addresses the homosexual couple. Civil partnership is so described in Clause 1(1):


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;A civil partnership is a relationship between two people of the same sex&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The grounds on which civil partnership is void specify those who fall within the bounds of consanguinity or other prohibited degrees of relationship. We are therefore excluding those who are blood relatives and those who have entered those relationships by way of adoption. That confines a person to having a same-sex relationship with someone to whom he or she is not directly related.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>It is right to say that the Bill is silent on the nature of the sexual relationship that exists between the couple, save to require that they must be of the same sex. We have not replicated in the Bill the grounds of adultery. Those who have had the delight of dealing with adultery litigation will remember all those tests, such as whether penetration took place. The Bill will address none of those issues. There is no adultery in it.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>However, there are provisions for unreasonable behaviour. Those who enter civil partnership will therefore have the capacity to tell of their reasonable expectation of what that relationship would entail. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, was right to say that if two spinsters had a loving and long-term, platonic relationship and wished to enter a civil partnership, there would no way in which we could determine that they were not so entitled. The Bill is not about the sexual content of the marriage; it is about the quality of the relationship of two people of the same gender who enter a registered partnership. A clear distinction is made between a marriage and the estate that we are now offering to same-sex couples by way of registration. They are different. We have tried to make that absolutely clear. Civil partnership is not marriage, but it is a recognition of a relationship which has value.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>Therefore, the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, would be well founded if the issue were merely one of tax avoidance or an opportunity to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC20"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC20</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

expunge a category of person&#039;s entitlement to pay inheritance tax. If that were the case, the noble Baroness&#039;s qualifications would perhaps be merited, but it is not. Therefore, the Government will not and cannot support any such amendment.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>My noble friend Lord Alli was right to say that the nature of tax relief for those who live in new relationships has been an issue for many years. We have a much greater range of relationships today than we had in the past.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Let us not mistake ourselves. A wide category of provision is already made for siblings and for those who live together. The issues faced by same sex-couples are very different from that category. Perhaps I may give some examples. Siblings are recognised in the intestacy rules in a way that same-sex couples are not. Siblings already have succession rights in the case of secure and introductory tenancies if they resided with the tenant for 12 months preceding the tenant&#039;s death. In the case of Rent Act tenancies, siblings have succession rights if they resided with the tenant for two years preceding the tenant&#039;s death. Usually, there is a question over a close relation&#039;s ability to attend a funeral or to visit a sick person in hospital. Those are not issues which arise.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>The position of carers and companions over 70 who share a home is different again. For example, should they really have joint financial responsibilities which could be set aside only after court proceedings for dissolution? We already have a difficulty persuading people that they wish to undertake the care of those in need. If they are to be financially and otherwise responsible for them as well, and have to bind themselves and be financially responsible for discharging their care, we may well find that fewer carers than there are at present will wish to enter into that estate.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>Should a person in such a relationship have an automatic pre-emptive share of the estate if the person he or she lives with dies without making a will, particularly a paid carer? We know that some carers are very expensive indeed, particularly if they live in. Should they, therefore, automatically receive half the person&#039;s estate when they die?
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>As those questions show, the concerns of homesharers, whether as family, carers or companions, are a separate issue to the concerns of same-sex couples. The Law Commission&#039;s report on home sharers in 2002 supports that fact. That report concluded that no single solution was possible for all the different permutations of home sharer. The Law Commission considered that the solution to the specific issues raised would be best determined by reference to the nature of the relationship in each case. Thus, the solution to the needs of those in caring relationships may not be the same solution to the needs of siblings who live together. So, it is clear that their problems are different from those of same-sex couples who lack legal recognition of their relationship because they cannot now marry.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>As I have said, civil partnership is an acknowledgement of the existence of committed same-sex relationships. I do not know whether the reason <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC21"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC21</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that those who find difficulty with that is simply because they do not want to acknowledge that these relationships have any special significance. Perhaps they do not want to acknowledge them as a reality or as existing at all. If that is the case, that is a sadness, but we might as well recognise that that is what they are trying to do.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>The Bill is designed to meet the needs of such couples, not anyone else. It provides a framework which allows same- sex couples to organise their joint lives, which is especially important if they are raising children together. It does not provide the type of framework that would remedy the different kinds of   problems faced by persons in other types of relationships. That was accepted by many noble Lords who spoke.

</p>

<a name="40510-42_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>If we were even to trespass into some of the different permutations which the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, invites us to consider, we could enter a nest of intractable problems by trying to abstract different relationships which would thereby be bound up. That is not our intention. We are trying to do something relatively straightforward and fundamentally decent; that is, to treat people equally. We are acknowledging for the first time in law that homosexual relationships exist. They have existed for a couple of hundred years. We are now just allowing people to acknowledge them. They have probably existed longer, since time immemorial. I think there is a reference to them in relation to Sodom and Gomorra.
</p>

<a name="40510-42_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>That is what we are faced with. I accept that there will be a lot of debate about how we meet these different needs. Families do not come in the same sizes any more. The grandparents are not looked after so intimately as they used to be within the home. There are not always two parents living with children. There is a plethora of differences, and that is something with which we will grapple, but not in this Bill.

<a name="40510-43_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord Bishop of Oxford:</b>  In the light of what the Minister said in the earlier part of her response, I draw attention to a point that I made at Second Reading. At the moment, it is proposed that a couple simply register their partnership, but there are no prescribed words to indicate or define what it is that they are entering into.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>In marriage, whether in church or in a registry office, the words are different, but nevertheless there are clear words. We know the familiar words of the marriage service&#151;for better or worse; for richer or poorer; in sickness and in health. If there were some prescribed words, however simple&#151;and not necessarily the same as those in the marriage service&#151;indicating that this is a profound commitment of two people, it would get over the question of whether this is a sexual relationship that we are talking about. As the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said, you are not inquiring about that in marriage. This is a commitment of two people. That is the fundamental point about it, not necessarily that it is a sexual relationship as people understand that. It would also say something to the range of amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain.

I will return to whether we should have some kind of prescribed words to indicate that this is a commitment, and that people are entering into a profound relationship.

<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="40510-43_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I will make it clear, if I did not make it clear at Second Reading, that the words are something which, although not incorporated in the actual ceremony, can be incorporated in other procedures. For instance, there can be a separate blessing, if that is what the couple want. Local authorities can organise other ceremonies, but the words will be similar to the two facts that currently must be ascertained for civil marriage. First, the registrar must ascertain that the couple are able to marry, that there is no legal impediment to their marriage; and, secondly, that they come to register that marriage. In fact, those are the only two issues that must be clear for a civil marriage.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>It has become the norm, in agreement with the registrar, to have a whole set of other words that can be agreed between the parties and one can have an infinite variety. It would be possible to have a procedure, separate from the civil procedure, which could encompass all of that. We are sticking clearly to the simplicity that currently must be proven for a non-religious, secular marriage. This is a non-religious, secular procedure.

</p>

<a name="40510-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Perhaps I may just go through the various points dealt with by the various speakers. The noble Lord, Lord Alli, said that I dealt with the unfairness to cohabiting couples. I did not: I did not mention cohabiting heterosexual couples at all.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>Certainly, I mentioned the unfairness about inheritance tax. I shall come back to that. We are told this is a relationship Bill, a partnership Bill, not a tax avoidance or an inheritance tax Bill. Unless I am very mistaken, the original impetus for the Bill came out of the very sad, untimely and horrific death of Lord Montague in the House at a debate one Friday, as I recall. There was a big move after that because his companion of so many years was left in very difficult circumstances. If they had been an ordinary married couple, they would not have had the inheritance tax problem. There was great sympathy from people around the House for Lord Montague.

<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="40510-43_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I am afraid that the noble Baroness is quite mistaken. The origin of this Bill was that at a conference my party passed a unanimous resolution advocating such a Bill.

<a name="40510-43_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   I apologise. Certainly, a lot of people to whom I have spoken about the Bill felt that that was the start. The situation elicited an enormous amount of support.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I return to the point: this is not a relationship Bill, it is seriously a tax Bill. The amendments I have tabled have dealt with that situation.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40510-43_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Alli: </b>   From a reading of the Bill, it is a relationship Bill. The noble Baroness is trying to make it a tax Bill, but it is currently a relationship Bill. The second point I make to her is that if it were a tax Bill we should not be discussing it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="40510-43_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   I thank the noble Lord. I was about to make the point that we should not be discussing it and that we should change the whole Bill to make it a relationship Bill and a recognition of loving relationships for same-sex couples, but not give them the benefit of inheritance tax. That would cause no problems at all.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>I finally reach the point about siblings having some of the advantages that I did not admit that they had. They do, of course, but they do not have them all. This is really a tax reduction scheme to enormous excess.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>My noble friend Lord Higgins said the line has to be drawn somewhere. He has a difficulty with Amendment No. 10 and the example with over 70s rather than over 65s. If I did not say it, I certainly intended to say that these are examples. The reason for using the age of 70 was that the greatest hardship seems to occur to people over the age of 70. Up to the age of 70 most people are capable of earning an income but a lot of people are not. I think that is where the problem arises.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>I was chided for talking about the same house. My noble friend was slightly&#151;if he does not mind my saying so&#151;splitting hairs there. By sharing the same house I did not actually mean the same location in Surbiton and moving to Crawley, to Doncaster or whatever. It was actually within the same home; sharing a home. My noble friend says they all moved to Worthing&#151;and they all voted Conservative.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>Furthermore, the problem was described as not being a Treasury problem, that the only Treasury problem was a cash-flow problem. That is slightly na-ve because after the survivor receives the relief from the inheritance tax do you think that he or she will leave all that money to the Treasury when he or she dies? I really do not think that that is a cash-flow problem; it is actually a serious problem for the Treasury if the inheritance tax provisions are extended to cover all the people I have suggested they should. So I do not think we can be too na-ve about that.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said that I have laid great emphasis on rights and never on responsibilities. She said that the fact is that carers looking after disabled people certainly have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC25"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC25</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

responsibilities; younger sons or daughters looking after elderly parents certainly have responsibilities; and the sisters living together provide succour to each other. I took down those three levels of responsibilities. The noble Baroness said that in the Civil Partnership Bill would acknowledge that same-sex couples living together have those responsibilities. I maintain that all the people I suggested ought to have those responsibilities.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>The point made about the 1930s&#151;I do not remember them&#151;where daughters were responsible for their parents. In fact there are still some of us, even though we were not around in the 1930s, who were brought up to accept that we always would have familial responsibilities. I can say that mine ended only three weeks ago. I felt deeply responsible for my parents and for my siblings until the death of my last sibling three weeks ago.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>So, I do not think that it necessarily means that people do not feel they have responsibilities. A lot of people do feel they have responsibilities. Perhaps I may also say that when the responsibility has gone you typically feel, &quot;Well, what is the purpose here?&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>However, we have to recognise that there are of course fantastic loving and supportive relationships between same-sex couples. It is wonderful that you can have these sorts of relationships. We all want loving and supportive relationships. But, marriage is not on the basis of inheritance tax or tax relationships. This Bill, I fear, has far too much emphasis on that area. I wonder whether there is some way that we could equalise that. Of course the best option would be to do away with inheritance tax altogether. The second best option would be to include all the categories that I suggest. The third option would be to give no one other than married couples the benefit.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>In the examples siblings can have rights over friends living together or carers looking after disabled people. They can have tenancy rights and intestacy rights. But they cannot have any inheritance rights or pension rights. I have mentioned four sets of rights. The Bill would give all four sets of rights to same-sex couples in civil partnerships. Siblings would have two of the rights but not all four. Many of the categories I have mentioned would have none of the four. So it is still a discriminatory Bill. It is unfair and unjust.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>I fear that the Government have constructed a Bill that looks very much like civil marriage. We can strip out some of the elements that most closely resemble marriage. I shall try with later amendments to do so. But that should not stop us from trying to address the fundamental injustice which the Bill creates. It is not fair that only homosexual carers should be exempt from inheritance tax; that only homosexual pensioners should be able to obtain next-of-kin rights; and that family relationships should be excluded altogether.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>What could be done would be to bring into the Bill an absolute requirement to say that those in long-term homosexual relationships&#151;male or female&#151;should have the sort of rights to counterbalance the appalling situations, which were raised I think by the noble Lord, Lord Alli, at Second Reading; for instance, a <br>&nbsp;<br>

dying person having no access at the last rites and no say in medical treatment or in anything. Perhaps we ought to be doing something about that.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>People say that the specified degrees of family relationships are too limited. I have simply duplicated the list of prohibited degrees in Schedule 1. These are the people who are specifically excluded from the Bill. Of course at a later stage I shall be very willing to think about broadening the list. But the primary purpose of the amendment at this stage is to draw out the Government&#039;s reasoning for excluding familial and platonic relationships.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>Finally, I have chosen a seven-year qualifying period for relationships. Only those who make a decision as adults to live together are making the kind   of commitment that I think merits recognition. An 18-year old who moves in with his or her disabled friend will be 25 by the time they have lived together for seven years. As for the elderly, it seems that targeting the over-70s addresses those instances in which the most difficult cases of hardship could arise.
</p>

<a name="40510-43_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>I realise that I have very little support, either from my own party or from others.

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>I was unfortunately not able to be at Second Reading. I was away on holiday with my wife. Had I been present, I would have pointed out&#151;what seems to have come as a slight shock to some&#151;that this Bill does not provide for civil partnerships to be confined to homosexuals. Merely, that they are to be undertaken only between persons of the same sex.
</p>

<a name="40510-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>If anyone believes that marriage has never been undertaken for financial reasons, they must be poorly experienced and very poorly read in great literature. And if anyone believes that civil partnerships will not be abused in the same way by some smart lads somewhere in the world&#151;and there are a lot of awfully smart lads in this world&#151;very eager to find a way to avoid taxation, then they will be in for a considerable shock.
</p>

<a name="40510-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>The Bill raises some very curious issues. Any two men or women not subject to the consanguinity rules can enter into a civil partnership for whatever reasons. There is no requirement for them to be homosexual; to have a sexual relationship; or for them to have a loving relationship. The nature of the relationship is not specified in the Bill.

</p>

<a name="40510-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>With marriage, certain specific undertakings are made and its purposes are clearly known. We therefore have a very curious situation. There is essentially a consanguinity rule in the Bill. I shall discuss it in a moment in the detail of the amendments. Why should brothers or sisters not be allowed to enter a civil partnership? We know why there is a consanguinity rule for heterosexual marriage. It is for the protection of potential offspring. That is the basis of it. In a marriage between persons of the same sex, there will clearly be no offspring, so why is that rule included? All it does is to prohibit siblings entering a civil partnership. Sooner or later, a pair of homosexual siblings may turn up in the courts, claiming that their rights have been abused and that they are not allowed to enter a civil partnership purely because they are related. They will claim that there is no good reason for it.

<a name="40510-44_para4"></a>

<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="40510-44_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I think that that point came up at Second Reading. It was pointed out that if people of opposite sexes were allowed to become civil partners, it would to some extent undermine the principle of marriage.

<a name="40510-44_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   He says &quot;not at all&quot;, but that is so. By restricting civil partnership to same-sex couples, it is a fundamentally discriminatory piece of legislation. It is as simple as that.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;if, being of opposite sexes, they are within prohibited degrees of relationship&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>There could of course be children of such a union if that were allowed. One would have to introduce a consanguinity rule to keep things tidy.
</p>

<a name="40510-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>I can see no logic at all in refusing homosexual brothers from entering a civil partnership open to other same-sex couples. The rules against consanguinity are there to safeguard against inbreeding and to protect potential children. There is no place for those to be in a same-sex relationship. I suspect that they are there in an effort to confine this legislation at the behest of the Treasury. If it is widened at all, the Treasury would see itself losing too much revenue. It is intended to prevent father and son, brother and brother, mother and daughter, or sister and sister&#151;however dependent they may be, and however strong their relationships&#151;from entering a partnership that would bring tax advantages.
</p>

<a name="40510-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Alli, said, this Bill cannot actually provide for tax concessions because it is in this House, but it paves the way to give a tiny minority tax concessions that are not available to those who are equally deserving, but exist in greater numbers. This is a case where it is a disadvantage to be a member of a large group. The Treasury will not give tax concessions to members of large groups. This Bill is applicable only to a very small group. It will, in fact, only give advantage to a minority of a minority. After all, why do we exclude from the benefits of this Bill daughters who gave up their lives to care for their fathers, sons who care for their mothers, or indeed mothers who care for their sons? The Bill is shot through with illogicality and discrimination.
</p>

<a name="40510-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>I have a feeling that somewhere down the line, this Bill will be challenged in the courts for discriminating on the grounds of sex. I look forward to seeing the Government wriggle when that comes. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="40510-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>The White Paper, as has already been said, explains in paragraph 1.4 that the Government have considered the position of opposite-sex couples, many of whom now choose&#151;I emphasise choose&#151;to cohabit instead of marry, and other people who live together in a closely supportive household environment. The Government believe that these situations are significantly different from those of same-sex couples who wish to formalise their relationships, but are currently unable to do so. The Government&#039;s argument for not providing benefits to unmarried, opposite-sex couples, is that they can choose to marry, whereas gay and lesbian partners cannot choose to marry.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC29"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC29</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>If the Government&#039;s argument were, &quot;We quite agree that the position of opposite-sex couples is anomalous and may need protecting, but it will take us a long time to work out the horrible details of law reform, and that justifies dealing with this mischief straightaway, and getting round to the wider mischief later&quot;, that seems to be possible grounds for justifying the difference in treatment. It may be that the Minister will reply to the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, on those lines. If she can indicate that the Government have it well in mind that something must be done on law reform in relation to what we will loosely call common-law marriages, that would be most welcome.
</p>

<a name="40510-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>If Members of the Committee look at the tables helpfully included in the consultation paper, they will find that table 1 on page 15, and table 2 on page 16, show that many other countries are already protecting opposite-sex couples in the way that they also protect same-sex couples. That is particularly true outside the European member states. If noble Lords circle the word, &quot;both&quot; in table 2, they will see that many of those countries are protecting opposite-sex as well as same-sex couples. I am sympathetic to the argument, even though my Bill dealt with opposite-sex and same-sex couples, but the matter is very complicated and it will take a while to get around to acting on it.
</p>

<a name="40510-44_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>I want to deal with the argument based on choice, as that is the only argument that the Government have put forward. They have not made an argument based on administrative or law-reform problems. The choice argument has been well dealt with in the Supreme Court of Canada case by two women justices. I emphasise that they were women; they looked at the matter very much as women in their two judgments. I very much hope that the Government will look at the judgments; I am sure that the Joint Committee on Human Rights will be asked to do so as well.
</p>

<a name="40510-44_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>Justice Claire L&#039;Heureux-Dub&#233; made three points. She said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;First, discrimination on the basis of marital status&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-44_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>that is what we are talking about; it is not on the basis of sex&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;touches the essential dignity and worth of the individual in the same way as other recognized grounds of discrimination violative of fundamental human rights norms. Specifically, it touches the individual&#039;s freedom to live life with the mate of one&#039;s choice in the fashion of one&#039;s choice&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-44_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Justice L&#039;Heureux-Dub&#233;&#039;s second point is that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;marital status possesses characteristics often associated with recognized grounds of discrimination . . .  Persons involved in an unmarried relationship constitute an historically disadvantaged group. There is ample evidence that unmarried partners have often suffered social disadvantage and prejudice&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-44_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>That is the common-law marriage problem. She said that, historically in Canada,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;the unmarried partner has been regarded as less worthy than the married partner. The disadvantages inflicted on the unmarried partner have ranged from social ostracism through denial of status and benefits&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-44_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>Then she talks about illegitimacy and says that it is no longer quite the problem that it was.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC30"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC30</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-44_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>The third point that Justice L&#039;Heureux-Dub&#233; makes is that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;A third characteristic sometimes associated with analogous grounds&#151;distinctions founded on personal, immutable characteristics&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-44_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>in the sense that one cannot change one&#039;s colour or gender&#151;is present in common-law marriages, albeit in attenuated form. That is an important point. She said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;In theory, the individual is free to choose whether to marry or not to marry&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-44_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>That is the Government&#039;s argument. She continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;In practice, however, the reality may be otherwise. The sanction of the union by the state through civil marriage cannot always be obtained. The law; the reluctance of one&#039;s partner to marry; financial, religious or social constraints&#151;these factors and others commonly function to prevent partners who otherwise operate as a family unit from formally marrying. In short, marital status often lies beyond the individual&#039;s effective control. In this respect, marital status is not unlike citizenship&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-44_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I mention those points only because I wonder whether the Government are on safe ground in founding the whole of the justification for not doing what my Bill did&#151;covering common-law marriage couples&#151;on a matter of choice. The judgment says that, in the real world, many of those who would like to marry cannot do so because their partner will not marry or for other reasons. No doubt the Human Rights Joint Committee will need to go into those matters. The Government may in due course have to justify that difference of treatment under the Human Rights Act, if it ever comes to that.
</p>

<a name="40510-44_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>I am not arguing in favour of the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit&#151;that the Government should somehow now accept common-law marriage&#151;as that would simply be impractical. The change to the Bill would be so massive, in terms of law reform, that it would be beyond its scope and kill it altogether. However, I ask the Minister whether she can give a fair wind to the notion that we will not simply warn common-law marriage couples that there is no such thing in law and that they had better get married if they want to. We should do what Canada and many other countries have done, which is to reform cohabitation law. I do not believe that that will undermine marriage in this country any more than it has done in other jurisdictions, such as Canada.
</p>

<a name="40510-44_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>Therefore, I support the spirit behind the part of the amendment which seeks to remove the difference of treatment. I fully understand that there are serious Treasury reasons why that would not be very welcome as it stands and, as I said, I recognise the practical problems. However, I believe that the difference of treatment cannot be justified on the simple argument that, in theory, a heterosexual couple can marry. It is a little like St Paul&#039;s terrible statement that it was better to marry than to burn. It seems to me that one should not be saying anything of that kind&#151;a civil registration&#151;should apply in this context.

<a name="40510-45_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Rendell of Babergh: </b>   In connection with the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, I believe that the consanguinity rules originally had <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC31"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC31</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

nothing at all to do with offspring but came into being because, in ancient times, the Roman Catholic Church believed that people who were already related would have their natural affections so increased by marriage as to exceed their love for God. I do not know whether that has any application to the Bill, but I think that it rather does away with the contention of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, that those rules came about in some way to prevent damaged offspring coming into being.
</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="40510-45_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   We have had a fascinating debate and I am very glad to enter into the fray. However, I should deal directly with one of the noble Lord&#039;s assertions that a large group of people is being disadvantaged and that large groups are generally disadvantaged. Of course, the largest group who are already advantaged by similar, if not identical, measures to those which we now seek to offer to same-sex couples are those who already enjoy the estate of marriage, and that is an incredibly large group in our country. Therefore, it is not that we seek to disadvantage large groups in general.
</p>

<a name="40510-45_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Perhaps I may deal, first, with Amendments Nos. 3 and 16. I have already made it clear that the Bill would not be open to opposite-sex couples as they already have the opportunity to gain a legal status for their relationship through marriage&#151;the matter already foreshadowed for me by the noble Lord, Lord Lester. It is true that, thereby, they are given a choice&#151;either to choose to marry and have the advantages and disadvantages that may flow from that or not to marry.
</p>

<a name="40510-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>I also accept what the noble Lord, Lord Lester, says&#151;that is, for some, that choice is muted because there is a reluctance by one partner to marry the other. As the noble Lord rightly said earlier, often it is the male partner who chooses not to invest in the female partner the rights which, by the nature of the relationship, she probably deserves. One has to grapple with that issue, not least because there is a failure to understand the distinction which is still drawn today between those who have entered the estate of marriage and those who remain resolutely outside it. To that end, the efforts of the Department for Constitutional Affairs are currently focused on demystifying that division.
</p>

<a name="40510-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>I also listened with great care to what was said about the need to consider cohabitation as an issue on its own, separate and apart from marriage and separate and apart from the issues with which we are dealing in the Bill. I shall certainly undertake&#151;if not later in Grand Committee, then on Report&#151;to give the House the more mature reflection of the Government in relation to how to respond to that issue. I think that I made clear both today and at Second Reading that these issues have percolated to the top of the discussions on a number of occasions. They are issues with which the Government have grappled and they will wish to continue to do so.

the issue of cohabitation and the implications for the social security system and so on. Therefore, when the noble Baroness says that the Government will grapple with those matters, I presume she means that we will debate them in due course.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="40510-45_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   We shall be debating them in due course in our deliberations on this Bill. However, what I mean, and have already said, is that I do not think that these issues can be dealt with adequately within the Bill because of their complexity and depth. We made very clear the regime that we are currently suggesting in relation to the tax consequences, and those are the issues that will be debated later. We tried to make it clear that those who enter into a civil partnership will be in a similar position to those who marry; and those who choose not to enter into a civil partnership will be in a similar position to opposite-sex couples who choose not to marry. I see that the noble Lord still looks mystified. I do not know whether I can help him further at a later stage.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="40510-45_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I am not mystified; I am merely saying that I do not believe one can take a view on the Bill unless one knows what the Government&#039;s views are on the social security implications.

<a name="40510-45_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   We shall be dealing with the social security issues, as the noble Lord has defined them, in the amendments. I know that he and my noble friend Lady Hollis are looking forward with some relish to discussing those issues in depth.

<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="40510-45_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I am very encouraged by the fact that the noble Baroness says that the door is ajar to further thoughts by the Government. When the Joint Committee on Human Rights comes to consider the Bill, we shall have to consider whether or not the difference of treatment between heterosexual and homosexual couples is objectively justifiable. Of course, through our committee the Government will, as always, give a fuller explanation of their case, which we shall evaluate.
</p>

<a name="40510-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>If there is any indication by the Government that they are open to long-term considerations of law reform in respect of cohabitation, personally I shall find that far more convincing than resting the whole case on what may be an illusory choice. Therefore, if the noble Baroness and her colleagues could think about whether the justification might be more broadly based than what is in the consultation paper, I do not think that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, need be troubled about this matter. I am not talking about social security, pensions or tax; I am talking about providing some basic legal protection for the basic rights of both sets of couples. I recognise that that cannot be achieved in the Bill. I hope that that is helpful.

<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="40510-45_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I shall certainly take fully into account what the noble Lord has said and, of course, as I have indicated, I shall try to give a fuller answer&#151;if not later in Committee then on Report. <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40510-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>As I believe I made clear, the Government recognise that some unmarried opposite-sex couples are under the mistaken impression that they have rights that they do not have. Some jurisdictions have adopted a deeming provision, which states that if a person lives with someone for x years, he or she is deemed to have assumed the rights. The indication is that the number of people who then marry is enhanced because they think that there is no point in not doing so in terms of avoiding responsibilities.

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>Those issues have been open to debate, and the misconceptions that currently abound in this regard have led to difficulties. For example, one partner may be left financially vulnerable after the breakdown of the relationship because the partners did not make any clear arrangements about ownership of property bought with joint funds.
</p>

<a name="40510-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>There is also the issue of serial relationships. How many relationships does one remain responsible for in the long term, bearing in mind, in particular, the increasing tendency for people to have serial relationships instead of one long-term relationship? As I indicated, colleagues in the Department for Constitutional Affairs are currently working with two voluntary services&#151;the Advice Services Alliance and One Plus One&#151;on a public awareness campaign to tackle that myth. The campaign will aim to clarify the legal position of unmarried couples as it currently stands and will suggest ways that unmarried cohabitants can protect themselves if things go wrong with their relationship.
</p>

<a name="40510-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>We debated at length the fact that the Bill is designed to meet a different problem&#151;that of same-sex couples. After consultation with family lawyers, it is our understanding that civil partnerships would be unlikely to help opposite-sex couples where one member of the couple was unwilling to marry the other&#151;not least because the rights and responsibilities in same-sex partnerships are similar, although not identical, to those entered into by married couples. Therefore, if people are unlikely to want to enter one, they are unlikely to want to enter a partnership. The noble Lord is right to identify the major problem&#151;that of shouldering the financial responsibilities that flow from marriage. Many people do not want to do that and therefore they do not get married.
</p>

<a name="40510-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>In addition, some opposite-sex couples have told us that they would wish to form a civil partnership because, for example, they already have a spouse who does not agree to a divorce or they fear losing a pension left to them by a deceased spouse. The Bill would not help those people either, and, in fact, similar duties and eligibility requirements would apply to civil partnerships as do to marriage. Civil partnerships would not therefore meet the needs of those couples. For those reasons, the Government do not believe that the new legal relationship of civil partnership is appropriate for opposite-sex couples.

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 64, which seeks to remove the requirement that the members of a couple must both be of the same sex at the time they entered into an overseas relationship in order to be treated as civil partners in the UK. I hope that I have explained the Government&#039;s position. This is reflected in Clause   156, which deals with the recognition of relationships formed overseas. We do not intend that overseas opposite-sex relationships should be recognised as civil partnerships. I hope that the noble Lord will feel comforted and able to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="40510-46_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   The noble Baroness is hopeful that I will be comforted and feel able to withdraw the amendment. She knows that I have no choice and therefore she can be comforted on that issue. She is absolutely right that my proposal that civil partnerships should be open to opposite-sex couples would not, in fact, be the greatest thing on earth. If partners in an opposite-sex couple did not wish to enter into a civil marriage, it is unlikely that they would enter into a civil partnership. Although the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has a point in that respect, I think that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said, it is not going to be the big issue.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>I was surprised that the noble Baroness said that my amendments would unduly complicate the Bill. I believe that that was the general gist of what she said. In my view, they would bring admirable simplicity and clarity to the Bill, but I think that that is really what she fears most.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>In the amendments, I am more concerned about those who do not have the choice of marriage than those who do. I refer to close family members, who have no opportunity to marry, whose commitment to each other is at least as great as that of any who would qualify under the Bill as drafted, and who would suffer similar disadvantage, hurt and discrimination as if they were not related in any way. I think that that group, which we typically describe as those in a parent and child relationship in old age, is most discriminated against. At present, they can perhaps shrug and say, &quot;Well, that&#039;s the way the world is&quot;. However, with the enactment of this Bill, I think that they will see another very small group being given preferential treatment. The argument is that these people cannot enter into a marriage contract and therefore we give them a way of obtaining the benefits of it, yet we do nothing for parents, children or siblings who care for each other. Although I shall withdraw the amendment today, as I am required to do, as the noble Baroness may suspect I shall be back to argue the case again.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>Of course I take the noble Baroness&#039;s point concerning Amendment No. 64, but I tabled it merely for the sake of consistency with the other amendments. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 4 stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Wilcox. To a considerable extent we have probably already covered some of the ground on this issue, because of the answer which the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, gave in response to the earlier debate on the situation of same-sex couples who are not involved in a sexual relationship. None the less, while one would not want to go into the tedious business of looking up dictionary definitions, it seems to me that there is some implication that &quot;sex&quot; is an active situation and &quot;gender&quot; is a relatively passive one. I do not know whether that is true. However, as, in any case, &quot;gender&quot; seems to be a politically correct expression nowadays, is it not more appropriate that that should be the term used here rather than &quot;sex&quot;, which appears in the Bill at present?
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I believe that much debate took place on this matter during deliberations on other Bills, which happily I was not involved in, and perhaps that experience will enable the noble Baroness to give us a fairly brief answer. However, as it stands, I would prefer the wording proposed in the amendment. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="40510-46_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   As my noble friend Lord Higgins said, he was not one of the campaigners on the earlier legislation concerning the words &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;gender&quot; and therefore he was not able to enjoy the debates that we had on the difference between the two. At the end, I came to the conclusion that the Government could not clearly define the difference between the two words, and they certainly did not like the definitions in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, where &quot;sex&quot; is essentially described as a physical concept whereas &quot;gender&quot; is a concept of the mind. &quot;Sex&quot; is what a biologist would call it; &quot;gender&quot; is what a sociologist would call it. I really do not like to see my noble friend putting himself in the sociologists&#039; camp as against the biologists&#039; camp, and therefore I do not have too much sympathy with him on this occasion. But I shall be fascinated to hear what the noble Baroness says.
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="40510-46_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I hope that my response can be brief. There really are sound legal reasons for using the term &quot;sex&quot; in this Bill. Almost without exception, existing legislation refers to &quot;sex&quot; rather than &quot;gender&quot;. There is one honourable exception, which I know the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, has firmly in his mind. It is the terminology traditionally used by legislation&#151;for example, in the Sex Discrimination Act, although there are many others&#151;to describe the characteristic of being male or female. It is also the approach taken in recent Bills&#151;namely, the Housing Bill and the domestic violence Bill, with which we are currently dealing and which make provision for same-sex couples.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>It has been pointed out that the Gender Recognition Bill, which was recently debated in this House, seems to be the one exception. The reason for that is relatively clear. In its report on the Bill, the Joint Committee on Human Rights noted that the law has always regarded the question of being male or female as one of sex and not gender. It was explained to the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC36"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC36</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

committee that the Gender Recognition Bill deals with issues arising from a person&#039;s gender identity, which concerns whether a person regards himself or herself as male or female. In that context, &quot;gender&quot; is the more appropriate term and it is the term preferred by individuals with gender dysphoria.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>In this Bill, we are dealing with couples of different sex or the same sex and therefore we do not believe that &quot;gender&quot; is the appropriate term to use. On this occasion, we delight to be with the biologists and with the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, in that &quot;sex&quot; is the clearer term and it is one that fits more easily into other legislation and, therefore, into this Bill, too.
</p>

&quot;(   )   which is subject to the Finance Act 2004&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_90"></a>The noble Lord said: This is an extremely important amendment. It will be apparent to Members of the Committee that, in a way, this is a peg on which to hang an extremely important argument. Nowadays, the Government seem able to do almost anything&#151;including abolishing the office of Lord Chancellor, or at least trying to do so&#151;in press releases. In relation to this Bill, the Inland Revenue issued a press release under the heading:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;Civil Partnership Bill: child & working tax credits, child benefit & guardians&#039; allowance&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>In the final paragraph, ahead of the &quot;Notes for Editors&quot;, the press release states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;The Civil Partnership Bill is social policy legislation, so any tax consequences will be dealt with in the first available Finance Bill&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-46_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>That seems to me to be a complete <i>non sequitur</i>. I do not believe that one follows from the other. In fact, one would have thought that, if it was social policy legislation, the tax consequences would be dealt with in this Bill.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>Also, the expression,


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;in the first available Finance Bill&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-46_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>is extraordinarily confusing and inappropriate. I am not in the least clear about it, and that is after years as a Treasury Minister and after decades as the chairman of the Treasury and Civil Service Committee in another place. I am not at all sure what those words mean. I presume that they mean the first Finance Bill in which it is possible for the Government to legislate on this subject. Of course, a Finance Bill is going through another place at present, and there is no reason at all why the opportunity should not be taken to spell out the financial provisions relating to this Bill.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>In an earlier debate, the noble Lord, Lord Alli, pointed out that it would not be appropriate for us to deal with financial matters. But I find it difficult to recall any piece of legislation where the tax and social security implications are not more important. To introduce this Bill without any clear indication of the proposed legislation so far as concerns the financial consequences really is a &quot;Hamlet without the prince&quot; <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC37"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC37</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

situation. Therefore, my first question to the noble Baroness is: will she give an undertaking that these matters will be dealt with in the Finance Act 2004? That was the purpose of the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>Having said that, there is now a long tradition, which I started back in 1972, of publishing draft clauses to Finance Bills if they concern complicated issues. It seems to me absolutely clear that, so far as concerns the financial implications of this Bill, those draft clauses should be available. Therefore, my second question to the noble Baroness is: are those draft clauses available? Does the Treasury have those draft clauses? If so, it seems to me to be essential that the Committee should see them before agreeing to the general provisions of the Bill. Having said that, it seems appropriate that they should be published as a draft&#151;as I say, that is a well-established Treasury procedure&#151;otherwise we will have no idea what the provisions really are on a whole range of issues.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>I think it is broadly clear from the press release what will be the changes in regard to the Tax Credits Act. We have debated time and again today the question of inheritance tax and we still have no idea of what will be the situation in regard to it. We have no idea to which groups it will extend if relief is indeed to be given. Perhaps the noble Baroness can tell us today&#151;we will need more detail later&#151;whether inheritance tax will apply to those covered by the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>As I pointed out earlier, what is involved is really a cash flow problem rather than an actual loss of revenue. The department has published an estimate that the cost would be &#163;1.3 billion if inheritance tax relief were given to those covered by the Bill. Is that &#163;1.3 billion the interest on losing the cash flow during that period, or is it some estimate of the absolute cost? I find it difficult to believe that it is the absolute cost, but no doubt the noble Baroness can clarify the matter.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>I have received various representations. For example, the Society of Conservative Lawyers points out that the situation with regard to fiscal matters as far as a married couple is concerned&#151;and so also, I imagine, as far as concerns those covered by the Bill&#151;is different in status from other legislation because it not only affects the two parties&#039; obligations as between themselves, it also affects their relationship with the taxman.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>Various bodies have expressed considerable concern. For example, the Tax Law Review Committee of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which is a highly reputable body, states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;Despite the introduction of independent income taxation in 1990, the tax system is neither neutral or consistent with respect to marital status&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-46_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>It continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;For some purposes it matters critically whether two people of opposite sex are married or not. For other purposes it is critical to know of a married couple whether they are &#039;living together&#039; or not. For yet other purposes it is critical to know of an unmarried couple whether they are &#039;living together as husband and wife&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-46_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>That very distinguished committee concluded,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;that the treatment of marriage overall in the tax system is confused&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC38"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC38</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-46_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>It is going to be more confused if we do not get the legislation right in the Bill; and even more confused if we have no idea what the Government intend to do.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>I was very worried by a statement made earlier by the noble Baroness in the context of tax and social security, which suggested they are still trying to work out the right approach. Perhaps she could tell us whether there are outstanding issues relating to the Treasury which a whole range of other government departments have not yet managed to resolve.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The Tax Law Review Committee, which is a non-party body, also expressed concern about the situation with regard to income tax and, in particular, tax credits, which, it points out, graft elements of the social security system into the income tax system. It is a key principle of social security law that &quot;couples living together as husband and wife&quot; are to be treated in exactly the same way as if they were married. But this is quite alien to tax law. Are we going to introduce that particular provision in relation to not only married couples, but to those covered by the Bill, and perpetuate the fact that the social security side of the issue&#151;the tax credit system&#151;is alien to tax law?
<a name="time_8"></a>
<a name="40510-46_time1"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40510-46_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>I have already covered the question of the likely costs of the inheritance tax situation&#151;at least to the extent of saying that we do not know the answer and look forward to seeing what is the position. There are further complications with regard to the extension of the surviving spouse exemption, and we are still not clear whether under the Bill one or other of the partners will be described legally as the &quot;spouse&quot;, a word which turns up in a number of places in tax law. The Minister seems to indicate dissent, suggesting that one or other of the partners&#151;I am not sure which one&#151;will not be described as the &quot;spouse&quot; so far as concerns tax law.
</p>

<a name="40510-46_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>These are not simple issues. We need to be clear about what the Government propose before we agree to the Bill going forward. Of course, as the noble Lord, Lord Alli, and others have pointed out, the basic principle of the Bill relates to the disadvantages that same-sex couples are said to have suffered as a result of not having a fixed, stable relationship. Nevertheless, the whole of the tax and social security aspect is extremely important and we cannot allow the Bill to go through without knowing what on earth the Government have in mind. I beg to move.

I hope the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will agree that it is very unusual to attempt to amend a Bill before it has reached the statute book on the basis of another Bill which also has not reached the statute book and is subject to debate.

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC39</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>The Finance Bill includes no references to civil partners at the moment. That is not surprising because we are debating the matter now and, as I explained at Second Reading, Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury tends not to foreshadow that which may become law, choosing instead to deal with matters only once they are law. One can see the sense in that because we do not know what the Bill will look like in the final analysis. If it looks like a Bill which would delight the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, it will not look anything like the Bill as currently drafted. It is therefore impossible to say what will or will not be included&#151;for instance, whether it will refer only to same-sex couples; whether it will refer to opposite sex couples and whether or not it will cross the bounds of consanguinity. Such issues would make a nonsense of the Finance Bill currently passing through Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40510-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>We have to look at the certainties, and I can certainly be clear about the Government&#039;s intentions. It is not correct to say that the Government&#039;s intentions regarding the fiscal consequences of the Civil Partnership Bill are not crystal clear, because we believe that they are. The Government have already announced that for all tax purposes the intention is to treat civil partners in the same way that married couples are treated. Nothing can be clearer than that.
</p>

<a name="40510-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>The Government have gone further, however, and clarified the tax consequences of the Civil Partnership Bill, which will be addressed and debated at the appropriate time in the first available Finance Bill. One knows that Finance Bills come round as regularly as good buses: if you miss the first one, you are assured that another one is coming right behind. The first bus might have left without the Bill, but the next one will be there in good time. So to insert a cross-reference in this year&#039;s Finance Bill would anticipate the outcome of the Civil Partnership Bill, something we need to avoid.
</p>

<a name="40510-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>In addition, it is likely that the Civil Partnership Bill we are currently debating will not come into force until about a year after Royal Assent. So there will be plenty of time for another Finance Bill to include provisions dealing with the tax consequences of the Civil Partnership Bill. I hope that the noble Lord will accept that that is as comprehensive an answer as I am able to give at this stage.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="40510-47_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Quite the contrary. I am now not the least bit clear that if the Bill passes through Parliament and receives Royal Assent, as intended, which will be the next available Finance Bill to incorporate the tax provisions. It seems clear from what the noble Baroness said that it will not be the one now going through the House&#151;although it is quite possible this Bill will be in fairly clear shape before then&#151;but I can understand that. In which case, the statement in the press release that it will be in the next available Finance Bill is simply wrong.
</p>

<a name="40510-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>The alternative is to say that it will be in the first Finance Bill after this Bill receives Royal Assent. That seemed at first to be what the noble Baroness was saying. But she then qualified it by saying that the Bill <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC40"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC40</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

was not coming into operation until somewhat later and another Finance Bill will be coming along. That also is not the next available Finance Bill. So presumably the Government are saying&#151;and ought to say&#151;that the provisions relating to the Bill that require fiscal legislation will be in the first Finance Bill after it receives Royal Assent. Is or is not that what the Minister is saying?
</p>

<a name="40510-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>The noble Baroness has totally failed to answer some of the important questions I raised. We need to know what the Government have in mind and whether, indeed, they know what they have in mind. The Minister seemed to imply earlier that they did not. We need to see some draft clauses. It is not unusual for the Treasury to produce draft clauses for debate, and it would enable the Committee and the House at subsequent stages of the Bill to have a precise, informed view.
</p>

<a name="40510-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>It is not, with respect, adequate to say, &quot;We will do exactly the same as with married couples&quot;. This is not simple legislation, and it will require detailed scrutiny in another place in due course. We need to know precisely what the Government have in mind before we agree to the Bill. We might be letting ourselves in for something quite unforeseen, and noble Lords could be asked to vote for it without knowing exactly what the Government have in mind. This is not a satisfactory situation. I again pose the question: do these draft clauses exist, or are we to understand that the Government are going ahead without producing any draft clauses in order to clear their minds in advance of putting forward the Bill? I hope the noble Baroness can answer these specific questions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="40510-47_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I can certainly tell the noble Lord that I do not have, and have not had, sight of any draft clause; neither would I expect to. I hoped that I had been crystal clear. There are direct fiscal consequences which currently exist as a result of entering the state of marriage. They include inheritance tax; fiscal arrangements; the benefits one gets from additional allowances; and the disadvantages involved in being treated as a couple as opposed to single individuals. The Committee will know that in various financial categories some consequences are beneficial and some are not.
</p>

<a name="40510-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>It is on that basis that I agreed with the statement made by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, that the Bill comes with a health warning. Those who believe it is all benefit and no responsibility are wrong. Just as with those who enter the state of marriage, there are rights, responsibilities and fiscal consequences. We propose that those who register as civil partners should have a similar distinction and the same rights, responsibilities and fiscal consequences as married couples. Those who choose not to register their relationships will have the same advantages and disadvantages as those who have chosen not to join with a partner in a recognised relationship. That is the way it will be divided.

<a name="40510-47_para8"></a>

anomalies and so on. However, we do not seek to resolve those difficulties through the Bill. There will be no difference between the tax relationship for those entering a partnership. They will not be spouses, because it will not be a marriage. The rules will relate to &quot;civil partners&quot; or &quot;spouses&quot;, not simply to &quot;spouses&quot;. There is no way in which civil partners could ever be described as &quot;spouses&quot; because they would not be in marriages.

<a name="40510-47_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to confirm that the timetable runs something like this: that the clauses cannot be put into a Finance Bill until after the Civil Partnership Bill has received Royal Assent; and that the Civil Partnership Act, as it will then be, cannot be brought into force until the tax changes are made. Therefore, while this rules out any possibility of bringing the Bill into force in 2004, or the tax year 2004&#150;05, it should be possible to bring it into force half-way through the tax year 2005&#150;06. Can the noble Baroness confirm that when the Finance Act 2005 is passed&#151;assuming, of course, that the present Government are responsible for that Act&#151; the provisions will be drafted in such a way that, if the Civil Partnership Bill is brought into force in, say, October 2005, it will then be possible for one partner to transfer assets to the other partner and claim the capital gains tax exemption for any transfers made after the date of the civil partnership registration but before the end of the tax year 2005&#150;06?

All the tax changes will be made by the time of implementation. We anticipate that the Act will take about a year to implement after Royal Assent.

The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has put forward a reasonable scenario, but if the press release means anything at all, and if it does not refer to the finance Bill now going through the House, it must surely mean the first finance Bill after this Bill receives Royal Assent. Is that the case?
</p>

<a name="40510-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>The noble Baroness also said that the expression &quot;spouse&quot; will not be used in relation to the Bill, but she said that the provisions in the finance Bill will mirror exactly, as I understand it, the provisions which already exist on the statute book in relation to marriage.

<a name="40510-47_para11"></a>

legislation receiving Royal Assent but years before that. When I first introduced draft legislation on value added tax, it was published a full year before so that bodies such as the one to which I have referred, the tax committee of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, and so forth, could look at it and point out to the Government what changes were necessary.

<a name="40510-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>It is extraordinary if the Treasury has not yet drafted these clauses. The matter needs careful scrutiny because one knows only too well from finance Acts that very often something emerges in the course of discussion, either on draft legislation or actual legislation, where problems arise which had not been foreseen. I hope very much that the Minister will be able to clear up those extra one or two points. Will it be in the first finance Bill after this Bill receives Royal Assent? If not, what on earth does the press release mean?

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>Part 1 is a helpful introduction to the Civil Partnership Bill. It has the effect of easing us into the slightly daunting 195 clauses which lie beyond Clause   1. That clause sets out the categories into which the provisions regarding civil partnerships are divided&#151;namely, England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and outside the UK. My amendment seeks to leave out this division of provisions for countries.

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>Clearly it is not my intention to leave these categories out of the Bill completely. At this stage this is a probing amendment but, in tabling it, my noble friend Lord Higgins and I are asking the Government why it is necessary to have different provisions for each of the categories outlined in Clause 1, and exactly how different are they. Is it the case that only the language used is different&#151;for example, to cover the different legal systems in Scotland and Northern Ireland&#151;or are there substantial differences of which we should be made aware? If that is the case, can the Minister explain why that should be?
</p>

<a name="40510-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>In a Bill of this size it is not always easy to spot the differences between provisions, especially as we on these Benches do not have the luxury of an army of excellent civil servants and legal advisers at our disposal. As I said at Second Reading, the devil in a Bill such as this is always in the detail and I am taking this opportunity to ask the Government exactly what is meant by these provisions. I look forward to receiving clarification. I beg to move.

<a name="40510-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>As I see it, the purpose of the amendment is to remove the different registration procedures in the devolved administrations. It would also appear to remove the ability of same-sex couples to register as civil partners at British Consulates, or for Armed Forces personnel to register.
</p>

<a name="40510-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Under Clause 1, two people who are eligible to do so would be able to register as the civil partner of each other in either England or Wales, in Scotland or in Northern Ireland under the relevant part of the Bill. This ensures a coherent system across the United Kingdom while respecting the different legal jurisdictions in the different parts of the United Kingdom. I hope that answers one of the noble Baroness&#039;s questions. We are seeking a coherent system across the United Kingdom.
</p>

<a name="40510-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>In addition, under provisions to be made by Order in Council, eligible same-sex couples would be able to form a civil partnership outside the United Kingdom in certain circumstances similar to those where marriage is available. This facility would be available at British consulates and for Armed Forces personnel serving abroad.
</p>

<a name="40510-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>If noble Lords are seeking to reduce a civil partnership to a contract, it may be that they do not accept that the formation of the new legal relationship of civil partnership should take place when same-sex couples register as the civil partners of each other in accordance with the procedures set out in the Bill. However, I hope that point was explained in the debate on an earlier amendment. The Government see civil partnership as a new form of legal relationship, which is brought into being by partners registering.
</p>

<a name="40510-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>The laws and practices of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are different in many areas of family law, as the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, said. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC44"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC44</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

They each have their own statutory provisions. There are also different practices in registration procedures in the devolved regions when important life events are recorded. By acknowledging these different procedures the Bill seeks to respect the distinct legal systems and practices and to accommodate the diversity and character of the devolved administrations. The sub-paragraphs are an essential part of the description of how a civil partnership is formed and are linked to the parts of the Bill containing the registration procedures. For the reasons I have explained, we are not able to agree with the amendment and I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw it.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>The noble Baroness said: The principle behind the amendment is to remove reference to Northern Ireland from the Bill. It is not intended to undermine the amendment of my noble friend Lady Wilcox, which was a probing amendment. This is something quite different.
</p>

<a name="40510-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Let us be under no misapprehension: there is no way that the Civil Partnership Bill would ever get through the Northern Ireland Assembly. In Northern Ireland, the level of objection to gay marriage would be overwhelming. I think the majority of people in Britain would oppose the Bill if they knew what it was about; in Northern Ireland the opposition would be almost universal&#151;and yet the Bill seeks to impose civil partnerships on the Province.
</p>

<a name="40510-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>We all know that Northern Ireland has a very different religious and political culture. Family life is very strong in the Province and divorce rates are much lower than on the &quot;mainland&quot;, a term I use advisedly because it is how the people of Northern Ireland refer to England, Scotland and Wales when they are speaking of Great Britain. On the mainland, many of the hard cases amongst platonic relationships arise as a result of family breakdown. There is much less of that in Northern Ireland. As a matter of fact, there are very few homosexuals. A recent census found that there were only 288 same-sex couple households in the whole of the Province. The reference for that is the <i>Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Online-Census 2001</i>. As if we did not know for other reasons, this simply shows that the situation is very different there.
</p>

<a name="40510-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Above all, we cannot be seen to be riding roughshod over the wishes of the electorate of Northern Ireland. It would be a constitutional outrage for the Bill to impose civil partnerships upon them.

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>In June 2003, the Government published a consultation paper announcing plans to introduce civil partnerships in England and Wales. In that paper, the Government stated that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;no decision has yet been taken as to whether a parallel civil partnership registration scheme might be introduced in Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-48_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>On 19 December 2003, five months later, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ian Pearson, launched a consultation on civil partnerships in the Province. The closing date for submissions was 5 March 2004.
</p>

<a name="40510-48_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>One would hope that a two-month consultation from 19 December to 5 March would elicit a good number of responses from members of the public and interested parties. One would also hope that the Government would take adequate time to consider such responses. However, on 30 March, only 25 days after the consultation closed and before any report had been produced, this Bill was printed. It came complete with at least 49 clauses and three schedules applying civil partnerships&#151;in full&#151;to the Province.
</p>

<a name="40510-48_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>The England and Wales consultation closed on 30   September 2003. Six months passed before the Bill was published, yet consideration of the opinions of members of the public in Northern Ireland apparently took only days.
</p>

<a name="40510-48_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>In answer to a Written Question, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;All responses have been examined carefully and the points made, both points of principle and detailed comments, have been properly taken into account&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 27/4/04; col. 918W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-48_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>Such detailed consideration simply cannot be possible in such a timeframe. Will the Minister tell the Committee what was said in the responses to the   consultation and how many were made? The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State promised a report on the consultation in early May. I know that today is 10 May, but when is early May? When is it likely to happen?
</p>

<a name="40510-48_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>As we all know, the Northern Ireland Assembly is, sadly, currently suspended. The Government are therefore exercising all its functions. Could it be that the Government are trying to get gay marriage on the statute book in Northern Ireland before the Assembly reconvenes because they know that the Assembly would not support it? The opinions of those in Northern Ireland are being bypassed, and it is clear that we should not extend civil partnerships to Northern Ireland in this Bill. The Government should let the elected Assembly debate the merits of civil partnerships in due course. I beg to move.

<a name="40510-49_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, that I understand entirely why she says that there is a difference in terms of Northern Ireland. We need to be clear that the effect of this amendment would be to prevent the formation of civil partnerships in Northern Ireland and that it would therefore be the one part of the United Kingdom where parity of treatment did not prevail. When the Government consulted on this issue in Northern Ireland, we made clear our views that considerations of fairness and social justice applied just as much to same-sex couples in Northern Ireland as elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<a name="40510-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I hear what the noble Baroness said about the numbers of homosexual couples or individuals who have chosen to declare themselves. If one were to have asked a similar question in England, Wales, or Scotland a few years ago, one might have found similar low numbers of homosexual couples apparently resident in England, Wales and Scotland. We know that that would have not been the correct case. Simply because of the prejudice and disadvantage, many fear to disclose their sexual orientation.
</p>

<a name="40510-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>The consultation in Northern Ireland generated a considerable response. The majority of responses from individuals were opposed to the introduction of civil partnerships but, on the other hand, most groups or organisations who responded&#151;including the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission&#151;were supportive for the reasons set out in the consultation paper. I understand that the analysis of the responses, which has just been published, will inform noble Lords and others of the detail of that.
</p>

<a name="40510-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>The Government have considered carefully the responses received, both the numerical balance and the   arguments made. Ultimately, we have decided that the reasons why this proposal was put forward in the first place still hold good. We remain convinced of the strong equality and social justice imperatives behind this proposal. No matter what size the population, we have come to the conclusion that fairness and social justice are demanded by each individual and group of individuals, no matter what their size or number.
</p>

<a name="40510-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>There are also strong practical and administrative reasons for ensuring that comparable schemes would be established in each of the three jurisdictions, to ensure that a comprehensive package of rights and responsibilities would be available to civil partners wherever the civil partnership was formed. There are issues of inequality and social justice that affect everyone across the United Kingdom. Our preference is for co-ordinated schemes benefiting everyone in a comprehensive way.
</p>

<a name="40510-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>I hope that Members of the Committee would agree that it would be invidious if some of the rights and responsibilities attaching to civil partnership were removed from some couples on the basis that they had, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC47"></a>

for whatever reason, moved from England and Wales or Scotland to Northern Ireland. If there were no civil partnership in Northern Ireland, same-sex couples from Northern Ireland would have to travel to England, Wales or Scotland to register as civil partners of each other. That would present obvious disadvantages to those on lower incomes and with disabilities.
</p>

<a name="40510-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Furthermore, civil partners returning to Northern Ireland would be subject only to the rights and responsibilities falling within the reserved or excepted field, such as immigration rights. Rights and responsibilities in transferred areas such as inheritance and intestacy would not be extended to them. I hope that Members of the Committee agree that that would be grossly unfair.
</p>

<a name="40510-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>A theme that has run very strongly in Northern Ireland is the desire to have parity of treatment and equal rights and responsibilities. We think that an exception should not be made in the area, and I ask the noble Baroness not only to withdraw the amendment, as she must today, but to consider that it would be right not to bring it back on Report.

</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="40510-49_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I listened carefully to what the Minister said. I was not entirely clear to which document she referred that had only just been published. Is it the response to the consultation, or the consultation document itself? I was also rather puzzled by what she said about the situation if, supposing the provisions did not come into force in Northern Ireland, an individual came to the UK and then returned to Northern Ireland. Would he or she not be in the same position as someone who otherwise has an overseas civil partnership? I am not clear on that, but it is a difficult area and I am not at all familiar with the law on it.

<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="40510-49_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   The report to which I referred is the report that analyses the responses made to the Northern Ireland consultation. We have been waiting for it for a little while, so I am very pleased that I am able to say that it has been published. It will be put in the Library, but I thought that, as a matter of courtesy, the Members who have participated in this Committee might like to receive a copy directly. Therefore, we have undertaken to send a copy to each of them.

<a name="40510-49_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>In terms of support, I referred to the ability of those whose country of residence is Northern Ireland to take advantage of the fiscal and other opportunities that the Bill gives. Members of the Committee will know that, within England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, there is an arrangement in relation to how benefits are paid and what one can draw and not draw. That is relatively easily done when the system is well <br>&nbsp;<br>

co-ordinated. It would be difficult if a recognised civil partnership system in England, Wales and Scotland, operating in the context of those three separate administrations, enabled a person to claim benefits and advantages as a full partner, but if those benefits were not made available to him or her when residing in Northern Ireland. For example, if someone were to leave Northern Ireland in order to enter into a registered partnership in England, Wales or Scotland and then go back to Northern Ireland, where there would not be a similar recognition of that status, the benefits that would attach to partnership would not attach in Northern Ireland. That would not be fair or just.

</p>

<a name="40510-49_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>The Minister has had a considerable benefit in responding to the amendment. She has seen the document. I am operating in the dark.

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="40510-49_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   A policy decision has in effect been made as a result of the consultation on whether to exempt Northern Ireland. The policy decision is that all British citizens have to be treated equally in this way. For reasons of social justice, we simply did not feel that it was possible or proper to exclude Northern Ireland from an opportunity that we were giving to the rest of the United Kingdom. The noble Baroness will know the particular sensitivities that flow both ways about difference of treatment and the sensitivity that surrounds our response. We have taken the decision, for reasons of equality and social justice, that we could not, in all conscience, maintain a distinction.
</p>

<a name="40510-49_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>We understand the sentiments that the noble Baroness has expressed. We understand why she said that the situation in Northern Ireland is different from that which prevails in England, Wales or Scotland, but it is right to remind your Lordships that there is 83 per support for the Bill in England and Wales right across the board. Eighty four per cent of individuals supported it and 74 per cent of organisations. Only 17   per cent did not support it or did not express an opinion. There is whole-hearted support for what the Government are doing right across the board in England, Scotland and Wales. We understand that Northern Ireland may fall into a different category, but, as a policy consideration, we have come to the conclusion that it would not be fair, just or proper to treat those who want a same-sex relationship in Northern Ireland differently from those who want that relationship in England, Wales or Scotland. This is, after all, still a United Kingdom.

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>I wonder where the Northern Ireland Assembly fits into all of this. Although the Minister said that the Northern Irish people should not be deprived of the opportunity, I am quite convinced that it would not be regarded as an opportunity in Northern Ireland. This looks as though again it is the mainland riding roughshod over Northern Ireland&#151;a sensitive issue at a sensitive time when the Assembly is suspended. And there is the importance of dealing with Northern Ireland with kid gloves&#151;I have railed against that on occasions, too&#151;but we have bent over backwards in order to try to defuse trouble. I fear that this is yet another of those situations.
</p>

<a name="40510-49_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said that above all there is a desire to have parity of treatment. It is the desire of us in Westminster to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland have parity of treatment, irrespective of whether they want it or not. After all, the Bill is a fundamental rewriting of family law. For example, we have never sought to impose English divorce law on Northern Ireland. It has its own laws which reflect differences in culture and the strong religious faith. Why must we insist that they accept English&#151;Westminster and London&#151;ideas about how to deal with homosexual partnerships?
</p>

<a name="40510-49_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>I am sorry if this offends the noble Lord, Lord   Goodhart, but homosexual practice is much less acceptable in Northern Ireland. That is a fact. One can say that that is narrow-minded, bigoted, unfair, uncaring and all of those things, but that is a fact. We must not impose English civil partnership legislation, particularly while the Assembly is suspended. I know there is nothing I can do about this now&#151;anyway, I probably have absolutely no support&#151;but in withdrawing the amendment I give the Minister notice that I shall return to it.

<a name="40510-50_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Wilcox </b>   moved Amendment No. 8:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>Page 1, line 16, leave out subsection (2).</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a small point and I shall not hold the Committee up for long with a long explanation as to why we have tabled the amendment. Clause 1 is an introduction to the whole idea of civil partnerships. It is a summary&#151;an overview. Subsection (2) states that all civil partnerships, no matter where they are formed&#151;England, Wales or Scotland&#151;can be void under the Act in the ways stated. Our amendment would leave out subsection (2).
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>We do recognise the ways in which a civil partnership can be declared void, but we have tabled this amendment as a drafting point. It seems to me that in a generally well-drafted and articulate Bill, subsection (2) of Clause 1 is somewhat out of place. It does not really even seem to make sense until you have read it several times&#151;and I say that as a founder of the Plain English Campaign. Can the Minister confirm that this is the drafting which will appear in the Act? <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC50"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC50</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Or might she take the amendment, as it is intended, and ask the draftsmen very kindly to have another look at subsection (2) with a view to making it more understandable for all of those who will, in years to come, be using the Act? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="40510-50_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I apologise if the noble Baroness found the provision difficult. It was hoped that the meaning of subsection (2) was relatively clear, but I accept immediately that clarity to a lawyer seems always to be so opaque to those who are not burdened with constant interpretation&#151;or so it has come to appear to me since I joined this House.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>The amendment would remove from the Bill the idea that a civil partnership can be void. I do not believe that that is what the noble Baroness intends&#151;she is worried only about the wording. It was hoped that in the way in which the subsection is constructed&#151;I shall certainly go back to the draftsmen&#151;it would be crystal clear that we are introducing three ways in which you can get out of a civil partnership. They are on death, or on dissolution or on annulment.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>If the registration is void for a specific reason&#151;for example, if two people enter into a registration of a partnership and at the time of that entry one of them is still married, or within the bounds of consanguinity, and should not have entered into the partnership&#151;that would not be a voidable partnership. It would be void <i>ab initio</i>&#151;it would have been void right from the beginning. It would be null. If we look at the basis on which we are setting out the procedure to get out of these registration partnerships, it would usually take two years to bring it to an end, whereas if it were void from the beginning the partners would be entitled to want to set it aside.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>Therefore, the wording is hoped to be short and succinct in paragraph 2, because subsection (1) is subject to the provisions of this Bill, under or by virtue of which a civil partnership is void. Subsequently, we go on to deal with the provisions that would make a partnership void. Paragraph 3&#151;if your Lordships look at it&#151;sets out the same basis; death, dissolution, or annulment. In the later sections we clarify each of those.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>If the intent of the noble Baroness is not to remove the ability to invalidate a registration and express it as being void, we can look again. I fear that I will be told that the drafting is as precise and as succinct as we can make it, and that if you look at the rest of the Bill, it becomes explicable. I do not know whether that helps the noble Baroness. I am happy to explain as we go along what will make it void, voidable, or subject to dissolution, and the consequences that flow from that. I regret to tell your Lordships that for a family lawyer, I am afraid that these phrases would be all too familiar.

<a name="40510-50_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Wilcox: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness. For the lawyers, it is all perfectly clear.

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>I remember when I was chairman of the National Consumer Council, and we did some work on access to justice. Out of that flowed a lot of awfully good work. Now that the Minister has explained it to me&#151;absolutely wonderful. However, if I had to pay her to explain it to me, it would have cost me a great deal of money. For the moment, I will withdraw the amendment, but I am grateful that she will go back to check whether it can be made a bit clearer. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="40510-50_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Wilcox </b>   moved Amendment No. 9:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>Page 1, line 18, leave out &quot;, dissolution or annulment&quot; and insert &quot;or dissolution&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_117"></a>The noble Baroness said: I rise to speak to Amendment No. 9, and with the leave of the Committee, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 47 and 48. We touched on the first amendment and the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, had a discussion. The Minister did go some way to explaining the position. If noble Lords would be patient, I would prefer to read out exactly what I have written down. I am not sure that I understood what she was saying, or how much it answered my question.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>It is a probing group of amendments. We are still in the introductory stages of the Bill, and I wanted to raise the point about the ending of a civil partnership early on, to be clear in my own mind what exactly this entails.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>Amendment No. 9 relates to Clause 1(3), which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;A civil partnership ends only on death, dissolution or annulment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40510-50_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>My amendment would leave out one of the processes of bringing a civil partnership to an end; namely, annulment. It is annulment with which our amendments are concerned. Amendment No. 47 would leave out the paragraph in Clause 36 which allows the court to make an order which annuls a civil partnership. Amendment No. 48 would leave out the subsection in that clause which deals with the time when a civil partnership will cease to exist due to nullity.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>Clause 48 deals with the grounds on which a civil partnership will be held to be void. Annulment for civil partnerships seems a rather puzzling idea to me. For example, it is a commonly held belief that a marriage will be annulled when it has not been consummated. I cannot believe that that is to be the case for civil partnerships. It does not seem likely and, from reading the Bill, it would seem that some procedural irregularity would need to occur in order for it to happen. However, I felt that we needed to make the point that it seemed unlikely that such an irregularity would occur, given the very detailed process through which two prospective civil partners have to go before <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC52"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC52</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

achieving civil partnership status. Is it really necessary to have the two separate categories of dissolution and annulment? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="40510-50_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I certainly now understand why the noble Baroness tabled these probing amendments. I say to her straightaway that it is not only lack of consummation that can bring a nullity order; there can be all sorts of additional examples, such as a person marrying under the age of 16 or masquerading as a different gender. There are all sorts of issues that would mean that, right from the beginning, the relationship&#151;whether a marriage or a partnership&#151;could not have been valid in law. That is why the provisions on nullity remain.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Amendment No. 9 would remove the statement that a civil partnership may be annulled. Amendment No.   47 to Clause 36 would remove the power of the court to make a nullity order, and Amendment No. 48 to Clause 36 would remove the description of the effect of a nullity order in cases where a civil partnership is voidable. It is quite important to retain those provisions because of the Bill&#039;s complexity. We thought it necessary to emphasise how serious the relationships were; they cannot be entered into lightly and they cannot be dissolved or removed lightly.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>Clause 36(3) provides that a nullity order made in respect of a civil partnership which is voidable annuls the civil partnership only for any period after the order is made final. The civil partnership is to be treated as though it had existed up to that date. Clause 48 sets out the grounds on which a civil partnership would be void, and therefore invalid, under the law of England and Wales, and Clause 49 sets out the grounds on which a civil partnership would be voidable.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>I should make clear the difference between &quot;void&quot; and &quot;voidability&quot;. Something void never had any value from the beginning&#151;it could not have happened. Something voidable can be declared not to be void at the instance of one person. Those concepts have sat in our law for a very long time. One is void from the beginning&#151;what we would call void <i>ab   initio</i>&#151;and was never valid; the other can be challenged and found not to be valid and therefore voidable.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>The provisions provide that a civil partnership would be void where the fundamental eligibility requirements were not met. The examples that I have given apply. Other examples would be where the couple were not of the same sex, where one of them already had a civil partner, or where a serious procedural breach had occurred, such as where the due notice of proposed civil partnership had not been given. The problems would be where some fundamental breach had been made.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The civil partnership will also be void if certain formal requirements are not complied with. These are the failure to provide the required notice, the civil partnership document not being duly issued or having expired, the place of registration not being the place specified in the notice and the civil partnership document, or a civil partnership registrar not being present at the registration.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC53"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC53</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40510-50_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>In addition, the civil partnership of a person under the age of 18 will be void if the civil partnership document was void by reason of its issue having been forbidden by a person whose consent is required for the child to form a civil partnership. So, if your 16   year-old asks, &quot;Can I enter into this partnership?&quot; and you say &quot;No&quot;, and then by some strategy they manage to get themselves before the registrar and enter into it, it is void and will not be recognised.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>It is important that civil partnerships should be void where there are severe irregularities. An example of that is where one of the civil partners is already registered as a civil partner of another person or is already married. In such a case, it would be wrong to require the other civil partner to apply for an order for dissolution as the civil partnership was never validly in existence. There is a clear difference between a civil partnership that was in existence and subsequently broke down, for which dissolution is appropriate, and a civil partnership that never legally existed.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>Removing the provisions for voiding a civil partnership would have very serious repercussions for the whole Bill. It would require a civil partnership, formed in breach of the key eligibility criteria and registration requirements, to be treated as if it were valid. We do not think that that can possibly be right.
</p>

<a name="40510-50_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>Civil partnership is a serious and significant legal relationship. There are some conditions on eligibility and procedure that the state regards as essential to prevent abuse. Where one of those is breached the consequence should be that the civil partnership is void.

</p>

<a name="40510-50_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>I hope that I have said enough to explain why a nullity order provides protection for civil partners and matches the protection available to married people where there are major legal irregularities. To remove the provisions for nullity would significantly and unnecessarily reduce the protection available to civil partners introducing a difference between them and spouses for which we can see no real justification. With that explanation, I hope that the noble Baroness will be enlightened a little.

</p>




<p><a name="st_121"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 11 is grouped with Amendments Nos. 12 to 14 and Clause   6 stand part. The purpose of the amendments is to replace the register office ceremony.
</p>

<a name="40510-51_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>At Second Reading I pointed out the many similarities between civil partnership and marriage. If this Bill is not gay marriage, which is what the Government claim, I cannot see any logical reason for the Bill to imitate the civil marriage ceremony. I cannot see why the Government would be attached to this method of formation. Presumably, they cannot object to a different but equally secure mode of registering civil partnerships.
</p>

<a name="40510-51_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The registration ceremony is one of the obvious ways in which civil partnership imitates civil marriage. The parties must sign the register at the register office in the presence of two witnesses and the registrar. That is identical to civil marriage. Any person sitting outside a register office for a few hours would see heterosexual and homosexual couples coming and going. He would know that they had stood before the registrar with their witnesses; he would know that they had all signed the register and he would see them coming out wreathed in smiles. He would conclude, not unreasonably, that the heterosexual and homosexual couples alike were married.
</p>

<a name="40510-51_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>Many married people will be deeply offended that the civil marriage ceremony is to be adopted in the formation of civil partnerships. I have had a large postbag to that effect. Many people feel that marriage is marriage and civil partnerships are civil partnerships and ne&#039;er the twain should be mixed up. As I said at Second Reading, it is wrong to create a parody of marriage for homosexuals, particularly as the Government maintain that this civil partnership is not a marriage.
</p>

<a name="40510-51_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>There is an additional argument. I have argued, along with others, that civil partnership should be open to a much wider range of people. I dealt with this in my first group of amendments. In order to open up civil partnership to those in non-sexual relationships or relationships not necessarily of the same sex, we must remove the similarities with marriage. It is obvious that two sisters would feel uncomfortable going through a kind of marriage ceremony in order to get legal recognition for their co-dependent relationship. Two friends would not want to have to stand before a registrar to obtain the benefits contained in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40510-51_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>My amendments simply replace the register office event in Clause 3. Instead, the couples involved would require formalities comparable to those necessary to obtain an enduring power of attorney. Those formalities would still be adequate to tackle fraud. Written consent would need to be obtained from the registrar in advance. That would provide the opportunity to verify the application.
</p>

<a name="40510-51_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The parties would then need to sign the civil partnership document and have it witnessed by a commissioner for oaths. That is an exercise with which people who have been involved in legal proceedings may be familiar. The next step would be to post the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC55"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC55</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

completed form to the registrar. Only when the couple receive notification that the document is registered is the partnership formed. These are sensible amendments. I hope that the Minister will be willing to give consideration to them. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="40510-51_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   The purpose of these amendments is to alter the role of the civil partnership registrar and the registration service in the formation of civil partnerships.
</p>

<a name="40510-51_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>The amendments are at odds with the approach to civil partnership registration taken by the Bill. They replace the role of civil partnership registrars in the statutory steps of formation with commissioners for oaths, who will merely witness the signature of a document signed by the couple. The role of the civil partnership registrar would be reduced to providing a written consent for a couple to sign a civil partnership document in front of a commissioner for oaths and to countersigning the civil partnership document once the couple and the commissioner for oaths had signed it.
</p>

<a name="40510-51_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>In the Government&#039;s view, civil partnership is a legal relationship, which is formed when two people register as civil partners of each other. It is that simple but solemn procedure which brings the civil partnership into being. By taking the step of forming a civil partnership the couple will gain rights and undertake the responsibilities to which we referred in our earlier discussions, which are set out by law and are not chosen by agreement between them. We do not see this relationship as based on a contract. Accordingly, it is not appropriate for the formation of a civil partnership to take place with only a commissioner for oaths as a witness.
</p>

<a name="40510-51_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>The amendments may assume that a civil partnership registrar does little more than witness the signing of the civil partnership document. This is not the case. It is likely that civil partnership registrars will be designated from existing registration staff and they are therefore likely to have considerable experience in dealing with couples at such a significant time in their lives. They will also be in a position to give the signing of the civil partnership document the same degree of solemnity, significance and importance that is associated with other significant life events, such as civil marriage.
</p>

<a name="40510-51_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>In this way, they will contribute to the cultural and social change expected with the introduction of the civil partnership. They will have the knowledge and training to be able to check on the day whether the couple still meet the eligibility requirements for registering as civil partners of each other. And there may be up to 12 months between the giving of notice of a proposed civil partnership and the signing of the civil partnership document. They will have the experience, as registrars, to be able to deal with any issues which may have arisen during that period in relation to eligibility. I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<a name="40510-51_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>In response to the wider clause stand part debate, Clause 6 sets out several provisions relating to the place at which two people may register as civil partners of each other. I use this opportunity to stress that civil partnership is a registration that is a purely secular process. The couple registering as civil partners of each other will have to take the statutory steps set out in the Bill. Their partnership is formed when they sign the civil partnership document in the presence of a civil partnership registrar and witnesses. It is not appropriate to have this secular registration process take place in religious premises, as has been suggested.
</p>

<a name="40510-51_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>For registration of a civil partnership under the standard procedure, the venue chosen by the proposed civil partners must be agreed with the registration authority in which it is located. Once agreed, it must be specified in the notice of civil partnership. If it has not been agreed, the notice will be void.
</p>

<a name="40510-51_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>In that way, the registration authority will maintain full control over the exact place of registration. This will help to ensure that the health and safety of its officers is not threatened by attending potentially dangerous places. The place must also be open to any person wishing to attend the registration, and therefore it must be public. That will enable objections to the proposed civil partnership to be raised by any person wishing to do so. I beg to move that Clause 6 stand part of the Bill.

Health and safety is now the reason that there is almost nothing you can do. I think that sooner or later our children will conceive that a little creature&#151;&quot;elf and safety&quot;&#151;comes out of the woods to prohibit things. It was quite the most remarkable reason for putting down my noble friend&#039;s amendment that I have ever heard.

<a name="40510-51_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>It seems to me that what she said was eminently sensible. Indeed, as she spoke, it occurred to me that the Bill might have been better if the Government had bundled the provisions for civil marriage into civil partnership and abolished civil marriage because the distinctions between the two have almost completely faded away and people may conclude that there will now be only one genuine article of marriage&#151;that is, one which is properly conducted within a church. That might not be a bad thing. They might just as well have bundled civil marriage into civil partnership and said, &quot;Heave it all in; no difference. It is not a contract or anything like that, just an arrangement for loving couples, so here we go&quot;. If the Government are not going to go as far as that&#151;I fancy that they would be slightly embarrassed to do so&#151;they should give careful consideration to the amendment proposed by my noble friend.

<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="40510-52_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   I thank the Minister, who gave us a little levity. As my noble friend said, the atmosphere in this room is ghastly. I have discovered that there is more than one person with a blinding headache. Although this is &quot;off the record&quot;, I hope that for the next session of Grand Committee something can be done about the air in this room. One has only to go out for two seconds to realise just how appalling it is. I have the most terrible headache. However, I thank the noble Baroness, who is full of life&#151;I do not know how; the rest of us are dying on our feet.
</p>

<a name="40510-52_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>The Minister opened her rebuttal of my amendments by saying that they would alter the role of civil partnership. Of course they would. Why else would I table the amendments? She said that they are at odds with the Bill. Of course they are, otherwise I would not have moved them. Then the whole argument rested on the fact that there is a registrar who has a job to do. I shall not bring up the &quot;elf and safety&quot;, but the Minister said that the registrar is experienced in all these issues. I draw the attention of the Grand Committee to the fact that the registrar is experienced in the registration of civil marriages, not in the registration of civil partnerships. The problem is that, the closer we get to the nuts and bolts of this in Grand Committee, the more we realise that the two phrases, &quot;civil partnerships&quot; and &quot;civil marriages&quot; are utterly interchangeable.
</p>

<a name="40510-52_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>So, what is wrong with the registrar having to have a new set of rules to deal with civil partnerships along the lines contained in my amendment? The noble Baroness says that it is a legal relationship and therefore it has to have a simple but solemn procedure. Indeed, it is also important that the rights and responsibilities involved in it should be undertaken seriously. That is precisely what happens with an enduring power of attorney, to which I referred.
</p>

<a name="40510-52_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>The Minister said that it is also important&#151;this made me smile&#151;that the witnesses and not just the registrar should be there looking at the signing and the solemnity, as in a civil marriage. That came right from the mouth of the noble Baroness. But do we not realise that many civil marriages have witnesses who are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC58"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

literally taken in from the street? They are asked to, &quot;come and witness our civil marriage&quot;. Many celebrities, or so-called celebrities, have done that. I know of two couples who decided that they were going to get married. They did not want their friends to know exactly when they were to be married. They went to the registry office and pulled in two guys from the street as witnesses. I do not think that the witnesses of civil marriages are aware of their solemn duty and responsibility. It is not exactly like godparents at a baptism.
</p>

<a name="40510-52_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>I did not get the point about eligibility; that the eligibility requirements can be checked on the day. I wonder whether they can be. The noble Baroness put in another complication. One could make one&#039;s intention known about the civil partnership and have up to 12 months to regularise or formalise the contract. For those reasons, I was not desperately convinced.
</p>

<a name="40510-52_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>I cannot see why the statutory steps that I suggested in the amendment could not be taken as statutory steps for a civil partnership. The Government say that these are the rules. All I am asking with these amendments is: why are they the rules? And are not the rules also in the situation where we are in Grand Committee subject to input from people holding different views who can tease out whether the rules are valid or could be changed and whether it would be better if they were changed and made stronger or whatever. Surely, that is the purpose of debate. I know that I can do nothing else about it, but I shall return to the matter on Report and probably at Third Reading. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.
</p>

<a name="40510-52_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="40510-52_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Wilcox: </b>   The Question whether Clause 2 shall stand part of the Bill stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Higgins. This is a simple question. It seeks clarification on the clause in the Bill that deals with the registration and formalities of civil partnerships.
</p>

<a name="40510-52_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>We tabled the question after the point was raised at Second Reading. Although the Bill is large and detailed, it is not very clear on the formalities of a civil partnership. Therefore, will the Minister explain to the Committee exactly what the form is for civil partnerships? When in the process of becoming civil partners may the participants call themselves such? What will be the final act of becoming civil partners? In addition to the signing of a document, what will the registration process involve? I look forward to hearing an outline of how exactly the process will work in practice.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="40510-52_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Clause 2 describes the point at which two people are to be regarded as having registered as civil partners to each other. It sets out who is to be present at the registration, who is to sign the civil partnership document and it states the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC59"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column GC59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

administrative procedure to be completed after the registration. It has an important link back to Clause 1. I can see perplexed looks.
</p>




<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="40510-52_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Alli: </b>   I just wondered whether we are on Clause 2 stand part.

<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="40510-52_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Yes.

<a name="40510-52_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Wilcox: </b>   I am talking to the Question whether Clause 2 shall stand part of the Bill, which stands in my name. We do not want it to stand part because we are trying to question the procedure.
</p>




<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="40510-52_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Clause 2 has an important link back to Clause 1, which provides that a civil partnership is formed between two people when they register as civil partners to each other. So, in accordance with Clause 2, the couples are to be regarded as having registered as civil partners once each has signed the civil partnership document at the invitation of, and in the presence of, the civil registration registrar and two witnesses.

<a name="40510-52_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>The civil partnership registrar and the two witnesses must then sign the civil partnership document in the presence of each other and the civil partners. After the signing is complete, the registration authority in whose area the signing takes place must ensure that the civil partnership registration and any other information prescribed by regulations is recorded in the register.
</p>

<a name="40510-52_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>In order to reflect the secular status of the civil partnership, the clause also provides that no religious service is to be used while the civil partnership registrar is officiating at the signing of the civil partnership document. For that reason, Clause 2 complements, and is integral to, the aims of Clause 1. I hope that the noble Baroness does not press her opposition to the clause.

<a name="40510-52_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Humanitarian Mine Action</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="40510-52_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Statement.

</p>

<a name="40510-52_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>Following an internal review by the Department for International Development, I am announcing today a revision to the department&#039;s management of its support to Humanitarian Mine Action. The review team consulted a wide range of stakeholders including the United Nations, civil society, mine action organisations and other government departments.
</p>

<a name="40510-52_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>In 2000 DfID decided to channel the majority of its funds for mine action through the United Nations. The objectives of the review were to assess whether DfID&#039;s policy objectives of channelling most of its funds in this way were being met, and to consider DfID&#039;s resourcing of mine action and to look at future options.
</p>

<a name="40510-52_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>The review concluded that the overall policy approach should remain unchanged. The four existing main pillars of support remain valid. These are to: support humanitarian mine action focused on the poorest countries; improve the effectiveness of the international mine action system to mine pollution; develop new technologies to improve mine clearance; and promote the globalisation of the mine ban convention. Additionally DfID&#039;s commitment to spend at least &#163;10 million per annum on humanitarian mine action will continue.

</p>

<a name="40510-52_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>The policy in 2000 established partnership arrangements with the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Geneva Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD). This support has   contributed to improved co-ordination in the international system. These partnerships will continue but with revised overall funding levels. UNMAS and UNDP will continue to receive similar levels of funding to assist in strengthening their capacity but will receive less towards country programme activity. Support to UNMAS will primarily be for its co-ordination role rather than its mine clearance operations, except in cases requiring short-term emergency response. In the case of UNICEF, DfID&#039;s ongoing three-year partnership for support to mine risk education will continue.
</p>

<a name="40510-52_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>As a result of these changes, DfID will now consider other funding options including bilateral funding via non-government organisations (NGOs) and commercial companies. NGOs have an important role to play in advocating and implementing mine action. The revised <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS2"></a>

<b>10 May 2004 : Column WS2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

policy reflects this by ensuring that more bilateral resources will be available to fund mine clearance by NGOs.
</p>

<a name="40510-52_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>Within DfID, the Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department (CHAD) will continue to be the central point for humanitarian mine action policy. However in view of the increasing mainstreaming of mine action into development programmes, DfID regional desks/offices also have an important role where mine action features in DfID country assistance plans. This creates an additional potential source of funding from within DfID.
</p>

<a name="40510-52_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>DfID will continue to fund research and technology and the generation of knowledge. The department expects to commit approximately 10 per cent of its mine action funding in this area.

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="40510-53_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Bach): </b>  My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Defence (Mr Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40510-53_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>The Ministry of Defence has selected two systems offered by Dynamit Nobel and Saab Bofors Dynamics to proceed into a competitive assessment phase for the antistructures munition programme. This follows a successful and comprehensive evaluation as part of the concept phase. The cost of the assessment phase is likely to be approximately &#163;7 million.
</p>

<a name="40510-53_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>The ASM programme is intended to produce a man-portable, shoulder-launched, precision weapon for use against fixed structures and other emplacements at a range of around 200m utilising enhanced blast warhead technology. A decision on whether to commit to demonstration and manufacture of the system will occur at main gate.
</p>

<a name="40510-53_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The Strategic Defence Review new chapter placed increased emphasis on the need for precision in the face of force and ASM has the potential to provide the Armed Forces with a significant advancement in capability in this area, particularly for expeditionary operations in urban and mountainous terrain. It is designed to minimise casualties and will be fully in accordance with our obligations under international humanitarian law.

<p><a name="wa_st_10"></a>
<a name="40510w02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   The main form of no win, no fee arrangement permitted in England and Wales is a conditional fee agreement (CFA) which was introduced in 1995 and reformed in 2000. CFAs are providing access to justice for thousands of people with meritorious claims, are helping to increase early settlement and providing defendants with a system in which they are more likely to recover their costs in successfully defended cases. There has been satellite litigation concerning CFAs and related legal costs issues which prompted the Government to undertake a review of the CFA arrangements. This review, which is near completion has found that the current legislative arrangements are unnecessarily complex, may be difficult for many consumers fully to understand and provided scope for technical challenges by defendants. We plan to address this by bringing forward by the summer proposals to simplify the secondary legislation. This should help to ensure that the simple concept of no win, no fee translates into simpler agreements that are easier to undertstand and work even better for the consumer, are more straightforward for legal representatives to use and are more resistant to technical challenge.

At the UK&#039;s suggestion, EU Heads of Mission visited the CHT from 22 to 24 March. The visit included touring relief efforts in the   Mahalchari area, where the homes of over 300 indigenous families were destroyed in an attack in August 2003. Rebuilding and rehabilitation is being co-ordinated by the UN Development Programme, funded by a number of donors, including through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#039;s Directorate Programme Budget. EU Heads of Mission also met local leaders and government representatives in Khagrachari and Rangamati, in both emphasising the need for lasting and peaceful solutions for the area, and that further attacks like that in Mahalchari were unacceptable.

<ul>the people of Iraq for breaches of those rights by the authority or the forces.  [HL2545]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_24"></a>
<a name="40510w03_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean:  </b>  The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and the coalition forces as occupying powers in Iraq are required to conduct themselves in accordance with the rules of international law, which includes respecting the human rights of the Iraqi people. The CPA and the coalition are also responsible for upholding the law of the land, which until a new constitution has been agreed by the Iraqis is the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL). We take very seriously any allegations alleging breaches of human rights. Iraqis will have recourse to the Iraqi justice system for any infringements of their rights in the TAL. For incidents relating to UK personnel, it is standard practice for an independent investigation to be undertaken if there is any doubt as to whether the appropriate rules of engagement have been adhered to. If an investigation concludes that there was wrongdoing on the part of UK personnel, appropriate disciplinary measures will be taken, including criminal proceedings where necessary.

<p><a name="wa_st_27"></a>
<a name="40510w04_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean:  </b>  The UK was closely involved in support of the UN Secretary General&#039;s efforts to broker a Cyprus settlement. An integral element of the UN Secretary General&#039;s comprehensive proposals was the demilitarisation of the island and progressive withdrawal of foreign troops (both Greek and Turkish)&#151;ultimately leaving just 950 Greek and 650 Turkish troops. Unfortunately the plan has not been accepted by both sides&#151;therefore there is no agreement on early withdrawal of Turkish troops. We continue to believe the UN Secretary General&#039;s proposals offer the best prospect for a fair, just and viable future for the island. We see no other possible basis for a settlement.

<p><a name="wa_st_32"></a>
<a name="40510w04_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean:  </b>  We welcomed Prime Minister Sharon&#039;s announcement that he intends to withdraw all settlements from Gaza and a number from the West Bank, and to order a significant military redeployment, as a significant step consistent with the road map route to the two-state solution. The dismantling of settlements would be a real step forward, in line with phase I of the road map, which calls for settlements to be frozen and outposts dismantled.
</p>

<a name="40510w04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_25"></a>Withdrawal of settlements and the Israeli Defence Force from Gaza would be beneficial to the Palestinians in practical terms, improving freedom of movement and releasing agricultural land. We have urged the Israelis to withdraw fully. If they do, it would also stimulate renewed international support to enable the Palestinian Authority to built its capacity to deliver services. We are working with the Palestinians to ensure that they can make the best use of Israeli withdrawal to improve the daily lives of the Palestinian population.

<a name="40510w04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_26"></a>As the Quartet indicated in its statement of 4 May, we support these proposals on the basis that they do not prejudice negotiations on the final status issues between the parties, as laid down in the road map, and as a route to the goal of a two-state solution with Israel secure within its borders and living at peace with its neighbours, and Palestine established as a viable, contiguous state.
