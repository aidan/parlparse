<A NAME="40913-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Dykes </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:


<P>
<UL>What recent assessment they have made of the economic opportunities that would be available to the United Kingdom upon joining the European monetary system.
<P></UL>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport  (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </B>  My Lords, the assessment of the five economic tests, published on 9 June 2003, states that, with the five economic tests met, Britain in the euro would enjoy the benefits of greater trade, investment and employment. However, sustainable convergence and sufficient flexibility have yet to be achieved. As the Chancellor announced in this year's Budget,


<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"while the Government do not propose that a . . .  assessment be initiated at the time of this Budget, the Treasury will again review progress at Budget time next year and report to the House".&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 17/3/04; col. 324.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>






<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dykes: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. But does he agree that it sometimes takes an awfully long time for this country to do important things? The Government are facing some complex tasks, including the approach of the general election and, of course, the referendum on the European constitution&#151;very complicated matters. But, from now on, will the Government at long last begin to address the important matter of conveying to the British public the growing success of the euro as an <P>


<a name="column_892"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 892</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>international currency both inside and outside the euro-zone and the growing disadvantages that we now face in not joining and in stubbornly refusing to join?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I cannot agree that we are not continually addressing these matters. The assessment that we published in June last year was extremely&#151;some would say excessively&#151;detailed in 18 volumes, and we still believe that that assessment was the right thing to do at the time. We do not believe that it is necessary or desirable to continue to make public statements updating that basic assessment. Every six months we carry out a study on flexibility and we shall continue to do that.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lawson of Blaby: </B>   My Lords, the European currency has now been in operation without the participation of the United Kingdom for more than five years. What is the Treasury's estimate of the net economic cost to date of our non-participation? Or is this yet another matter which the Chancellor has declined to divulge to the Prime Minister?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, wishes to pay attention to the tittle-tattle in the newspapers by former employees, he is welcome to do so. But clearly the assessment that has been made cannot be entirely quantified, and there is no single answer to the question that the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, asked. As the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, said, these are complex matters and they are not to be solved by sound bites.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, when the Chancellor initially announced the five economic tests, he said that the most critical one was sustainable economic convergence. Can my noble friend tell us quite how one can ever get sustainable convergence?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, we probably could not obtain sustainable convergence as defined by economists, but if we did it in a more common sense way&#151;I shudder to think what is happening behind me&#151;and used the analysis which was used in June last year, we would be able to see when there is sustainable convergence, and we could see at that time that there was not.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Taverne: </B>   My Lords, as far as concerns one of the present weaknesses of the euro-zone&#151;namely, fiscal discipline&#151;do the Government agree that the most recent proposals of the Commission, which put the emphasis on peer pressure, are rather more sensible than a regime of strict rules, severe penalties and no enforcement? Is it not the case that one of the most important matters would be for the Government to stress the importance of the "no bale out" provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, thereby strengthening the pressure from market forces?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, is beyond me in some of the detail, but in principle I agree with what he says. On <P>


<a name="column_893"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 893</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>3 September the Commission published an analysis of the stability and growth pact following the decision of the European Court of Justice. Three of the four recommendations of the Commission communication are in line with the Chancellor's view of the prudent interpretation of the pact. I think and hope that that is what the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, agrees with.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Tomlinson: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that it is still the Government's position that they are agreed in principle to joining a successful single currency? If that is the case, why are the Government not doing more to explain the benefits for those countries that are already participants in a single currency that they deem to be successful?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I agree that the Government are in favour in principle of UK membership of a common currency if the conditions are right. However, to convey a message, it has to be relatively simple and understandable. I acknowledge that to say as we do that three of the five economic conditions have been met and two have not is not the easiest thing to communicate in simple terms.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, do the Government accept the recent analysis from the much respected German Bundesbank, which finds that no economic benefits have accrued to the German economy or to other European economies from the single currency or, indeed, from the single market? If so, would they agree that joining the EMS is, at best, pointless?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, no. The most recent assessment of the situation regarding the euro area, which is the European Commission and IMF estimate last Friday, is that the euro area as a whole is achieving a moderate recovery. They are upgrading estimates of growth for 2004 and downgrading estimates of inflation.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the interview given by the Chancellor last Friday to the <i>Financial Times</i> made a cast-iron case for staying out of the euro, at least for the foreseeable future?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, no. I have it in front of me. I would be glad to debate it in detail with the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, but certainly it does not convey that impression to me.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </B>  My Lords, we would find any such practice distasteful but this is a matter of professional medical conduct for which the General Medical Council is responsible. The council's guidance to doctors, called <i>Good Medical Practice</i>, states,


<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"You must act in your patients' best interests when making referrals and providing or arranging treatment or care. So you must not ask for or accept any inducement, gift or hospitality which may affect or be seen to affect your judgment".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>






<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-01_spnew14"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, is it not wholly unacceptable to have two professional regulatory bodies at odds with each other on this issue? As the Minister said, the GMC has been extremely clear in its views that this practice is unethical and improper, whereas the Law Society earlier this year amended its own regulations for this practice to allow fee sharing despite the fact that the GMC had ruled it unethical. Will the Government now urge the Law Society to change its regulations back again to outlaw this ambulance chasing?

<P>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, in this country we have a system of professional self-regulation through the General Medical Council and the Law Society. The GMC, as I have said, has made its position crystal-clear. In <i>GMC News</i> in April it said:


<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Doctors generally have no expertise in legal services on which to base their recommendation of a particular firm and their chief interests in such schemes is a financial one. For these reasons such schemes are not appropriate".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-02_para0"></a>It is for the Law Society to consider this matter in the light of what the GMC has said and, I understand, it is balloting its members on the change in its introduction and referral code.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that in a report published in May of this year called <i>Better Routes to Redress</i>, the Better Regulation Task Force recommended that the Chief Medical Officer and the NHS chief executive should issue immediately joint guidelines to hospitals and surgeries on the content of advertising by claims management companies on their premises? Is he aware that these companies and, indeed, solicitors compete in order to gain an exclusive franchise to distribute advertising literature in these articles? Have the Government taken that report on board and what are they doing about it?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, we are aware of the Better Regulation Task Force's report. Indeed, it was this Government who set up the Better Regulation Task Force. We are considering very carefully the proposals in its report, <i>Better Routes to Redress</i>.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the essential thing is a matter of choice for the potential litigant? No single name should be put forward at any time and clear choice is essential. Does he agree also that it is vital that the potential client <P>


<a name="column_895"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 895</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should understand that having a claim against a particular person or institution should be pursued and that any doubt about that is undesirable?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, the Government recognise that great harm can be caused to people and that they have rights of redress. On this particular question we are discussing, the issue is whether the particular proposal from the Law Society is deemed to be appropriate medical conduct by the professional body&#151;the General Medical Council. I think it has made its position crystal clear.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, do I not detect a hint of hypocrisy about the criticism of the Law Society? The Government have permitted, indeed have stimulated, the cult of speculative litigation. Before the previous government permitted that, no professional body would have allowed it. Now ambulance chasing has been made legitimate by the Government in relation to solicitors. This pompous comparison between the two professions overlooks the source of the authority.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I refute that absolutely. Perhaps I could give your Lordships a few figures. The figures from the Compensation Recovery Unit show that the overall number of accident claims went down by 9.5 per cent in the year to March 2004. Of those, public liability claims were down by 16.7 per cent; clinical negligence claims were down by 10.8 per cent; and employers' liability claims down by 14 per cent. That hardly represents government encouraging a compensation culture.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, what is the position with regard to health service employees, or indeed other public servants, such as the police, in the context of this question? Is it appropriate for such individuals to be paid to refer people to personal injury lawyers? What is to stop that happening?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, people must make their own judgments in these cases. But this is rather wider than the particular question that was raised. I shall look into the matter and write to the noble Lord.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Christopher: </B>   My Lords, have the Government given their views on this matter to the General Medical Council? I declare an interest as a past member of the GMC. I am a little surprised at what he has told us as it was news to me. I should have thought that it was inappropriate for any medical practitioner to give particular advice to a patient in a matter of this sort. If a patient seeks an opinion, it is fine to say, "Well, in those circumstances it is not for me to say what you should do. Perhaps you should consult your solicitor". But to go beyond that seems to me to be entirely inappropriate. I am troubled at the prospect of a ballot of GMC-registered doctors coming out the wrong way.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I think my noble friend may have misheard me. I said that the ballot taking place relates to the Law Society and its members on the <P>


<a name="column_896"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 896</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>changes to its introduction and referral code. I think that the GMC's position is absolutely clear from the quotations I gave from both its <i>Good Medical Practice</i> guide and the <i>GMC News</i> in April.

<A NAME="40913-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:


<P>
<UL>How long a "demanding . . .  large scale operation", as described in <i>Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities</i> (Cm 6269), can be sustained concurrently with standing military commitments and an enduring small-scale peace support operation, without overstretching the Armed Forces.
<P></UL>



<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Bach): </B>  My Lords, we acknowledge, as we have always done, that the most demanding, large-scale operations could be carried out only by breaking what we call our "harmony guidelines"; that is, the amount of time our personnel spend on operations or on exercise, compared to the time they spend at home. Our planning assumes that a large-scale operation would be an infrequent, one-off commitment that lasts up to six months, thereafter drawing down to medium scale.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. Assumptions that we will win, and win quickly, any large-scale symmetric operation and that our allies will then relieve us is dangerously questionable. Is it not vital at a time of overstretch, and with little time for our Armed Forces to rest and train, that provision to rotate them is built into planning assumptions for the war-fighting duration and follow-through periods?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, of course we have to bear that consideration in mind. But defence planning assumes large-scale operations similar in size to Operation TELIC, which became a medium-sized operation well within the six-month period, will occur infrequently. That is our experience over the past 50 years. Of course we realise that our Armed Forces require a period of recuperation prior to being ready to conduct another similar-sized operation. The length of time required to recuperate will depend on the choices we make in prioritising activities and resources.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Garden: </B>   My Lords, on which month of which year does the Minister expect to have the necessary people, equipment and training completed to be able to fill all the annex requirements for concurrency in Command Paper 6269? Will it be longer or shorter than the six years the Armed Forces waited for a similar promise to be delivered in the Strategic Defence Review?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I cannot give the noble Lord the exact month or the exact date. He of course was <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, in view of the current situation, to which reference has been made, will the Government defer their proposals concerned with the infantry arrangements?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, no, we will not defer those decisions. Those decisions are not ready yet in any event. The Army Board will be meeting later this year to decide on them and one should not expect final decisions to be announced before the New Year. I would recommend to the noble Lord that he look at an article by the Chief of the General Staff in the <i>Spectator </i>magazine of 11 September this year, in which he deals very clearly with the issue. I hope that I will be forgiven if I quote briefly from it. He said:


<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Army Board's duty is to ensure our Army's capability and ethos up to some two decades ahead. It is my duty to lead the board in so doing. That process involves change, inevitably an uncomfortable process, but one which if not grasped would indeed lead to a grave threat to the Army's war-fighting capability. Standing still is likely to realise that threat".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, apart from the technicalities, in which I am not at all well versed, are the Government satisfied that, given the present commitments of the Army, soldiers are able to spend enough time at home?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, it has been an extraordinarily busy period&#151;I think that that is the noble Baroness's point. It is true that during the height of Operation TELIC, we were not satisfied with the amount of time that our soldiers were able to spend at home, but the position has improved greatly since then.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, does the Treasury see the present operation in Iraq as a medium-term commitment? If so, will all the money that is needed for that operation be drawn from within the MoD budget, so that the MoD will not go to the Treasury for further funds, or will the MoD have to go to the Treasury to fund the operation in Iraq?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, from the very start of the operation in Iraq&#151;whether during the course of the conflict or now, in the peace support part of the operation&#151;the Treasury has always made sure that the Ministry of Defence is financed in order that it can meet its requirements.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us what proportion of our Armed Forces is currently located outside the United Kingdom and whether he expects that the proportion to increase or decrease?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Strange: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us why we still need three battalions in the Parachute Regiment?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I very much look forward to answering the noble Baroness's Starred Question tomorrow. It relates, in a small way, to the question that she has just raised. The Parachute Regiment is very different from those that I think that she has in mind in relation to this question. The Parachute Regiment has a proud history, as do the other regiments that she has in mind, and is vital given the increased necessity for expeditionary exercises, which is what we have been involved with much more in the past few years than previously.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, the strategic review only glanced at the issue of asymmetric threats and the need for troops here. We also have unexpected events such as, the press says, seven ships having to be held back for a possible fire fighting operation. In the past, 19,000 soldiers have been required for a fire fighting operation. Given that, is there any reason why numbers should not remain as they are until it is much clearer what the needs will be? I am not talking about change; I am talking about numbers.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, to move to change, which is what we need to do, it is important to recognise that decisions are vital to ensure that our future capability is, frankly, aimed not at the old threats but at what we see as future threats. As is highlighted in the paper to which the noble Lord referred in his Question, in certain areas we judge our current capability to be disproportionately high now for the actual level of threat. By way of example only, I mention anti-submarine warfare and air defence in particular. That judgment is not dependent on new capabilities that we will be obtaining. We also identify the capabilities in which we need to invest. It is therefore prudent to reduce some capabilities now, tough as that is, while restructuring and investing in our priority areas.

But does the Minister agree that a very relevant point now is that the question of a September sitting is not decided for ever and, if it were to be reconsidered next year, the problem of falling over the carpet and all the other works during a Session would <i>ipso facto</i> be solved?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, no doubt there will be issues to discuss about that arising from the Leader's report, which I understand will be published tomorrow. I take the point: there is some dust; there is noise; perhaps there is a little discomfort; and there is inconvenience. But this is not a disaster area. The fact is that we have reassembled because there is business to do. That is what is important, not questions of convenience, dust or difficulties in finding enough refreshments. The fact is that the House has business to do. We have done business over some nine Bills. I myself had the pleasure of talking to your Lordships during a day's debate on Iraq. The fact is that the House is here to discharge the business allotted to it. If that involves a little inconvenience on occasion, so be it.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, the Minister is absolutely justified in saying that the House was given full details of the works to go ahead and what might be the consequences, but can she answer two brief questions? First, has she reason to believe that things will be back in a proper state by the time of the reconvening of Parliament on 11 October, or is there any overrun in the expected time? Secondly, <P>


<a name="column_900"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 900</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>given that what we are spending is taxpayers' money, can she assure the House that we are living entirely within the budget agreed to by those committees?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I have no reason to think that the budget is any different. I can tell your Lordships that &#163;14.4 million is being spent over the three phases of the refurbishment. I understand that that has been considered by the appropriate committees of your Lordships' House. On the question of whether all will be returned on 11 October, I was careful to say that almost normal services will be available on 11 October. I understand that there will still be a degree of disruption in the Library and to Committee Room G.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Boston of Faversham: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister appreciate that sizable numbers of noble Lords dislike September sittings? Does she further appreciate that although she is very good, if I may say so with respect, at keeping your Lordships informed about things in your Lordships' House, the disruption that we suffered last week and continue to suffer this week is, in my experience, much greater than we ever envisaged when we discussed these matters last year? Can the noble Baroness hold out any hope to those of us who take that view of an end to September sittings?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-03_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I acknowledge that there are Members of your Lordships' House who dislike September sittings very much. Were it not for that fact, we would not have discussed these sittings twice&#151;in December of last year and November of the year before&#151;when those voices were very clear in their objections.
<P>

<a name="40913-03_para0"></a>I agree with the noble Lord that it is undesirable to have this degree of disruption in the House. But it is enormously important that the facilities of the House are put right in order that it can function properly in the longer term. We have had real issues of concern about the facilities, particularly on the question of health and safety for members of our staff for whom we, as sitting Members of this House, have a duty of care. That duty of care has to be discharged.
<P>

<a name="40913-03_para1"></a>I do not have the length of experience that the noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, has over the degree of disruption, but the inconvenience that we are suffering is not all that great considering how important these changes are.

<P>

<a name="40913-04_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: We now come to Clause 122, which deals with the power of the local authority or other authorised individuals to enter a premises to carry out work on a property during the interim or final management order.
<P>

<a name="40913-04_para15"></a>We have debated previously that such power must be used with caution as they possess the ability of infringing an individual's right to privacy. Can the Minister tell us when such a power of entry would be used and, in particular, under what specific conditions and circumstances?
<P>

<a name="40913-04_para16"></a>Amendment No. 170 attempts to clarify what the Minister considers to be a noted period of reasonable time before intended work and entry can commence. As the Bill stands, there is nothing to stop a local authority deciding overnight to enter premises. We are seeking a level playing field on a national basis rather than having a free-for-all that varies widely from one area to the next, merely confusing everybody involved.
<P>

<a name="40913-04_para17"></a>Amendment No. 171 would remove from the clause the possibility of legal action and a fine for not complying with allowing an authorised person to enter the premises. This amendment is consequent to Amendment No. 170. If the Minister can provide us with further details of what he considers a reasonable time period with which we are comfortable, I will not pursue this matter further. I beg to move.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Clause 122 provides the right of entry for a local housing authority, or other person authorised by it, to a property which is subject to a management order for the specific purpose of carrying out works. The clause is principally aimed at occupiers, rather than landlords.
<P>

<a name="40913-04_para18"></a>Subsection (1) provides that reasonable notice must be given to the occupier in order to gain access.
<P>

<a name="40913-04_para19"></a>Subsection (4) provides that if an occupier, having been given reasonable notice that the works are to be carried out, refuses access for that purpose, the local housing authority may apply to a magistrates' court for what is described as "an access order".
<P>

<a name="40913-04_para20"></a>Subsections (5) and (6) provide that if the access order is not complied with by the occupier, then that person commits an offence and upon conviction may be fined up to &#163;5,000.
<P>

<a name="40913-04_para21"></a>Amendment No. 170 seeks to remove the requirement in subsection (4) for the giving of reasonable notice of intention to carry out works, with a requirement that one month's notice must be given in every case. As I have indicated, this clause is concerned to ensure that the local housing authority is not frustrated in carrying out its repairing obligations to occupiers of property that it is managing because of a management order. In a lot of cases it may be perfectly reasonable to give one month's notice if the works are minor or routine, but it is not reasonable if <P>


<a name="column_903"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 903</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the required repairs are to remedy a dangerous or injurious hazard in the property. In those circumstances the local authority would want the work carried out as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="40913-04_para22"></a>Clause 203 allows access for the purpose of inspecting on 24 hours' notice. It would look odd if, having carried out the inspection under that provision and having identified a serious hazard, the local authority could not embark on works to sort out the problem for a month. That would not make sense.
<P>

<a name="40913-04_para23"></a>Amendment No. 171 seeks to remove the criminal penalty for non-compliance with an access order. It is safe to assume that in the vast majority of cases occupiers will be more than willing to grant access to carry out the works. They are the direct beneficiaries of the works or improvements. Nor do the Government seek to criminalise occupiers who may have forgotten about the appointment or wish to rearrange it for a more convenient time.
<P>

<a name="40913-04_para24"></a>There are two limbs to the access order. If the authority is unable to gain access and it either has some doubt as to the occupier's intention or it is an emergency, then it may apply to the magistrates' court for an access order. It is only if the occupier fails to comply with that order that he will commit an offence.
<P>

<a name="40913-04_para25"></a>There will be examples where it is necessary to take this course of action: the resident landlord may resent the local authority having taken away his management of the property and may just want to make things difficult and be a member of the awkward squad; or the landlord may not care and make life difficult&#151;for example, if certain communal features were in his flat and in disrepair. This provision is intended to address that type of case.

<P>

<a name="40913-04_para26"></a>The removal of subsections (5) and (6) would have the opposite effect to that intended by the noble Lord. Enforcement of breaches of access orders would have to be by proceedings for contempt of court which could lead to something worse than fines. Imprisonment can be used for contempt of court.
<P>

<a name="40913-04_para27"></a>If the concern is that local authorities might act unreasonably in acquiring access&#151;and that is justifiable concern&#151;then government Amendment No. 238M prohibits it by inserting a new clause for authorisations for enforcement purposes including, power of entry under this clause. Any entry has to be authorised by a deputy chief officer of the authority. We do not want to be unreasonable. In only very few circumstances would emergency access be required. In the vast majority of cases, it could be routine. Therefore, one could give longer notice. With that response, I hope that the noble Lord will be satisfied and not pursue the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40913-05_para4"></a>Empty Dwelling Management Orders
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para5"></a>   Empty Dwelling Management Orders: Introductory 


<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
(1)   This Chapter deals with the making by a local housing authority of&#151;


<br>
(a)   an interim empty dwelling management order (an "interim EDMO"), or


<br>
(b)   a final empty dwelling management order (a "final EDMO"),


<br>
in respect of a dwelling.


<br>
(2)   An interim EDMO is an order made to enable a local housing authority, with the consent of the relevant proprietor, to take steps for the purpose of securing that a dwelling becomes and continues to be occupied.


<br>
(3)   A final EDMO is an order made, in succession to an interim EDMO or a previous final EDMO, for the purpose of securing that a dwelling is occupied.


<br>
(4)   In this Chapter&#151;


<br>
(a)   "dwelling" means&#151;


<br>
(i)   a building intended to be occupied as a separate dwelling, or


<br>
(ii)   a part of a building intended to be occupied as a separate dwelling which may be entered otherwise than through any non-residential accommodation in the building;


<br>
(b)   any reference to "the dwelling", in relation to an interim EDMO or a final EDMO, is a reference to the dwelling to which the order relates; 


<br>
(c)   "relevant proprietor", in relation to a dwelling, means&#151;


<br>
(i)   if the dwelling is let under one or more leases with an unexpired term of 7 years or more, the lessee under whichever of those leases has the shortest unexpired term; or


<br>
(ii)   in any other case, the person who has the freehold estate in the dwelling;


<br>
(d)   "third party", in relation to a dwelling, means any person who has an estate or interest in the dwelling (other than the relevant proprietor and any person who is a tenant under a lease or licence granted under paragraph 2(3)(c) or 10(3)(c) of Schedule (Further provisions regarding empty dwelling management orders)); and


<br>
(e)   any reference (however expressed) to rent or other payments in respect of occupation of a dwelling, includes any payments that the authority receive from persons in respect of unlawful occupation of the dwelling.


<br>
(5)   In subsection (4)(c), the reference to an unexpired term of 7 years or more of a lease of a dwelling is&#151;


<br>
(a)   in relation to a dwelling in respect of which the local housing authority is considering making an interim EDMO, a reference to the unexpired term of the lease at the time the authority begin taking steps under section (Making of interim EDMOs)(3),


<br>
(b)   in relation to a dwelling in respect of which an interim EDMO has been made, a reference to the unexpired term of the lease at the time the application for authorisation to make the interim EDMO was made under subsection (1) of that section, or<P>

<br>
"Preceding interim EDMO", in relation to a final EDMO, means the interim EDMO that immediately preceded the final EDMO or, where there has been a succession of final EDMOs, the interim EDMO that immediately preceded the first of them.

(6)   Schedule (Further provisions regarding empty dwelling management orders) (which makes further provision regarding EDMOs) has effect."<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-05_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: These amendments provide for the introduction of a new clause after Clause 122 entitled:


<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Empty dwelling management orders: introductory".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-05_para7"></a>I shall speak to a host of government amendments explaining what we want to do about empty homes. I apologise for the length of the speech. Although this is not brand new material because the issue has been debated&#151;and, indeed, requested from all sides of the House in the other place&#151;it is new in the sense of the Government putting forward a proposal.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 171A to 171H, 174A to 174D and 210A provide for the introduction of empty dwelling management orders. Such management orders would enable local authorities to secure occupation of long-term, private sector empty homes in certain defined circumstances. The Committee will be familiar with the concept of management orders in Part 4 in respect of accommodation subject to the licensing provisions in Parts 2 and 3. They provide for local authorities to "step into" the shoes of property owners in order to ensure responsible management. The amendments extend the control provisions of Part   4 to empty homes.

<P>

<a name="40913-05_para9"></a>The amendments give effect to the Government's commitment in the sustainable communities plan to allow local authorities to lease long-term, private sector empty homes. That commitment was made in response to a recommendation by a Select Committee in another place and we followed it up with a consultation paper, entitled, <i>Empty Homes: Temporary Management, Lasting Solutions</i>, which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published 17 months ago.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para10"></a>Empty homes present a significant problem, but they are also a significant opportunity. Last year, in England, local authorities reported some 718,000 vacant dwellings. Of those, nearly 84 per cent were privately owned. At the same time, local authorities reported that 308,000 privately-owned dwellings had been vacant for more than six months.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para11"></a>The presence of significant numbers of long-term empty homes, often heavily concentrated in areas of housing decline, can significantly affect the viability of an area. There are many examples in northern England where empty homes have contributed to blight and market failure. That is a matter we are tackling through the housing market renewal programme. But the problem of empty homes is by no means confined to such areas.
<P>


<a name="column_906"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 906</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para12"></a>Empty homes may be less concentrated in other areas, but that does not mean they can be ignored. Nearly 2 per cent of the private housing stock in London&#151;more than 43,000 homes&#151;was vacant for more than six months at the last count in 2003. In overall terms, London and the south-east accounts for nearly as many long-term, privately-owned empty homes as the north-east and north-west. The presence of large numbers of empty homes in all parts of the country is something with which we ought to be concerned. But, particularly in areas of high housing demand, their presence is nothing short of a scandal.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para13"></a>Anyone who is unfortunate enough to have lived next door to a property that has been left empty for a long period of time will understand the sheer frustration that such a situation can create. Poorly maintained empty properties are magnets for vandals, drug users, squatters and even arsonists. Boarding them up to secure against break-in simply identifies properties as long-term empty. It is not sustainable.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para14"></a>From my former role as a constituency Member, I could give examples of empty homes that were not just inner-city terraced homes. They could be outer suburban three-bedroom semi-detached properties&#151;in ordinary roads with trees and families&#151;which were just left. The properties do not just stay the same: for example, gardens grow, they become derelict, odd windows are smashed but do not get repaired. As I have said, they are an invitation to problems for everyone. People get very frustrated and go to the council saying, "Do something about it". It replies, "Well, it is nothing to do with us. We do not own it". But, of course, the council is the responsible housing authority where people go when there is a problem. So there is a difficulty and we need to deal with it.

<P>

<a name="40913-05_para15"></a>Notwithstanding the annoyance caused to neighbours and others, there is the abject waste of a dwelling. We have a crisis of dwellings in this country. We all know that our house-building programme is not good. It is the worst that it has been since 1924. Our replacement rate is appalling at something like 0.1 per cent a year, whereas in continental Europe it is 1 per cent per year. That is a massive difference. The average dwelling in this country is expected to be maintained for 1,200 years; on the continent it is 100 years. To even say that sounds stupid. But the fact is that that is the current situation with the present building programme and the rate of replacement.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para16"></a>We can therefore see that empty homes represent a waste of an asset. They are a wasted opportunity for owners who could otherwise make financial gains from selling or letting them. They present a wasted opportunity for those who cannot get a foothold in the housing market. Many local authorities are working extremely hard to develop empty property strategies that seek to offer a package of incentives and penalties to empty property owners. But they believe that their efforts are frustrated by a lack of effective enforcement powers.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para17"></a>The threat of compulsory purchase can be a useful weapon, but it like the nuclear option: it puts people off because they know how long it can take and how frustrating it is. From the responses to the consultation paper, we know that many local authorities are very <P>


<a name="column_907"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 907</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reluctant to use compulsory purchase powers. They are very complicated and form part of a long and drawn-out procedure.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para18"></a>The issue is that the ownership of the property does not necessarily have to be changed in order to bring it back into use as a dwelling for people to live in. So the key is not necessarily the change of ownership. The key to unlocking the potential of empty homes is to get them back into use as homes as quickly as possible. That does not necessarily require a change of ownership. Where the owner is unwilling to do that, we should not be afraid to consider compulsion.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para19"></a>I recognise that the amendments will not completely solve the problem of empty homes. We are realistic enough to know that there will always be a certain proportion of housing stock that is vacant at any given time. Indeed, vacancy is essential. Without that the market cannot operate, which is why we are not seeking to deal with every empty property on the market. If every home was always fully occupied, buying and selling homes would grind to a halt.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para20"></a>Nor are we seeking to penalise people for leaving a home vacant for valid and reasonable reasons. Many people leave their principal home vacant while staying elsewhere. That can be through choice: for example, a person may be caring for someone, seeking job opportunities elsewhere, living with a partner or even living in a care home for a period of time with the expectation that he or she may return home.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para21"></a>While we would caution against leaving a property vacant and unattended for long periods of time, that is a matter of personal choice in which state intervention is not warranted in the examples that I have given. The properties that are the subject of the amendments are entirely different. They are not the principal homes of absent owners, second homes or holiday homes; nor are they homes that are undergoing repair or alteration or are subject to a process that will, in time, lead them to being reoccupied. If they met all those criteria, there would not be a problem. To all intents and purposes, they are abandoned properties that are discarded by owners who are unable to provide a good reason for them not being occupied.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para22"></a>There are often significant underlying factors at work, such as disrepair, which prevent some homes being occupied. It is not always a question of owners of empty properties being culpable. Our aim is not to penalise people for failing to tackle a difficult problem. The home might be left to the owner as the result of a will. He may not be able to cope with it, or just does not want to know about it in the hope that it will all go away. Our objective is to persuade owners in these circumstances to pass the responsibility of bringing the property back into housing use to a local authority. Of course, we want this to be with their consent. But where that consent is not forthcoming, we do not apologise for granting local authorities powers to secure occupation without the need to obtain consent.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para23"></a>We have considered very carefully the human rights implications of these measures. We are sensitive about interfering with people's property rights. But the rights of owners to do as they choose with their property <P>


<a name="column_908"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 908</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>must be balanced against the rights of other property owners and the wider community in which they reside. It is the Government's view that these measures strike a fair balance that does not place owners at a financial disadvantage. Indeed, they stand to gain the benefit of an improved asset and an income, where previously they may have had to pay to keep the property empty.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para24"></a>Above all, the amendments send a clear message to property owners that, by leaving homes idle for long periods of time without good reason, they risk losing their right to make decisions about how the property is managed. We expect this message will help to persuade many more owners to enter into constructive dialogue with local authority empty property officers about the range of services on offer to assist them. The emphasis will remain with voluntary measures. The new powers available to local authorities would sit behind, as a back-up measure, only to be used where it is evident that voluntary measures will not resolve the vacancy.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para25"></a>I have already apologised for the length of time I am taking, but this is an important part and I am quite happy to go through each amendment, very briefly, because it will assist in the further stages of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para26"></a>Amendment No. 171A describes interim and final empty dwelling management orders. It provides for a local housing authority to secure occupation of an unoccupied dwelling. A "dwelling" is defined as a building intended to be occupied as a separate dwelling, such as a house, or a part of a building so intended, such as a flat. It introduces the concept of "relevant proprietor"&#151;that is, the person who the empty dwelling management order is made against. In most cases, this will be the freeholder of the dwelling, but where there is a leasehold interest of more than seven years, it is the person with the shortest unexpired term of more than seven years.

<P>

<a name="40913-05_para27"></a>Amendment No. 171B requires a local authority to apply to a residential property tribunal for authorisation to make an interim empty dwelling management order. Prior to seeking authorisation, the local authority must attempt to notify the relevant proprietor of the fact, and ascertain if he has any intention to bring the dwelling back into occupation.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para28"></a>Amendment No. 171C requires that the residential property tribunal must be satisfied that various tests are met, and that the case does not fall within any category of exception prescribed by the appropriate national authority before authorising the making of an interim empty dwelling management order.

<P>

<a name="40913-05_para29"></a>Amendment No. 171D requires the local authority to take any steps it considers appropriate to secure occupation and proper management of the dwelling, pending either a final empty dwelling management order or revocation of the interim empty dwelling management order. It cannot grant rights of occupation without the consent of the relevant proprietor.

<P>

<a name="40913-05_para30"></a>Amendment No. 171E provides that the local authority may make a final empty dwelling management order to replace either an interim order or a previous final order if it considers the dwelling is likely to become or remain unoccupied. It does not require authorisation from the residential property tribunal.
<P>


<a name="column_909"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 909</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para31"></a>Amendment No. 171F requires a local authority to take steps to secure occupation and proper management of the dwelling. The local housing authority does not   require the consent of the relevant proprietor to grant rights of occupation. A final empty dwelling management order must contain a management scheme for setting out how the local authority intends to carry out its duties and how it will account for the moneys expended and collected.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para32"></a>Amendment No. 171G provides for a third party to apply to a residential property tribunal for compensation for any interference with his rights as a result of the making of an interim empty dwelling management order or to request the local authority to pay compensation for interference with his rights as a result of making a final empty dwelling management order.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para33"></a>Amendments Nos. 171H and 174A to 174D are consequential amendments. Amendment No. 210A covers a wide range of matters relating to the operation and effect of empty dwelling management orders and financial arrangements. It is a long and detailed schedule, and is fairly self-explanatory.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_time0"></a><H5>3.45 p.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>

<a name="40913-05_para34"></a>The general effect of an interim empty dwelling management order is very similar to that of the interim management orders under Chapter 1 of Part 4 of the Bill, and can last for up to 12 months. While it is in force, the local authority takes over most of the rights and responsibilities of the relevant proprietor but does not become the legal owner of the dwelling. Rent collected while the order is in force must be used to meet relevant expenditure, or to pay compensation. Any balance must be paid to the relevant proprietor.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para35"></a>A local housing authority may vary or revoke an interim empty dwelling management order at any time, on its own initiative or at the request of someone with an interest in the dwelling. However, if the local authority has secured occupation of the dwelling, it may only revoke the order with the consent of the relevant proprietor. It may also refuse to revoke the order unless any expenditure it has incurred up to that point that has not been met by rental income is paid to it either by the relevant proprietor or someone else.

<P>

<a name="40913-05_para36"></a>A final empty dwelling management order may last for a maximum of seven years. The general effect is the same as for an interim order. The only significant difference is that the local authority does not require the consent of the relevant proprietor to grant occupation rights. The procedure for varying or revoking a final order is similar to that for an interim order.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para37"></a>A local authority has a right to possession of any furniture in the dwelling while the empty dwelling management order is in force, but the relevant proprietor may request possession of it. The local authority may also supply furniture to the dwelling.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para38"></a>A retail property tribunal may terminate a lease of a dwelling on which an empty dwelling management order is made, if it considers the dwelling is not being occupied and the local authority requires possession to <P>


<a name="column_910"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 910</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>arrange for it to be occupied. This provision is necessary in order to prevent any sham arrangements being put in place to defeat the objective of the empty dwelling management orders. However, we recognise this could deprive someone of property rights, so the schedule provides for the retail property tribunal to order payment of compensation by local authorities to the person whose interest is determined.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para39"></a>On the termination of an empty dwelling management order, the local authority must pay to the relevant proprietor any balance of rent left after deduction of its relevant expenditure, and any compensation it has been required to pay. If, on termination, the balance is in deficit, the local authority may seek to recover the deficit from the relevant proprietor if he has agreed to pay it, if it relates to a service charge paid by the local authority and, in the case of an interim empty dwelling management order, if the relevant proprietor unreasonably refused consent to the grant of occupation rights.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para40"></a>If none of these provisions apply, the local authority must meet the deficit itself. However, if a subsequent final empty dwelling management order is made, the local authority may instead seek to recover the deficit from any surplus made under that subsequent order.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para41"></a>There are a wide range of rights to appeal to a residential property tribunal against matters that affect a person with an interest in a dwelling on which an empty dwelling management order is made. A relevant person may appeal to the residential property tribunal against a decision of a local authority to make a final empty dwelling management order, or the terms of it; the terms of an interim order, including any terms regarding compensation payable to a third party or a dispossessed landlord or tenant; or a decision of a local authority to vary or revoke, or its refusal to vary or revoke, both an interim or final empty dwelling management order. A third party may also appeal to a residential property tribunal against a decision by a local authority not to pay compensation to him, or a decision relating to the amount of compensation payable.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para42"></a>In conclusion, we consider that these arrangements strike a fair balance between the right of property owners to determine how their property is used and the duty of local housing authorities to secure occupation of that property in the wider public interest. That should come as no surprise to noble Lords since we consulted on this over a very long period.
<P>

<a name="40913-05_para43"></a>In particular I would point to the fact that the amendments provide for local authorities and residential property tribunals to balance the interests of the community against the effect the order will have on the rights of the owner and of third parties; local authorities would have the right to seek authorisation from a residential property tribunal to make an interim empty dwelling management order; there is a right to seek variation or revocation of an empty dwelling management order and a right to appeal against a refusal to do so; there is a right of appeal against the making of a final empty dwelling <P>


<a name="column_911"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>management order or the terms on which it is made; and compensation would be paid to persons other than the relevant proprietor whose interests are affected by the making of an empty dwelling management order and to dispossessed landlords and tenants whose leases are terminated by a residential property tribunal in authorising an empty dwelling management order. I beg to move.

<P>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I begin by saying that we are less than enthused by the way in which the Government have handled this part of the Bill, in particular the introduction of such a large and significant element at this stage. Earlier this year during the deliberations in   Committee in the Commons, the Government announced that they would bring forward in this Bill a scheme for the handling of empty properties. To table and publish such an important part of the Bill only last Thursday when they had the whole summer in which to do so borders, I believe, on an abuse of Parliament. It has in effect denied opposition colleagues from being able to scrutinise it in the manner this House expects.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para0"></a>Part of my concern turns on the fact that this is in no way an insignificant inclusion. The provisions being moved by the Minister today will have a major impact on many citizens, along with the involvement of the state in their private lives&#151;the taking into possession by local housing authorities of an empty but, I must stress, a private property.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para1"></a>This measure is designed to bring a greater number of properties into the housing sector. However, we have serious reservations about whether that ambition will be met by this scheme. This approach appears to be all stick and no carrot. We agree that there is an issue in relation to empty homes. The scandal of 730,000 houses and flats in England standing empty is one we should all be concerned about. However, we would have preferred some form of voluntary model. Such powers as those before the Committee today should have been introduced as one of a range of options backed up by other, stronger measures.

<P>

<a name="40913-06_para2"></a>There are important questions and points that need to be clarified. For example, the Government need to give further consideration to the legal complexities that might apply in circumstances involving the application of an EDMO in respect of leasehold dwellings, in particular flats. In such circumstances the responsibilities of the lessee will continue, notwithstanding the existence of an EDMO. The OPDM needs to consider whether, given the necessary statutory amendments, this would be practical, or whether the power to make an EDMO is confined to freehold interests only.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para3"></a>The ODPM needs to consider dispute properties; for example, those where family breakdown has occurred and one of the parties refuses to agree to the property being sold so that the other party derives no benefit from the property as a form of punishment for the relationship breakdown.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para4"></a>There can be multi-owner disputes. On the death of a single or joint proprietor, ownership passes to one or more members of the family who are unable to agree <P>


<a name="column_912"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 912</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on the future of the house. One person may wish to retain and improve the property for family use while the others wish to sell and realise the equity. This may also occur where the Court of Protection is involved and cautions have been placed on the sale by other family members in dispute of an agreement or will.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para5"></a>It should consider DIY owners, those who inherit or acquire empty, semi-derelict properties with a view to use as second or retirement homes. Having undertaken work on a do-it-yourself basis to reduce costs and as a hobby, they find that with the passage of time the condition of the property deteriorates and the costs escalate. They are reluctant to acknowledge that what had been a manageable project five years previously has now turned into a major headache with little chance of being turned around.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para6"></a>There are additionally issues around cost. Will the operation of the scheme be cost neutral to local authorities and be operated as a commercial enterprise, reclaiming financial expenditure through rent? How long will an authority wait before moving in, and on what grounds will a decision be made? Could we be left with a fragmented system where we have one local authority applying a different interpretation and being rather more keen to seize a property than the authority next door?
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para7"></a>Of the 729,770 empty homes in England, 76,637 are under the tutelage of local authorities and a further 37,625 under registered social landlords. Some 10,110 are controlled by other public bodies and the remainder, 605,398, are in private hands. Surely there is a case for the Government and local authorities to get their own act in order before starting to eye up private properties. Over 100,000 houses are in state hands and yet are still lying empty.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para8"></a>A further question relates to what will happen to such properties once they have been made fit for human habitation by the local authority. Will they be let to key workers or homeless people in the vicinity? If that is the case, how will such a scheme operate? Who will these people be, and how will they be chosen? What guarantee can be given that such people will not, for whatever reason, subsequently damage the property they are renting? What redress will the owner have if such damage occurs? These are just some of the questions that remain unanswered.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para9"></a>As I have mentioned, we are not at all impressed by the short period of time we have had to scrutinise these provisions and we are unable to comment today in the detail we would like. I know that my noble friend Lady   Hanham will also want to comment on these issues.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I should say first that we welcome what the Government are doing here. Bodies such as Shelter and the Empty Homes Agency, of which I am patron, also welcome these provisions. However, I agree with the noble Lord in his remarks about the way they have been handled. Having spent the whole of the week before we came back trying to find out whether these amendments had been tabled in order to prepare, I found that they eventually arrived <P>


<a name="column_913"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 913</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>only last week. I am not in a position to employ full-time staff, so that makes life very difficult. I hope that, in the future, the Government will do better with this type of thing. I realise that that is not simple, but it was as far back as 19 May this year that the Government said that they would put forward amendments.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para10"></a>The Minister has made a number of important points explaining why this is such an important issue. We have a huge number of empty homes in Britain. The noble Lord who spoke before me was a little dismissive of the number of homes and how this would assist in providing the many homes that are needed. But it is a fact that 84 per cent of empty homes are not publicly owned buildings; they are in the private sector. That is why it has been so difficult to deal with them and why it has taken so long to devise a comprehensive and imaginative solution.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para11"></a>In introducing the provisions, the Minister talked of what happens in areas where there are lots of empty properties. It is a fact that in some of the most deprived areas of the country, we find that a much higher percentage of homes are left empty. Research has also shown that in areas where more than 5 per cent of the dwelling stock is empty, house prices reflect that fact and as a result are much lower. Given the facts&#151;about which we could speak at length, but I will spare noble Lords that debate today&#151;it is clear that there is a need to do something about empty homes.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para12"></a>I have campaigned on this issue for well over 20 years in my own political life, so I see the provisions to be put on the face of the Bill as something of a milestone. Noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches have pushed for such provisions for a number of years and therefore we welcome them. My only regret is that something was not done sooner.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para13"></a>These amendments will provide a much-needed tool for local authorities, in particular where the owners of empty properties refuse to co-operate. It must be remembered that these will be provisions of last resort, and we hope that all the best practice we have seen introduced will enable local authorities to operate without having to undertake this kind of bureaucracy. However, it means that many more homes will be brought back into use and we will see more secure homes and a better quality of life for many families up and down the country.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_time0"></a><H5>4 p.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>

<a name="40913-06_para14"></a>As the Minister said, a good many voluntary leasing schemes are already in operation. In recent times there has been renewed interest in these schemes across the country. Many registered social landlords have become involved; some are running with major portfolios. East Thames Housing Group now has more than 1,500 previously empty properties on its books. That is without this legislation, so it shows what can be done.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para15"></a>Across the country there is a patchwork quilt effect of private sector leasing. In some areas there are excellent partnership relationships between local authorities and the local registered social landlord, but <P>


<a name="column_914"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 914</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>there are areas where there is no interest from registered social landlords. We need to ensure that there are more incentives for registered social landlords to see that private sector leasing schemes are an integral part of their work.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para16"></a>I vented most of my anger about the late tabling of the amendments last week. As we have said, it has been difficult to get to grips with them. I tried to listen to what the Minister was saying but did not always catch it completely, so I hope that I am not asking about matters that he thought he had explained. We may pursue other matters on Report.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para17"></a>The Empty Homes Agency is concerned about compensation. It was not in the initial consultation, nor in the initial position of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I understand that that is partly to do with human rights issues. Furthermore, in some cases consent from the owners of properties is required to rent them. Will the Minister set out the Government's thinking on those issues, the reasons why they came to their conclusions and the reasons for the amendments they have tabled?
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para18"></a>Some people take the view that if people have left their properties empty for a long time they perhaps do not have any right to compensation. If I have read the notes to the amendments correctly, compensation would be awarded only if the owner was not receiving any rent from the property, which is what we hope would happen.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para19"></a>One of the points that is welcomed by people who work in the area is that if local authorities have not recouped the costs of the initial interim empty dwellings management order, they will be able to apply for another. That is welcome because it should convince local authorities that are averse to embracing the new power.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para20"></a>One area that is rather sad, although I understand the problem, is that the definition of a dwelling would preclude empty flats above shops if there were no separate access. I can see the problem and that it might be a legal minefield, but will the Minister reconsider it?
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para21"></a>Subsection (2) of the proposed new clause under Amendment No. 171B requires a dwelling to be wholly unoccupied. However, the new schedule proposed by Clause 210A&#151;in Paragraph 2(3)(a)&#151;refers to the rights of existing occupiers. We are confused as to how that will work out; it seems inconsistent.
<P>

<a name="40913-06_para22"></a>I am sure that we shall return to the issue in more detail on Report. With those few comments and questions I look forward to the Minister's response.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-07_spmin0"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, for her comments. She made a plea to the Government to be more timely in tabling amendments. We have been saying that for years; the noble Baroness said it again today, but the answer is that it just will not happen. We will be faced with the same situation as we have now: of little information on anything and late tabling of amendments.
<P>


<a name="column_915"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 915</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para0"></a>We move into an area where we change from a partnership between owners of properties and local authorities into confiscation. The Government are giving draconian powers to local authorities to take away someone's private property for a period of years. That should be done only with the greatest reluctance and after the greatest scrutiny. We are only just beginning our scrutiny and the other place will not scrutinise the provision at all.
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para1"></a>The Minister said that he listened to the committee in another place that analysed the draft Bill. If he listened to the committee on this issue I only wish that he had listened to its other recommendations when it comes to the home condition report and the pack we are about to discuss under Part 5, because clearly they have not listened to the committee at all on those issues.

<P>

<a name="40913-07_para2"></a>The Minister kindly put in the Printed Paper Office the final regulatory impact assessment, which he signed on 7   September. Four different options were put forward. Option 1 was the status quo and options 2, 3 and 4 referred to EDMOs. Under option 2, there are 165,000 properties at stake. Under option 3, about 300,000 are involved, and under option 4, 165,000 properties, the same as in option 2. Needless to say, the Government have gone for the largest number of properties. Will the Minister explain why that action was taken?
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para3"></a>When the Government are doing something as controversial as this, would it not have been sensible to go for either option 2 or option 4, where a smaller number of properties is available, to see how that worked before tackling a bigger problem?
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para4"></a>When we look at the results of the consultation and the analysis, it does not surprise me considering that the majority of the respondents were either local authorities or housing organisations. Out of the 134   respondents, only 10 were individuals. That tends to be the case, but it is a bad way to make decisions. The Government decided to go for option 3, which is the preferred option of only 14 per cent of the respondents. Why are they making decisions when such a small minority is in favour of such a draconian power?
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para5"></a>Like the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, I have not had the chance to look at the amendment in as much detail as I would have liked. From what she says, I know that I have carried out less work than she has. Is it true that the EDMO has to have a tribunal agreement; does the local authority have to have the tribunal's agreement before it makes an EDMO, or can it make one without the tribunal?
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para6"></a>Does the local authority have to act on every one of the tribunal's decisions, or if the tribunal makes a set of recommendations, can it ignore them and do its own thing? I was confused when the Minister talked about compensation to the owner. I will read in the <i>Official Report </i>tomorrow what he said, but when he replies will he say a little more about how compensation to the owner will work? That might be helpful.


<P>

<a name="40913-07_para7"></a>Can the Minster confirm that when a local authority confiscates a property from an owner under an EDMO, it will take on all the liabilities that go with the <P>


<a name="column_916"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 916</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>property? If it is a flat, can he confirm whether the rental will be paid; and, if it is a house or a flat, whether the council tax, the water rates and so on will be paid by the local authority?
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para8"></a>Can the Minister confirm that the local authority will indemnify the owner once an EDMO has been taken out? Why should the owner be responsible if his property has been confiscated for a period of years? If an EDMO has been taken out, the local authority should be obliged to leave the property in good order. Can the Minister confirm that that is the case?
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para9"></a>Following up the point made by my noble friend Lord Hanningfield about the many situations that could arise and result in a property being left empty, what will occur in the case he mentioned where a family is discussing what should happen to a property, and then resolve that issue in year one of the seven years of the EDMO? Will they be able to apply to the local authority or the tribunal to have the EDMO rescinded and take back the property with vacant possession in order that they may do what they like with it?
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para10"></a>Can the Minister confirm that at the end of the EDMO the property will be returned to the owner with vacant possession and that there will be no security of tenure for any of the occupants that the local authority may have put therein?

<A NAME="40913-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   I declare an interest in that I am a member of Pendle Borough Council, an area of north-east Lancashire. I represent a ward which has a large number of empty properties. I recognise the situation described by the Minister when he refers to the problems created by empty properties in areas of otherwise good older housing. He could have been describing a large number of places, such as Colne in Lancashire.
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para11"></a>I regret having been unable to attend on any of the previous days during which the Committee has discussed the Bill because it goes to the very heart of the areas in which I have been involved for the past 35   years in trying to tackle the problem of poor and sub-standard housing. There are many decent streets of good housing in which one or two houses cause the blight of social problems described by the Minister.
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para12"></a>The aims of the government amendments are admirable. I want to stand on a little hill, wave a flag and cheer the Government&#151;which I do not do very often&#151;because their aims and objectives are quite brilliant.
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para13"></a>I share some of the questions that have been raised, including some of those raised by the noble Earl, Lord   Caithness. He comes from the opposite end of the scale of rights involved&#151;I start with the problem of the empty houses and he starts with the rights of the owners&#151;but somewhere in between there has to be a balance. Some of the practical problems that have been raised need answering. I hope the Minister will be tolerant if on Report we go into more detail on some <P>


<a name="column_917"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 917</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of these issues than we would have had they been discussed in the depth that they should have been in Committee.

<P>

<a name="40913-07_para14"></a>Having said that, I wish to raise one or two questions. I am slightly confused about some of the wording in the amendment. It may be that I have not understood it properly. It is highly complex and it is quite likely that I have not understood it properly; I look forward to the Minister explaining it to me. Under the clause heading "Empty dwelling management orders: introductory", subsection (2) of the proposed new clause states that,


<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An interim EDMO is an order made to enable a local housing authority, with the consent of the relevant proprietor"&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-07_para15"></a>and then, in subsection (3), it suggests that the final EDMO is a successor to the interim EDMO. I do not understand why it states,


<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"with the consent of the relevant proprietor",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-07_para16"></a>when much of the remainder of the amendment deals with a situation where there is no consent from the relevant proprietor. It may be that I have misread it, but that would seem to be the initial definition of interim EDMOs and final EDMOs. It is a matter which can be looked at, or it can be explained why I am wrong.
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para17"></a>The problems in Birmingham that the Minister described are exactly the same as those of which I am aware. Many properties are not in good condition for a reason&#151;they have been left empty for several years. Even in the best of areas, houses which have been left empty for several years often deteriorate; repairs are needed, water gets in, leakages are not repaired and so on. In areas which have more social problems, as the Minister said, windows get broken, kids get in, people break in and steal, traditionally, the fire-back boilers and various other kinds of equipment. Slowly, over a period of time, such houses become derelict or semi-derelict and the local authority steps in and boards them up.
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para18"></a>A process takes place: it starts off with a perfectly reasonable house&#151;which is left empty&#151;and slowly, over a period of time, it gets worse and worse until eventually it becomes derelict. I am not clear about what condition of house the EDMOs are intended to deal with. Quite clearly, if a local authority takes over houses which are not in a decent condition for people to live in, which are not fit to live in or do not meet the new health and safety housing standards, how much spending on such houses will the Government expect local authorities reasonably to undertake?
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para19"></a>If it is a question of a few hundred pounds to put them in order, that would be one thing, but with many of these houses you are talking about thousands of   pounds. A figure of &#163;20,000 is not unusual for a house which a local authority may, at the moment, compulsory purchase because it is in such a poor condition. It then has to do it up. It might be more than &#163;20,000, but taking that figure, if you let the property for, say, &#163;60 a week, which might be on the low side, it would take seven years to recoup the money&#151;and that is assuming that there are no other management costs <P>


<a name="column_918"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 918</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>associated with it and no on-going repairs in the future, which quite clearly there will be. It may therefore be a long-term operation.
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para20"></a>I am not clear from what the Minister said and from what the amendment sets out whether it is really intended to deal with that kind of situation or whether, if a house reaches a condition below a certain threshold, other measures will be brought in. If the house is in one of the new select licensing areas, if I have got the terminology right, it may be that the other measures will be there to deal with the matter and the authority may have to go down the CPO route.
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para21"></a>But if a property is not in such an area&#151;and, as I understand it, the EDMOs are designed to deal with properties which are not in these designated areas&#151;it may be much more difficult. I should like to get my mind around this question and understand the Government's thinking about the circumstances in which these orders might be made.

<P>

<a name="40913-07_para22"></a>I take the point made by the noble Earl, Lord   Caithness, about the combination of sticks and carrots and that this is all sticks. In the old days&#151;I say the "old days"; I am going back to the 1970s, when there was a great deal more money in areas such as my own for improvement grants&#151;local authorities had far more resources than they have now, or at least have had until the recent housing market collapse in partnership areas. We are one of those areas and so we may now be getting far more resources to deal with these problems in different ways.
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para23"></a>The annual capital programme for housing of my own authority of Pendle, for example, was up to &#163;6   million or &#163;7 million in the late 1970s, which was a reasonable amount of money for an ordinary small district. Despite inflation, that amount fell towards the end of the 1990s to less than &#163;2 million. So the amount of money available to local authorities in many of those areas collapsed. Of course, some of that money had to be spent on council housing as well, although in many authorities in north-east Lancashire and others with lots of old terraced housing, the proportion of the HIP that went into the private sector was always much higher than went into council housing. That was just the nature of the situation.
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para24"></a>So resources were not there. I was chairman of my local authority's housing committee, for my sins, back in the mid-1970s. We used to have a combined carrot-and-stick approach of saying to owners of empty properties such as those which the proposals concern, "We're going to CPO it, but we don't want to CPO it. And we will give you a grant. We will work with you to do the house up and do it that way". That approach fell by the wayside when it stopped being possible for local authorities to give grants to private landlords in that way and they had to rely more on the stick than the carrot. Since the local authority did not have the resources anyway, the number of houses which were dealt with like that went down from scores every year to a handful.
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para25"></a>If the Government now intend to allow local authorities to intervene again and to tackle the problem of houses which I call "rotten teeth" in areas <P>


<a name="column_919"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 919</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which have a future and are not going to be cleared, but which nevertheless require this intervention just to deal with such houses, that would be very worthwhile and welcome. However, there is then the question of resources. Where is the money coming from for the local authority to intervene? If the local authority makes an empty dwelling management order, where is the money coming from in the first instance to pay for the repairs in that property before the rent starts coming back to pay for it?
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para26"></a>I am asking the Government these questions because their aims are brilliant, but until we can see how the proposals are going to work in practice, along with the other raft of measures in the Bill&#151;a Bill which I am enthused by as a whole&#151;we will not know whether they are going to work.
<P>

<a name="40913-07_para27"></a>My final point is about compensation and echoes that of the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. Compensation is mentioned in the Bill, but there is no indication of the scale of compensation that the Government think is going to be involved. Will compensation be paid exceptionally&#151;something that happens now and again&#151;or will it be paid as a matter of course? On what kind of scale will it be paid? Will it be related to rents? Will it be related to capital values when the houses are taken over? Or will it be related to capital values after the council has fettled the houses up and made them decent? The whole question of compensation needs a great deal more elaboration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I agree with the Minister that the problem of empty homes is nothing short of a scandal. I am also in agreement with my noble friend Lord Greaves in thinking that it is a pity that the scheme could not have been extended to deal with the large number of properties over shops which still remain vacant. Although some of them are being modernised&#151;I have noticed this even in my own area in south London&#151;there does not seem to be enough of an incentive for landlords to do it on a larger scale. Therefore, if one looks up above the shops in almost any parade in south London, one will see available property which could be put back into use and which is gradually falling into dereliction.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para0"></a>My principal reason for intervening is that I tried to find out what was happening to the contracts into which NASS had entered for accommodation for asylum seekers, but which would no longer be required because of the sharp fall in the number of people coming here and seeking asylum, bearing in mind that those were long-term contracts, some of which did not contain escape clauses. When I tried to find out about the matter&#151;first, by asking NASS and, secondly, by tabling Questions on the Order Paper&#151;I was told that those contracts were "commercial in confidence", but that all but two of the contracts signed by NASS expire some time in 2005 and the remaining two in 2006. That means that a large number of properties will be falling vacant in this sector.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para1"></a>Will it be possible to make an EDMO for properties which NASS no longer requires, but which it cannot relinquish because the contracts do not contain an escape clause? Will the Minister say how many of the <P>


<a name="column_920"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 920</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>110,000 properties in other forms of public sector ownership that were mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, actually belong to NASS? I suspect that it is the majority of them. Therefore, it is worth spending a little time thinking about how we deal with the matter.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para2"></a>NASS is the most opaque public sector organisation of all. One cannot get a thing out of it. It has not published its budget even for 2003&#150;04, let alone for 2004&#150;05, but we know that it spent more than &#163;0.5   billion in the year to March 2003. Therefore, we are not talking about small sums of money and small numbers of properties.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para3"></a>I hope that the Minister can assure me that, as part of the new scheme that is outlined in the amendments, a very close look will be taken at NASS. He should also bear in mind that if the ODPM does not do it, the National Audit Office is extremely interested in the way that NASS manages its properties.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   The inevitable way in which the amendments have been put down has meant that we have ended up with comments that would have been better made at Second Reading, but I shall add a few more questions to those that have been asked.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para4"></a>We all acknowledge that there are properties that are left empty for unacceptable reasons. How does one deal with that problem in a way that does not appear to be confiscatory and that does not lead a politically motivated local authority to act in way that it should not?
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para5"></a>The Minister spoke about compulsory purchase orders and the slowness of the process. I agree with that. We went some way in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 towards dealing with that. However, a compulsory purchase order is quite a threat. I know from my experience in my authority that a property comes back into proper order amazingly quickly at the mere threat of compulsory purchase.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para6"></a>In authorising the making of an interim EDMO, should the residential property tribunal not be expressly required to consider all the reasons why a property is unoccupied? The reasons why an unoccupied property should not be taken over are given in the Government's amendments, but the residential property tribunal does not appear to be required to make sure that those reasons are valid and have not been ignored by the local authority.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para7"></a>Should not a final, as well as an interim, EDMO require the prior authorisation of the residential property tribunal? It is our understanding that a final EDMO does not require it, but that is the moment when it all begins to bite.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_time0"></a><H5>4.30 p.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>

<a name="40913-08_para8"></a>As to the question of the rent that will be raised, and what it will be used for when the dwelling is let, is it the Minister's understanding that the local authority will have to obtain the best rent that it can? Who is the property going to be let to? If the private sector is involved, will the property be let to people on the <P>


<a name="column_921"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 921</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>waiting list, or will it be let through an agency to people who want to rent or acquire a property in the private sector? Who will manage the property&#151;the local authority, a residential landlord or a housing association? Who will have responsibility, and from where can redress be sought?
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para9"></a>I turn to specific amendments. Subsection (5)(a) of Amendment No. 171A is extraordinarily vague. What is meant by the local authority "taking steps"? When is the moment for a local authority to take steps, and after what investigations? Who is going to inquire into the reason why a property is vacant, and who is going to make a judgment on the conditions that have been laid down?
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para10"></a>In subsection (2)(b) of Amendment No. 171C, what is meant by "immediate"? An owner may be prepared to take steps to put the property right, but, if works are required, there are often delays with letting contracts, planning permission or building regulation approval. It ought to be made clear within these clauses that the   owners are allowed a reasonable time in such circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para11"></a>In subsection (2) of Amendment No. 171D, the steps to be taken should not be those that the authority considers appropriate, but those which are objectively considered so&#151;presumably by an independent person who understands property conditions.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para12"></a>In subsection (4) of Amendment No. 171D, surely if the property cannot be let, the order should be revoked. Subsection (5) of Amendment No. 171D needs to be expanded to make it clear that the local authority is under other duties as a responsible property manager, for example, securing the property and taking reasonable steps to prevent damage, preventing burst pipes and so on in winter.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para13"></a>As the unfortunate way these amendments have come about means that, inevitably, a lot of this afternoon's questions cannot be answered beforehand, there will be a raft of amendments on Report. That is doubly unfortunate, because on Report we do not have the same opportunity to intervene as we do in Committee. It is deeply unfortunate that we did not have the amendments in time for us to have the opportunity to table our own amendments, which will have to come at a later stage.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I appreciate the tone of the speeches on the group of amendments. I will not go over the details of why they were put down only last week. I will just refer to the fact that, to varying degrees, both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Party in the   Commons called for action on empty homes, as has the Labour Party in the past. We can argue about which homes are actually empty, but we are talking about the totality of such homes. The Government are now proposing a fairly modest scheme, for reasons I will seek to explain. It is not a question of fobbing colleagues off. I have specific answers to some of the questions I have been asked in the past few minutes, and obviously on Report we will have a more meaningful discussion.
<P>


<a name="column_922"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 922</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para14"></a>I have said that this scheme is essentially a longstop. It is not the first port of call. In other words, by and large it is a voluntary scheme. No legislation is required for such schemes, and we want to get the job done on a voluntary basis if we can. Regarding the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about CPOs, our central point, as I said earlier, is that we are not concerned about the dwelling's change of ownership. We do not want the state to take ownership of the dwelling&#151;that would genuinely look like confiscation. That is not the purpose here and it could destroy the scheme. The ownership of the dwelling is a by-product. It is irrelevant to what we are trying to do, which is to get the dwelling used as a home. In fact, we want mixed tenure.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para15"></a>Even if CPOs were easy, and were not long and drawn-out, there might be good reasons for not going down the CPO route anyway, as that would take the ownership of the dwelling away from the owner. I suspect that that would raise more human rights issues than what we are proposing. I take the noble Baroness's point&#151;that essentially it is possible to get voluntary action with the threat of legislative action, and in some ways that is what is proposed here, but as a last resort.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para16"></a>I have jumped the gun a little bit. Our estimate is that local authorities will make about three orders a year&#151;that is, a thousand dwellings. That does not mean to say that there will be a total of only three dwellings in each authority; we are absolutely convinced that, because of the backup of the legislation as a sanction, we will get more empty properties back into use. We do not need legislation for a voluntary scheme.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, raised the issue of technical problems with long leases. I am not a long lease expert, but I agree with him that they are technical problems. We think the detailed provisions cover most of the problems that have been raised in the consultation, but we are prepared to accept that there may be some issues about the service of notices relating to leasehold matters. We will certainly give that further consideration and come back on Report. This issue has not yet bottomed out.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para18"></a>It is outrageous that too many state-owned properties are empty, but no legislation is required at this stage to deal with them. They form just 16 per cent of all such properties. There used to be more; it is well-known that the Ministry of Defence, for lots of reasons, needs to keep many empty properties, although it floated off a number of them some years ago.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para19"></a>In the case of local authorities, for similar reasons to the private sector housing market, there will never be a situation where every dwelling is occupied, because that would block people from moving around and swapping tenancies, just as it would block them from buying and selling properties. We are concerned with dwellings kept empty for longer than six months for no reasonable reason. We are cutting out a huge number of dwellings anyway, but we want to do all we can to encourage local authorities to combat all the empty <P>


<a name="column_923"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 923</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>properties in their areas, including the state-owned ones. There is no argument that we want to deal with that.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para20"></a>I was asked to whom the local authorities will let the properties, and whether it would be to key workers. That will be entirely up to the local authority. We could not be prescriptive from the centre, simply because of the variety of local authorities, who understand the issues in their areas. If the strategic authority takes the view that for its definition of "key workers"&#151;in my view everyone is a key worker, but at present the phrase has certain definitions&#151;then that is a good idea, and it may be the case that some authorities can do that.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para21"></a>I also want to deal with the issue of "compensation". I looked through the notes again yesterday, and I have listened to noble Lords today. "Compensation" is the wrong word. I suspect the lawyers and the drafters will say that is the word that has to be in the legislation, but it is not compensation as used by noble Lords and Baronesses asking the questions. I will come back to the question on more than one occasion. The relevant proprietor will not receive compensation per se, but rather the balance of any surplus on the rent and the capital appreciation of the property. There is compensation that could go to third parties, perhaps where a lease has been arranged and a finance company is involved. I believe that human rights legislation dictates that a lease is property and, therefore, there is a degree of compensation. The idea that the owner of the empty dwelling will receive loads and loads of compensation because the local authority has taken over the management of the property is not true. "Compensation" is not the correct word. We may consider that. It certainly requires a better explanation.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para22"></a>What the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said about flats above shops is absolutely right. The separate access issue refers to the definition of a dwelling. I fully agree with those who raised the issue about flats above empty shops. Since I was responsible for the housing and planning brief, and indeed since Keith Hill took it over, we have moved much further forward and action is under way.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para23"></a>Generally speaking, the tenants of shops which are used mainly&#151;but not exclusively&#151;as retail premises and which have flats above do not want to be landlords and neither do the property owners. That difficulty has been identified for some time; we need an intermediary who can deal with that. I must make it absolutely clear that this Bill cannot deal with that. Action in the department is under way on that.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para24"></a>Subsection (2) of Amendment No. 171B refers to where,


<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the dwelling is wholly unoccupied".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-08_para25"></a>There is a reference to the rights of existing occupiers in the schedule. The reference to "existing occupiers" relates to people who occupy a formerly empty property at the point when an interim or final empty dwelling management order is made. Some tenancies were granted and the schedule protects the rights of those people at the point when the final empty dwelling management order is made.
<P>


<a name="column_924"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 924</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para26"></a>The key order here is the first one, the interim one. One has to go to the residential property tribunal to obtain that order. Following that, one can get people into the property. They are then living there and they are the people referred to. That is why there is this apparent contradiction; but there is not a contradiction because people can live in the property when the final empty dwelling management order is made. That may sound barmy, but they are there because the interim order was made in the first place.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para27"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, asked some detailed questions and I hope I have some detailed answers, although I thought that he came a little too close to defending unacceptable practices in the property market. On whether every interim empty dwelling management order requires the authorisation of the residential property tribunal, the answer is yes. Does a local authority have to act on every order authorising an interim empty dwelling management order? The answer is no. The noble Earl then asked whether the residential property tribunal has to approve a final empty dwelling management order. The answer is no. Will a local authority indemnify the owner? The answer is yes. Must a local authority leave a property in good order? I thought that was a brass-neck question. Most of these properties will be in a scandalous condition, but they will be done up, at the end of the day, by the rent obtained from the order, but they will be dilapidated. Yes, it will not be in any worse condition&#151;as left by the owner when it was empty&#151;than it was found in to start with. The answer to his question is yes, it will be left in good order.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para28"></a>The noble Earl also asked whether the owner can ask for an empty dwelling management order to be revoked. The answer is yes, if the residential property tribunal agrees. Will the property be returned with vacant possession? The answer is yes.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para29"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, for the general thrust of what he said. I almost interrupted him but decided against it. He raised the issue of how much a local authority will spend on a dwelling. In a way, it is for a local authority to make an assessment of the housing needs, market values and the rental incomes in its area. It would not make sense to spend money that it believed it could not get back, say, over a seven-year period. In some ways it shares part of the risk. It is also an incentive against local authorities spending a huge amount of money on properties that they do not own but which they think they will get back from the owners in due course. They may not get that money back from the owners in due course. They have to make a judgment about the best route in their areas. Of course, there may be other schemes that they could follow.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para30"></a>The noble Lord asked about doing this with the consent of the relevant proprietor&#151;that was under the introductory clause. The answer is that a local housing authority can grant a tenancy only during an interim empty dwelling management order with the consent of the owner. If no consent is forthcoming, the solution is to make a final empty dwelling management order. The hope is that it will not be necessary to make final orders in every case if owners co-operate with a local <P>


<a name="column_925"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 925</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authority and take on the management themselves. The making of an interim empty management order does not require the consent of an owner, but it requires authorisation from the residential property tribunal.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para31"></a>I have partially covered the issue of compensation, but I now have a note which may provide a better explanation. The note says, "More detail on compensation". As a non-lawyer and as a lay person, I believe that compensation is the wrong word and gives the wrong impression. We do not expect that compensation will be paid in all or in many cases. I can give an example. A property may be subject to a lease of, say, four years' duration. The person who benefits from the lease is not using it. We know that because the dwelling is empty. The residential property tribunal can cancel the short-term lease and so permit the local housing authority to grant tenancies.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para32"></a>The problem is that human rights case law is quite clear. A lease is a possession and if the state is to deprive an owner of his possession there must be compensation, but the compensation does not have to be excessive. In regard to the owner, called in the amendments "the relevant proprietor", there is no deprivation of a possession. There is a control on his use of that possession and so no requirement to pay compensation arises.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para33"></a>I have covered a fair amount of the issue. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked me about making inquiries. We are dealing with properties that have been empty for more than six months for no good reason&#151;I shall not go over the exemptions that I raised earlier. A local authority will have to show the residential property tribunal that it has made full and extensive inquiries about the ownership of the property, or if it has found the owner, it will have to show why nothing has been done about it. A local authority will not be able to walk straight into empty properties and get things cracking straightaway. There have to be good and proper checks. As I said earlier, this is a major change in public policy regarding private sector housing for the greater public interest.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para34"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about the level of rent and tenants. Those would be matters for a local authority. It may subcontract the management. It will have acquired the management orders from the tribunal and if it has made a final one, so be it. But there has to be a schedule. It all has to be written down and there has to be a set of rules about how a property is managed and the rents that are charged, which will vary around the country. It will be up to a local housing authority.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para35"></a>As I have said, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord   Avebury, regarding shops. He referred also to the National Asylum Support Service and to empty properties. It is interesting to see that a note has not winged its way to me on that. It is hardly surprising as I do not know the answer myself and it certainly has not appeared in any of my briefings. Such properties are, by definition, owned in the private sector; they are <P>


<a name="column_926"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 926</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>empty but income is being received on them because the Home Office, through NASS, is paying for them in case they are required.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para36"></a>It is true that contracts were taken out when asylum applications were far higher than they are now, but I defend NASS. I know that problems have arisen. People tend to forget what was happening in London and the south-east counties at the height of the massive influx of asylum seekers. There was almost a collapse in social services and in housing where there were great pressures in Kent, East Sussex and some of the London boroughs. People tend to forget what was happening a few years ago. Operating NASS to disperse asylum seekers was not easy, and from a standing start literally tens of thousands were dispersed successfully around the country so that they could pursue their claims. That was not done without massive operational efforts in securing properties. Some were local authority properties, but one has to go generally into the market because the vast majority of empty properties in this country, as I have made abundantly clear, are in the private sector and longer-term contracts were needed.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para37"></a>This is not the place for us to debate the issue of why there were no get-out clauses, but before Report stage I will find out about the number of properties and whether there is anything that could be done about that. I suspect that by the time the clause comes into force and is fully operating those contracts will have come to an end. Nevertheless, I will seek further advice on the issue.
<P>

<a name="40913-08_para38"></a>I apologise again for the lateness but it would be wasting time to go over it. We have been requested by all political parties to do something about empty properties; 84 per cent are in the private sector and that is our modest response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   The Minister's replies have been extremely helpful. There are a number of points which he clarified today, such as when consent is required and the situation of a wholly unoccupied property. It strikes me that it would be extremely helpful if the department were to produce a flowchart of what is required and when&#151;something that would help us and the people who will operate the system. That would stop me muttering to my noble friend about whether we need to ask for a recommitment of this clause.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   That is a reasonable request and I will pass it on to see what can be done. This is an innovative scheme. I do not accept that the scheme is a form of confiscation, as I heard mentioned earlier. Someone is not using an asset; it is not being confiscated&#151;the ownership and the rights of ownership are not being   confiscated. The rights of the use are being confiscated, but the asset is not being used for the greater public good. I suspect that there will be some literature produced about empty homes so that everyone understands exactly what the procedures are, <P>


<a name="column_927"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 927</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what the rights are and what happens. If that is the case, the chances are that we will get a lot of voluntary co-operation.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-09_spmin0"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  I, too, am grateful for what the Minister said. In some cases he clarified the situation; in others he confused it for me. It might be my hearing but I thought at a couple of stages he   referred to the "retail property tribunal". I think he meant the residential property tribunal. As far as I am aware there is no retail property tribunal.
<P>

<a name="40913-09_para0"></a>Given the Minister's answer to me about how the local authority should leave the property, presumably that now requires that there should be a schedule of condition before the local authority takes occupancy of the property for somebody. Is that requirement in the Bill?
<P>

<a name="40913-09_para1"></a>The Minister said that we should have a sensible discussion on Report. I do not think that is at all possible. This is such a complicated area. What we have done today is a Second Reading. I see the Whip sitting there and I know what the Whip will say when it comes to Report. We are allowed to talk only once, and rightly so. He will get up and tell us that we are talking more than once. We will not have a sensible discussion.
<P>

<a name="40913-09_para2"></a>I therefore ask the Minister to talk to his noble friend the Chief Whip to recommit this part of the Bill. That is the only way that we will get a sensible discussion. The clause will not be discussed in another place. If we are going to have EDMOs, it is our responsibility now to make certain that they are right and that they function properly. We cannot do that just at Report stage. The clause is too big, too complicated, with a big schedule. I will not speak at length when we recommit, because it would be wrong to abuse it. However, in this instance it is a very good argument to say that we should recommit just this section.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   May I&#151;




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Could I just respond to that while we are in Committee? I could go back down the list but I have just given the noble Earl more "yes/no" answers to every one of his specific questions, save for one, than I think I have ever given in answer to a set of questions from the Dispatch Box. I shall not go to my noble friend arguing for recommitment because I was able to give the noble Earl such specific "yes/no" answers to his questions.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   I was very grateful for a lot of what the Minister said. I shall read <i>Hansard</i> with my usual enthusiasm tomorrow. So far, I have read all the <i>Hansard </i>reports on this Bill. As regards the definition at the beginning&#151;I wrote down the words carefully&#151;the Minister said:


<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The making of an interim EDMO does not need the consent of the owner".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>


<a name="column_928"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 928</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-09_para3"></a>However, my reading of subsection (2) in Amendment No. 171A is that it does. It states:


<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An interim EDMO is an order made to enable a local housing authority, with the consent of the relevant proprietor".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-09_para4"></a>There seem to be two opposite provisions. I agree entirely that the threat of compulsion is put there in order to encourage people to volunteer; indeed, that is very clear. The threat of compulsion has to be there, because that is the whole thrust. However, it does not seem to read clearly
<P>

<a name="40913-09_para5"></a>The Minister also said that one cannot put a tenant in an EDMO without the consent of the owner. Yet Amendment No. 171D(2) states quite clearly that the authority, having made an EDMO,


<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"must take such steps as they consider appropriate for the purpose of securing that the dwelling becomes and continues to be occupied".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-09_para6"></a>I am not trying to pick holes in order to make dastardly political points because the thrust of this proposal has my enthusiastic support, but perhaps it was drafted in a hurry at the last minute. Perhaps people need to look at some of the wording to make sure that it works. We do not want to pass legislation and have nice glossy pamphlets telling people how it will work, only to find that it does not stack up when it comes to the courts.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Although I have not gone back to that section, the answer is probably the difference between the interim empty dwelling management order and the   final empty dwelling management order. It is the distinction between the two. Perhaps when the flowcharts are organised, the noble Lord will find that that section is clear. We will have a look at that point.

<br>
(c)   paragraph 8(4) is to be read as defining "relevant person" as any person who, to the knowledge of the local housing authority, is a person having an estate or interest in the dwelling (other than a person who is a tenant under a lease or licence granted under paragraph 2(3)(c) of Schedule (Further provisions regarding empty dwelling management orders))."

<A NAME="40913-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend Nick Raynsford, the Minister for Local and Regional Government. The statement is as follows:

<P>

<a name="40913-10_para2"></a>
"With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement to the House on regional and local referendums in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber. This follows the Statement I made in July, in which I referred to the differences of view in this House about whether we should go ahead with referendums in the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber. I explained the Government's decision to reschedule the referendums in those areas, and confirmed, against a strong confidence in postal-voting&#151;in the north-east, our decision to proceed with the referendum in that region. Members will recall that Parliament approved the orders enabling that referendum to take place.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para3"></a>"In July, I also gave two assurances to this House. First, I said that the Government would not proceed with the referendum in the North East on the basis proposed if the Electoral Commission produced convincing evidence that it was unsafe to do so.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para4"></a>"Secondly, I said that, with your permission Mr Speaker, I would make a further statement in September on how we intended to proceed with the referendums in the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber having had the opportunity to consider the Electoral Commission's evaluation report of the June electoral pilots. Today's Statement follows on from those two assurances.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para5"></a>"Regarding the commission's report and statement, the Electoral Commission published its report on 27 August. In parallel it published a statement setting out its view of the implications of its report for the regional and local referendums in the North East.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para6"></a>"The report concludes that successful elections were delivered in the four pilot regions. The commission states that to date it is not aware of any evidence to suggest any widespread abuse of postal voting either within or beyond the pilot regions. Moreover, from an extensive public opinion survey, the commission found that people in the pilot regions were satisfied with all-postal voting by a margin of two to one&#151;59 per cent against 29 per cent.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para7"></a>"Nevertheless, the commission concludes that the all-postal pilots raise a number of important issues that need to be addressed for the future development of voting methods in Britain. It makes a range of recommendations designed to make voting more convenient, to increase the administrative capacity to run elections, and to build greater public confidence in voting arrangements.

<P>

<a name="40913-10_para8"></a>"Above all, the commission identifies in its report the strong public support for electors to have choice as to how to vote&#151;a demand for choice that the commission is clear that all-postal voting does not meet. Accordingly, it has withdrawn its previous recommendation that all-postal voting should become the norm in local government elections.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para9"></a>"In its place the commission proposes a basis for future multi-channel elections to develop a new foundation model of voting. The commission undertakes to work with government, electoral administrators, political parties, and experts in access and security to design this new approach to voting which must be capable of offering electors both choice and security.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para10"></a>"It is against that background of findings and recommendations that the commission has drawn up its statement about the conduct of regional and local referendums.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para11"></a>"As regards the North East referendum, which this House has approved for 4 November, the commission has unambiguously concluded that this referendum should proceed as an all-postal ballot without changes to the process. Central to the commission reaching this conclusion is its recognition that the referendum process is already under way, and its judgment that there would be far greater risk to the process if significant changes were to be made now than if the referendum were to continue as planned.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para12"></a>"The commission recognises that the system for the North East referendum is an improvement over that piloted in June, particularly as there is no requirement for a witness to sign a security statement and because we have required considerably more assistance and delivery points, at which voters can receive help and vote in privacy. The commission also recognises that there have been no allegations of fraud in the North East, there is extensive experience of all-postal voting in that region and there is greater public support for all-postal voting than in any other region.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para13"></a>"Accordingly, the commission also explicitly states that it is not making any recommendations for change to the orders already made in relation to the conduct of the North East referendums. The commission undertakes to work with the chief counting officer and government to encourage and promote good practice within the framework of the existing order.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para14"></a>"There are therefore no grounds for not proceeding with the North East referendum. It will go ahead as planned on 4 November. We as Government welcome the commission undertaking to work with others to encourage and promote good practice, and we stand ready to play our part.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para15"></a>"I turn now to the referendums in the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para16"></a>"In its statement the commission states that given the recommendations in its evaluation report, it could not support any future referendums on the all-postal basis now being used for the North East.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>

<a name="40913-10_para17"></a>"We welcome the commission's commitment to multi-channel elections&#151;the form of elections that has consistently been the long-term aim of the Government's electoral modernisation strategy. We are ready to work with the commission on developing its proposed new foundation model of voting and we will be discussing further with it how that will be taken forward. We hope that all key stakeholders will join us. We share the commission's belief as to the importance of securing a degree of public and political consensus for significant changes to the electoral process before moving forward. And we note that the commission aims to report on the new model in March 2005.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para18"></a>"Against this background it would be wrong now to reach final conclusions on the precise timing and form of the referendums in the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber. Over the coming months, we and others will want to see how work progresses on the new foundation model, and to consider and analyse more deeply the full range of the commission's recommendations. We will then be better placed to take final decisions about the form and timing of these referendums.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para19"></a>"I would, however, reiterate what I said in July. The Government are absolutely committed to these referendums going ahead.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para20"></a>"It is important that the people of the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber should have their opportunity to express their view for or against an elected regional assembly and the associated local government reorganisation. I understand the concerns that have been voiced about delay leading to uncertainty about the future structure of local government in Cheshire, Cumbria, Lancashire and North Yorkshire.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para21"></a>"We recognise that concern and we take it very seriously. But we want to make sure that the referendums are held against a background of confidence in the voting system. We will of course aim to minimise the delay. In all events, given the need for primary legislation following a 'yes' vote in one referendum to allow elected regional assemblies to be established and the associated local government reorganisation to take place, there is no reason why this revised timetable for the referendums should cause significant delay to the overall local government reorganisation timetable.


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para22"></a>"The extensive electoral pilots last June have much to teach us all. Already they have led the commission to revise some of its key conclusions about all-postal voting which it drew from earlier smaller pilots. But the way is now clear for the people of the North East to make their choice on an elected regional assembly for their region. And the people of the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber can be confident that they too will be able to exercise their choice before too long".
<P>

<a name="40913-10_para23"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-10_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, the Minister must find himself in a state of embarrassment, having to bring this Statement which was given in the other place by his right honourable friend Nick Raynsford. First, in July, the Government had to admit that they could not carry out referenda in the North West and Yorkshire and Humberside, in November. Now, they are saying that they intend to put those off indefinitely.
<P>

<a name="40913-10_para24"></a>Of course that really comes as no surprise, as it has become increasingly clear that there is little appetite for changes to government in those areas, and should the referenda be pursued, the Government are certainly not going to win. The Deputy Prime Minister, of course, would not want to lose face in his own area on his own flagship policy. However, could the Minister tell us how much this frolic has cost in terms of government information already put out, preparatory work already done and the cost of each ministerial visit&#151;of which there have been many&#151;and public consultation prior to the announcement of the deferment on 22 July?
<P>

<a name="40913-10_para25"></a>The Government point to the words of the Electoral Commission&#151;words which I quoted to the Minister last Tuesday, but of which he did not appear then to be aware&#151;that one of its key recommendations was that,


<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there should be no further all-postal votes undertaken in the United Kingdom".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para26"></a>The commission did suggest a further examination of voting systems other than all-postal, but is the Minister really saying that even an organisation so adept and independent as the commission is going to be able to undertake an in-depth consideration of the value of all the other methods of voting, controversial as some of those will be, carry out the necessary consultation and be in a position to make recommendations by March of next year? Would any recommendations then made be expected to play in to both the untimed referenda as well as a general election?
<P>

<a name="40913-10_para27"></a>The Government have got themselves impaled on an extremely sharp hook by insisting on "messing about" with the voting system, which they have now done systematically for a number of years.
<P>

<a name="40913-10_para28"></a>Will the Minister tell the House how he expects Parliament to consider any report of the commission on these matters in a timescale that is commensurate with good organisation&#151;particularly in view of the fact that neither this House nor the other place has yet   had an opportunity to discuss the Electoral Commission's report and/or the draft Bill on powers and responsibilities of regional government in time for it to effect the one remaining referendum in the North East?
<P>

<a name="40913-10_para29"></a>Actually, this is a matter of at least as much significance as the decision on the ballot. There has been no parliamentary scrutiny of the commission's report or the draft Bill. In that regard, the Minister may be interested to recall the words of his noble friend Lady Symons of Vernham Dean when she was responding to the debate on the Constitution for <P>


<a name="column_937"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 937</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Europe (Referendum) Bill on 10 September. She said (at col. 851 of the <i>Official Report</i> on 10 September) that,


<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a referendum held before Parliament, the cornerstone and very hallmark of our democracy, has had the chance to scrutinise the"&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-10_para30"></a>in her case she was talking about the treaty but in our case we are talking about the Electoral Commission report and the draft Bill&#151;was an "extraordinary proposition". Indeed it is and it is apt to the matter about which I have just spoken. Perhaps the noble Lord can give us an indication of when such a debate might take place.
<P>

<a name="40913-10_para31"></a>The Government make much of the fact that the Electoral Commission gave the go-ahead for the North East referendum to take place with all-postal voting, but that, of course, is because Parliament had already been bounced into the decision before the recess&#151;at that stage, before it knew what the Electoral Commission's views would be and, since then, plans have been underway. However, having set up the Electoral Commission to advise them on the pilots, was it not absurd that they took that decision before receiving the commission's report? Had they not done so, it might also have been possible for the North East venture to have been conducted according to a more normal voting system, whether or not the returning officers and others were prepared to carry out the all-postal ballot again.
<P>

<a name="40913-10_para32"></a>The Minister assured the House last Tuesday&#151;the Statement does so again today&#151;that there will be considerably more assistance and delivery points in the North East referendum election. But, as was pointed out last week, the population of the county of Northumberland is scattered, and unless each village and town is assured of several such points, it means that people will still be hampered if they wish to deliver their votes personally.
<P>

<a name="40913-10_para33"></a>This whole regional government policy, as we have said so often, is a mess. It is a policy which is not even widely supported in the regions concerned and one that pretends to be about local government but is nothing to do with local government reorganisation. The Statement underlines that situation.
<P>

<a name="40913-10_para34"></a>The Minister concluded by saying that the extensive electoral pilots last June have much to teach us all. And so say all of us&#151;they have been a disaster.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I was going to say that I, too, thank the Minister for repeating the Statement, but I am not sure whether thanks have yet been given. Normally when the Opposition rise on these occasions, they remind me that I must say thank you as well.

<P>

<a name="40913-11_para0"></a>However, I am not sure how much further forward the Statement takes us. That may be because the Electoral Commission made its report when Parliament was in recess and there has been a certain amount of discussion of the issue in the media. Nevertheless, of course one must welcome the information.
<P>


<a name="column_938"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 938</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-11_para1"></a>First, I put on record that we on these Benches are delighted that the Electoral Commission has rejected all-postal voting for local elections. The Statement refers to public confidence. I have to say that in my mind public confidence is not satisfied by references only to fraud which leads to successful prosecution. Although I have not read the whole Electoral Commission report, by definition it is the case that there are more allegations of fraud, thus undermining public confidence, than there are successful prosecutions or prosecutions at all. To take one point, we all know the difficulty of persuading witnesses to testify.
<P>

<a name="40913-11_para2"></a>The report refers to the demand for choice. I support that, but it also refers to developing a new foundation model of voting. I have to say that I am not persuaded by the jargon. I would be more persuaded if the new foundation model looked at matters from the point of view of the voter and considered all the issues thrown up in the experience of voters and, no doubt, in the experience of many of your Lordships who have played a part in recent elections. I refer to matters such as considering the timing of the various steps taken in the electoral process so that, for example, ballot papers do not arrive before official information about the election in question, and being clear to the voter about the fact that a postal ballot can be delivered on the day of the election. I am sure we all know of voters who were disenfranchised because they did not understand that kind of issue.
<P>

<a name="40913-11_para3"></a>As regards the referendum in the North East, we welcome the fact that that is to go ahead in order to give residents there the chance to make their own decision. We have said that consistently throughout this debate. But I support what the noble Baroness said about assistance and delivery points. Much of the North East is rural and very sparsely populated, including, to my surprise, as I found out about 10 days ago, parts of Hartlepool&#151;very nice it is too.
<P>

<a name="40913-11_para4"></a>I urge the Government not to get themselves into a situation in the North East in which decisions are taken too quickly and on the hoof. The kind of muddle that that creates for everyone is not fair to the chief counting officer, to the staff, to party activists and, most of all, to voters.

<P>

<a name="40913-11_para5"></a>As regards the other referendums, the Statement ends by saying that people in the North West, Yorkshire and the Humber can be confident that they will be able to exercise their choice "before too long". Is that the same kind of language as "shortly" and "in due course" and so is not capable of very clear definition? If it is capable of clear definition, the Committee will be grateful to hear it.
<P>

<a name="40913-11_para6"></a>I must express some concern that the timing of the referendums appears to be wrapped up with the project of expanding methods of voting. They are different issues. I simply cannot see that sensible work can be concluded by next March. But I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I am the least embarrassed Minister one could ever imagine. I am also probably the least politically correct one. I am not at all <P>


<a name="column_939"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 939</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>embarrassed, and nor was I embarrassed last week when I answered the noble Baroness's question. I do not have it in front of me but it was in the following terms: "In the light of the Electoral Commission's report, why are the Government holding the referendum in the North East?" My answer, which I rewrote myself as opposed to using what was presented to me, was that it was in the light of the Electoral Commission's report that we were proceeding in the North East because that was what the report said. The fact that it said, "Don't do it at any other time", was not an issue so far as concerned the North East. I read the full report and made it quite clear what the factors were.
<P>

<a name="40913-11_para7"></a>The noble Baroness asked me about money. I have various figures but, in terms of the information campaign, I think that originally &#163;5 million was set aside for the three regions. The current estimate of the main components of that is up to &#163;3.2 million. That is in relation to the "Have Your Say" information campaign, which I think was being run. Obviously there is nothing happening in the other two regions and I understand that, in any case, that campaign has now finished.
<P>

<a name="40913-11_para8"></a>So far as concerns Parliament, we published the draft Bill. The Select Committee in another place said that it would have a look at that. The implication is that, in due course, the Government will bring forward a Bill, subject to there being a "yes" vote. I am not a business manager but no one has said to me that we should put aside government time to debate the draft Bill when in due course there will be government time for debating the full Bill. The draft Bill is there for everyone, outside and inside, to see what we have said in relation to the powers. So far as concerns a debate on the report of the Electoral Commission, that is a matter for the usual channels and it is not for me to speculate.
<P>

<a name="40913-11_para9"></a>This is a fairly long Statement but&#151;I have to be careful what I say here&#151;it did not say a great deal that was new. The one point that is new is that the Electoral Commission will look at a new model for voting and will report by March next year. That is the new bit of the Statement. That is the news for today. We made the commitment in July simply because of the hiatus in local government reorganisation. Those two areas&#151;the four counties&#151;needed to know. They all know now what was going to be on offer in terms of the options. However, that will no longer be done because there will be no referendum. That can cause problems in terms of recruitment, training and decisions to be made. We fully understand that. Therefore, we do not want any undue delay.

<P>

<a name="40913-11_para10"></a>There are some important dates about which I have been reminded. I do not know whether my colleague, Nick Raynsford, referred to them in the other place, but 16 June 2005 is important in the chronology in terms of what happens when. There are no secrets about this. Everything is in the legislation; that is, the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act and referendum orders. There is a series of things to be done after the original <P>


<a name="column_940"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 940</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>soundings and process started, and a period by which it has to be completed; otherwise we shall have to start again.
<P>

<a name="40913-11_para11"></a>March 2005 is reasonable; it is six months away. The general election is in 2006, so the law says, or certainly by 2006. I do not know what will happen in spring next year but the Government are very supportive of the Electoral Commission. We are encouraging people to work with it and with our partners in the political parties in arriving at this new model for voting procedures, which will enable us to give a settled view   and, hopefully, the opportunity to keep the commitment to people in those two regions that they will have their referendums before not too long.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, is it not the case that while this debate about referendums for regional assemblies grinds on, the Government stealthily and without any democratic mandate continue to expand regional government on the ground, hoping, no doubt, that eventually they will be able to say that whatever public opinion says now, the time will come when they will be able to say with great force, "Now these bodies have all these powers, is it not really quite wrong that they should not be democratically accountable?" Where is the evidence that any public benefit will flow from the draining away of power from existing organs of government to these new assemblies? Is it not the case that Mr Prescott seriously thinks that these new regional bodies will be more pliant and more willing to do his bidding so far as planning is concerned than existing local authorities? That is at the back of this.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, that is not at the back of this, and I wholly reject what the noble Lord, Lord   Waddington, said. The Government are clearly making use of the government offices and regions that   we inherited from the previous Conservative government. It is true that we are changing functions and structures to deliver some of the issues on a regional basis. That has nothing to do with whether there are elected or unelected regional assemblies. As I said, the regional assemblies are there; they are all unelected at present.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   My Lords, as people will know, I live in the North West and I should declare that I was elected a councillor with my biggest ever majority under the Government's all-postal vote pilots. I also have to report that the whole thing was a shambles. If we get to debate this properly at any time I will be able to tell noble Lords many things about what went on. One fellow who was sat in the sun in Nelson town centre filling in ballot papers for all his family was a well known lifelong Labour supporter. One of our people went up to him and said, "This is how the Labour Party win elections, is it?" He said, "We've had a family meeting. It's all right. We've all decided to vote Liberal Democrat this year". It was a shambles. I am very pleased to say that he was not a voter in my ward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, no. As I said, the reason for the Statement made in both Houses today is to keep a commitment that was made in July that we would come back in the short September Session to make a Statement that would be relevant particularly to those areas where there is "local government blight", if I can put it that way. Clearly, there is local government blight in those four counties and they needed to have a further Statement of the Government's view. The Government will give their views on the Electoral Commission's report in due course. We have not yet done that.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, referring to what was said by my noble friend Lady Hanham, the Electoral Commission did not give wholehearted support for the North East referendum. It prefaced its comments by saying that it would go for it because the process was already underway.

<P>

<a name="40913-12_para0"></a>The Electoral Commission said that it could not support the referendums for the North West, Yorkshire and Humberside and that it would further discuss the issues. However, apparently the referendums will go ahead, if there is a degree of public consensus of support, by March 2005. I did not have the Statement with me so I had to take down what was said. How will that public consensus of support be measured? What does "degree of support" mean? Does it mean if 10 per cent say "yes" or 60 per cent say "yes"? The Statement said that the Government are confident that people will be able to exercise their choice before too long in these three regions. Does that mean irrespective of what degree of support there is?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, no. I said that the Electoral Commission stated that it will report by 2005 on this new model and then we will assess how the referendums will take place in the two regions. The issue of the referendums taking place is a settled view. Soundings were taken and statements were made to Parliament for the three regions. It was assessed that there was sufficient support for referendums to take place in the three regions, with two regions not doing that. It is still valid to proceed with the referendum up to a certain date based on the soundings that were taken originally. That is the point I made. No one said that the referendums will take place in March 2005.

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 942</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-12_para1"></a>If it was the case that it is said that the referendums were already underway and that is the reason we are proceeding with the North East, they were already underway in the other two regions in exactly the same way. So, I do not rest my case on that. I rest my case on the words of the Electoral Commission report&#151;it is a brief report on the website; a couple of pages of A4&#151;which made it quite clear that it has the confidence in the North East to proceed on the present basis on a series of factors. One was that it was already underway but that could not be the only one because it was underway in the other two regions and we are pulling the plug on the other two. For all the reasons we gave&#151;more experience, more support, no knowledge of any fraud or anything like that&#151;it was confident. So, it was not the case that the Electoral Commission said, "Do it in the north-east because it is a <i>fait accompli</i>; Parliament has already approved it". We had already approved it for the other two but we were not proceeding on that basis.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, the Minister referred to the blight on the counties and accepted that there was blight. However, the Minister did not mention the fact that there are county council elections in those four counties on the first Thursday in May. That is very important indeed. The campaign is getting underway for those elections. People are already selecting candidates. I have the same doubts as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, about this foundation model and it being in place by May. There could well be a general election at some stage next year. There are rumours that it could well be on the same day as the county council elections in May. Perhaps the Minister will comment on what is going to happen with the county council elections. With the confusion in those four counties, how can they proceed with county council elections at the beginning of May?

<A NAME="40913-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My Lords, did the Minister, in kindly reading out the Statement made in another place by Mr Raynsford, re-read the answers given by the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, on more than   one occasion expressing confidence in the arrangements which we were going to be exploring during the pilot schemes? It is against the background to those exchanges and the confidence of the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, which turns out to have been mildly misplaced, that I have three questions about the period between now and March.

<a name="40913-12_para4"></a>First, has any research been carried out in this country into why there is a reluctance among other western European countries to have postal voting on demand?

<P>

<a name="40913-12_para5"></a>Secondly, while all the electoral pilot schemes appear to have been monitored so far by administrators, would there be virtue in also having an independent element in any future testing?
<P>

<a name="40913-12_para6"></a>Finally, with the extension of postal voting, and in the light of recent events, do the Government think that   Section 115 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which relates to undue influence, will need re-writing?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, they are fascinating questions. On the initial point of the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, about my noble friend Lord Filkin, no, I have not gone back and done that. If one looks at the dates, I suspect that the Government took a decision the day before I made the first Statement in this House, which I think was the morning of Thursday, 22 July, following the debates in the House of Commons 48 hours beforehand, which of course superseded the answers my noble friend had given about other matters.
<P>

<a name="40913-12_para7"></a>In other words, we proved we were the ultimate listening government by listening to what the House of Commons, the elected Chamber, said about the referendums in the two areas. We made the decision on the night, having listened to the House of Commons, which is why I then came to this House to make the Statement.
<P>

<a name="40913-12_para8"></a>I do not know anything about research on the reluctance of others. I would be interested in research on why we are not able to export our wonderful first-past-the-post electoral system to anybody. We have not exported it to South Africa or to any of the former Communist states because in some ways it is a discredited system. I say that personally; that is not the Government's view, of course. The fact is that every voting system this Government have introduced since 1997 has been a proportional voting system. To that extent, I think the Government have been a very good government.
<P>

<a name="40913-12_para9"></a>I do not think that we have ever looked at the issue of independent testing in pilot schemes. I have no doubt that the Electoral Commission, when thinking about these things and the Government's response to its report about all postal voting elections, will probably look at Section 115 of the Representation of the People Act.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-12_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I have listened to this interchange with great interest. Of course we are all very concerned about low turnouts in elections. I think that we all understand why the Government have paid so much attention to electoral systems, but I suggest to the Minister that perhaps the Government should now be looking elsewhere in relation to this problem.
<P>

<a name="40913-12_para10"></a>The <i>Survey of public attitudes towards conduct in public life</i>, which has just been published by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, reveals that of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>1,097 people consulted, only 24 per cent reckon that they trust government Ministers to be telling the truth and only 27 per cent trust MPs. It is interesting that 41 per cent&#151;an improved figure but still very low&#151;trust their local councillor, whom many people know.
<P>

<a name="40913-12_para11"></a>Perhaps the public's perception of government Ministers, MPs and councillors is the cause of the trouble on low turnout and the Government should look at that before they proceed too far in fiddling about with voting systems in the hope that they will improve turnout. The situation is very worrying. It is part of the cynicism in this country about political processes. It is much the most worrying thing that we should all be thinking about in relation to democracy.
<P>

<a name="40913-12_para12"></a>Perhaps the Government will look very carefully at the public's perception of Ministers, MPs and local councillors and whether there is something here to consider that is even more important than voting systems.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has raised important points. I was going to refer to that report later on the Housing Bill when discussing the issue relating to estate agents, because that is the one body that figures lower than government Ministers in terms of the public's trust. I do not think they are all crooks and all tell lies. I would say that about others in public life.
<P>

<a name="40913-13_para0"></a>However, the noble Baroness has raised important points about the lack of turnout issue. The turnout at the last election was 59 per cent, which is an incredibly low turnout in a modern, mature and allegedly alert democracy. But, if people think that their vote does not count, they are less likely to use it. Turnout is higher in continental Europe where they do not use our voting system.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, are not the Government wriggling in a cage of their own making? It seems to me that the people of the North East now have a great opportunity and a great responsibility. Not only are they going to be voting for what might or might not happen in their own regions, but if they take the trouble to reject the regional assembly proposals, then at the same time they would create the opportunity to remove the blight which the Government have placed on local government in the whole of the north of the country, by expressing a definite opinion that they do not like it.
<P>

<a name="40913-13_para1"></a>Of course it remains to be seen whether that is what will happen, but if the North East rejects the regional assembly proposals it would be interesting to know what the Government's view will be on the other two regions where they have putative referendums to come in the future. It seems to me that they would be wise to withdraw the whole lot.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I would be extremely unwise to comment on that question. It is the choice of the people of the North East in the referendum to vote the way they want. It would be quite wrong for government Ministers to speculate on what might happen, whatever the choice was, on the turnout, the <P>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 89, line 22, at end insert&#151; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>




<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(10)   In deciding whether or not to serve an overcrowding notice, the Authority shall have regard to the prescribed standards referred to in section 64(2)."<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-13_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 123 allows for the service of an overcrowding notice where a house in multiple occupation is considered to be overcrowded. The clause will apply only to houses in multiple occupation that do not require a licence because the licensed HMOs will be dealt with under licensing procedure. Under Clause 64 the local housing authority cannot be satisfied that a house which requires an HMO licence is reasonably suitable for occupation by a particular number of households or persons unless it meets the prescribed standards laid down by the national authority. This means that there will be national guidance for local authorities with regard to overcrowding for licensed HMOs. There is, however, no provision, as far as we can see, under Clause 123 for there to be any such guidance. This would lead to different standards being applied between licensed HMOs and those that do not require a licence. The purpose of Amendment No. 172 is therefore to require the authority, in deciding whether to serve an overcrowding notice, at least to consider the same guidance as applies to licensed HMOs. This would give them a yardstick by which their actions should be judged. The amendment would require the local authority only to consider the guidelines. It does not require them to follow them, if there is a good reason for them not to do so. The amendment would result in consistency of treatment for all types of HMOs when dealing with overcrowding issues. I beg to move.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-13_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I am again asking a question about definitions and pointers. I readily admit that it may be that I have simply missed the point. Clause 123 is about an "excessive" number of persons being accommodated. The term is also used in Clause 124. Is that "excessive" as in Clause 125, where it is not defined but is dealt with? Or is there a definition somewhere else, which I have failed to pick up? Or is it one of those things that one recognises when one sees it, without a definition?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Clause 123, as the noble Baronesses have said, is concerned with the service of <P>


<a name="column_946"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 946</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>overcrowding notices in respect of houses in multi-occupation. I understand that there has been some concern that local authorities apply different standards for room sizes and it is felt that there would be more certainty if there were a set of national standards. We have no plans to introduce national standards at the moment. We intend to consult on these provisions, as well as on the overcrowding provisions in Part 10 of the Housing Act 1985, including whether there is a need to retain the current house in multi-occupation specific provisions that are contained in the Bill under which local standards have been set. Clause 187 enables the appropriate national authority to amend or modify the house in multi-occupation specific provisions in this part by order.

<P>

<a name="40913-13_para7"></a>The noble Baroness's amendment provides that in deciding whether a house in multi-occupation is overcrowded, the local authority must have regard to minimum standards that are prescribed for licensing purposes. The overcrowding provisions in this part apply only to unlicensed houses in multi-occupation since the licensing regime itself deals with overcrowding and space standards. This amendment would result in further regulation of the HMO sector&#151;which is probably not its aim&#151;since, in determining whether a non-licensed house in multi-occupation is overcrowded, regard would need to be had of the number and quality of shared bathrooms, toilets, kitchens and other facilities. As currently drafted, the only factor of which local housing authorities can take account in determining whether a house in multi-occupation is overcrowded under Section 124 is whether there are enough rooms, <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> the number of people living in the property.
<P>

<a name="40913-13_para8"></a>We think that the effect of this amendment, which greatly enhances the local authority's power to serve overcrowding notices in respect of non-licensed HMOs and therefore limit the permitted number of occupants, would be to introduce a shadow licensing regime for the whole of the house in multi-occupation sector that is not officially licensed.
<P>

<a name="40913-13_para9"></a>On the question of whether there is a definition of an excessive numbers of persons in Clause 123(2), as dealt with in Clause 125, the local authority decides what is excessive in its view, taking account of Clause 125. The residential property tribunal will decide on appeal, if there is a dispute about it.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-13_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply, but I am slightly baffled by it because he said that it would bring more houses in multiple occupation into a licensing system. But the whole of Clause 123 is about the service of overcrowding notices. It is a clause that applies to any house in multiple occupation: not just to licensed HMOs or to unlicensed HMOs, but to any HMO. If it applies to any HMO then, by definition, it will bring it under some sort of statutory control and it is relevant to this part of the Bill and the previous part.
<P>

<a name="40913-13_para10"></a>I do not understand the Minister's reply because our amendment suggests that, as overcrowding is stated in the Bill to be a problem and local authorities are able to take action, they should have regard to the prescribed standards rather than having to implement <P>


<a name="column_947"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 947</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>them. It would bring some consistency. Perhaps the Minister might like to come back on why, when there is a clause that encompasses all the HMOs, it should become a problem when one tries to steer it towards a prescribed standard.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My mental answer just then was "No". I did not want to come back because I do not have an answer. Clause 123(1)(b) specifically refers to houses in multi-occupation not required to be licensed. To that extent, the noble Baroness is incorrect. I shall be happy to drop her a note on this matter.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-13_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I would be grateful to the Minister if he would do so because the whole clause is headed "Service of overcrowding notices". If it relates to HMOs that are not licensed, which is what we are talking about, we say that there should be regard to the standards that already exist. I thank the Minister for his reply. We may return to this, depending on his response by letter, if he is able to let me have it before the next stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>



<P>

<a name="40913-14_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: I apologise for the lateness of this amendment. The Bill gives a number of duties to local authorities to enable them to licence houses in multiple occupation. The purpose of all those duties is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of occupiers and potential occupiers of houses in multiple occupation and other residential accommodation. In enforcing the various schemes, local authorities are required to notify and to hear representations from those who might have to comply with any licence or order imposed in respect of a particular property. Although occupiers are given some limited information&#151;for instance, when the authority takes over the management <P>


<a name="column_949"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 949</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of a property in pursuance of an interim or final management order&#151;there is no requirement that residents be made aware that there is a duty on the landlord to be licensed or that the landlord may be subject to general or specific conditions if he wishes to retain his licence or avoid a management order or overcrowding notice, which we have just been discussing.
<P>

<a name="40913-14_para10"></a>Given the limited resources of local authorities, which we have discussed as the Bill has progressed, it is important that the obvious and natural ally in the introduction and policing of the above schemes&#151;the occupants of residential accommodation&#151;are made aware of the obligations imposed on landlords by those schemes. Equally, those most likely to know whether their welfare is being affected are the occupants themselves. At present, nothing in the Bill requires local authorities to educate occupiers about the powers available under the Bill. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40913-14_para11"></a>In the absence of any information being given to occupiers, the likelihood of any real benefit to occupiers is diminished, as is their ability to participate in the process. That is detrimental if we are trying to help local authorities to roll out the programme, which we all agree is a good idea. We should make sure that there is some publication and some way of communicating with residents. I beg to move.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   The amendment proposes that local authorities should provide information about their powers and duties to residents of properties affected by the powers. Although we accept and agree with the points made by the noble Baroness and the way in which she has raised them, we do not think that the amendment is necessary.
<P>

<a name="40913-14_para12"></a>There are provisions in the Bill as drafted that will alert occupiers to proposals for or the existence of such schemes. There are requirements to consult about the making of licensing schemes and to publicise them when they are made. Moreover, the Bill provides general duties on authorities to secure the effective implementation of licensing schemes. The powers and duties under Parts 2, 3 and 4 will be identical for every local housing authority, so we do not think that it is such a good idea to impose a separate duty on each authority to summarise the legislation.
<P>

<a name="40913-14_para13"></a>If it will help, I can assure the noble Baroness that the Government fully intend to promote licensing and that that will include the publication of leaflets advising both landlords and occupiers of the licensing regime. Those will be distributed nationally and should be widely available free of charge from local offices, libraries, housing advice centres, citizens advice bureaux and other agencies. I hope that that will meet the general thrust of the points made by the noble Baroness which, as I said, we take on board.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 129, insert the following new clause&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>




<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
   "POWER TO REQUIRE EXECUTION OF WORKS TO REMEDY NEGLECT OF MANAGEMENT


<br>
(1)   If in the opinion of the local housing authority the condition of a house is defective in consequence of neglect to comply with the requirements imposed by regulations under section 198, the authority may serve on the person having control of the house, or the person managing the house, a notice specifying the works which, in the opinion of the authority, are required to make good the neglect. 


<br>
(2)   The notice shall require the person on whom it is served to execute the works specified in the notice.


<br>
(3)   A person commits an offence if he fails to comply with a notice under this section.


<br>
(4)   In proceedings against a person for an offence under subsection (3), it is a defence that he had a reasonable excuse for not complying with the notice.


<br>
(5)   A person who commits an offence under subsection (3) is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.


<br>
(6)   The provisions of Part 3 of Schedule 1 shall apply to a notice served under this section as if it were an improvement notice (omitting paragraphs 12, 13, 17 and 18)."<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-15_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: The Committee will be aware that the management regulations are a detailed set of regulations dealing with the day-to-day running of all houses in multiple occupation, not just licensed HMOs. The regulations are prescribed by central government. Currently, the regulations deal with issues such as cleaning, maintenance, testing fire alarms, ensuring that banisters, stair carpets and floor coverings are safe, boundary walls are kept in repair, letterboxes work properly, gardens are maintained and that the manager displays details of his name and address. That is just a brief summary; there are other <P>


<a name="column_951"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 951</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provisions. The Government will be redrafting the management regulations, but the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has said that they will continue to cover essentially the same ground.
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para2"></a>Under the Bill, any breach would be a criminal offence. Breaches could be trivial, such as having a broken letterbox or unkempt garden. The current management regulations provide for criminal prosecution in the event of a breach but also allow for the service of a works notice where work is required to remedy a breach. Current government circular advice advises local authorities normally to resort in the first instance to service of a works notice rather than instituting criminal proceedings in the event of a breach. Experience in Leeds has shown that that is what the authority does, save in the most serious cases. Landlords are concerned about the extent to which the criminal law is being relied on in the Bill to deal with breaches.
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para3"></a>The proposal contained in the new clause would retain the existing alternative of serving a notice in the event of breach. Failure to comply with the notice would be a criminal offence. The notice procedure provides a half way house, so that one does not have to resort immediately to criminal proceedings.

<P>

<a name="40913-15_para4"></a>The Government have rejected that suggestion because they want local authorities to rely on the HHSRs to carry out a risk assessment under that system in the event of a breach. That approach fails to take into account the detailed nature of the management regulations. The failure to clean up a room in a property or mend the letterbox, although a breach of the management regulations, is unlikely to attract a score at all under the HHSR system. Furthermore, it is really a waste of resources for an environmental health officer to go to the lengthy and detailed procedures envisaged under the guidance to deal with minor matters. Prosecution is a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para5"></a>A simple notice procedure to deal with such small breaches is a useful method in the local authority's enforcement armoury and will also save costs. I beg to move.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-15_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 238A, which is grouped. We think that there has been an omission from Clause 198. My amendment replicates powers currently contained in Section 372 of the Housing Act 1985, which requires the execution of works to remedy poor standards of management. A similar power is not contained in this Bill. That is why we are moving the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para6"></a>The Government may think that everything in Clause 198 covers that, but as it is something that has been in operation for a number of years and something which officers of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health think is important to keep, I would like to hear the Minister's view on this amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   These amendments deal with issues that are similar to each other but not exactly the same.
<P>


<a name="column_952"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 952</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para7"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady   Hanham, would permit a local authority enforcing the management regulations to issue a notice specifying works to remedy physical defects if the property was defective in consequence of neglect to comply with the requirements imposed by the management regulations under Clause 198.
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para8"></a>The amendment is well intentioned but it misinterprets the purpose of the management regulations, which set out basic management duties for HMO managers with regard to those HMOs that are of the description so specified.
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para9"></a>The focus of the management regulations will be on the management of the property. They are not intended to address the physical fitness of the property. That is where the misunderstanding arises. The physical conditions of properties, including HMOs&#151;whether licensed or not&#151;and all required works can be dealt with by the powers available to local authorities under Part 1 of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para10"></a>It is not our intention to create unnecessary bureaucratic duplicate measures which are already provided for in the management regulations powers. Management regulations are only concerned with management duties while the powers provided under Part 1 of the Bill are the correct vehicle for tackling the hazards to which the noble Baroness has drawn attention.
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para11"></a>We understand why the amendment has been put forward, but we do not think that it is necessary or that it will work in the way in which the noble Baroness suggests.
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para12"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, for her amendment. It would amend Clause 198 to include in the regulations powers that enable a local authority to serve notices on owners of HMOs to carry out works or actions that may be necessary to ensure satisfactory standards of management and that they are in place in the HMO.
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para13"></a>The noble Baroness was seeking a response to whether we felt that we had left something out from previous legislation. We have not.
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para14"></a>If works relating to the physical conditions of properties are required, the powers available to local authorities under Part 1 of the Bill can be used to require them to be carried out. I understand where the demand for "works notices" under the management regulations comes from. Local authorities are used to these tools under the existing management regulations, made under Section 369 of the Housing Act 1985.
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para15"></a>The flexibility and powers for local authorities conferred by Part 1 make it unnecessary for management regulations to continue to be the vehicle for ensuring that works are carried out. Again, we do not want to create unnecessary duplication between Part 1 powers and management regulations. 
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para16"></a>It may help if I give an illustration of what management regulations are aimed at tackling. The management regulations will be able to place a duty on a manager to ensure that means of escape from fire are <P>


<a name="column_953"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 953</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not blocked. If the local authority discovers that they are, then it will be able to prosecute that person for failure to comply with the management regulations. However, if blockage of the fire escape constitutes a hazard to the health and safety of the residents, the local authority can take action under Part 1 of the Bill to require the landlord to remove the hazard. It is not necessary to confer an additional power on the local authority to serve a different kind of notice on the landlord because the type of work that needs to be carried out relates to something that is covered by the management regulations.
<P>

<a name="40913-15_para17"></a>The solution to the problems and difficulties to which both noble Baronesses have drawn attention is dealt with in the practical workings of the management regulations. I hope that that explanation helps.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-15_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. I am sure that his explanation is absolutely spot-on. But we need to reconsider what the management regulations are set to do against Part 1 of the Bill.

<P>

<a name="40913-15_para18"></a>The requirement to do the improvements which are set out under the management regulations&#151;which are more trivial matters&#151;are covered by the improvement notices in Part 1. I am not sure that I agree with that, although I hesitate to say that the Minister is wrong. I would like the opportunity to check that and, if necessary, return to these matters on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 92, line 25, leave out "or intended to be occupied"</UL><FONT SIZE=3>






<P>

<a name="40913-16_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: All the amendments that we have tabled under Part 5 of the Bill have to be seen in light of the fact that we have serious concerns as to the inclusion of this part. The Minister in the other place was able to show that he, too, had doubts about the feasibility of some aspects of the home information packs and, indeed, the home condition reports and he welcomed sensibly tabled amendments that improved the overall quality of this legislation.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para2"></a>There are many aspects of this Bill that we welcome. Part 5, however, the compulsory provision of home information packs, we do not.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para3"></a>We appreciate that the Government have had such a scheme in mind for quite some time. Indeed, the improvement of the current system by which property is bought and sold has been one of their long-held election manifesto pledges. Any initiative that attempts to improve the way in which the housing market works on a day to day basis we welcome.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para4"></a>However, the issue here seems to be that neither we, nor the property industry at large, had fully appreciated that sellers would be obliged to provide <P>


<a name="column_954"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 954</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>these packs, at substantial costs to themselves, and that the packs would have to be available as soon as the property was put on the market.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para5"></a>We therefore disagree wholeheartedly with the compulsory nature of these packs as well as when the legislation requires them to be produced and the onus that this places on the seller and their agents. As well as this, although we appreciate the need for consistency, we disagree that every house to be sold should need one.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para6"></a>To that end, I would like to begin by moving Amendments Nos. 176 and 177 and also, with your permission, speaking to Amendments Nos. 210 and 199A, which cover the issues of warranties, to establish what property requires a home information pack. The need for clarification on this point is much needed.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para7"></a>If a house is clearly derelict and in need of much renovation, why should the vendor have to produce a lengthy, expensive report on its condition when it is clearly obvious that any buyer will realise that the house he is thinking of purchasing is clearly a renovation project?
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para8"></a>At the other end of a house's life cycle&#151;the formative years&#151;how can a home information pack be necessary for a property that has not yet been built? The final specifications may need to be clarified to suit the buyer's requirements, such as issues regarding tenure and other essentials. All this sort of information, that the Bill expects to be available, may not have been finalised when the property is put on the market. Indeed, we will be discussing the timing of the production of these packs at a later point in the proceedings.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para9"></a>Likewise, if a property is brand new and entirely covered by adequate guarantees and warranties by the builders, why should an information pack be provided over and above what has already been put in place? On the issue of warranties, our amendment makes clear that a warranty provider means the National House-Building Council or another provider duly approved by the appropriate national authority.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para10"></a>Will the Minister assure us that there will be enough inspectors in place before the legislation is rolled out across the land? We accept that the National House-Building Council and other approved bodies are well qualified to carry out the inspections envisaged for the production of home information packs. But, so far, there have been a wide range of figures bandied about as to the number of inspectors that will be required. I beg to move.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   This is a new section. We support efforts to assist consumers with buying and selling houses. But, as will become apparent&#151;in particular, my noble friend Lady Hamwee will make it apparent&#151;we are very concerned about much of the detail and implementation of home information packs.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para11"></a>I support the intention of Amendment No. 199A. It is important because the National House-Building Council provides warranties for new houses. We need to be careful&#151;I have said this in reference to other <P>


<a name="column_955"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 955</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parts of the Bill&#151;that where things are operating satisfactorily, we need to be able to draw them into legislation and not work against them. Obviously, the National House-Building Council expressed quite a lot of concern about that. When new homes are first marketed, it would like them to be exempt from having to have the home condition report. As regards "second-hand" homes, the NHBC refers to a 10-year warranty. I am a little worried about blocks of 10   years, but I am sympathetic to the points that it has made. We do not want completely to do away with the present system.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para12"></a>One reason why people buy new houses is because they get a warranty and know what is happening. It may be that there is certain other information that also needs to be provided. But I hope that the Government will be sympathetic to the position of the National House-Building Council. I am fairly sure that they are, but I should like to hear in some detail what the Minister has to say about that. So I am supportive of the principle behind Amendment No. 199A.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   It was right that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, should give their broad views on this controversial part&#151;Part 5&#151;before we get into the detail of a great deal of separate amendments. I would like to express a different view on the two fundamental questions that they have both mentioned. When, if there is a duty to supply a home information pack and a house condition report, should that be required? Should there be a gap in time before it is due, although the house is put on the market?
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para13"></a>That would be severely detrimental to Part 5 and the valuable consumer protection embodied in it. If there is a time gap before a home information pack is required, that would be a blow to the intentions of the Bill. Apart from preliminary thoughts that the vendor has about wanting to sell, if he puts it on the market to the general public he or his estate agent should have the pack available. As to whether it should be compulsory or voluntary, we all know that there have been a number of voluntary schemes in operation up and down the country, many of which have been very useful. We have all seen some of the lessons that have been learnt from that.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para14"></a>If a scheme is introduced for England and Wales that is not compulsory, it inevitably means that if there are chains of vendors and purchasers&#151;we all know that that is one of the great problems vendors and purchasers have&#151;the chain will be only as good as each link. If one of those links is broken because there is no home information pack or house condition report, the rest will not go through effectively. In other words, compulsion is required to make the scheme effective.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para15"></a>It is a valuable scheme. We all want reassurances from the industry. No doubt the Minister can convey assurances on matters such as how many inspectors there will be and whether purchasers will be satisfied or want their own surveys or valuations done as well, which would somewhat destroy the purpose. We all want answers to those questions. But if, from the <P>


<a name="column_956"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 956</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>beginning of the discussion on Part 5, we allow some period when the vendor markets the property but does not have to produce the pack and, <i>a fortiori</i>, if we have the scheme only voluntarily and not compulsorily, we would probably be wasting our time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-16_spmin1"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  I am sure that we will come on to the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. In fact, I think that we start looking at the points he raised at the next amendment. This is a different amendment. I must declare my interest. I am a consultant to an estate agency in London. I am a surveyor and have practised for probably more years than I care to remember just at the moment.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para16"></a>I should like to raise one point of major concern with the Minister; that is, the lack of response and information that I have received from his department. At Second Reading, I raised a lot of issues; it was only last Friday that I received the final piece of information. On 26 June, I received a letter from the Minister in which he said that he would write in more detail in days to come. I looked forward to receiving that letter. Coincidentally, I wrote to him on 26 June, reminding him that, with Committee stage coming up, I was looking forward to receiving a detailed reply. On 15 July, the Minister wrote a letter that I did not receive. But that did not answer any of my specific points. I got answers to those specific points only on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of last week.
<P>

<a name="40913-16_para17"></a>This is a completely new part of the Bill; that is, Prescott's penalty on property owners. It is new, unchartered territory. No other country in the world does what we are going to do. Therefore, it needs to be scrutinised with very great care. The amendments were ably introduced by my noble friend. But I want to clarify with the Minister how one is supposed to produce, as an agent, a home information pack containing a home condition report when one is selling a property that has not yet been built from a plan. There is a show house. The next house will be identical. Someone comes along wanting to buy it straight off the plan. A home information pack cannot be produced. If a property is three-quarters built, a home information pack cannot be produced, let alone a home condition report. This part of the Bill therefore starts off as a nonsense. I therefore strongly support my noble friend Lord Hanningfield in moving the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I have not taken part in discussions so far on this Bill. This is the part of the Bill in which I have a particular interest&#151;perhaps I should declare an interest. There is another major problem. As regards houses that have not been built, valid points have been made, although, presumably, one would be able to say that they will be built to a certain specification.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para0"></a>I am more concerned about how one gets anyone along to certify exactly the condition of a building. Many people may find themselves in that difficulty. My home in London is surrounded by redevelopment. In fact, 20 years ago, I had to rebuild my whole house. The building opposite went down three storeys <P>


<a name="column_957"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 957</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>underground and split my house apart. If the seller's pack had existed, perhaps the vendor would have revealed to me that the house was fatally flawed, and it might have helped me.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para1"></a>Since then, all those big buildings that were built then have been demolished and they are rebuilding everything. Pretty well everyone in the area has cracks developing in their houses. Now, no one can get any surveyor round to look at the cracks. Although you would imagine that the groups that were just finishing building would want to be quite sure of the condition of your house, so that they did not get the blame for what the next huge developer is going to do, this is not the case. Certainly, surveyors who were asked to come in July to look at new cracks developing have not been seen yet.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para2"></a>What concerns me&#151;and I speak as a dentist who knows how hard it is to get a dentist at the moment&#151;is how you are going to find enough surveyors or qualified people to comply with all of these home information packs. There is real cause for concern there. The Minister will have to satisfy the Committee that people will be in sufficient quantity, and sufficiently available, at a cost that people can afford if they want to sell their property, whether is it new or old. Certainly, in the area of London I have spoken about, you could not possibly produce a pack if you could not get anyone to walk in the door. It may be that we will all be bidding up more and more, and whoever pays the surveyor most will get one to come to their house. Who knows? But it is just not good enough. This is a very important point.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para3"></a>Another important point is that when the housing market is running hot, as it was in the past when houses were selling so quickly, you would have to be very quick with your pack. But it is quite a different matter if the market is slow, and your house is on the market possibly for a year or two. How many packs are you going to have to produce in that time? I see that there is a later amendment which says the pack must not be more than three months old. That is quite a horrific thought&#151;you would have to pay repeatedly for the same conditional survey to be made. This part of the Bill really causes worries.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I want to address Amendments Nos. 210 and 199A, because there seems to be some misunderstanding of the issue of a warranty, and a more fundamental misunderstanding about the very valuable purpose of the home condition report and the home information pack. Since everyone has been making mini-Second Reading speeches about this section, I might as well join in and say that I am a great fan of both of those provisions, and I think they will help considerably in a number of ways.

<P>

<a name="40913-17_para4"></a>One of the issues I want to raise in the context of these two amendments has not been raised previously. The warranty that a house has as a new build primarily relates to the structure and condition of the building. The home condition report contains other elements, for example, the environmental efficiency of the building, which are important concerns to the purchaser in terms of what <P>


<a name="column_958"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 958</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that will do to future fuel bills, as well as, I hope, to many purchasers in terms of the environmental impact that their intended purchase will have. I hope also, being a great fan of the home information pack and the condition report, that we will see other environmental condition issues associated with that. The provisions already contain information about flood risk management, which is of vital importance to buyers of property.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para5"></a>I hope that the Minister, in dealing with these two amendments, will recognise that the warranty is only very partial in what it covers. I take the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, that if the system is working then it should not be amended. The warranty will no doubt be a very valuable input into the home condition report for those houses that are new.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   As this is the first time that I have contributed to the debate, I had better declare an interest as a solicitor whose firm does lots of conveyancing. I myself used to do a lot. I would like to illustrate what the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, said about the virtue of Amendments Nos. 199A and 210. It seems to me that if those were added they would exclude from the purview of the HIP a considerable number of transactions. I am as keen as anyone to improve our conveyancing system, to make it easier and less expensive. But I do not think there is any point in trying to pretend that the HIP will make things any cheaper.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para6"></a>If one considers the prospect of a pack becoming out of date when the market is flat&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, said, it is commonplace for properties to be around for well in excess of the likely period after which one is going to have to renew surveys and searches&#151;then one is really into major expenditure. I do not know whether the statistic has been given hitherto, but to give one specific example of my home patch in Suffolk, Babergh District Council now charges &#163;129 for a basic search. It charges another &#163;74&#151;and this is national&#151;for drainage and environmental searches, and it charges &#163;10 extra for each of 15 optional enquiries. So if one had the whole 15 optional enquiries, plus the basic search, plus the drainage and environmental searches, one is talking of &#163;350. And many local authorities charge a lot more than &#163;129 for basic searches.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para7"></a>It seems to me that there is no point in being anything other than profoundly pragmatic about all this. If these two amendments are, as I say, going to reduce the potential costs of conveyancing&#151;which ultimately, one way or another, find their way back into the system, whether through increased prices or however else&#151; without any major drawback, then I hope the Government will go with it.

<A NAME="40913-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Unfortunately, I am not in a position to make a Second Reading speech, but to answer the amendments. I am going to have to stick to that, because lots of issues have been flagged up.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para8"></a>I think I shall kick off before I start on my notes with one specific answer to the noble Lord, Lord   Hanningfield, who moved these amendments. <P>


<a name="column_959"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 959</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>He made the point that, if a house is derelict, why should there be a home condition report? If it is marketed&#151;and this is the key&#151;for residential occupation, then a home condition report is required. If it is marketed for redevelopment, then no home condition report is required. We will achieve that by regulation. I am happy to give that assurance. Quite a bit will be in secondary legislation.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para9"></a>I was also quite pleased to listen to the last few speeches, because we got away from the London-centric argument. I take the view that London is slightly different from the rest of the country. Particularly, the part of London where the noble Earl, Lord Caithness operates is completely different to the rest of London, so far as I am able to ascertain.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para10"></a>On the issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, on skills, I take the point about the shortage of people, and we will come to that in later amendments. First, we would not operate the system if it did not work, because it is not planned to come in overnight anyway. Secondly, we do not envisage a massive shortage of people qualified to do the home condition report. I think the figure is somewhere around&#151;do not hold me to this, because it will turn up later on&#151;7,000 nationally. It is not envisaged that there will be difficulty in getting the people trained and skilled to do the report in this legislation. It is horses for courses. I fully accept the point the noble Baroness made about the individual issues she raised. Nevertheless, there are many issues that have been flagged up that we will come to later. I am not trying to pre-empt those, by the way, it is just that it enables me to kick off this section and give a few answers before questions start being raised.
<P>

</P>

<P>

<a name="40913-17_para11"></a>I turn now to this group of amendments, and the two others related to it to which I shall be happy to respond. It is the Government's intention that the marketing of single dwellings for sale with vacant possession should be subject to the home information pack obligations. The definition of "dwelling-house" in Clause 130(1) is key to securing this. Making the deletion suggested in Amendment No. 176 would run counter to that objective.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para12"></a>The effect of deleting the words,
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para13"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"or intended to be occupied as a separate dwelling",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-17_para14"></a>from subsection (1) would be to remove unoccupied homes from the home information pack duties. But there are many reasons why a property might be unoccupied while it is being marketed. Obvious examples include cases where the owner has already moved, or where someone is selling the home of a deceased relative. The benefits of up-front information in the home information pack apply just as much to homes which are vacant during marketing as they do to homes that are occupied.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para15"></a>We see no reason for opening up what would be a potential loophole, as well as putting the customer at risk. This is a consumer protection issue.
<P>


<a name="column_960"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 960</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para16"></a>Amendment No. 177 would delete the words,
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para17"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and includes one that is being or is to be constructed",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-17_para18"></a>from subsection (1), thereby excluding homes which are not yet built or still in construction from the definition of a dwelling house and thus from the home information pack duties.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para19"></a>I shall seek to explain why the amendments are undesirable. It is common practice for house builders to market new homes before construction is completed. Indeed, I know that in many cases the marketing takes place before construction has even started. It is commonly the case that houses are marketed "off plan", before a single brick has been laid&#151;assuming, of course, that any bricks are being used to build the houses. That is not always the case these days. Buyers of such homes need up-front information of the sort the home information pack will provide just as much as the buyers of existing homes. This is already recognised by house builders, most of whom provide prospective buyers with a pack of helpful information about their new home. Our intention is that the home information pack will bring this information into line as far as possible with that available to the buyers of existing homes.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para20"></a>I accept that commissioning a home condition report on a house that does not yet exist, or is only half built, is unnecessary and not what we propose. The Bill provides in Clause 144(9)(c) power for the Secretary of State to address this in regulations. We will do that because we want a sensible market to operate in which people have access to better information. We are reasonably convinced that, overall, the market will operate better and to the benefit of consumers.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para21"></a>Our consultation paper on the contents of the home information pack included a proposal to allow home condition reports to be omitted from the pack for first sales of newly built homes so long as the structural integrity of those homes is covered by a satisfactory warranty. To qualify, warranties would have to provide the necessary cover for any undisclosed defects, and therefore offer an effective substitute for the home condition report for first sales of new homes. We are setting up specialist working groups that will consider this and advise us on the appropriate contents of home information packs for sales of new homes.

<P>

<a name="40913-17_para22"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 177A. This would delete the words "or may become" in subsection (2) and thus would amend the definition of "home information pack". The effect would be to disapply the definition from properties that are not yet on the market. The amendment may seem relatively innocuous but, when taken together with similar amendments tabled by the noble Earl to other clauses&#151;Amendment No. 178A to Clause 131 and Amendment No. 194A to Clause 141&#151;a different picture emerges.

<P>

<a name="40913-17_para23"></a>The amendments would open up a loophole that would enable estate agents to engage in supposed pre-marketing activities that would amount to actual marketing in all but name, but without triggering the home information pack duties, which I presume is the fully declared intention of the mover of the amendment. It would, for example, enable someone to evade the duty <P>


<a name="column_961"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 961</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to have a pack when marketing begins by advertising the property as "becoming available for sale shortly" knowing full well that potential buyers would see this as a marketing gambit. That is what it is and we might as well call a spade a spade. It is a loophole waiting to be exploited and is therefore not something I could recommend to the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para24"></a>Amendment No. 199A seeks to add a new subsection to Clause 144. The new subsections, as set out in Amendment No. 210, would exempt the responsible person from providing a home condition report for the sale of a new home. The amendment would also provide that there is no duty to have a home condition report where the property is resold during the period in which the warranty cover remains in place.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para25"></a>Although we do not intend that home condition reports should be required for the sale of new homes&#151;that is, from the builder to the first buyer&#151;for the reasons I gave earlier, we are not convinced that this exemption should apply throughout the 10-year warranty period.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para26"></a>Amendment No. 210 would have a similar effect to that of Amendment No. 199A. I have already explained that we intend to exempt sales of new homes, but still believe that the home condition report is required for subsequent sales of new homes&#151;that is, new homes that would then be second-hand. Subsection (8)(c) of Amendment No. 210 would provide that a home condition report is not needed when the ownership of a new home is transferred from a developer to another company prior to marketing and where the company assuming ownership is registered with a designated warranty provider.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para27"></a>To be frank, this provision is not necessary because the home information pack duties are triggered only when there is marketing to the public or a section of the public. A pack is therefore not required when a property is transferred from one person to another in these circumstances. It is necessary only when the property is put on the market, or where a "qualifying action" is taken by an estate agent. I can also assure noble Lords that, while we debate these issues in Committee and on Report, officials in the department are continuing to work extremely closely with interested parties to discuss all the issues relating to this part of the Bill, including those relating to new homes.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para28"></a>Because we are at the beginning of this group, I think that it is worth putting a little more on the record, although it would not normally be required. I turn to warranty schemes, which have already been raised. In our view, an effective housing warranty scheme will involve inspections at the construction stage with a view to preventing or correcting defects before completion. An effective warranty scheme will also provide a good measure of redress for the home owner if defects come to light after completion. It should provide for the builder to rectify defined sorts of defects, including quite minor ones, for an initial period and should then provide a "no fault" insurance cover for a further period against significant damage <P>


<a name="column_962"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 962</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>arising from defects in the original construction. The designation of any housing warranty scheme by the Secretary of State would be on the basis of a scrutiny of the operational effectiveness of the scheme and the extent of the cover provided.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para29"></a>As mentioned, we intend to consult separately about the designation criteria for designated housing warranty schemes. We envisage that the criteria would have regard to a series of issues: the process for vetting builders seeking admission to registers, and for monitoring builders on the registers; the technical standards laid down by the schemes; builders' undertakings in relation to compliance with the scheme standards; warranty scheme operators' arrangements for checking plans and carrying out site inspections; the arrangement under schemes for resolving disputes between owners and builders over what remedial work is needed to bring a home into compliance; the terms of the insurance cover underpinning the builder's obligations; and the terms of the insurance under which the owner can claim if damage due to non-compliance with the scheme standards comes to light following the end of the builder's warranty period. I think that it is worth putting those points on the record further to help our debates.
<P>

<a name="40913-17_para30"></a>I am reminded that I have spoken to Amendment No. 177A tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, that has been regrouped and therefore has not yet been moved. He now has advance warning of what my response will be. I apologise for that.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040913/text/40913-18.htm"/>

<P>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-18_spmin0"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  I was going to thank the Minister and remark on how kind it was of him to give me an answer to something I have not yet spoken to. However, I can assure the Minister that I will speak to the amendment in due course. The noble Lord also said that I operate in a different market from anywhere else. Of course I do; that is the housing market. There is no such thing as the single housing market as a general or specific area. The housing market in England and Wales is comprised of thousands of separate housing markets. It is different throughout the country from one area of town to another; it is different from street to street. That is why we need qualified surveyors to know the differences.

<P>

<a name="40913-18_para0"></a>The Minister spoke about the regulations to be laid under Clause 144(9)(c). When are we going to see them? I fear that much of the debate will be shoved away under the promise of regulations, but unless we see draft regulations before Report stage we will not be able to carry out the work that we need to do satisfactorily in Committee. For instance, in Clause 144(9)(c), the Minister will be able to provide for different types of property market. Where houses are of a particularly low value he will exempt them from having a home condition report or an HIP. We will create all sorts of false markets. Unless we can discuss that in Committee, the House will be prevented from doing what it should.
<P>

<a name="40913-18_para1"></a>The Minister referred to the warranty and said that there would be no HIP when it came to the first sale from the developer to the first owner. He did not like the idea of a 10-year warranty. The noble Baroness, <P>


<a name="column_963"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 963</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lady Maddock, was also concerned about it. What happens if an owner puts down a deposit on a house that is yet to be completed and for all sorts of reasons is unable to proceed with the purchase that he is legally contracted to buy? That person will then have to sell that property. Surely in those circumstances it would be wrong to have a home condition report.
<P>

<a name="40913-18_para2"></a>Would it not be wise to have the warranty extending perhaps not for 10 years but to have no HIP necessary for the first two years after the house is completed? At that stage I can see a logical argument for bringing in a home information pack. The housing market is full of such circumstances in which we will catch people and subject them to extra unjustified expense.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I did not apologise to the noble Earl for the delay in response to his question at Second Reading, so I apologise for forgetting about that. In response to his example of someone who puts down a deposit on a new property covered by a warranty, who does not live in the property but is required to purchase it&#151;I am not sure about the contractual obligations if the property has never been lived in&#151;I am not sure how the sale would figure. I shall take advice. It is the kind of nitty gritty example for which we need to have an answer.
<P>

<a name="40913-18_para3"></a>We would like to cover every property sale in the country, but to cover 100 per cent is probably not a practical proposition for the kind of example that the noble Earl has just given. I am not giving an answer, but I can envisage the circumstances of a brand-new dwelling that has been sold off-plan, where someone who has put down a deposit is for some reason required to go the whole hog and buy the property and then market it to sell it&#151;although it cannot be completed and they have never lived in it. We would not want to open up loopholes, but such practical questions have to be dealt with. That is why we aim for 100 per cent, but we will probably never fully achieve it.
<P>

<a name="40913-18_para4"></a>Forty thousand people market their property every week. No matter what happened to the 40,000 that marketed last week&#151;if any problems arise&#151;another 40,000 people will market this week. In other words, any government who introduce such a programme need to be certain that everything is in place to run the system, simply because they are people's homes and it goes without saying. Forty thousand homes every week is about 2 million per year. If something does not work, it is not just the 40,000 people who marketed last week who will be affected, but those marketing this week and the next week and the week after that. The rules have to be in place and copper bottomed.
<P>

<a name="40913-18_para5"></a>Many questions on many issues must be answered and people must be trained, as I said to the noble Baroness. No one denies that it is a big operation. It is also because the majority of properties&#151;I will not argue about the number&#151;are in a chain. That is why the system has to be compulsory; it cannot be voluntary. A voluntary system will not work, simply because of the majority of properties being in a chain. We shall come to that issue in later amendments.
<P>

</P>

<P>

<a name="40913-18_para6"></a>Twenty-eight per cent&#151;one quarter&#151;of transactions fall through after an offer has been made and accepted. Think about that: 40,000 properties are marketed every week; think about the distress, the anxiety and the frustration and the cost to the person who has made the offer and obtained the surveys. I spoke to someone yesterday who had paid as prospective purchaser for two surveys and both dwellings had fallen through: he was extremely angry.
<P>

<a name="40913-18_para7"></a>Many people are involved in this matter and we must get it right and answer as many questions as possible and be open and honest: to get it 100 per cent right will be extremely difficult given the type of example raised by the noble Earl.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   On 7 June at Second Reading the Minister twice said that he would not detain the House regarding the information and evidence on which key parts of Part 5 are based. He invited that debate&#151;I think he called it&#151;to happen in Committee. I refer to the crucial nature of the 28 per cent statistic&#151;as he put it, 28 per cent of transactions break down between offer and exchange of contract, with all the attendant heartbreak and expense and so on. Everyone here accepts that; those of us in the business have seen it too often.
<P>

<a name="40913-18_para8"></a>Have the Government undertaken substantial and widespread research among the body of people who will know this better than anyone&#151;namely, solicitors engaged in conveyancing&#151;as to how that 28 per cent figure is compiled and, more importantly, what causes they ascribe to the breakdown of transactions? They are many and disparate.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I do not have the answers off the top of my head, but there are many disparate causes, not least finding out about the property on which one has made an offer. It beggars belief that people make offers on property not knowing much about it. They will spend less time in a house than in the supermarket and make an offer. Then they start to find out about it when the seller has to give the information about what is available, rows with neighbours, fixtures and fittings, which is the fence and all the basic stuff that has to be filled in now. The majority of requirements under the Bill already have to be provided now.
<P>

<a name="40913-18_para9"></a>We are trying to get most of the information upfront to enable people to make an informed decision on an offer, knowing more about the property in the hope that the sale will take place rather than falling apart if they make an offer that is accepted. I understand that solicitors have an interest; I cast no aspersions on the noble Lord&#151;far from it&#151;but I understand that the Law Society is not very happy about the scheme. Many other people who know about the heartache are coming on board, the more they find out about it.
<P>

<a name="40913-18_para10"></a>I freely admit that the proposal has changed since the Government first brought it forward before the last election when we were criminalising people and doing all kinds of things&#151;it quite rightly got a drubbing and we have made substantial changes. I will see whether a <P>


<a name="column_965"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 965</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>breakdown of information is available, because I am happy to have a debate in Committee to see how the 28 per cent figure breaks down. I have seen so much about it over the past few months, but I am not sure whether there is a breakdown of the figure.






<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. It is very important that he should do that. When he replies, will he make reference to the Home Office document on this issue, which it describes as a "small study by economic consultants"? It concluded that the proposed HIP could create benefits. I hope that the information upon which we are proceeding does not rest upon this small study. It does not look as though it does.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   No, I do not say it rests completely upon that study. This issue was piloted in Bristol on a voluntary basis&#151;indeed, some people around the country are still operating such a system&#151;but, because it is voluntary and because of the chain system, you cannot check the effectiveness of it. That is a part of the problem.
<P>

<a name="40913-18_para11"></a>Even I have said in my musings, "This is a big operation&#151;40,000 a week across the country. We have got to get it right. Why can't we pick a region and consider everything in that region?". But, of course, you would get all the arguments about people buying and selling out of the region and on the margins. Most people will be buying and selling within the region, subject to job changes and so on, but I was convinced&#151;as indeed the current Minister has been convinced&#151;that it will not work unless everyone plays ball because the vast majority of properties are in a chain. That is the major difficulty and one which I freely accept.
<P>

<a name="40913-18_para12"></a>There will be amendments in due course in relation to estate agents who are not even based in England. They think that that will be a way around the measure, but it is not. However, there is a way around it for us.
<P>

<a name="40913-18_para13"></a>We have to face these matters&#151;it is a complicated issue&#151;but we are satisfied that this is a major consumer protection measure. I believe that it is one that will get a good wind the more information that is known about it.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-19_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I agree that it is a consumer protection issue. I am not sure whether I have declared my interest as a solicitor, albeit as one in a practice where everyone else does the conveyancing because it would not be safe if I were let loose on it.
<P>

<a name="40913-19_para0"></a>As regards the Minister's comment about people spending so little time looking at a property, with the first flat that I bought&#151;I was influenced entirely by the spiralling prices in the early 1970s&#151;I spent about seven minutes in the property, spotted the offers that the vendor had received and offered him &#163;100 more than he was asking. That was a lot of money at the time.

<P>

<a name="40913-19_para1"></a>Noble Lords have received a briefing from the National Association of Estate Agents and I take this point from that briefing. According to the Government's <P>


<a name="column_966"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 966</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>own document, <i>Key research on easier home buying and selling</i>, the most common reasons for failure are related to the property price not meeting the lender's valuation or a change in the buyer's financial status. Thirteen per cent of aborted purchases were caused by a bad survey, which is arguably the only factor that could be dealt with by the introduction of home information packs.
<P>

<a name="40913-19_para2"></a>From the same briefing, the Minister referred to the trial in Bristol. The home information packs were free of charge. There were 159 volunteer transactions during the six-months' trial period, of which only 61 exchanged or completed a sale by the end of that six months' trial. However, 4,400 sales were completed in Bristol in a six month period in the same year&#151;in other words, not the same six months. But the figures are helpful.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-19_spmin0"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  Let me put what the noble Baroness has just said in context; the 159 transactions in the Bristol survey excluded the new Beazer homes. With those excluded, you get 159&#151;which shows that it is a very small survey on which the Government have based their legislation. The Government, of course, paid for the home information packs. The noble Baroness was right to quote the key research. The valuation&#151;on which there will be nothing in the home information pack&#151;is the major cause of failed purchases.
<P>

<a name="40913-19_para3"></a>The Minister referred to 40,000 properties marketed per week, but one of the great sources of information on which the Government rely is what is happening in Denmark. We market 40,000 properties a week in England and Wales; in Denmark, there are fewer than 70,000 property transactions a year. Again the Government have used a totally wrong comparison to bring forward in the Bill. As they did with New South Wales and Denmark, they have done with Bristol. This is based on a very shaky foundation.
<P>

<a name="40913-19_para4"></a>The Minister did not answer my point about whether he will publish the draft regulations under Clause 144(9)(c) before the Report stage. It is very important that we should know.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I cannot answer that. Obviously we want to publish as much as possible before the Report stage. We want to give the House answers because that will help us to obtain a fair wind for the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40913-19_para5"></a>Of the figures that have been given in terms of failure rates, there are currently arguments that the transaction failure rate is now only about 15 per cent. But the Government have carried out an informal survey with major groups of corporate and independent estate agents. That indicates that transaction failures are still, running at about 30 per cent, and of those about 43 per cent were attributable to an adverse survey.
<P>

<a name="40913-19_para6"></a>I freely admit&#151;I almost declare an interest&#151;that in 1979 I pulled out of a purchase following a survey which stated that the roof was on the move. I have gone past the property on the train since and the roof was still there. But the report said it was on the move and I said, "No, I am not getting into that", and pulled <P>


<a name="column_967"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 967</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>out. I do not rely on Denmark but it is worth pointing out that, although it is true that it is smaller, it is a very similar market to England and Wales. More than half its homes are owner occupied; the annual transactions-to-population ratio is similar at one to 55; more than 90 per cent of home sales are conducted through estate agents; and Copenhagen, which has a population of 1.75 million, has a vibrant market and is similar to large cities in England. All the main players in the Danish home buying and selling industry agree that the system works well and is an improvement on the old system.
<P>

<a name="40913-19_para7"></a>No one is saying that it is the same&#151;it cannot be because of the population difference&#151;but, as I said, the ratio figures indicate that it is not totally unfair to look at it proportionally as a market with conditions similar to our own.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   We have many more amendments. Shall we move on to some of them?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-19_spmin1"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  I want to pick up on two points. First, to thank the Minister for what he said about the regulations. Secondly, the 43 per cent that he mentioned is 30 per cent of adverse valuation surveys&#151; it had nothing to do with the structure of the buildings&#151;and that is not covered in the home information pack. Only 13 per cent was due to an unfavourable survey. So it is not 43 per cent; it is only 13 per cent.




<P>

<A NAME="40913-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   We have had an exciting debate on the amendment. There are dozens of these amendments so we had better have another day or two for the Committee stage of the Bill. We always knew this was going to be an interesting area.
<P>

<a name="40913-19_para8"></a>There seems to be a great deal of support for Amendments Nos. 199A and 210. I repeat the points made by several noble Lords about new houses either not being completed and resold or houses being sold in the first few months of completion. I was interested to hear the Minister's tremendous enthusiasm for it all. I can remember Ministers having the same enthusiasm for the community charge and having several debates on it; they were selling it to us over and over again.
<P>

<a name="40913-19_para9"></a>It might be a good idea if this legislation was brought in before Christmas this year. My feeling is that it will be as popular as the community charge. I am surprised that the Minister said he has had many people supporting this provision; I have heard very few people support it. It is a pity that we have to wait two years for it because it might create the same reaction as the community charge.
<P>

<a name="40913-19_para10"></a>We will obviously debate the matter later in Committee, as well as on Report and at Third Reading. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40913-19_para14"></a>The noble Earl said: This is a simple amendment to which the Minister has already said a few words. I hope that he will say a few more.
<P>

<a name="40913-19_para15"></a>Clause 130(2) states:
<P>

<a name="40913-19_para16"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"References in this Part to a home information pack, in relation to a residential property, are to a collection of documents relating to a property or the terms on which it is or may become available for sale".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-19_para17"></a>I can understand why the home information pack relates to properties that are for sale, but having it relate to properties that "may become available for sale" has much wider implications. There are implications for those who are just considering selling their property in due course. The clause seems to put an onus on people to have a home information pack ready and available whether or not they are going to put their property on the market. I beg to move.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I know that the Minister has commented on these words already, but I have a lot of sympathy with the noble Earl. It may be that I did not understand the Minister's arguments, but perhaps he could set out what other stages between a sale being a twinkle in a prospective vendor's eye and putting the house on the market the Government have considered and how they came to this form of words. There are quite a lot of stages between considering putting a property on sale and doing it. This seems to be so open that it is hard to support it on the face of it.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   To be honest, I am confused. I am not clear whether the noble Baroness is supporting the noble Earl or not. She seemed to start off that way and then to come round to the commonsense view of opposing him towards the end.
<P>

<a name="40913-19_para18"></a>I have nothing new to say beyond what I have already said, except to point out that the amendment is part of a little group that is littered around the Bill that opens up a massive loophole that would enable estate agents to engage in supposed pre-marketing activities. The key question is: is the house on the market? If it is known that one can go to an estate agent, put one's head around the door and say, "Have you got a filing cabinet of people not featured in the window who think they might sell if someone wanted to buy?", dozens of estate agents, and the crooks and spivs of this world, will operate a black market and say, "Oh, you can come to us. By the way, people who put their head around the door, we'll send them up to you and if they like your house and make an offer, you don't need to get a home information pack". That would be pre-marketing that really amounts to marketing. A massive loophole would be opened up if the amendment were accepted, without triggering the duty to provide a home information pack. The amendment goes against the whole thrust of this part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   Would the Minister employ an estate agent who is going to market his <P>


<a name="column_969"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 969</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>property in such a manner? How on earth can an estate agent get the best coverage, the best price and the maximum number of offers if he keeps it in his filing drawer?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-20_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I agree with the Minister in that I would not want to open up a loophole. I would much rather that legislation was straightforward and enforceable. However, is it right to make duties enforceable, attracting penalties that are set out later in this part of the Bill, in connection with a property which may become available? I have not analysed the Bill to see whether one would ever get to that point, but it seems to be relevant to the arguments that the Minister was using.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   The "may become" provision is extraordinary. What if a group of people are sitting around a dinner table and someone says, "Well, have you thought of selling this house?" If the reply is, "Oh, I might think of it", does that mean that the house "may become available"? Or does one have to approach an estate agent? I am all for closing loopholes, but why can there not be a specific, designated means of defining when one's home is now for sale? The Minister spoke about estate agents saying a property might become available, but that is the technique that they use now. They are always ringing up and saying, "Would you like to sell your house?" Then they will say to someone else, "Would you be interested if so-and-so decided to sell?" That matching of people goes on even now. That is more likely to happen at a time when property is hard to sell. People will not be prepared to pay for a home information pack when no one is buying and when they think that they will have to repeat it. Will there be a ceiling on how much one has to pay constantly to repeat one's home information pack if it sticks?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   If the chat around the noble Baroness's dinner table is such that someone says, "I might want to do it? Are you interested?", the property is not being marketed to the public. The trigger is marketing to the public or a section of the public. I suspect that the noble Baroness's dinner table would not count as the public. It is only if a seller indicates to a section of the public or to the wider public that his property may be available for sale that he would need to have a home information pack. For the estate agent, the definition of "qualifying action", which is the trigger, is in Clause 141. That definition is quite tight. There are grey areas. We do not want to legislate for further grey areas. We want to make the legislation as black and white as we possibly can.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-20_spmin0"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  The Minister has moved on to Clause 131 while I am on Clause 130. I am not yet talking about marketing, although I shall talk about it. I am talking about a home information pack for a house that "may become available for sale". That is nothing to do with marketing. We have not come to marketing yet. I might not even employ an agent, so the clause relating to agents is not relevant yet. I am <P>


<a name="column_970"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 970</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grateful for the support of the noble Baroness, Lady   Hamwee, who, with her solicitor's brain which I do not have, also sees the provision as a problem. In order that we can move on, will the Minister have a look at this point, not from the point of view of marketing&#151;we will do that under Clause 131&#151;but from the point of view of a house that may become available for sale. For example, we may know that somebody is going to sell a house because his parents have deceased or whatever. He has not given instructions. From my interpretation, he is caught, because that house may become available for sale. He has not yet reached that stage, but the stage before that.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Perhaps I am doing the noble Earl a disservice, but as I said before it was moved, Amendment No. 177A is seductive and looks relatively innocuous. However, we are not stupid. The Marshalled List is public knowledge. As I have said, if the amendment is taken together with two other amendments, regarding Clauses 131 and 141, which is the intention, a different picture emerges. It is not as innocuous as it first appears. Taken together, they open up a massive loophole. That is what I am warning the House about, so we do not go down that road. On its own, the amendment is innocuous, and the noble Lord can make a reasonable, moderate case for it. However, the other amendments grouped with it would be highly damaging.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-20_spmin1"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  I am grateful for the Minister's last remarks, because we will come back to this. To take up what the Minister said, the Committee could accept my amendment but refuse the amendments to clauses 131 and 141. My Amendment No. 177A, which he looks at with dread, is so innocuous that the House could accept it at a later stage. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"(   )   The Secretary of State may by regulations prescribe the operational date of all or part of the introduction of this Part with regard to the capacity effectively to implement.


<br>
(   )   The Secretary of State may not make any regulations under this section unless a draft of the regulations has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament."<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-20_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: I do not wish to dwell on this amendment for too long, but suffice to say, given the debate we have already had, there is a lot of doubt as to whether the Government can really establish Part 5 of the Bill and have it implemented by the Minister's date of early 2007. We all share concerns about the level of expertise available to produce the packs. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors claims that although 2,000 of its residential property surveyors are currently sufficiently qualified to carry out the inspections needed to compile the packs, the likely need, according to the Government, is for 7,000 inspectors by 2007. The Minister said so himself <P>


<a name="column_971"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 971</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>several times during the debate. Given that surveyors will need to go through a 12-month conversion course, followed by several months of in-role training, we are being very optimistic if we think that in a matter of 24 months we will have a sufficient number of qualified surveyors to do the work.
<P>

<a name="40913-20_para3"></a>That is why, and I am sure the Committee will agree with me on this point, it is important that the legislation gives the Secretary of State a degree of latitude as to when he can go about the implementation of Part 5. I am particularly keen to see the first subsection of Amendment No. 178. The capacity to implement effectively is the point I want to emphasise. Without the necessary surveyors in place, it is not difficult to envisage the entire housing market grinding to a halt as house sellers wait their turn for a surveyor to carry out the necessary inspections. As the Minister said on an early amendment, between 1.3 million and 1.4 million house transactions take place every year in the United Kingdom. Even taking into account a slight steadying of the market come 2007, it is unlikely that number will have dropped very much. In fact, due to the demands of the Deputy Prime Minister for thousands more new houses, particularly in the south east and my own county of Essex, the housing market will be even more full. It is important, therefore, that the Secretary of State has discretion over the implementation of Part 5.
<P>

<a name="40913-20_para4"></a>I now talk briefly to the second part of the amendment, which is designed to ensure that the process behind Part 5 is revisited fully by both Houses before it is implemented. I am sure none of us has any particular desire to trawl through this debate again in two years' time, but it is important that the conditions are right for the implementation of that part. I do not need to point out that the world may well have changed a lot by 2007, both in the country nationally and perhaps quite rightly in Westminster too. To that end, it is important that the process is revisited.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-20_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has raised an important matter&#151;that of the numbers of inspectors qualified to do the job. He used the word "surveyor", perhaps loosely. I do not think it requires a qualified member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors to do the job, and, as the noble Lord is well aware, many people have talked about an appropriate NVQ that would be quite adequate. The Government's statement about 2007 is based on the view that time is needed to get an adequate number of inspectors.
<P>

<a name="40913-20_para5"></a>The key point is that this is a chicken and egg situation. If Parliament passed an amendment of this sort, the prospect of the actual introduction of home condition reports and the need for inspectors would be put that much further forward in people's estimation. As it is, with the Government's plans reasonably firm on the matter of date, once the Bill goes through there will be some sort of incentive and interest in attaining that qualification, interest which would not be there if the prospect were pushed away several years ahead.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-21_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   On the amendment, though I am not following the line of argument of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, can the Minister amplify the statement made in the compendium letter sent to noble Lords following Second Reading, and indeed the comments made today, about taking time to introduce home information packs "on a compulsory basis"? That is the wording in the letter dated 26 June. We would not introduce HIPs on a compulsory basis until we were confident that the packs could be assembled quickly and efficiently and in a form that people would find easy to use. We will come to the issue of voluntarism later. Will the packs' introduction be achieved by the commencement orders, or is there something more complicated behind it?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Off the top of my head, the phrase in the letter covers a situation where the date is set. We know early 2007 is challenging, but we believe it is possible. When we are getting close to that date, the legislation is in place and the training is under way, it will be much easier to encourage the industry to implement the system anyway, in advance of the actual date. It is not as if nothing will happen in property marketing one Friday, and then everything will all happen on the following Monday. The radicals in the industry and those who can see the benefits of consumer protection, and actually of marketing the issue as one of protecting consumers, will be up and running before the statutory date. That was what the terminology in the letter was intended to cover.
<P>

<a name="40913-21_para0"></a>We have no intention of introducing the home information pack requirement until we are satisfied all the pieces of the jigsaw&#151;and it is a jigsaw&#151;are in place. We will not, for example, introduce the home condition report until we are satisfied that adequate numbers of appropriately qualified and insured home inspectors are available. We want to ensure there is capacity in the industry to implement Part 5 of the Bill in an efficient and effective way, and therefore we will continue, as we do now, to work closely with representative bodies affected and the industry in general, as we develop the regulations and prepare for implementation of the home information packs.

<P>

<a name="40913-21_para1"></a>We have set up new programme management arrangements designed to ensure that the home information pack proposals are implemented smoothly, so the interests of consumers are safeguarded and the disruption to the industry is minimised. We do not want a black hole to appear. By and large, those arrangements have been welcomed by the industry and consumer representatives, and we look forward to working closely to achieve a realistic implementation.
<P>

<a name="40913-21_para2"></a>As I have said, the research to date suggests the beginning of 2007 is an achievable target for implementing home information packs. It is challenging but nevertheless achievable. If the blueprint shows that is not the case, we will think again. This is not our poll tax. We learnt our lessons from that tax: unless we are ready and convinced, we will not do it. Therefore, if enough <P>


<a name="column_973"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 973</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pieces of the jigsaw are put in place we shall pull back. There is no question of us implementing this proposal until everything is in place for a successful introduction.
<P>

<a name="40913-21_para3"></a>Of course, we would encourage the widespread use of home information packs well before the period of implementation of a compulsory system&#151;six months beforehand. There has been an enormous amount of government publicity and from the industry. The industry will gear up before the system becomes universal. That should give ample reassurance that a commencement order is sufficient to introduce the operational date of the home information pack duties.
<P>

<a name="40913-21_para4"></a>The demand issue was raised by the Select Committee on the draft Bill in the other place. I have repeated the assurances that we gave the Select Committee about not implementing it unless we are satisfied. Our view was that to satisfy demand for home condition reports there is a need for some 7,500 to 8,500 inspectors, assuming a mix of full and part-time working, so it will not necessarily be a full-time job: 40 hours a week. Sufficient numbers, with a satisfactory geographical spread across England and Wales, will be required. It is no good if they are all based in London.
<P>

<a name="40913-21_para5"></a>Research has been undertaken by the relevant sector skills council. We have figures; for example, from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. I take the point made by my noble friend Lord Borrie, that such a qualification may not be necessary. The Royal Institution estimated that 4,500 chartered surveyors were carrying out residential surveys.

<P>

<a name="40913-21_para6"></a>On a central basis, it is estimated that there are between 10,200 and 17,000 people currently employed in property services or adjacent sectors who may be expected to convert to work in home inspection. It is not as though we want to re-invent the wheel and that nothing similar is being done. Among other interested professional bodies, the Asset Skills research shows the following levels of interest: the Association of Building Engineers at 1,500, the Chartered Institute of Building, 500, and the Institute of Maintenance and Building Management, 1,250. A range of people in the country are undertaking similar or ancillary work.
<P>

<a name="40913-21_para7"></a>It is a matter of the industry gearing up once we have the appropriate training. Not only do they need to be trained; they also need to be insured. It is fundamental for the security of the buyer and the seller and for everyone involved in the chain that they are not just qualified but actually insured for the work that they undertake.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   In the spirit of genuine co-operation, does the Minister consider that there is no merit in having a fully-fledged pilot of this elaborate scheme before it goes national? We had a small, partial pilot in Bristol, I think, in 1997. It was a different scheme. All the packs were paid for by the Government. There are so many potential loopholes and problems and so much dissent about whether it will be more or less expensive and whether it will save <P>


<a name="column_974"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 974</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>much heartache, and so on. Might it be wise to take a county like Northamptonshire, run the scheme there full-tilt for a year and then take stock?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   When I was responsible for the day-to-day aspects of this, I raised the issue because of the scale. None of the pilots has been compulsory because there has been no legislative framework. That is an issue. If it is not compulsory because of our changed system, no pilot, however big, will tell one what one needs to know. The noble Lord makes a suggestion. Ministers are listening to what is said in Committee. At present, we intend to roll out nationally on a compulsory basis. We do not have closed minds on this. Yesterday I saw a poster which said, "Minds are like parachutes: if they're not open, they're not working". The noble Lord suggests carrying out the scheme on a county or a regional basis. This is an important issue which affects millions of our fellow citizens on a yearly basis. It is not just the individual sellers, but their families and everyone else who becomes involved. I shall take away the suggestion of the noble Lord.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-21_spmin0"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  I thank the Minister for that. It is terribly important that we conduct a better, bigger and wider trial than we have had so far. That is what the Select Committee in another place recommended, but it was turned down by the Government. I am grateful for the tone of the Minister's reply to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. As we all recall, the home information packs, or the sellers' packs as they were then known, were supposed to be in effect by 2003&#151;so they have dropped back four years to 2007. I believe that if we carried out a much bigger trial, over a longer period of time, we would still find wrinkles that would be best sorted out before the system went national.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   We have had another interesting debate on this group of amendments. The Minister said that it was not to be his community charge or poll tax. I remember many people wanting to get the matter right with all aspects planned, as the Minister said, to make everything certain. The more we talk about it the more complicated it becomes. That was certainly the purpose of the initial introduction of the community charge. Then the Secretary of State, Nicholas Ridley, decided to do it much quicker. If it had had the right kind of planning and thinking and the right time spent on it, we may still have the community charge.
<P>

<a name="40913-21_para8"></a>We have already had one bad experience this year on all-postal ballots. I feel that this could be much worse than all-postal ballots. We shall carry on and only time will tell. We shall have several more interesting debates on this theme during this part of the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40913-22_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the regulations before us today make a number of amendments to eight of the many sets of regulations which provide the structure of the old and the new child support schemes.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para1"></a>The amendments cover a range of regulations, some affect the old child support scheme provisions and some the new scheme, and the rest, both schemes. Included are amendments to the transitional regulations, which provide for the transfer of cases from the old scheme to the new scheme. Some cases&#151;linked to new cases&#151;have already moved from the old to the new scheme.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para2"></a>I could not introduce these regulations without referring to the fact, as noble Lords will know, that there have been problems with the new IT system. I can reassure the House that the agency is working closely with EDS, the contractors, to correct the defects as a matter of urgency. We have made it clear that we will not make arrangements to transfer cases from the old scheme to the new until we are satisfied that it is working well. In the mean time, we need to ensure that the legislation for both schemes is kept up to date and is fit for the purpose. Hence this group of changes.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para3"></a>This package consists mainly of clarifying and technical amendments which support the policy intention. I shall give a brief explanation of each regulation. I shall group them according to the status of the scheme, starting with the amendments to the old scheme. I am always happy to provide more detail if noble Lords want it and to reiterate that some of the changes in this package, to make them fit for purpose, are being made as a consequence of changes elsewhere in other legislation; for example, the introduction of the educational maintenance allowances.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para4"></a>To help noble Lords&#151;I hope that it has been a help&#151;we have provided a schedule to allow noble Lords to see how the regulations, as amended, will look. That is for guidance only and has no legislative status. I hope that is helpful.

The subparagraph itself mirrors changes that have already been made to the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999, for new scheme cases, so we are bringing that into line. It allows the agency to revise the decision appealed at any time between receipt of the appeal and determination at an appeal tribunal. Where the appeal is revised in the appellant's favour, the appeal will not go on to tribunal. Instead, the appellant will receive a new decision, with new appeal rights.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para6"></a>Regulation 5 amends the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases) Regulations 1992, which provides the basis for old scheme child support liabilities to be assessed. One amendment is made as a consequence of the introduction of a national scheme for the educational maintenance allowance, following, as noble Lords will know, a very successful pilot exercise. EMA payments are made to young people aged 16 or over who continue in education. In most cases the person receiving EMA will be the child of the Child Support Agency's client. But, in a very small number of cases, the beneficiary could be the client, or the partner of a client. The amendment ensures that in all cases EMAs do not count as income.

<P>

<a name="40913-22_para7"></a>Other changes have also been made to allow for travel-to-work costs to be calculated in metric measurements instead of imperial ones. The calculation will be made by a small stand-alone computer system, and, to avoid any possible confusion, forms and leaflets will explain that 240 kilometres is broadly equivalent to 150 miles.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para8"></a>Noble Lords may ask why we are making that amendment now. The regulations as they stand can be interpreted as already compliant with the EU directive because there are generic regulations&#151;DTI regulations&#151;converting imperial measurements in existing legislation. However, the regulations apply in a fairly broad-brush manner. Therefore, in order to remove any prospect of uncertainty, we have introduced this amendment which puts the legal position beyond doubt.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para9"></a>A further amendment made by Regulation 5 reflects financial help recently introduced by the Government for employees who have become fathers or have adopted a child. In common with similar payments, statutory paternity pay and statutory adoption pay are included as earnings.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para10"></a>I turn now to the second group of the new scheme. Regulation 2 amends Regulation 6B of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 which, among other things, provide for decision making in child support. Regulation 2(2)(a) and 2(2)(b) make minor clarifying changes of a somewhat technical nature in relation to the operation of what we call the tolerance rule in child support. Briefly, this rule means that small changes in income are ignored and do not lead to changes in maintenance due. The importance of that to the parent and family is that it provides parents with some stability and certainty of the amounts of maintenance payable. We all know how important that is.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para11"></a>Regulation 2(2)(a) covers cases where both income and non-income changes&#151;for example, the arrival of another child&#151;are notified together and the non-income change leads to recalculation of maintenance. In these circumstances the new liability will take account of both changes, irrespective of whether in itself the income change would breach the tolerance rule. As I said, this might be where there is a change in the number of qualifying children and a small change in net income of a non-resident parent of less than 5 per cent. In these circumstances the CSA would alter maintenance to take account of both changes.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para12"></a>Regulation 2(2)(b) makes clear how we deal with cases where an earlier reported change in income did not breach tolerance and so maintenance was unaltered. It ensures that any new liability resulting from a subsequent non-income change&#151;for example, new shared care arrangements&#151;will also reflect the earlier income change. Both changes will be effective from the date of the later change.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para13"></a>It is sensible to clarify these matters in legislation since, as maintenance is being recalculated because of non-income changes, the agency will also sweep up any small income changes.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para14"></a>Regulation 6 amends Regulation 29 of the Child Support (Maintenance Calculation Procedure) Regulations 2000. These provide for start dates for child support liability in specified cases. Some non-resident parents are liable to pay child support for children by different persons with care. Our term for these parents is "multiple parent with care cases". Existing legislation provides start dates for paying maintenance in these cases. The provisions assume that the first maintenance calculation, though in force when the application from the second parent with care was made, remains in force when liability for the second parent with care is calculated. However, this is not always the case.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para15"></a>Sometimes it will be the fact that maintenance for the first parent with care has come to an end after the second parent with care has made her application. This might be, for example, because the qualifying child in the first case has reached the age of 19 or found employment. The old scheme did not provide for this, or provided it in different ways, so the amendment provides new, initial start dates for these cases where liability in respect of the first parent with care has ceased before a maintenance calculation in respect of the new parent with care has been made. There will not be many of these cases, but, where they do occur, the current effective date provisions would be insufficient. That is why we need to make this change and remedy the gap that exists.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para16"></a>Regulation 7 amends the Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and Special Cases) Regulations 2000, which also provide for the calculation of child support maintenance in the new scheme. One amendment within this group mirrors the one which I have described in Regulation 5, providing for statutory adoption and statutory paternity pay to be treated as earnings. The remaining amendments in <P>


<a name="column_978"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 978</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this regulation are intended to clarify the legislation and to ensure that it reflects the policy intention. In the new child support scheme the maintenance due is calculated as a percentage of the non-resident parent's net weekly income. A parent with income of less than &#163;5 a week is required to pay nothing. A non-resident parent on benefit is normally required to pay a flat rate of &#163;5&#151;but if their income, including benefit, is less than &#163;5 a week, again a nil rate will apply. The amendments clarify that social security benefits are net weekly income for the purposes of establishing whether a non-resident parent can be assessed to pay nothing.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para17"></a>Regulation 9 contains two minor technical amendments to the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000, which allow for child support maintenance calculations to be varied in specified circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para18"></a>The final group of regulations applies to both schemes. Regulation 3 amends the Child Support (Information, Evidence and Disclosure) Regulations 1992. The amendment clarifies that when an appeal is made to an independent tribunal, the Secretary of State may disclose the relevant information to the non-resident person(s) with care and any other person with a right of appeal.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para19"></a>Regulation 8 makes several amendments to the transitional regulations. The transitional regulations ensure that there is a proper legal framework for the conversion of old scheme cases to the new child support scheme. They also allow changes in liability to be phased in over a period of up to five years in specified circumstances. I stress that the amendments ensure that the provisions in this area work as we intended them to. Some old scheme cases that are linked to a new application have converted or will convert early to the new scheme. The bulk of the old scheme cases will be transferred to the new scheme when, as I said, we are sure that it is working well.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para20"></a>Regulation 8(3) ensures that a conversion can happen on cases where there is an outstanding departure direction, revision or supersession which cannot be resolved until more information is provided. Here we will provide that the conversion decision will be based on the information used or considered to make the maintenance assessment being converted. When the full information becomes available, both the old and new scheme decisions will be corrected as necessary.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para21"></a>Amendments made by Regulations 8(4) and 8(7) allow the child support payable to a parent with care in the new scheme to be adjusted where a non-resident parent has overpaid maintenance under the old scheme. Regulation 8(7) also allows payments made by a non-resident parent in the new scheme to be attributed to arrears which accrued under a maintenance assessment in the old scheme. So these amendments essentially provide a bridge by which overpayments and underpayments of maintenance can be offset between the two schemes.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para22"></a>Those are perhaps the most significant changes in this package, which we readily acknowledge is very technical and very detailed. I intend to leave it there. If <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lords wish to raise other points of detail, I will do my best to respond or at least to reply in writing. The important point is that with these minor but important amendments we are trying to ensure that the new and old schemes operate as fairly and effectively as possible for the families and particularly for the children concerned. The regulations underpin our continuing commitment to ensuring that child support works for parents and children.
<P>

<a name="40913-22_para23"></a>I am satisfied that the regulations are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, and I commend them to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, the House will be extremely grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, for explaining these amendment regulations so clearly and so briefly. To summarise the changes that these regulations make to no fewer than eight existing pieces of legislation in such a way is indeed masterly. I applaud, too, the Explanatory Notes&#151;provided originally, I understand, to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para0"></a>I use the word "legislation" advisedly because one should never forget that much more law is made by statutory instrument than by Act of Parliament. That becomes especially important at a time in our history when so many Acts are framework ones, so that the devil is in the detail. Not that I have detected any devils tonight, though I do detect that amendments are being made to both child support schemes under the 1991 Act and the 2000 Act&#151;what the noble Baroness described as the "old" and the "new" schemes.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para1"></a>As I understand it, the policy behind Regulation 2 covers a situation arising under both Acts and is to do with a change of circumstance; for example, the absent parent's income or a change to the number of children involved&#151;which I would have thought would be a lot less likely. It must be very rare indeed that an absent parent of, say, two children would suddenly find that they are responsible for three living with their original partner. How many cases of that does the noble Baroness know of? Slightly more likely is a case where the absent parent has had more than one partner with children born to more than one partnership. Again, can the noble Baroness tell me how many maintenance payers&#151;because that is what we are talking about&#151;that applies to?
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para2"></a>The new recalculation rules make such perfect sense that I am surprised that they have not been in place since the commencement of the 2000 Act.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para3"></a>The clarifying Regulation 3 does not concern me. It is only fair that all parties to the appeal should have the information. However, like Regulation 4, which started under the 2000 Act, it corrects an omission, and now the revision or lapsing of an appeal against a child support decision will be the same as under the 1991 Act. Again one wonders quite how the omission occurred, but I shall leave that perhaps for another time.
<P>


<a name="column_980"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 980</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para4"></a>Regulation 5 amends the two schemes by virtue of new legislation such as the statutory adoption and paternity pay and the educational maintenance allowance. I am not clear, however, who benefits when. Clearly, the educational allowance is person specific and should not affect maintenance. However, paternity pay given to an absent father should be included in the maintenance calculation, as should adoption pay.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para5"></a>It is all, in a sense, part of the maintenance calculation procedure, whose scheme is being amended by Regulation 6, which seems to tidy up a slight muddle in the definition of the date when an award is made. Circumstances change, such as when one child becomes 19&#151;as the noble Baroness suggested in an example&#151;maintenance is no longer payable and so a new calculation has to be made. As I understand it, the new regulation makes provision for a time overlap between the absent parent being contacted either before or after the change of circumstance.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para6"></a>I hope that I have that right. It is a complicated matter. Indeed, it is so complicated that I thought I heard the noble Baroness say that a change in income of 5 per cent would be tolerated. Did she in fact mean &#163;5 a week, which I think is much more likely and is the figure given in the Explanatory Notes?
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para7"></a>Finally, I observe, however much I regret it, that the word "partner" has now become established in English law. As far as child support is concerned, it is no longer necessary to specify what it means in each and every piece of legislation. I suspect that we will see a whole lot of social security orders where the definition of the word "partner" will be cited as that in paragraph (10)(c) of Schedule 1 to the 2000 Act.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para8"></a>For years after the setting up of the Child Support Agency there were complaints of its activities, both from the recipients of maintenance and from those from whom the agency collected the money. Those seem to have died down and I have not heard of any recent problems barring the introduction of the newish computer system to which the noble Baroness referred. With the large number of absentee parents&#151;some 800,000, I believe&#151;that is surprising. Can the noble Baroness confirm that the agency is now on an even keel and that the system is working well and will work even better once the new IT is up and running?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   My Lords, I too congratulate the noble Baroness on her introduction. She was given a job to do and it was perhaps one of the worst. In my experience, when the DWP announces that something is just "technical", it is time to run for cover. However, she stepped up to the plate and she did an extremely good job of introducing what I think her colleague the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, would call "very techie" amendments. I thank her very much indeed.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para9"></a>I thank the noble Baroness also for providing the schedule of regulations. It was extremely helpful to see these provisions embedded within the clauses to which they relate. It helped to explain many points.
<P>


<a name="column_981"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 981</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para10"></a>We on these Benches welcome quite a few of the provisions. We strongly welcome the provisions on the educational maintenance allowance exceptions. We also accept the overall proposition that minor changes in circumstances amounting to not much more than a small change in the non-resident parent's income should be within what the noble Baroness called the tolerance rules. We think that that is an example of effective administration. We welcome also the exemptions on statutory paternity pay and statutory adoption pay.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para11"></a>I noticed that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, resisted the temptation to deal with the regulations that recalculate distance in kilometres instead of miles. Why we do not make the rest of Europe multiply distances by eight and divide by five, I do not know&#151;but it is a thought.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para12"></a>The point at which the noble Baroness started and the one on which the noble Lord ended is perhaps the key background to this&#151;the two IT systems that the DWP is attempting to run, both containing roughly 1 million cases but neither working particularly effectively. As my honourable friend in another place, Paul Holmes, noted, and as my honourable friend Steve Webb noted over the summer, 76 per cent of cases are on the old system and 24 per cent are on the new, but neither of the systems is working very well. The noble Baroness rather glided over that. The payments perhaps do not involve substantial sums, but they are made to people who badly need them. The timing of payments is critical to their ability to balance their budgets and the bad performance has had a major effect on their lives.

<P>

<a name="40913-23_para13"></a>One matter about which I am most exercised is in Regulation 8&#151;the provision that seems to imply that people may be transferred from the existing system to the new system with incomplete information. The regulations refer to examples where assessments are made with incomplete information. Does the department have an estimate of how many people are likely to be transferred from the existing system to the new system with incomplete information, and, on average, how long it will take to find that missing information? Will assessments and payments start to be made on the new system based on incomplete information or will there be a pause or delay between the two?
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para14"></a>The noble Baroness spoke with considerably more awareness than I have about cessation orders and continuation orders. From what she said, I take it that, if there had been an over-payment or under-payment on the old system, that would continue into the new system but, when payments were remedied, there would be a period of time under which the correction would take place. When those recalculations of payments are made, can the noble Baroness tell us&#151;perhaps not now but in writing at a later stage&#151;whether they are intended to be made over periods of time and whether they will be made in exact amounts or in bandings?
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para15"></a>I think that the noble Baroness has been given an impossible job this evening&#151;not in explaining the technical nature of the regulations but in defending the <P>


<a name="column_982"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 982</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>department's computerisation. I have every sympathy for the people who have to use the system. It is clearly extremely difficult for them to do so with any sense of accuracy, but I have even more sympathy for those who are dependent on the system for the payment of small but necessary amounts, which impact on their household budgeting and their ability to keep their heads above water.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para16"></a>I thank the noble Baroness very much for the way in which she introduced the regulations. I hope that at some stage&#151;perhaps not this evening&#151;she may be able to answer some of the questions.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-23_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful for the welcome that noble Lords have given to the regulations and for the kind words that they have offered me. I appreciate that.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para17"></a>I start at the point at which the noble Lord, Lord   Skelmersdale, and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, finished&#151;that is, matters relating to the future of the system. In evidence to Select Committees and in presentations to the House, no Minister has disguised the frustration that he or she has felt at the difficulties that we have had in implementing the scheme. Those frustrations are obviously shared in particular by the staff, who are desperate to make the scheme as good as possible, to make the payments as swiftly and accurately as possible and to ensure that the money reaches the children. We may be talking about small sums of money but they are critical sums.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para18"></a>I can tell the noble Lord that there is no doubt that the system is improving. A number of statistics now show that a steady increase in the number of cases is being dealt with and that there is growing capacity in the system. I shall give a few brief examples which indicate the volume of work with which the scheme is coping. The scheme started in March 2003 and, as of June 2004, the CSA received 404,616 applications of which 197,000 have been cleared and 117,000 have had maintenance calculations made on them. It is a huge undertaking involving a huge volume of work. Although the system did not prove as robust or as resilient as we had hoped, we are looking at a steady increase in capacity; we are dealing more readily and more speedily with the new cases that come in; and the cases which had become stuck are being freed up.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para19"></a>However, I reiterate&#151;this goes to the heart of what the noble Baroness said about overpayments and underpayments and the timescale for ensuring that people receive the benefits of the schemes&#151;that we cannot afford to transfer the old cases to the new scheme until we are absolutely sure that it is as good as it can be. That is where we stand in relation to that matter. But we are making progress and, in particular, claimants say that they prefer and appreciate the new simplified system. It is a huge bonus to them. But our prime concern is to protect their interests and to ensure that their maintenance is made, paid and maintained. I am grateful for what the noble Lord said about it.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para20"></a>Perhaps I may address the issues with which I am able to deal. In relation to the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, we do not know how <P>


<a name="column_983"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 983</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>many non-resident parents become liable for an additional child with an original parent with care or another parent with care under Regulation 2. We know that people live very complex lives and sometimes additional children are born to the original mother, perhaps following a temporary reconciliation, or other children may be born to other, different mothers. We do not collect information on that, but more commonly the issue will arise when a new child is born into the non-resident parent's new household. I am afraid that that is as far as I am able to respond to the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para21"></a>The noble Lord asked about the tolerance rule and the figure of 5 per cent. I did mean 5 per cent. For the new child support scheme, we recalculate liability only when changes in net income exceed 5 per cent of the figure used in the current calculations. I probably did not make that clear. Therefore, under the old scheme, the tolerance rule ensures that payments of child support are adjusted in most cases only where the difference between the old and the new assessment is at least &#163;10 per week. Therefore, it is slightly more complex.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para22"></a>The third point raised by the noble Lord related to Regulation 5. I can confirm that statutory paternity pay and adoption pay do count as earnings. I believe that that was the question that the noble Lord asked.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para23"></a>The noble Baroness asked me about the transfer to the new system. She raised the problem of incomplete information and asked whether we knew how long it would take to find the missing information. We do not know. We do not know many things about the length of time that matters are taking because the IT does not enable us to be certain of some of them. However, obviously we want as much complete information as possible to be used as the basis of the assessments and as soon as possible. Again, that is a reflection of how we need the scheme to be as robust as possible.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para24"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the process of overpayments and underpayments. Because this is quite a technical issue and good social security practice relates to both schemes, if the noble Baroness will allow me, I shall write to her on that point.
<P>

<a name="40913-23_para25"></a>If I have not picked up any of the questions raised by the noble Lord or the noble Baroness, I shall read <i>Hansard</i> very carefully and follow up those points of detail. In the mean time, I again commend the regulations to the House.

<P>

<a name="40913-24_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the penalty notices for disorder were introduced by the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. These are on-the-spot penalties for disorderly behaviour. Police officers may issue penalty notices in respect of offences listed in Section 1 of the Act. Current penalty notice offences include being drunk and disorderly, causing harassment, alarm or distress, wasting police time and being drunk on a highway. Therefore, they are targeted at a range of low-level anti-social offences which can blight our neighbourhoods and communities and which serve to increase the fear of crime.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para1"></a>As noble Lords know, penalty notices for disorder form an important part of the Government's determined campaign, working with the police, local authorities and concerned citizens, to tackle anti-social and nuisance behaviour and offending. But this type of offending is at the lower end of the scale of seriousness and therefore needs to be dealt with in a way which punishes the offender and reassures the community but which does not take up large amounts of police and court time.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para2"></a>Penalty notices for disorder have proved that they fulfil that remit. They enable offenders to be dealt with quickly on the street or at the police station by the issue of a ticket. A significant amount of police time is already being saved by not having to prepare the paperwork necessary to take an offender to court&#151;around two-and-a-half hours per case. Further time is saved by the police officer not having to attend the court hearing. That means that police officers are free to spend more time on the streets deterring crime and dealing with other offenders who might otherwise never be apprehended. In addition, court time is freed up to deal with more serious offending.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para3"></a>Penalty notice amounts are currently &#163;80 and &#163;40. The recipient of a notice has 21 days to decide how to respond to the notice. If he pays the penalty within that time he cannot be tried and receives no criminal record for that offence. If within 21 days he chooses instead to go to court so as to contest the notice, he may be tried for that offence. If he does nothing, a sum of one-and-a-half times the original penalty amount is registered against the offender as a fine. Such fines are then enforced in the normal way. That is very similar to the discussion we had on Friday about these notices.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para4"></a>The penalty notice scheme was piloted and then rolled out nationally earlier this year. The police have welcomed it and have asked for it to be extended to further offences. One new offence, that of causing harassment, alarm and distress, was added to the original list in 2002 and is well used, representing as it does almost half of penalty notices issued. The Government have now decided that the time is right to add a further 10. They are largely low-level offences which are suitable for penalty notice disposal or, in two cases, offences for which the least serious examples are suitable for such treatment. It is the addition of these 10 offences which we are debating today.
<P>


<a name="column_985"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 985</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para5"></a>The proposed new offences are four offences involving alcohol misuse by those under 18; three new firework offences; destroying or damaging property where the damage is valued at under &#163;500; retail theft under the value of &#163;200, and dropping litter. A further order is to be laid before the House which will set the penalty amounts for each of these offences. The order proposes that the majority of these offences should become penalty notice offences by 1 November but the three firework offences will be available for penalty notice disposal two weeks after the order comes into force, bearing in mind the proximity of bonfire night. That will mean that police officers will be able to issue penalty notices for many offences associated with fireworks in the run-up to 5 November. That should help to combat a very serious problem involving firework misuse which is experienced daily on our streets across the country.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para6"></a>As the House knows, theft and criminal damage are generic offences and can cover a wide range of behaviour. As I said, for theft it is no more than &#163;200 and for criminal damage where the value is no more than &#163;500.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para7"></a>The order which is before the House today pursues, therefore, the Government's commitment to tackle anti-social behaviour and nuisance offending. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para8"></a>Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 19 July be approved [<i>27th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].&#151;(<i>Baroness Scotland of Asthal</i>.)




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-24_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that succinct explanation of the order. The extra offences which have been added to the existing ones for which a penalty notice can be issued, which she has enumerated&#151;namely, theft; destroying or damaging property; depositing and leaving litter; and the widening application of fireworks offences&#151;clearly make a lot of sense.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para9"></a>The order also includes a widening of alcohol-related offences. While we fully recognise the dangers to the public peace and, indeed, to the personalities of the young persons, of binge drinking, I share with my right honourable friend Mr David Davis his concerns that the highly publicised plans to clamp down on binge drinking are but a prelude to the imposition by the Government of cash curbs on pubs and breweries, especially in view of the failure of the Licensing Act to address the problems posed by many pubs in residential areas. I would welcome an assurance by the Minister that he has no intention of imposing these burdens in future.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para10"></a>Turning to the modification of powers exercisable by police civilians&#151;in this House, we rise above such cheap epithets as "Blunkett's bouncers" or "plastic policemen"&#151;this is a proposal which we welcome, provided that it releases police officers to deal with more serious forms of crime. However, this widening of the role of community support officers must not be used as a cloak to avoid addressing the fundamental need to increase the number of police officers, which, <P>


<a name="column_986"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 986</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in the view of my own party, is the only really effective way of reversing the tide of anti-social behaviour and restoring respect for authority and the law.

<P>

<a name="40913-24_para11"></a>I would remind your Lordships that my party is pledged to increase police numbers by 40,000, to remove central government interference on local policing and to put it on to a sustainable financial footing, also to create a genuine partnership between police and public by establishing directly elected police authorities in England and Wales. However, with those reservations, I agree with this very comprehensive order.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, one of the reasons why we on these Benches are suspicious of secondary legislation is that when we have the major debate on the key Bill, there is always the suspicion that what is being debated is the tip of the iceberg and it is at the secondary legislation stage that we shall see what the Home Office really intends.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para12"></a>It also means that mini-debates such as this are on very narrow specifics when they need to be taken in a broader context. Most of the measures in these orders or the problems that they are trying to address are, by common consent, a desire by people to see something done. There is wide concern about unruly behaviour. The problem I face is seeing any kind of coherence in the government response. One worries that sometimes this little package or series that we see is designed to cover the Government's <i>Daily Mail </i>flank in advance of a general election rather than to put some of these issues in their proper context.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para13"></a>As far as policing is concerned, what we are doing at the moment is trying to catch up after a decade of cutting police numbers by both parties when they had responsibility for these matters. One of the advantages of being in this House for almost 10 years is that I remember pressing the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, about the Government sticking to the previous government's record and intentions on police spending and being assured that new technologies and greater mobility mean that we did not need extra police on the street. So, I am glad that there is now common consensus that we do. I should also point out that this party was advising community support officers a decade ago when again it was seen as some kind of weird liberal thinking.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para14"></a>Today most of these orders are aimed mainly at young people. Young people cause most public concern. My eyes were caught by two things: first, today's <i>Guardian </i>headline, "Today's youth: anxious, depressed, antisocial"; and, secondly, a booklet on social exclusion published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister entitled <i>Breaking the Cycle. </i>It states:
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para15"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Social exclusion is about more than income poverty. It is a shorthand term for what can happen when people or areas face a combination of linked problems such as unemployment, discrimination, poor skills, low incomes, poor housing, high crime, bad health and family breakdown".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-24_para16"></a>I draw attention to that because social reformers in all parties believed that if those problems were cured, the anti-social behaviour&#151;crime itself&#151;would diminish in the better, richer society that would be created.
<P>


<a name="column_987"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 987</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para17"></a>What is worrying about the research published in the G<i>uardian</i> today is that it found:
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para18"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The increases cannot be explained by the rise in divorce and single parenthood . . .  because they found comparable increases in all types of families, although there is a higher rate of adolescent mental health problems in single-parent families.</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-24_para19"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Nor can growing inequality over the 25 years explain the rise in problem teenagers because rates of increase were comparable in all social classes. There was no difference between white and ethnic minority teenagers".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-24_para20"></a>In some ways it is extremely worrying that this rejection of society's behavioural norms is taking place. One finds it in so many ways. You talk to teachers who find that they cannot teach because of the simple defiance of students that will not take authority. Then we find that the rules and regulations make it very difficult to exclude those who then destroy the education for a whole class. You talk to policemen who say that the youth seem to be very well versed in their rights, with very little idea of any kind of social responsibility.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para21"></a>The temptation therefore is to appease that concern by ever more draconian measures. On Friday, these orders were slapped on 10 year-olds and now we are going to fine people on the spot for theft, which seems a slightly odd way of punishing theft. It might be an encouragement to go and steal something else to pay the fine.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para22"></a>I am really putting a marker down. I know that the Government have other studies coming up on the educational and training aspects of 15 to 18 year-olds and their leisure pursuits. Some studies show that crime drops where the old youth club provisions are restored and where sport and other leisure pursuits are available. I cannot believe that that is not a better route than simply relying on ever more draconian policing.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para23"></a>I suppose it is a sign of old age when one starts thinking nostalgically. I have a teenage son. Sometimes when I raise my voice at him I think, "Where have I heard that before?" Then I realise that it was from my father. It is a difficult period, but this generation does seem to be throwing up even greater challenges.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para24"></a>I have a small point on fireworks, about which I do not think there will be great protest. Members of the general public often ask me why, when in our youth fireworks happened on bonfire night, they now seem to run for three months beforehand and three months afterwards and are let off almost anywhere at any time of day or night. If this order can help in that regard, it will be welcomed.
<P>

<a name="40913-24_para25"></a>As I say, I am worried that the motivation behind the order is not the more efficient policing to which the Minister referred but ticking another box for the <i>Daily Mail</i>. We welcome the order in a limited way because we believe that the wider issues, of which it is a part, need to be addressed in a wider context.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-25_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, and the noble Lord, Lord McNally, for their comments. Although they <P>


<a name="column_988"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 988</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>went very wide of some of the issues with which we are dealing, I have taken from them that I have general assent to the orders that we are bringing forward.

<P>

<a name="40913-25_para0"></a>I say to the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, that binge drinking is an issue of concern. Of course, I can make no commitment to any further introduction or change of policy. The targets we have in our sights as a result of this order are the selling of alcohol to under-aged children, the delivery of alcohol to under-aged children, the purchase of alcohol by under-aged persons and the drinking of alcohol by under aged persons in a bar. Noble Lords will know that alcohol has had a significant impact upon the behaviour that, regrettably, we are seeing in many of our city and other centres. It has been a real problem.
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para1"></a>The Government's alcohol harm reduction strategy for England, published by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister's strategy unit on 15 March 2004, included recommendations aimed at encouraging greater use of penalty notices for disorder to clamp down on the low-level drunk and disorderly behaviour that we are seeing. They are quick, easy and direct. I can assure your Lordships that before they are issued an officer has to have clear evidence that such an offence has been committed.
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McNally, talked about draconian measures but these penalties are seen by others as a quicker and more efficient way. Instead of pulling people right the way through the criminal justice system, criminalising them for what may be a one-off piece of foolishness, they are a way of punishing it, recognising that it is wrong, but dealing with it. We think that it is a more effective, and often more speedy, response.
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para3"></a>I assure the noble Lord that the police have welcomed it. Governments quite often come up with ideas that people in the field do not find to be of much use. The impression that we have from officers is that, for once, government have come up with something that works, which is useful and which has made a difference. Already 20,000 penalty notices for disorder have been issued to great effect. Most of them are being paid. Noble Lords should think about what that says for our criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para4"></a>In relation to theft, the difficulty that we have in terms of the volume of crime is petty theft from shopkeepers. We have consulted shopkeepers and they very much welcome this. Particularly, in relation to the younger element, not criminalising a child who has stolen a 10p sweet from the local sweetshop may be seen by many as a very good thing. I know that noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches will applaud telling the child that it is wrong, making sure that the parents know what the child has done and intervening swiftly in a way that does not unnecessarily criminalise the child but which, we hope, brings an end to the behaviour. This is not to placate the <i>Daily Mail</i> or anybody else.
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para5"></a>I know that there is a wider debate. I listened with great care to what was said by the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, and the noble Lord, Lord McNally, but we have done more than any government before us <P>


<a name="column_989"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 989</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to increase the numbers of police officers on the beat. We are taking a holistic approach. We are looking at education and diversion with the work we are doing with DCMS; work is being done with NOMS and probation to find diversion, and we are doing work on drugs. There is obviously a lot that we can discuss, but maybe not tonight and maybe not on this order.
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para6"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord McNally, that this is not electioneering. This is hard work that needs to be done and is being done well. It is already proving to be very successful. I am glad that we have unanimity on all our Benches that this is a good thing and we should get on and do it. I commend this order to the House.

"(A1)   In this Part references to "the market" are to the residential property market in England and Wales."<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-25_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: This is the first of a number of government amendments. This one is intended to remove a potential ambiguity about the meaning of the expression "on the market" in Clause 131. The amendment makes it clear that for the purposes of Part 5 "the market" is the residential property market located in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para14"></a>Amendment No. 181B follows on from Amendment No. 178ZA and removes a redundant reference to England and Wales in Clause 136.
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para15"></a>Amendment No. 210F includes "The Market" in the index of defined expressions in Clause 155, specifying the meaning in accordance with Clause 131 as amended. It is thus consequential on the first amendment.
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para16"></a>Amendment No. 181ZA clarifies that for the purpose of Clause 132,
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para17"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a business in England and Wales",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-25_para18"></a>includes any business conducted from premises that are not used exclusively or mainly for business purposes&#151;for example, a residential property.
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para19"></a>The small drafting changes in Amendments Nos. 178B and 194ZA are intended to clarify the point that only actions that are taken with "the intention of" marketing will trigger the HIP duties. This phrase describes the policy aim more clearly than the expression "a view to marketing", which it replaces.
<P>


<a name="column_990"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 990</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para20"></a>An estate agent is not in breach of the duty if, for example, he or she tells a spouse or colleague that a particular property is going on the market, but this would not be a qualifying action within the meaning of the part, provided that the communication was not aimed at marketing the property.
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para21"></a>Another example is where an estate agent is seen at a property that is not yet on the market and is asked whether it is up for sale. If the estate agent were to answer truthfully, "Not yet, but it will be as soon as the home information pack is ready", that would not be a qualifying action either.
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para22"></a>Amendment No. 181ZB is intended to simplify the explanation for the purposes of Clauses 134 and 135, which detail responsibilities of the estate agent and the seller respectively, by defining the property as a residential property that is "on the market".
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para23"></a>Amendment No. 185ZA is a small drafting change   to achieve consistency of expression with Clause 138(6). Both will now read,
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para24"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"where the responsible person is the seller".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-25_para25"></a>Amendment No. 188B removes and replaces Clause 138(6) and thereby removes the unnecessary requirement that a seller must believe that the other person responsible for marketing his property&#151;for example, the estate agent&#151;has a home information pack in the situation when a request is made for a copy of the pack. This requirement is unnecessary because, by definition, one of the responsible people must have the HIP, and where the seller does not have one, the other person must have one.
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para26"></a>Amendment No. 191B deals with the situation where the seller imposes a condition on Clause 139(2), requiring the buyer to pay a charge to receive a copy of the HIP or part of it. The amendment ensures that all conditions under the clause, including these, are effective only if notified to the potential buyer before the end of the 14-day period after a request for the pack is made.

<P>

<a name="40913-25_para27"></a>Amendments Nos. 192A and 192B remove a slight verbal ambiguity by ensuring that "purporting to be" in Clause 140(1) refers both to the pack and to any document included within it. Amendment No. 193ZA removes a potential loophole that might make Clause 140(4) seem to catch cases where there is no duty to comply with a request made under Clause 138(1). The duty to comply with,
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para28"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a request to a responsible person for a copy of the home information pack",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-25_para29"></a>does not apply in various situations detailed in Clause 138. That includes, for example, when the responsible person reasonably believes the person requesting the pack does not "have sufficient means" to make the purchase or,
<P>

<a name="40913-25_para30"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is not genuinely interested in buying a property".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-25_para31"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 210ZC clarifies the period during which a penalty charge notice may be given in the case of a continuing breach of any duty, under Clauses 137 to 141 or Clause 147(4). In the case of a continuing breach,

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-26_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Perhaps I may ask a question about Amendment No. 193ZA. I understand that there should be relief from the duty to provide a pack if one does not think that a person can pay for the purchase or is a serious prospective purchaser, but that does not seem to be what it is about. The duty under Clause 140 is about ensuring the authenticity of the document. That confuses me. It suggests that "spoof" documents could be supplied. I am sure that that is not what is meant.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am sure that that is not what is meant but, in due deference to the noble Baroness, I will ensure that we check that point. It seems fair that we should.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   I find all these amendments inoffensive, except for Amendments Nos. 178B and 194ZA. They are the same but concern different clauses. This is rather a micro-point, but it is worth making. Amendment No. 178B affects Clause 131(1). It would change the words, "a view to" to "the intention of". That would be senseless. The clause states:
<P>

<a name="40913-26_para0"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A residential property is put on the market when the fact that it is or may become available for sale is, with a view to marketing the property, first made public in England and Wales".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-26_para2"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"with a view to marketing the property",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-26_para4"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"with the intention of marketing the property".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-26_para5"></a>So far as I can see, if a property is put on the market, it is with a view to selling the property. Surely, that should be the amendment. It is wholly unreasonable to expect the Minister to give a running answer to that rather knotty point. But it is one that I hope his learned advisers will think about. I would commend to the Committee that my wording is a heck of a lot better than theirs.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is being entirely reasonable in giving me a get-out clause before responding. As a lay person, if I want someone to market my property, I would want him to have intent rather than a view maybe to marketing it. It is possibly a question of emphasis, but I hear what the noble Lord says. Of course, we will take learned advice.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   If you put the thing on the market, which is what they start by saying, it is with a view to selling it. You do not put it on the market with a view to marketing. It is not a big point.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   You put it on the market with the intent of selling it. Well, I think most people do.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   Selling it.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The noble Lord makes a point, and we will reflect on it. We can do no more than that.

<P>

<a name="40913-26_para8"></a>The noble Earl said: We now come to the serious business of marketing. This is one of the most important areas of the Bill. The Government are taking away the right of somebody to market their property as soon as they want to do so. They are shackling that person's freedom, that they currently have, and making it impossible for them to do something that is done successfully, and without any great difficulty, at the moment. This erosion of freedom is unnecessary, and will cause great resentment if the Government pursue it. It is quite common in estate agency for people to make very quick decisions about the need to sell a property. This can be for a variety of reasons. The most common reason cited, perhaps, is that they find a property that they want, or that they have been looking and looking and have now seen something that really interests them. In order for them to proceed with that purchase they have to sell their own property. However, the Government are not going to let them do that until they have a home information pack available to them. That could take some days or weeks to prepare.
<P>

<a name="40913-26_para9"></a>Let us take the simple case of a freehold property. That should not be too difficult. You now have a home condition report, you have to get all the searches and all the requisite information, and that could take up to 10 days. But what happens if you own a flat, and you have managing agents who are less than diligent in providing you with information about service charges, costs of repairs, future programmes or sinking funds for future costs? I have battled endlessly with management agents in selling flats over the past. They can cause quite a major delay to the sale of a property.
<P>

<a name="40913-26_para10"></a>Quite often the managing agents are nowhere near where the flat is. I have sold flats in London where the managing agents have been up in Manchester, and getting information out of them has been horrendously difficult.
<P>

<a name="40913-26_para11"></a>The owner of that flat is now going to be faced with the situation that he cannot sell his property because he is not allowed to market it. That is quite wrong. If we are going to have home information packs, and we want to speed up the process of buying and selling properties, surely the property should be allowed to be marketed at day one?
<P>

<a name="40913-26_para12"></a>The other extreme is the ability to sell quickly. I have sold a property within 24 hours of being given instructions. I had the right purchaser, at the right price, for the right property, and it all worked. It does not happen very often, but it did happen. Why should, in that instance, an owner have to go to all the expense, time and trouble of preparing a home information pack? He might well have lost the sale. The sale was critical because the purchaser had to choose between two properties, and he was either going to sign an unconditional contract with my vendor, or somebody else's vendor, within 24 hours. So the sale went through.

<a name="40913-26_para13"></a>However, what the Government are now doing will distort the market by preventing marketing at day one. That is crucial to how the current market works. If the Government persist in the view that one cannot market at day one, there will be a seismic shift in how the property market works and how quickly it can flow.
<P>

<a name="40913-26_para14"></a>In due course, some 20 years down the road, I do not believe that it will be such a problem, but it will be a major problem in the early days of providing a pack. For that reason, we need to provide flexibility to allow a vendor to market a property immediately he or she wishes to do so. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40913-26_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Amendments Nos. 179 and 180 tabled in my name are probably rather tendentiously grouped with this amendment. However, they refer to "marketing", which must have brought them together.
<P>

<a name="40913-26_para15"></a>The purpose of these amendments is to help the Secretary of State, and I hope that the Minister will view them in that light. I understand that, in law, information is deemed to be public once it has been published in the <i>London Gazette</i>. I am not entirely convinced that many prospective house buyers scan the pages of that fine journal, and to that end I congratulate the draftsman of subsection (3) of this clause for including the expression,
<P>

<a name="40913-26_para16"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"public or to a section of the public",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-26_para17"></a>thus getting over that particular hurdle.
<P>

<a name="40913-26_para18"></a>I turn to the issue of what constitutes a "section of the public". If I were to say in passing at a council meeting that I was thinking of selling my house, would I then be required to produce a home information pack that day? On a more serious note, if a property developer were to place an advertisement in a London evening paper&#151;not the <i>London Gazette</i>&#151;prospecting for buyers of luxurious riverside apartments just down the river from here in a development that is yet to be built, would that be deemed to be marketing to the public?
<P>

<a name="40913-26_para19"></a>We touched on some of these matters earlier, but as my noble friend Lord Caithness has pointed out, marketing is now a major issue in this part of the Bill. We feel that the most expedient way to deal with it would be to delete this clause and simply leave the definition of marketing to the public to the Secretary of State.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-26_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   We all know of the experience of the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, and it is valuable to the Committee to have the benefit of his thoughts. However, I regard some of his language as a bit extreme and emotional. The use of the phrase, "shackling" the freedom of the vendor to market his property and the citing of certain examples suggest a touch of special pleading.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-26_para20"></a>Let us take the instance of someone who has set his heart for many years on buying a certain property in the neighbourhood. It comes on sale and therefore he is keen to buy. In order to finance the purchase, he has to sell his existing property. That person will want to put his existing property on the market as soon as possible. I fully understand that. But why should he be able to put that property on the market without enabling the buyer to have the benefit of the provisions we are discussing in this part of the Bill&#151;namely, a home information pack and a house condition report&#151;just so that he can put his house on the market quickly, in order to move ahead of other people who may be interested in the property which he has been keen to buy for many years?
<P>

<a name="40913-26_para21"></a>Should we suggest that the Bill be radically altered and reduced in its impact in order to deal with a special instance of that kind? The rush to market which it is suggested that the vendor should be able to do would be made at the expense of those who want to know what kind of property they may be bidding for if they interest themselves in his existing property.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   I strongly support Amendment No. 178A in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. I am unable to support Amendment No. 179 in the joint names of the three Opposition Peers. I would like some elucidation from the Minister on Amendment No. 180. I do not support Amendment No. 179 because, rather than giving the Secretary of State power to make more regulations on a central issue&#151;namely, what marketing is&#151;I would rather leave that word to be construed by lawyers in the courts under common law principles. Any statutory definition of marketing will be a mess.
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para0"></a>I particularly support the amendment to delete the words "or may become available" in Clause 131(1). The provision seems to extend in a most unsatisfactory and unclear way the potential ambit of Clause 131&#151;which is an important clause&#151;to say that residential property is put on the market when it "may become available" for sale. That seems a contradiction in terms. I do not see the rationale or justification for those three weaselly words.
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para1"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 180. Those who want subsection (3) to be deleted could be fouling their own nest. It is helpful to say that a fact is made public when it is advertised to a section of the public, but it would help the Committee if the Minister were to tell us what the Government understand the words "section of the public" to mean. Is it any group, anywhere, at any time, as one might logically think, or does it have some particular meaning? Given its importance, it would be interesting to know if he can give us any help.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-27_spmin0"></A><B>The Earl of Courtown:</B>  Can my noble friend Lord   Caithness tell the Committee how long a delay the legislation would instil into the selling of property&#151;or can the Minister?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   As long as it takes me to get on my feet. That last point is for the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, to deal with. I shall deal with the <P>


<a name="column_995"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 995</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendments in turn. I start with Amendment No.   178A. I am sure that all Members of the Committee involved in the debate understand that Clause 131 defines the circumstances in which a property is regarded as having been placed on the market and the period during which it is regarded as remaining on the market.
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para2"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, ably explained&#151;as one would expect&#151;the first amendment is about what he sees as obstacles to sale. The noble Earl made the case from the perspective of estate agency businesses of the provision being seen as an erosion of the freedom to take to market. While I appreciate the sincerity and commitment of that view, we take a different approach. It comes down to that: we have a different view of how we see the market working in the future.
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para3"></a>The Government are rightly making the case that we want to have a well-informed market. Some of our common and personal experiences suggest that it is highly desirable that people have more information. That is the purpose of the home information pack and why we take the view that it is important for that information to be available as early as possible in the process. We therefore believe this amendment is inappropriate and that it would open a loophole by enabling a marketing process to begin before that information had been properly assembled.
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para4"></a>A seller in those circumstances could simply advertise the fact that his home was about to become available for sale and thus start the marketing ball rolling in all but name, but without having to have a pack ready. That would obviously trigger inquiries, offers and negotiations without either side being in possession of the information needed to make meaningful decisions. I listened with care to what the noble Earl said, because his comments expressed clearly that a potential buyer might have to make decisions and take a view about complex matters in the process of considering and making a reasonable assessment of the offer.
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para5"></a>Our case is that they will be better placed to do that with the information contained in the home information pack. While I can see that taking something to market at an early stage may have some potential advantages, there will also be delays at a later stage in the process if that information is not available and the potential purchaser is unable to make reasonable judgments.
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para6"></a>As we see it, the absence of the pack at the outset will continue to perpetuate the problems that all house purchasers and potential home purchasers experience at the present time, with a high rate of transaction failure and the unnecessary worry, stress and waste of time that come with it. That is the reasoning behind our objection to the amendment. We do not think it will help in the process of improving the way in which the market operates. I was very taken by the points made by my noble friend Lord Borrie in opposing the view expressed by the noble Earl.
<P>


<a name="column_996"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 996</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para7"></a>I was interested in what the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said about Amendment No. 179. We think that the amendment is unnecessary because Clause 131 already provides for the definition. It states:
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para8"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A residential property is put on the market when the fact that it is or may become available for sale is, with a view to marketing the property, first made public . . .  by or on behalf of the seller".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-27_para9"></a>Of course, a property will remain on the market until it is taken off or sold.
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para10"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said, Amendment No. 180 would delete Clause 131(3). That subsection defines when a fact is made public. Its removal could make it unclear when a property is put on the market and the associated duty to have a home information pack commences. We believe it is important that sellers and their agents should be clear about when the home information pack obligations kick in and when they conclude. The proposed amendment would not help that. For those reasons, the amendment cannot be supported.
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para11"></a>The noble Lord invited me to say a few words about expressions&#151;in particular the expression "section of the public"&#151;which are used in the clause but are not defined in the Bill. Our understanding is that the phrase has been used in other Acts of Parliament where some flexibility is desirable. The noble Lord is usually attracted to things like that. The case law indicates that "the public" relates to the public at large; and that "section of the public" indicates a slightly more restricted group. Thus, for example, the placing of an advertisement in a national newspaper could be described as "marketing to the public" as everyone in the country could potentially see it. By contrast, the placing of an advertisement in a local shop window would be marketing only to a "section of the public" as only a small proportion of the public would be likely to see it.
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para12"></a>Family members, individuals or small groups of people&#151;one's immediate colleagues at work, for example&#151;would not be considered as a section of the public for these purposes. Marketing to such people will therefore not be affected by the duties described elsewhere in this part of the Bill. Generally speaking, the seller would know such people in a private capacity and the property would therefore not be available for sale on the open market.
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para13"></a>I realise that I have probably inadequately responded to all the points that have been made, but that is our case. There is a clear difference of view. Returning to the first of the amendments, the noble Earl made the point that in the future he did not think there would be a problem with the way in which the clause is currently drafted and that it will work. That is a very significant point.
<P>

<a name="40913-27_para14"></a>Throughout the debates on this issue, my noble friend Lord Rooker has made it clear that implementation will be steady. We acknowledge that there are difficulties to overcome. We will make sure that the introduction of this part of the legislation, which is very important, travels at a pace&#151;but at a pace which understands and respects the fact that the <P>


<a name="column_997"></a>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, I note that he accepted that Clause 131 is the lynchpin of the whole of Part 5 of the Bill. However, if an auctioneer is auctioning Black Acre and at the end of the auction says, "A number of people have asked me whether the owners are going to sell Whiteacre. Well, they're considering that, but they may be bringing it to market in the spring", why on earth should that, which clearly brings it within the "may become available" provision of Clause 131, trigger a requirement on the part of the owner of Black Acre to go to the significant expense of putting together a home information pack when he has not even made up his mind to sell? Can the Minister answer that, because I am blown if I can see how it serves a useful purpose?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-27_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   While the Minister is thinking about that, I turn to "public or section of the public". If I were to put a couple of lines in a company's newsletter, which went only to those who worked there, would I be advertising to a section of the public?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am less confident in giving an explanation to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, but in response to the noble Baroness, I can say that that would be deemed as marketing to a section of the public. I do not think that there is any question about that. I want to reflect further on what the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said, because his example depends very much on the exact form of words used. Of course, there will always be difficulties in those sets of circumstances. In the end, this legislation will work well if we use our common sense and have goodwill. In bringing about an important change for the potential buyer, we have to give careful thought to that, because the advantages are paramount and obvious to all.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   I think that the Minister sees the point, but it is often useful to the people of a town or a group of property developers to have some inkling that a particular property may be coming on the market. As the legislation stands, just saying that is going to trigger the need for the home information pack.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-28_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I refer specifically to Amendment No. 180, which would remove Clause   131(3). Much of our debate has shown why that should be; namely, the suggestion that bringing the matter to the attention of the public is an advertisement in itself and triggers the marketing clauses. It is very unclear what "advertising to the public" and "section of the public" mean. It is not even clear whether putting a picture in an estate agent's <P>


<a name="column_998"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 998</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>window and not advertising in any other way would be covered by the clause. More questions are raised by Clause 131(3) than are answered.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-28_spmin0"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  I shall read with care what the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said, because he made some points that I would like to pick up at a later stage. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, accused me of special pleading. If he means that I am making a special plea on behalf of the market in which I work, I shall plead guilty, because the housing market is a mixture of different markets around the country that come together to form the housing market of England and Wales. If I have made special pleading, I have acted no differently from that area of the country which has made special pleading that houses below a certain capital value should not need home information packs. There is no difference&#151;it is just another section of the market with a particular problem, caused by this piece of legislation. I work in the international market in London, which is undoubtedly faster than most other parts of the country and much more international and cosmopolitan.
<P>

<a name="40913-28_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said I was making a special plea for the vendor, but I am doing the same for the purchaser. If the noble Lord and I are seeking the same property, Whiteacre&#151;mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, really wants the house, but I have my house on the market with a home information pack, he is at a disadvantage because he cannot submit an offer to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, as he does not have a HIP. The pack works both ways for the vendor and the purchaser, and&#151;I have to repeat the word&#151;it shackles an important sector of the market, though not at all the majority, that will be hamstrung by this legislation.
<P>

<a name="40913-28_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said that we could advertise that the property is likely to become available. Does that mean I can now put Whiteacre into <i>London Property News</i>, saying, "We haven't actually received instructions, but it's possible that we will do so, and the property is likely to come on the market"? In that case, the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, who is desperate to get Whiteacre, can now see that, "Ah! That is the house I have really been after. I will drop the purchase price of my house because I want a quick sale so that I am in a position to buy Whiteacre".
<P>

<a name="40913-28_para2"></a>When we look at the practicalities of what the Government are trying to do, we get into some very difficult areas. It is no good the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, saying "Well, we have all got common sense and we can all handle this". We are dealing with a cut-throat business market where at times people are desperate to get, or to sell, a particular property. The noble Lord went on to talk about making the market work properly. Do not let us forget that over 70 per cent of present transactions go through without any hitch at all. We are not talking about a market that is not working&#151;just about a minority sector of a market that can be improved. As an agent, I would dearly like to see that, and I know the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, <P>


<a name="column_999"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 999</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wants it improved from the solicitor's point of view. However, we are not talking about the great majority of transactions.
<P>

<a name="40913-28_para3"></a>Clause 131 is crucial. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, did not answer any of my points with regard to flats. I know it will be difficult for him to answer at the moment, but this time I hope that he or the Minister will write to me promptly. At what stage can a property be put on the market with an incomplete pack? At what point can the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, start marketing Whiteacre? He gives me instructions to market the place; it is a flat, and I cannot get the service charges, any of the building costs, the plans for repair or indeed the schedule for the last five years, or details of the sinking fund. I am hamstrung. I will go to my client and say: "I'm sorry, I cannot market your property. You might want to, but you can't, and I can't either. The Government won't let us". At what stage can we actually get on and start marketing the property? Why can it not be at day one, if there is an intention to prepare the pack as soon as possible?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Because the noble Earl made particular points about flats, I ought to try and respond to some of what he said. I apologise for the discourtesy of not picking up those points earlier. If there are further points that the noble Earl wants covering and I do not cover them, of course we will try to provide him with some more information between stages.
<P>

<a name="40913-28_para4"></a>The noble Earl raised the issue of acquiring information on flats and delay in the marketing process. I understand the point. I know that the noble Earl is concerned that managing agents will struggle to provide the information in real time and in the time that assists in the marketing process, particularly at an early stage.
<P>

<a name="40913-28_para5"></a>Our view is that the contents of the pack will, in most circumstances&#151;the noble Earl almost made the point for us&#151;enable the market to work well, with 70 per cent of transactions proceeding at an orderly pace. That is not to say that there cannot be improvements, even for those who feel that the system works well as it is. Most of the information will be there and the seller will already have it in his possession. Where information is not readily available and to hand, sellers will be able to market with incomplete packs after a defined period&#151;that will be set out in regulations&#151;provided that they can show that efforts have been made to obtain the missing information.
<P>

<a name="40913-28_para6"></a>I believe that over time&#151;perhaps this is behind the point made by the noble Earl&#151;these changes should not cause a problem. In any event, reforms to the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act will strengthen leaseholders' rights to obtain information from landlords in a more appropriate and accessible way. One has to look at the changes that we are putting in place as being part of a longer-term programme of improvements to the market and to access to information for those involved in the buying and selling process. Information is there for those who manage the market through estate agencies, sales and so on.
<P>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1000</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-28_para7"></a>Returning to my earlier point, if we approach this matter with goodwill during the period of time in which we build up to implementation, many of the problems that can now be seen, or imagined, will begin to dissipate. We need to focus on solving them in a practical and hard-headed way. The advantages, certainly for those buying and needing more information to make a reasonable judgment about property, are paramount and very important. That is why I believe that purchasers will see the longer-term benefit of the changes that we are making.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-28_spmin1"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, for that further explanation. He has made an excellent effort to reply to me. He is absolutely right: we need to focus in a hard-headed way. We need to focus on what is going to happen on day one, when we have these packs, which are totally unused by any other country in the world. We are pioneering a new worldwide system in a very complex, large and diverse housing market.
<P>

<a name="40913-28_para8"></a>The Minister reminded me of something that I said on an earlier amendment to the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said, "We will set out in regulations". Could the Government lift the veil gently on these regulations so that we may see them? If we cannot look at the regulations, we shall not be doing a proper job of scrutinising the Bill. Again, I make the plea to the noble Lord, Lord Bassam: can we please see the draft of the regulations before we go into Report stage? Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

If the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, wants to sell perhaps the major asset that he owns&#151;his flat or his house&#151;it can be done by anybody without any qualification; that person need have no training whatever. That is a nonsense and it does not happen in other places in the world.
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para11"></a>The Government have used Denmark as an example for the housing market. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said earlier how similar Denmark was to Britain. But in order to deal with the complexities of the home information pack in Denmark, estate agents have to be licensed. To gain a licence, agents must have a good theoretical and practical knowledge of property matters. From June 2003 all new licensees must have a degree in property transactions and have completed two years' practical training. There is no comparison with England and Wales&#151;we have nothing.
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para12"></a>But we are lucky. The Labour government of the 1970s passed the Estate Agents Act 1979 in which Clause 22 contains standards of competence. It states:
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para13"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may by regulations made by statutory instrument make provision for ensuring that persons engaged in estate agency work satisfy minimum standards of competence".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-29_para14"></a>Here is the Fifth Cavalry coming to the help of this Government. The Secretary of State can prescribe professional academic qualifications, designate any body or persons as a body which may itself specify professional qualifications, make provision for the establishment of a body to examine and inquire into the competence of persons engaged, or professing to engage, in estate agency work, and delegate powers to that body.
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para15"></a>The net result is that,
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para16"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no individual may engage in estate agency work on his own account unless he has attained the required standard of competence",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-29_para17"></a>and that,
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para18"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no body corporate or unincorporated association may engage in estate agency work unless such numbers and descriptions of the officers, members or employees as may be prescribed have attained the required standard of competence; and any person who contravenes this subsection"&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-29_para19"></a>subsection (3) of Clause 22&#151;
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para20"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall be liable on conviction on indictment or on summary conviction to a fine which, on summary conviction, shall not exceed the statutory maximum".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-29_para21"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, will now tell me what that is! But the principle behind that is that as the Government make the process of buying and selling properties that bit more complicated, it is only right that when one is dealing in most cases with the most precious asset a person has, the person handling that transaction should be qualified. It is not right that the <P>


<a name="column_1002"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1002</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mess should be cleared up after that person makes a mistake. We should tackle it before it happens and get the standards right now. I beg to move.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-29_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I rise to support the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. It is fundamentally important, if the Bill is to proceed in the way it is, that people can trust the estate agents who deal not only with the sale of their house but in many cases on the compiling of the home information pack.
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para22"></a>As it stands, currently only one in three estate agency businesses in this country are even members of the ombudsman for estate agents. The ombudsman for estate agents does not offer legal redress for consumers who have to complain about estate agents, but who can do so only if the agents are members of the scheme. The majority of estate agents offer no legal redress or indemnity and can be called to account only through the courts. That inevitably means that the home inspectors will carry the can if something goes horribly wrong.
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para23"></a>I have always been enormously surprised that estate agents are not regulated in a way that would give comfort to the public who are buying and selling through them. I therefore support the amendment.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   One of the advantages of the present subsection (3), which the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, would like to remove, is that it covers those who act as estate agents&#151;that is, act on behalf of a vendor with a view to marketing residential property&#151;regardless of whether they describe themselves as an estate agent. Therefore, as the Explanatory Notes to the clause mention, a solicitor who acts as if he was an estate agent shall be treated as such for the various provisions of the Bill. It therefore follows, and perhaps this is an   unintended consequence of the noble Earl's amendment, that a desirable feature of subsection (3) would disappear. But of course that is not the main part of what the noble Earl is seeking.
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para24"></a>I feel a sense of <i>d&#233;j&#224; vu </i>for the quarter of a century in which the Estate Agents Act 1979 has been in force but for Section 22. Through the 1980s, when I was Director-General of Fair Trading and had certain powers under that Act to ban people from acting as estate agents for various kinds of wrongdoing and misdemeanours, there were many occasions when various interest groups and members of the public suggested the very sort of logic that the noble Earl and the noble Baroness have put forward&#151;that, surely in this important transaction, those who act as agents for the vendors should have some sort of qualification.
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para25"></a>The noble Earl may be right. I am not sure that the method of implementing Section 22 that he suggests is the right way of doing it, but I think that, for the purposes of debate, and certainly for the purposes of hearing what my noble friend the Minister may say, I should indicate that the arguments as I remember them for not implementing Section 22 over the years went something like this.
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para26"></a>In the first place, it was said that standards of competence differ a great deal according to what the estate agent is doing, what kind of property he is <P>


<a name="column_1003"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1003</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>selling, and whether indeed he is doing valuations and surveys and the other things that estate agents often do, especially those qualified by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. It might be quite difficult to have either a range of qualifications or to think of a common denominator that would be appropriate for all.
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para27"></a>I remember banning certain people from acting as estate agents because they had been in gaol for fraud. I remember that many of the complaints about estate agents were not about competence. No one was suggesting that they were not capable of doing the job; they just were not honest. They were doing all sorts of things like failing to pass on offers to the vendor because they got a handout from someone else and that kind of thing. A number of them did that, and no doubt a number of them got off from various charges. However, in my day, and I dare say that it may not have changed all that much, some of them were dishonest&#151;or, at any rate, shall I say that competence is not necessarily the same as integrity?
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para28"></a>Finally, in relation to insisting on qualifications for doing any particular task in life, holding any particular post or being in a particular occupation, the question always was and always will be asked: does that not unduly inhibit competition, which is normally beneficial to the public? The argument is made that there should be rivals for the custom of the public and that, if the requirement for competence is raised to an unduly high level, that may be nicely comfortable and cosy for those who are already in the relevant profession or occupation but it is not necessarily a good thing for members of the public who want a wide range of people who are, I dare say, moderately qualified and certainly people of integrity. But sometimes one wonders whether systems of qualification and registration and so on achieve that.
<P>

<a name="40913-29_para29"></a>I am not sure that I can say more, other than I do not think that this is the way of achieving what the noble Earl is seeking. However, I am glad that he put forward the amendment because we shall all have the benefit of hearing the Minister's up-to-date view.

<P>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, sits down, can I ask such a useful witness of reality whether, during his time as director-general, those whom he disciplined for various acts of misbehaviour among the estate agent fraternity were disproportionately people who had no RICS qualifications or whether he can recollect little distinction in the numbers between the qualified and unqualified estate agents?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My memory is not as good as the noble Lord would like it to be, but I do not think that most of them were members of the established qualified institutions&#151;the RICS and, at that time, the Incorporated Society of Valuers & Auctioneers.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   When the Minister comes to reply, I think that it would be very helpful if he could confirm, <P>


<a name="column_1004"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1004</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>or otherwise, that the relevant part of the Estate Agents Act 1979 is in force. If it is in force, does the current Bill produce a conflict of laws?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   I find myself a little torn by the amendment of the noble Earl. On the face of it, it looks eminently reasonable and I should be as interested as others to hear what the Minister says in response. The whole world of property has, like everything else, become more and more complicated over the years, and therefore the time may have come to implement this part of the legislation. But one should make no mistake about it: the points made by   the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, in terms of bureaucratising and, to some extent, slowing down the competitive ability of the estate agency world may be inhibited.
<P>

<a name="40913-30_para0"></a>One point that I want to make strongly is that the first part of the noble Earl's amendment&#151;that is, to abolish the existing subsection (3)&#151;should not stand because, as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, hinted, many solicitors' firms act as estate agents and do the whole job. They sell the property and convey it, and it would be quite wrong if, in seeking to make an improvement in one area, he were to destroy a perfectly satisfactory practice that goes on in another.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I apologise for missing the first part of the debate, but I had a perfectly good and honourable reason.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   Was it the noble Lord's dinner?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   No, I had no dinner. I am afraid that I have brought a bucket of cold water for this amendment as well. I can just about remember the Act in question. If I remember right, it was a Private Member's Bill in 1979. I can see my colleague but I cannot remember his name.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-30_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, was one of the two sponsors.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-30_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   That just shows you. Of course, there was general consent for the Bill because of the fall of the government. It was a Private Member's Bill that got a fair wind through both Houses because of the vote of no confidence. But, since then, no government have seen fit to make the regulations under Section 22.
<P>

<a name="40913-30_time0"></a><H5>9.30 p.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>

<a name="40913-30_para1"></a>When the Act was originally debated in the House, the government spokesman said that it would not prescribe any standards unless and until the need for them was apparent. Section 22 has not been brought into force, which is the answer to the noble Lord, Lord   Hylton. Presumably, there has been no commencement order; hence no requirement for regulations.
<P>

<a name="40913-30_para2"></a>The Office of Fair Trading report looked very carefully at the issue of competence requirements for estate agents. The report concluded that the range and <P>


<a name="column_1005"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1005</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>complexity of the legislative requirements placed on estate agents do not justify a regulatory requirement for minimum standards of competence. That is what the report concluded.
<P>

<a name="40913-30_para3"></a>The Government agree with the OFT's "intellectually rigorous" analysis, although those words are not in my notes. Placing competence requirements on estate agents would lead to an increase in their costs which in the end would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher rates of commission. We do not believe that that is justifiable as it would impose unnecessary costs on business and inhibit competition without delivering sufficient improvements.
<P>

<a name="40913-30_para4"></a>I suppose that in a way I would rest my case on that last sentence. I do not think the case is that strong otherwise. In other words, if there is to be regulation it must have material benefit for people. There is no question about that, otherwise it would be a waste and a fraud to do it. It would give a false impression to people that by regulating, things will be great. In this case we could do all these things but it would not deliver sufficient improvements to make the job worth while. I think that that is the honest view. Common sense would tell you that they should be competent, but the legislative proposals would be so complex that it would not be worth while for the gains that would be made. That is fair and I am quite happy to stand here and make a robust defence on that basis as opposed to my earlier sentences.
<P>

<a name="40913-30_para5"></a>On the other hand, there is help on the way. One has to look at this in the round. I realise that we go through the amendments one by one. Nevertheless, the Government have tabled Amendments Nos. 210C to 210E. We believe that that little package of amendments, which is on the second page of the Marshalled List&#151;certainly we shall not reach them tonight&#151;provides for a requirement for estate agents to belong to a redress scheme approved by the Secretary of State. We think that that potentially offers a more effective and efficient mechanism for improving standards in the sector.
<P>

<a name="40913-30_para6"></a>Let us suppose that once estate agents have had to sign up to a redress scheme, the independent body that runs the scheme decides on a dispute between an estate agent and buyer or seller, finds for the buyer or seller and then says to the estate agent, "Legally, you have to make redress"&#151;which is not the case at present. There would then be a cost upon them and they might start to clean up their act as regards the competence of the people working in the estate agency who had caused the problem in the first place. It offers a mechanism for improving standards in the sector. It is a backdoor means of raising competence because we are more or less saying, "If you get yourself in trouble, it will cost you a fortune if you have incompetent staff and you fall foul of the person doing the adjudication". It will be a legal requirement to be a member of such a scheme.
<P>

<a name="40913-30_para7"></a>Although we are opposed to compulsory training and competence requirements, we accept that there may be a case&#151;there is a case; there is no question of <P>


<a name="column_1006"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1006</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that because everyone should be qualified to do what they do, whatever the job&#151;for developing a recognised qualification and national quality standards for residential estate agents. If done properly, this could provide a career incentive to improve standards. There is no question of that. There are thousands of people involved in this industry. It is very competitive so there is opportunity there for career incentive. We see this primarily as a matter for the industry. However, as the Government, we are prepared to offer help and advice and support to stakeholders involved in the development of the process.
<P>

<a name="40913-30_para8"></a>We do not say that we do not agree with the amendment, but in the light of the Government's own package of amendments for estate agents to belong to redress schemes, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.
<P>

<a name="40913-30_para9"></a>I wonder whether I can take the opportunity&#151;this place does not have any rules so I can probably do this&#151;to ensure that something I said earlier in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is not misunderstood, not so much by people here but those outside. By Report stage, we will offer to spell out in more detail what the "dry run" will entail; in other words, the six months before the compulsory date that the pilot starts. I have clearly said in the six months beforehand. I was not saying that we do not want to offer a pilot.
<P>

<a name="40913-30_para10"></a>There is a problem. I have taken further advice on the matter since I am not as up-to-date as the day Minister on this. The industry is dead against any single pilots, compulsory or otherwise. The view of the National Association of Estate Agents, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the RICS and the Consumers' Association is that we need to have a date for the pilot across England and Wales. Otherwise, the education institutions will not gear up for the home inspector courses. We are not likely to get people on the courses, which we need to do a reasonably sized pilot.
<P>

<a name="40913-30_para11"></a>The industry apparently is dead set against pilots, even in just one area, because of these difficulties, so there are some major problems. The matter has obviously been discussed. To my certain knowledge it has been discussed. We are offering a six-month dry run, as I said earlier, before the compulsion commences so that we can run the publicity, offer encouragement and everything else. By Report, we will come back and spell out more about what we mean by that dry run. I am not saying that it is the equivalent of a pilot, but it will not mean that everybody goes home on Friday under the same old discredited system&#151;and it is a discredited system for those that fall foul of it&#151;and come in bright and perky on Monday morning to a brand new system.
<P>

<a name="40913-30_para12"></a>It clearly would not work like that anyway. We need something programmed and a managed introduction. Although it becomes compulsory on a date, it must be a managed introduction, hence our use of the term "a dry run". It is a national dry run in that sense. I will gladly give way to the noble Baroness.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-31_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   Perhaps the Minister could clarify a little more what he means "by Report". The <P>


<a name="column_1007"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1007</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>plan was that we would come to Report the first week we are back in October. I can see that we will be in the same position. I will be running around the week before trying to find out what is available and maybe not finding it. I am sorry to be so sceptical but the last week has been hell.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I have no knowledge of the dates of Report. I genuinely have not seen any dates.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Day one of Report.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I am told that day one of Report is 13 October. That is the first Wednesday that we are back. That information is available to the usual channels. I am just a humble Minister who comes here to conduct the business. Whatever day it is, I will be here.
<P>

<a name="40913-31_para0"></a>However, I take the point of the noble Baroness. One can see by the size of it that this is a major Bill at the fag end of a Session. It is quite clear that this Bill was always going to be "running late", as it were, up against the end of the Session. We will use our best endeavours to get more information available in advance of tabling amendments, such as other documentation to assist proper scrutiny of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40913-31_para1"></a>I do not want this Bill not to be properly scrutinised, believe you me. I get as annoyed as anybody else because I feel as though we are being rushed without adequate time, especially on issues of course&#151;I am not saying this is relevant&#151;that the other place did not discuss. There is a lot of new material in this Bill.

<A NAME="40913-31_spmin0"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  I am very grateful to all noble Lords that have taken part. The noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord Phillips, took me up about the drafting of my amendment and wanted me to omit the first part, which is to leave out subsection (3). I had a huge amount of difficulty with the Clerks in tabling this amendment. They were very against my tabling anything like this. They said that it was not within the Long Title of the Bill. However, I managed to find a way, thanks to the Estate Agents Act 1979, but it was the Clerks who advised me to put down,
<P>

<a name="40913-31_para2"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"leave out subsection (3)".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-31_para3"></a>I did not want to leave out subsection (3); I thought it was rather good. But the Clerks said that that is what I had better do, so who am I to argue with them? Having won the major battle, I was not going to fight over a few words like that. But it does amuse me that it has worked out the way it has.
<P>

<a name="40913-31_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said that estate agents are not all that honest or have the requisite integrity. As an estate agent and surveyor, I could not agree with him more. That is what worries me about my profession. I think the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, hinted earlier that even estate agents are less popular than politicians. As I have sold a second-hand car, and <P>


<a name="column_1008"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1008</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been a politician and an estate agent, I can only look up now, I hope. I cannot get much lower on the ladder in people's estimation than those two things.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-31_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   You could become a journalist.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-31_spmin1"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  God forbid! I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. That is exactly why I put down this amendment. I am seeking to raise standards. The noble Lord, with his great experience&#151;I remember him well in the 1980s&#151;talked about the difficulties that having qualifications poses. I put to him the argument that he was using earlier this afternoon, many hours ago. It is consumer protection. Too many people are being taken by estate agents. We need higher standards. I do not think that the profession is honest or has enough integrity. In a lot of cases, it does, but there are too many bad cases. We want to weed out those bad cases. My view is that we should weed them out beforehand rather than afterwards. Although I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, his amendments are some sort of backdoor scheme and, in this instance, I prefer to go in through the front door. Let us be bold about it. I hope that the noble Lord will think again and say that we must get a grip of this situation. We now have a wonderful opportunity to take this forward.
<P>

<a name="40913-31_para5"></a>I take issue with the Minister on one point. He said that the present system of buying and selling is discredited. It is not discredited. Over 70 per cent of transactions go through all right. That can be improved. It is a section of the market that is not working as well as it could. I heard what the Minister said about the dry run. I want to read with care what he said. It is important. People in the profession with whom I have talked are very keen that there is a further trial area on a much bigger scale than the rather miserable one in Bristol.
<P>

<a name="40913-31_para6"></a>In view of the amendment that I tabled, I wrote to a number of estate agents, some of which are quite large firms. I wrote about a dozen letters asking them whether they employed qualified people and what they did. I got one reply from an estate agent who said that his firm did not employ qualified people but did some in-house training. That is not good enough. It condemns my profession. It is for that reason that I shall support the Minister when he comes to his amendments but I hope that he will support me and say that we have got to wield a much bigger stick to this bunch. I might come back to this but, at this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

It is another one of those little, innocuous amendments, I am afraid. Clause 134 describes the responsibilities of a person acting as an estate agent, when they apply and when they cease to apply. The agent must comply with the duties set out in Clause 137 for as long as he is instructed by the seller to act and is taking steps to market the property on the seller's behalf. He stops being responsible when all the following three conditions are met: his contract with the seller is terminated; he has ceased to take any action to make public the fact that the property is on the market; and any such action taken on his behalf has ceased.
<P>

<a name="40913-31_para16"></a>The amendment would insert the word "or" after the first condition. The intention would appear to be to provide that an estate agent is to be regarded as responsible in cases where his contract had been terminated but he continues to carry out marketing activities. We are not persuaded that that would assist consumers, to be honest. In fact, it is the very opposite: the effect would be to make more ordinary sellers become responsible persons under the Bill and subject them to the home information pack duties. If the estate agent is still actively marketing a property, he ought to be the one complying with the home information pack duties.
<P>

<a name="40913-31_para17"></a>The amendment would also mean that an estate agent would no longer be subject to the duties under the Bill where the agent's contract had not been terminated but marketing activity had ceased. That could present huge problems to which the noble Earl did not refer.
<P>

<a name="40913-31_para18"></a>The Bill as drafted relieves agents of complying with the duty when a property has been taken off the market. To replace that with an arrangement whereby a property could still be on the market but the pack obligations would come and go according to the level of activity of the agent concerned would be impossible for anyone to police. It would be impossible for trading standards officers. As drafted, the Bill sets up a straightforward, sensible and easily understandable arrangement. I therefore hope that the noble Earl will <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>not pursue what appears to be his innocuous, seductive, sensible amendment, because it is not so in reality.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-31_spmin3"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  That was quite fascinating, but not at all what I was expecting. Clearly, I have started something much more ingenious than I thought. I was under the simple impression that if I stopped marketing a property, I was no longer instructed. As long as I am instructed to sell Whiteacre for the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, I will market it. If I do not market it, I will be got rid of. My job is to market property. So it was in fact a simple amendment. However, it is clearly much more complicated than I had anticipated. I will read what the Minister said and am delighted that he spoke for much longer than I did. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40913-32_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a large group of amendments, including Amendments Nos. 182, 184 and 185. The remaining amendments are consequential on those first three. They are all linked and would, if implemented, make the information packs voluntary. During the course of the day, we have had some discussion on the desirability of a voluntary or statutory home information pack. It is still our view that this part of the Bill is wrong and that we should try to advance amendments to bring the Government to a commonsense view and stop these home information packs being an absolute requirement.
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para5"></a>We understand that some people might find some merit in producing the packs and, without doubt, in some circumstances they would add to the marketability of the property. However, as a general rule, producing home information packs could be seen as one of many options available to a home seller.
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para6"></a>While we recognise that they may well have some merit in simplifying the process of presenting a home on the market&#151;indeed, many people may chose to produce the packs in order to increase the desirability or marketability of their property&#151;imposing a duty to produce such a pack is unnecessary, will force people to sell their properties privately and will be most unhelpful to all concerned.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para7"></a>There are many reasons that bring us to this view and some of them will be discussed further on in the course of the Bill. At this stage I put down a marker that we believe that these packs should be voluntary. I beg to move.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-32_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   That is a view that we share. The more the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, convinced himself about the need for a compulsory scheme&#151;talking about 40,000 last week, 40,000 this week, 40,000 next week, so we have got to get it right&#151;the more I thought what a jolly good idea it would be to have a voluntary scheme which would enable us to gain the experience to get it right. We could tweak the scheme over a period in the light of that experience.
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para8"></a>The arguments for home information packs have been about transparency and speeding up the process. I am unconvinced that this is the way to speed up the process. I hope that the electronic mechanisms that are becoming available&#151;on-line searches, and so on&#151;will do that. It defies my belief that the packs will. We simply do not see eye to eye on that matter.
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para9"></a>The best evidence of the potential of the pack comes from the experience that some agents are able to put before us. There are voluntary schemes going on now.
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para10"></a>Over the summer I was interested to read an item in the press&#151;given the time, I will not share the full article with your Lordships&#151;about an agent who operates a voluntary scheme. He said that it should not be forced on sellers. He is quoted as saying:

<a name="40913-32_para11"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If the Government were involved, it would become far more complicated and less flexible".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-32_para12"></a>That is a sad reflection on the Government, but one I fear that I share.
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para13"></a>The underlying point is that we should get proper experience. We have heard from the Minister of the problems that the industry is reported as seeing in the pilot. For goodness sake, let us not get it wrong.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-32_spmin0"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  This is a very important set of amendments.
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para14"></a>Under the proportionality section of <i>The Principles of Good Regulation</i> published by the Better Regulation Task Force, it is stated:

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Policy solutions must be proportionate to the perceived problem or risk . . .  don't use a sledgehammer to crack a nut".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-32_para16"></a>In the report on the Bristol seller's pack trial&#151; which the Government think is the greatest thing since sliced bread but is in fact useless&#151;it was reported in paragraph 7.11:
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para17"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Thirty eight per cent of sellers considered their experience with the seller's pack worse than expected";</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-32_para18"></a>and in paragraph 9.4 it says:
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para19"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The buyers' exit survey showed that only 23 per cent felt that the pack helped them to decide whether to put in an offer".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>

<a name="40913-32_para22"></a>Yet only 42 per cent consulted the pack before making an offer. There is no great demand for the pack.
<P>


<a name="column_1012"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1012</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para23"></a>What about the cost? There will be a huge added cost to the whole of the property market&#151;for buyers and, particularly, for sellers. It is alleged that the current system costs about &#163;350 million due to aborted transactions, which I seriously question. That &#163;350 million figure is based on the analysis and extrapolation of costs incurred in just 30 transactions&#151;I repeat, 30 transactions&#151;when we market more than 40,000 per week in this country. That is a highly suspect figure.
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para24"></a>But we know that the home condition report is an added cost of a minimum of &#163;300 per report: 2 million transactions would cost &#163;600 million. So we would practically double what the Government say the present system costs. That is a nonsense of a way to make legislation. The Government are imposing Prescott's penalty on property owners. There is no doubt that this is a huge added burden, which will cost a great deal of money. It is not "cost equal". For that reason, these amendments, with some of those that we discussed earlier, are absolutely crucial to getting the balance right.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for saying that what he had offered before supper was not now possible. The least persuasive part of his explanation was that the industry did not like the idea. Without being too condemnatory in saying it, one has to say that the estate agency industry has a vested interest in the passage of this measure. There is no question but that very many transactions, which, for all sorts of reasons, currently go through without any survey being undertaken will now have to have a survey.
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para25"></a>At Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said that there was evidence from other countries of the success of packs. But what is so manifestly lacking here is a lack of evidence from this country. When we debated this issue in relation to the Homes Bill in 2001, I went to see the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, to discuss the evidence on which the Bill had been brought forward. He was very frank: the evidence was extremely thin, about which he was quite open.
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para26"></a>Given the scale&#151;to which the noble Lord just referred&#151;and reach of these reforms, which could not be more profound, affecting as they will up to 2 million transactions a year and members of the so-called ordinary public, it is a folly for us as a House to go forward with this hugely different, highly complex, Byzantine regime without solid evidence. What proportion of failed transactions will be addressed by the buyer's pack? What will be the extra costs? We have had no remotely convincing statistics of what they are likely to be. What are the savings likely to be? We have had mere speculation as to what the savings are likely to be.
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para27"></a>At the time of the Homes Bill, I conducted a detailed survey among the solicitor practitioners of the Suffolk and North Essex Law Society, which had no axe to grind. Its net conclusion was that that Bill was likely to impose significant extra costs on the "conveying" <P>


<a name="column_1013"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1013</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>public&#151;if I may put that way. There is no question that those costs will find their way back into the costs of acquisition and disposal.
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para28"></a>Of all the aspects of this debate that make me believe that this set of amendments must be right is the sheer lack of basic evidence that what we are doing is workable and likely to achieve its purpose. I urge the Government to think hard about that. Although this may not be a poll tax&#151;that is somewhat hyperbolic&#151;there is no doubt that interfering wholesale, as we are, with an extremely well tried, well honed, organically developed system of conveyancing in this country, really is tampering with things one knows not of. My fear, frankly, is that the best intentions in the world may not relieve the proposals in this Bill from pretty dire consequences downstream. I simply do not see why we need to take that risk. I was very grateful for the Minister's reception of my suggestion of a pilot earlier, and I really do not see why it should not be undertaken. I am deeply unimpressed by the industry not thinking much of it. I concede the difficulty of training the inspectors, but that is a superable problem. I think if you decided to take a county, and Northamptonshire was going to be the pilot, one could set up training for inspectors in that county quickly and efficiently, so that you could get the pilot on the go.
<P>

<a name="40913-32_para29"></a>For my part, I wish the intentions of this Bill all the good luck and success in the world. But short of a pilot, or something like it, I do not believe that we are headed down a sensible path. For those reasons, I would support this set of amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   As I have said before, if we are not confident that it will work, if we are not geared up and the industry is not geared up and we have not got the staff trained, it will not be brought in. I have made that clear. But we cannot get to that point if we do not pursue the legislative route. It has to be, as I have said before, the compulsory route. It is not worth doing voluntarily, simply because of the number of properties that are in chains in this country. It would simply not work on a voluntary basis. So our starting point for debating this amendment, and others with the same aim, has got to be clear from our point of view: acknowledgment of the deficiencies of the present home buying and selling process.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para0"></a>There is misery caused. When I went to address the AGM of the National Association of Estate Agents about 18 months ago&#151;I think I have said this before&#151;I dumped the speech. I did not use it. About a week beforehand, because I had been writing letters as housing minister every day to Members of Parliament who had got letters and surgery cases from their constituents about the buying and selling process, I said "Give me 20 of the last letters we have had in". And I used them as my speech. It did not go down very well, because they did not like taking it. I simply quoted from these ordinary people's letters the fingerprints of ordinary citizen's experience in buying and selling properties. It was disastrous. True, they <P>


<a name="column_1014"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1014</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were the complainants, but that was the point. There is a really serious problem here, and they did not like it. I said I probably would come back the following year with some more, but by then I was not the housing minister.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para1"></a>There is a real problem of deficiencies in the system. The Government start from that position. The process is slow by international standards. I know I am going to be asked for this, and I have not got the figure for it, but we are just about the slowest in Europe. Whether that is little Europe or big Europe, I do not know. I do not know how slow we are, but we are incredibly slow, there is no question about that. Anyone who has been in the process knows. We think it is very inefficient, and takes place in a disjointed fashion. Professional people&#151;solicitors and others&#151;spend most of their time sitting around waiting for someone else to do something, but nothing happens. That is the reality and people understand that. It is absolutely appalling. It is wasteful and prone to delays.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   I am terribly sorry, and most grateful to the Minister for giving way, but that was the provocation to cap all provocations: to make a generalised statement that solicitors sit around waiting for something to happen. Just sit inside any solicitor's office for a day, and you will know that their reputation in conveyancing matters depends upon them pulling their finger out and getting on with it. That is because, as the Minister has implied all along, speed is of the essence.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para2"></a>I know that the Minister is being semi-jovial at this time of night, but I hope that he will withdraw the remark.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   They are not doing nothing, they are obviously doing something for client B while they wait for replies for client A. They are still clocking up on the clockometer for the money. I am not saying that they are twiddling their fingers. They have made inquiries, sent out various forms and contacted local authorities. They have started the searches and have tried to contact the solicitors for the other party. But the system is a problem and an incredible waste of professional people's time.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para3"></a>We think that around 30 per cent of transactions fail after the offer has been accepted, which in itself is a problem. Indeed, Members of the Committee can go and ask people in the street about their experiences. They think they have a deal and then, all of a sudden, it evaporates. Although the figure has been queried, we estimate the cost of failures to be around &#163;350 million. Around &#163;1 million a day is wasted. That is not money down the drain because it goes into someone's pocket, but it is not part of buying houses because nothing has happened. The deal has fallen apart. However, someone has been paid because people have paid out their money.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para4"></a>Nine out of 10 consumers are not satisfied with the present process. When asked, 90 per cent of consumers are not satisfied with the present procedure. We ought to focus on that statistic. The results of our research carried out by independent consultants were presented <P>


<a name="column_1015"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1015</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in a consultation paper, together with options for reform. The responses revealed a clear consensus on the way forward. Home buyers and sellers need more information and they need it up-front, at the start of the process.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para5"></a>It is true that only a minority of people have surveys carried out. The percentage is worryingly small when you think about what they are actually buying. As I have said, because of the chain system, home information packs need to be compulsory so that everyone can benefit from them. We cannot have someone wrecking the whole process, which we do not doubt would happen if they were voluntary. Voluntary arrangements would not work.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para6"></a>The Law Society's transaction protocol provides some evidence. For years the protocol sought to encourage sellers, through their solicitors, to make all the legal documentation available at the start of the transaction process. That has been only partially successful. Despite the best efforts of the Law Society, the voluntary protocol has not been able to deliver the improvements we seek, so we have taken the mandatory route to deliver these universal benefits.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para7"></a>The effect of the main amendment and those tabled with it would be to introduce a voluntary home information pack system and essentially continue what is now a very unsatisfactory process; indeed, it would be almost the status quo. Sellers would be allowed to avoid the duties by ensuring that the marketing material made it clear that the property was being sold without a pack. That would probably be the worst of all worlds. Given the choice, some sellers&#151;perhaps a sizable proportion&#151;would choose to market their property without a home information pack. That might be to avoid costs or in the hope of avoiding disclosure of information. That is key here&#151;the avoidance of the disclosure of information about problems with the property that sellers are aware of, but do not want to disclose. We think that that is very unfair to buyers who would have had to provide a pack for their own sale, given that most people are part of a chain.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para8"></a>More harmful than that, the result of these amendments would be an unsatisfactory two-track process where sales without packs would slow down sales with packs in a chain, cancelling out the benefits to those who had provided the packs. Having people freeloading in the system just would not work and we would be back to where we started.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para9"></a>A small number of forward-looking estate agents&#151; those who really care about the people they are working for&#151;are already marketing properties with home information packs and reaping the benefits, not least in lower transaction failure rates. While I accept that such agents represent only a small proportion, numbers are increasing. However, the increase is taking place far too slowly for us to say that the market will ultimately provide. I am afraid the phrase used by the late Ian Gow when he was Minister for housing&#151;"the magic of the market"&#151;does not apply here because we would have to wait until kingdom come <P>


<a name="column_1016"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1016</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>before the system became universal. Only by introducing the requirement for the packs can we deliver the benefits.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para10"></a>We listened to the concerns expressed during the debates on the Homes Bill before the general election. We have come forward with a different system now. It is not based on criminal sanctions at all. But we need to beware of relaxing the duties if we are to succeed. A case can be made for a voluntary basis, but it would not improve the buying and selling of homes. We cannot make such a case at the same time as saying that we are going to improve the system.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para11"></a>There are markets all over the country. House prices vary regionally: there are expensive houses alongside inexpensive ones. While I pay enormous tribute to the sincere concern the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, has raised in his amendments, behind which there is goodwill and experience, the section of the market in which he operates is unusual to say the least&#151;I do not think that it is mirrored anywhere else in the country.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para12"></a>I hope that on reflection the Committee will recognise that a mandatory system is the only one that will work. It would not be worth having this part in the Bill if we were not doing that. That is why we went back to get a manifesto commitment to introduce a compulsory home information pack system. There would be no need for legislation for a voluntary basis; we would not be doing what we are doing.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para13"></a>I know that that is a bucket of cold water, but the voluntary system will not work and we are not going down that route; if we were we would not need the Bill. It would be a false prospectus to say to people that we can improve the system on a voluntary basis. We cannot make such a case: it will not work because the bulk of properties are involved in a chain. People will say that we said that there would be a different system and that we would improve it; that they trusted us and we did not tell them the truth.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para14"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, quoted us the latest report from the Commissioner for Standards in Public Life about the fact that the general public think that Ministers and MPs are telling fibs. I think that the report said "lying". We are not lying on this matter. We would be telling fibs if we said that we could do this on a voluntary basis and improve the home buying and selling process. We genuinely do not believe that we could make that stick. It would not be telling the public the truth. It is not a happy story. It is incredibly complicated.
<P>

<a name="40913-33_para15"></a>I accept that and I have given enough forewarnings: every week another 40,000 dwellings are being marketed. We step on that and get it wrong at our peril as Government. We understand that, which is why the provision will not be introduced unless we have it geared up, we have had a good dry run, people are adequately trained and all the bits are ironed out that are not straight at the present time. The only way to do it is through a compulsory system.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-34_spmin0"></A><B>The Earl of Caithness:</B>  I must take up the Minister on some of his points. He blames the chain system for the delays. I contend that he is totally wrong to do so: <P>


<a name="column_1017"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1017</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>other countries have chain systems and are quicker than us. The chain system can hold something up but it is not the only cause. The Bill is not going to help the chain system. We are slow by international standards but we are becoming much quicker. We are also cheap by international standards. We are speeding up hugely because of e-conveyancing; the solicitors have become much quicker; the agents have improved over the past six years.
<P>

<a name="40913-34_para0"></a>If the Minister carried out a survey now compared to the evidence of the 1990s he would find that transactions are going through more quickly. I was surprised when he said that nine out of 10 people were not satisfied with the present system. If I carried out a survey now I could get 10 out of 10 for him, because it is a matter only of the question one asks. I could get one out of 10 if I asked another question. That is not a terribly good statistic.
<P>

<a name="40913-34_para1"></a>The Minister said that forward-looking estate agents are selling with packs now. The Minister in another place, Keith Hill, called Maria Coleman, who was part of the Bristol project, "saintly" in Committee. At that stage Maria Coleman, besides being an agent, was very involved with a company that produced the packs. No wonder she was for the packs. It was a conflict of interest which I hope she declared to the Government before she took it on. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that.
<P>

<a name="40913-34_para2"></a>I have used packs in the past and it helps when solicitors provide information to agents. It can work on a voluntary basis. I disagree fundamentally with the Minister on that.

<a name="40913-34_para3"></a>One of the assumptions made by the Government in regard to home information packs is that buyers will accept the home condition report. I am not sure that that will happen. I do not know of any buyer who will say to the seller, "Okay, the report that you have given about the condition of your property is correct". We may very well find that the situation is not much different from that which exists now; people will simply go and get a second survey of their own which they feel they can trust.
<P>

<a name="40913-34_para4"></a>We have not yet touched on the cost of these packs. The current estimate is &#163;1,000 for each pack for each seller. We shall come later to how often the packs will have to be produced. Thanks to the activities of the Bank of England, the property market is slowing; we are not in the same heated market that we have been in for a number of years. It will be interesting to see whether that slowing will benefit from home information packs. I doubt that it will. I think the whole mechanism is beginning to calm down; there is more for buyers to seek, to look at and to go around. E-conveyancing and e-transactions are already beginning to speed up the whole process.
<P>

<a name="40913-34_para5"></a>The Government are seeking to impose an extremely bureaucratic system. It is not a system that we like. We think that there are benefits in putting this on a voluntary basis if people wish to put all the information together, have it available and risk having a home condition report that buyers will accept, but it should not be on a wholesale compulsory basis.
<P>

<a name="40913-34_para6"></a>With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment for the time being.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins </B>   moved Amendment No. 268:

<P>

<a name="40913-34_para13"></a>Page 119, line 11, at end insert&#151;




<P>

<a name="40913-34_para14"></a>"(   )   The trustees or managers of the scheme may charge a sum at least equivalent to the non-risked based amount of the levy to all scheme members."


   
<P>

<a name="40913-34_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is tabled in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale. During our previous sitting, we had a very wide-ranging debate on the Pension Protection Fund levy. Perhaps the grouping was too extensive. On Report we will need to deal with the matter in a more focused&#151;I believe that is the "in" phrase at the moment&#151;manner.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-34_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Targeted?

 


<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   No, we are against targets, and I thought that the Government were also against them, but nobody is against being focused.

<P>

<a name="40913-34_para16"></a>The noble Baroness in her usual way was kind enough to set out the timing of the implementation of the levy. That was extremely helpful, because we were all surprised at some of the ways in which it is apparently planned that the scheme will operate. The noble Baroness dealt with the period of the initial levy, which has no risk-based element&#151;it is not on the record, so I am not sure how we can get it&#151;after which, for a transitional period of two to five years, the scheme is a mixture of the two; and, finally, from year six onwards, it has both a basic and a risk-based element. On reflection, I feel bound to say that, since one of the problems with the levy's not being risk-based is that it seriously adversely affects sound schemes, which would be paying protection for less soundly based pension schemes, to wait six years before full implementation is too long. No doubt we will wish to return to that point.
<P>

<a name="40913-34_para17"></a>The amendment was debated in another place. The CBI is particularly concerned about it. The amendment suggests that the trustees or managers of the scheme may charge a sum at least equivalent to the non-risk-based levy to all scheme members. In other words, a pension scheme paying the levy should be allowed to recoup some of the cost from its members. <P>


<a name="column_GC268"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC268</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>That, at least, would have the advantage of bringing home to scheme members what the system is all about. The question is whether that would be appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40913-34_para18"></a>My impression is that the Government were not unsympathetic to the amendment when it was debated in the Commons. But, if a company could charge out the insurance premium&#151;for want of a better expression&#151;to its members, a problem of uncertainty arises: does it cover only active members or does it also include deferred members? Many schemes will have very few active members and many deferred members or those whose pension is in payment. It is not clear from the debate in another place whether the proposal covers everyone. The CBI appears to be in favour of it. I declare an interest&#151;my goodness it must be very trivial&#151;in this matter: I was a deferred pensioner and am now an actual pensioner of a large multinational. I would not view with enormous enthusiasm the idea that the company would suddenly ask me to pay towards the cost of the scheme because another company may go bust, when I have been receiving the pension, I regret to say, for some considerable time. I am not clear why that should or should not be so.
<P>

<a name="40913-34_para19"></a>In all events, those are the arguments being put forward. It would be helpful to hear the Minister's comments. I beg to move.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-34_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   On Thursday we had a very thorough and thoughtful debate on the PPF, the risk-based levy and so on. We do not believe that you can have a genuine risk-based levy unless everyone pays on a risk basis.

<P>

<a name="40913-34_para20"></a>I would have thought that Amendment No. 268&#151;an EEF amendment, if I can so call it&#151;was difficult. I can see what people are trying to achieve by it, but I would have thought that it was better for pension schemes and their members to discuss together how the premium will be paid rather than to be too prescriptive here. On balance, therefore, subject to what the Minister says, I am inclined not to support the amendment.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-34_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  I thank noble Lords, and agree that there are issues about phasing in the risk-based levy. If opposition parties have strong views about that or alternative routes, we will obviously be happy to consider them in consultation with the industry. That said, all the advice that I have been given in my meetings with the industry is that it wants it phased in as quickly as possible. That means not waiting to the end of the full transitional period, which is six years. We are in a dilemma, but I am perfectly happy to continue those discussions.

<P>

<P>

<a name="40913-35_para0"></a>The principle of phasing the levy in seems to have been welcomed by the major companies&#151;by definition, those that are least likely to be paying a high risk-related premium. It would be difficult to unpick that, but I am very happy to take on board any points or even anything that should go in the guidance notes from the Government or discussions with officials and working parties. I realise that the matter is difficult, <P>


<a name="column_GC269"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC269</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>particularly when one wants to raise the single sum and balance the two. The more one takes on, risk-based, the more one lays off on to scheme funding for weaker companies. It is an honourable dilemma, but we do not have any easy solutions to it.
<P>

<a name="40913-35_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has identified the two issues involved with the amendment. One is whether scheme members or essentially the employer will pay for the levy. The other is, if the levy is laid off on scheme members, what we not only do about existing pensioners&#151;they might not be happy to see a charge of &#163;5 or &#163;10 a year fall on them&#151;but how we trace and track deferred members. We know that for every two active members, there is likely to be one non-active pensioner.
<P>

<a name="40913-35_para2"></a>We have given a lot of thought to the matter. We do not disagree with much of the thrust of the amendment, but there are problems about its practical delivery. In the first instance, recovering any sums from deferred members would be difficult to administer, because they have no pension in payment, and are unlikely to be employed by the sponsoring employer. As a result, many schemes do not have up-to-date contact details for those members. Indeed, many of them may come back through the tracing service in due course, so it will be quite hard.
<P>

<a name="40913-35_para3"></a>Even when we have members, we also have quite complicated methods of calculating the sums. The method for recouping costs means that we might have to get the money from pensioner members, which would affect their current income in payment. For deferred members, we would have to work out quite complicated costs about accrual rates over time and so on; statistically, it would be an elaborate exercise.
<P>

<a name="40913-35_para4"></a>Reluctantly, we are saying that although we do not disagree that it would not be unreasonable to ask people to contribute towards the payment of the protection of their pensions, there are practical administrative difficulties in the non-risk-based element. If the average per capita sum is about &#163;20 a year a member&#151;that might come for the non-risk scheme element to only &#163;5 or &#163;7&#151;frankly, the administrative costs in chasing that might outweigh a simple contribution. We cannot find a way through the matter any more than I suspect that the noble Lord can. Therefore, we are leaving it to employers, scheme trustees and their consultation to work out whether they wish to lay off any of the costs and how best to do so.
<P>

<a name="40913-35_para5"></a>Some schemes have large numbers of active members; some are tiny; some have different ranges of payers; some have multiples of deferred members with tiny pots and so on, some of whom have been lost track of and will have to be chased. Therefore, the costs of administration could exceed the saving to the employer if we were to go down the proposed route. With that acceptance of the complexity and the admission that we are slightly stuck on the matter, I <P>


<a name="column_GC270"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>suggest that the noble Lord withdraws his amendment. If he has any further thoughts on the matter, we will be happy to consider them.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for clarifying the situation, which was not entirely clear in the debates in the House of Commons. I find her arguments very convincing. I am chairman of a pension fund and had to try to track down deferred members to get their agreement to changing their AVCs from Equitable Life to another organisation. That was extremely difficult and very costly. Even so, one could get nowhere near 100 per cent of the people involved. I understand, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>almost entirely rewrite Clause 173 for perfectly respectable reasons. However, a lot of this would occur anyway where fraud did not appear. It is not particularly relevant to fraud because the PPF payments, which we discussed at some length previously in Committee, follow to a great extent, although not entirely, the same formulation.

<P>

<a name="40913-35_para9"></a>Therefore, I am rather confused by subsection (1)(b) of Clause 173; the fraud element comes in because of the commission of a prescribed offence which, so far as I can see from my various pieces of background reading, has not been exemplified very much, if at all. It would be extremely helpful if the Minister could help me in that respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-36_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Is the noble Lord asking what we consider to be a prescribed offence and whether that will come through in regulations?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Yes.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-36_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes, it will come through in regulations. To give the scantiest of backgrounds, I refer to two points. First, the noble Lord will know that this is an area where, as he absolutely rightly says, the Pension Protection Fund has taken over the responsibilities of the Pensions Compensation Board. Therefore, this is one area where the PPF remit extends beyond DB schemes to DC schemes. From the experience we have this is a very limited offence. The 1995 Act, which sought to deal with Maxwell-type fraud, has broadly worked, I am pleased to say. So far as we are aware, the Pensions Compensation Board dealt with three such cases which took eight to 11 months. We discussed that in connection an earlier amendment. I believe that they resulted in a total default of about &#163;500,000.
<P>

<a name="40913-36_para0"></a>Such cases nearly always arise because the employer has allegedly embezzled some of the funds. Two of the cases concerned DB schemes and one was a DC scheme. The noble Lord will understand that that is privileged information and that it would be inappropriate to give the names of the relevant companies. I would have to share that information on Privy Council terms.
<P>

<a name="40913-36_para1"></a>A prescribed offence will be an offence that involves dishonesty. It is not about mistakes or something being one day late but about dishonesty. That test is well established in common law.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-36_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I have one point to make concerning the fraud compensation fund. I am not entirely clear about the definitions of situations that would be covered under the Bill, in particular these clauses. The noble Baroness referred to fraud and dishonesty. A letter has come to me from a Member of another place which is concerned with an individual who says that the value of the scheme was reduced by 95 per cent by an ex-trustee because of breach of trust. I was not clear about the expression "breach of trust" with regard to dishonesty and fraud. He also says that the pension ombudsman does not seem interested in the case and, if I understand it correctly, only cases from 1997 onwards are affected. It might be easier if I sent her the letter, but can the noble Baroness say whether breach of trust is covered by the board in those circumstances? If not, what redress does another trustee, for example, have against the individual concerned?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-36_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   It would help me enormously if I were to see the letter. I have not had any particular briefing on this, but my understanding is that there would be a remedy against trustees only if dishonesty were involved. For example, the trustees might have made a pretty disastrous investment decision, but that would not, in my book, be a breach of trust. I am thinking on my feet, but there would either have to be culpable negligence&#151;for example, <P>


<a name="column_GC274"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC274</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>failure to extract money from the employer when appropriately due or failure to bring in the accountant when appropriately due&#151;or the trustees would have to have been involved in dishonest action. That is where I think the case would stick. If the noble Lord could send me a copy of the letter, we could have more background and see whether it is simply a complaint about investment decisions or whether there is a degree of recklessness and culpability which veers over into dishonesty.

<P>

<a name="40913-36_para15"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 180 shall stand part of the Bill?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-36_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I said that I would come back to the levy. Not only is there to be a scheme levy, as my noble friend Lord Higgins has said, there will also be a risk-based levy. In certain circumstances, there will be a fraud compensation levy. The trouble is, one does not know what fraud is until it happens. Therefore, it is difficult, I should have thought, to raise a levy in anticipation of what the noble Baroness has just admitted is, comparatively, a very small amount pertaining to very few schemes. I know that the various pension schemes' organisations to which we have referred in debates on previous amendments are extremely interested in how this will work and how the department intends the board to calculate it. After all, it should be a comparatively insignificant amount, but it could be much larger. Indeed, the amount could go up and down, depending on the circumstances and depending on the year.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-36_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is right: we expect the sums to be extremely modest. In Clause 180, unlike the other PPF-related clauses, we do not envisage that the levy will be an annual occurrence. The Pensions Compensation Board has needed to collect only two levies since April 1997, for precisely the reasons that the noble Lord described. The second was announced only in March this year. The compensation levy currently being collected is at a rate of 23 pence per member and applies to all schemes liable to pay the levy, providing they have at least two members. We have no reason to think that that pattern will alter under the PPF board.
<P>

<a name="40913-36_para16"></a>We intend to limit the size of levies and their impact on individual schemes through regulations, so that people know in advance where they stand. Unlike the other levies, they will cover all the DC schemes. About 97,000 schemes will be billed, of which 85,000 will be DC schemes. Obviously, DC schemes tend to be the smaller schemes, but that is one reason why the levy is so low. Our intention is that levies will be calculated <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>according to the formula that the PCB uses. It seeks to maintain a float of about &#163;2 million in the fund, and that is what we expect to do.
<P>

<a name="40913-36_para17"></a>There will be very little change. What I should have said in my previous response is that the main difference, apart from the fact that the process will be run by the PPF, is that there will be 100 per cent compensation; at the moment, it is 90 per cent. With fraud, we seek to restore the individual members' scheme to what it was. That is the main difference. Apart from that, the levels will be pretty much as they are under the PCB.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-37_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I had picked up that it would be 100 per cent compensation, thanks to the useful briefing for Peers that the noble Baroness circulated a long time ago&#151;was it weeks or months? On page 36 of that document, there is a useful example that shows clearly that compensation would be 100 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40913-37_para0"></a>I am grateful for the answer that there will, basically, be no change from the existing scheme of things, but I hope that the noble Baroness will understand why I asked the question. The Bill is not explicit in that regard.

"(   )   This section is subject to section 296."<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-37_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: This group of amendments covers basically the same point, which is a human rights point. The intention is that information to be provided to the board under regulations to be made under the clause should be protected. We have a long time to go before we reach Clause 296, which deals with protected items, but basically this relates to information that is subject to legal privilege.
<P>

<a name="40913-37_para5"></a>As I understand it, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights enshrines the right to privacy. Scots law, in particular, has traditionally protected the relationship between a solicitor and his or her client and has made provision for the doctrine of legal professional privilege, which we do not have south of the border in exactly the same way. To preserve that relationship and ensure that such communications are privileged, provision should be made in the Bill to the effect that the provisions of Clause 181 will not extend to the disclosure of such information. I hope that the noble Baroness will agree, so that it will be the third day running that I will have had a modicum of success with the Bill. However, that may not be the case.
<P>

<a name="40913-37_para6"></a>Also in the group is Amendment No. 269. I feel strongly that when pieces of paper and so on are taken away, they should be receipted, and everybody should know what is going on. I also wondered why, in the first instance, it was necessary to have as long a period as four months to retain bits of paper, given that a little later on there is a 12-month extension for such holding. I should have thought that three to six months would have been a much more appropriate period.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-37_para7"></a>Clearly, retention must be necessary and proportionate. That is not currently in the Bill, but it would seem to me to be common sense and normal practice. I beg to move.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-37_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Again, I doubt whether there is very much disagreement between the noble Lord and myself on any of these issues. On the first of his points and Amendment No. 268A, I simply refer him to Clause 296, which specifies that,
<P>

<a name="40913-37_para8"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A person may not be required under or by virtue of this Act to produce, disclose or permit the inspection of protected items".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-37_para9"></a>I am happy to give the reassurance that he suspected that I could give him&#151;that legal privilege covers those items. So that is OK, I think.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Hang on a minute, that is not exactly the point. Legal privilege covers those items, but the point at issue is whether the clause is covered by Clause 296.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-37_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes, it is.
<P>

<a name="40913-37_para10"></a>The second point raised by the noble Lord was about documents being seized. I absolutely agree with the principles behind the amendment; it is important to give a receipt, for reasons that we discussed with regard to the regulator. Frankly, if receipts were not given to provide a paper trail, evidence would not stand up under PACE. Therefore, giving a receipt is right in terms not only of human rights but of practicabilities. It would also help people whose premises have been entered: they could keep track of documents which had been taken and, when necessary, ensure that the documents were returned to them. As we said earlier, some of those documents are part of the lifeblood even of a company that is winding up.
<P>

<a name="40913-37_para11"></a>The third issue on which the noble Lord pressed me related to the minimum period. The reason that it is 12 months is that we expect the assessment period to be 12 months. Therefore, the documents are likely to be necessary for the assessment period. None the less, that would not mean that there would not be receipts given or that, if the board needed to hold on to the documents, duplicates could not be made, so the company could continue to have access to the material it needed to wind down or go for its valuations.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-37_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   There was a third point, relating to retention of the document being necessary and appropriate.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-37_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   This is a time question. We are going for 12 months rather than three because that period broadly coincides with the time necessary for the assessment period, which is precisely when the board will need those documents. That is not to say that the company will not have duplicate documents in that situation, should it request them.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-37_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I am extremely grateful to the Minister. I may have to come back to the last point, having read what she said, because I am not sure whether we are in as much agreement on that point as we were on the other two or three points. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-37_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I want to ask just one question. The clause relates to entry of premises and will affect those operating with regard to the various fraud compensation arrangements, and so on. Could the noble Baroness give us some idea how that compares with, say, the powers of entry of Customs and Excise? Is it a fairly standard situation? Customs and Excise normally has greater powers than anyone else, and I was not clear whether the powers were appropriate in relation to police or Customs and Excise. Where on the scale of powers of entry do the provisions fall?
<P>

<a name="40913-37_time0"></a><H5>4 p.m.</H5>
</P>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-37_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Although issues of warrants may obviously arise, the board will normally enter not because fraud is going on&#151;that could be the case, however&#151;but because the Pension Protection Fund needs the basic information, as the scheme is winding up. It is effectively in the assessment period. We expect the PPF to be in and out of the company premises quite regularly, in the sense of collecting the information necessary for the assessment period to determine the value of the assets and the protected liabilities, to see whether the scheme comes through.
<P>

<a name="40913-37_para20"></a>Obviously, we expect that to be with the consent of the company; it may well be anxious to see the security of the scheme by coming into a compensation arrangement. Therefore, we do not expect that to be especially challenged by employers, unless there is fraud and so forth. Issues of warrants come up where the employer resists entry. As I understand it, there our powers are broadly similar to those of the Inland Revenue, which in turn are broadly similar to those of Customs and Excise&#151;a magistrate's warrant has to be agreed.
<P>

<a name="40913-37_para21"></a>I emphasise that we expect the PPF to have routine entry, with consent, to premises as part of determining the assessment period. That is to monitor the future viability of the fund and whether it is capable of being wound up outside the PPF, because its assets are greater than its liabilities to an extent that it can more than match the compensation offered by the PPF or not. We do not expect warrants to come up very often&#151;bluntly, only when we suspect that the employer is verging on fraud, in the sense of trying to destroy documents that we need. I expect the provisions to be used in only very rare circumstances.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-37_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My question may have been prompted by my misunderstanding, and that may in <P>


<a name="column_GC278"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC278</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>turn have been provoked by the fact that there are two levies. There is a Pension Protection Fund levy and a fraud protection fund levy. There is only the one board, and the board may require entry in connection with the Pension Protection Fund or a fraud investigation. Is that right?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-37_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   That is exactly right. In terms of the levy, but particularly of the assessment by the PPF during the assessment period of 12 months or so, when it is uncertain whether a company can or should wind up its pension fund outside the PPF, we expect there to be regular, free and continuous access into the books and so on. Because the PPF is responsible for fraud as well as the levy, as the noble Lord rightly said, there will clearly be situations where a warrant is necessary where it is suspected that documents would otherwise be destroyed. In that case, the board has to go to the magistrate, but we would expect the request to be granted. The powers of entry and for the granting of warrants are similar to the powers of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. I am now a little concerned; I was trying to think of other examples where there were powers of entry merely to obtain commercial information rather than information that is in any way related to an offence. I do not wish to pursue the matter, so I shall let it rest there.

<a name="40913-38_para1"></a>Clause 184 [<i>Penalties relating to sections 182 and 183</i>]:
<P>

<a name="40913-38_para2"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 184 shall stand part of the Bill?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-38_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I am about to ask exactly the same question on the clause as my noble friend Lord Higgins did on the previous clause. Are the penalties envisaged necessary and appropriate in this instance?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-38_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   It might be helpful for me to spell this out, because it is a sensitive area, and then continue to the issue of penalties. The obligations to provide information to the board are set out in the earlier provisions of this chapter, which we have already discussed. These are the duty to provide information requested by notices under Clause 182 and to co-operate with a person who has entered scheme premises using the power under Clause 183.
<P>

<a name="40913-38_para3"></a>Clause 184 follows on from these obligations and is designed to ensure that there are effective criminal sanctions available for use against those who intentionally fail to comply with these obligations. There are two types of offence: first, when individuals without reasonable excuse fail to comply with a request to provide information, they will be guilty of an offence which can lead to a fine of up to level 5 on the standard scale&#151;which, I understand, is &#163;5,000. Secondly, for the more serious offence of deliberately altering, destroying or concealing a document that they may be asked to produce, again without <P>


<a name="column_GC279"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC279</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reasonable excuse, an individual will be guilty of an offence which can lead to a fine or imprisonment for up to two years&#151;or both.
<P>

<a name="40913-38_para4"></a>We envisage that these penalties will only be used in exceptional circumstances. They are an important deterrent and will encourage individuals to provide the information that the board of the PPF will need to carry out its functions. The penalties would apply only when an individual has deliberately failed to provide information, or has destroyed or tampered with evidence, without reasonable excuse. I hope that that response is satisfactory.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Almost. Level 5 on the standard scale is normal, as I understand it. My question relates to subsection (7) about the last offence mentioned by the noble Baroness, the intentional destroying or altering of a document. Is that paralleled in, say, environmental law, where such powers of entry are similar?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-38_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am sorry. I really do not know about the powers of environmental law.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-38_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Could the noble Baroness be helpful by giving another example outside pensions legislation where similar fines or imprisonment are levied?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-38_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am trying to think back to the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, which had similar powers. I am fairly sure that we had similar powers in the CSA Bill because we had a similar debate, where noble Lords raised concerns about what information was kept by Experian, the credit agencies and so on. I am assured that these matters are broadly similar to the Financial Services Authority legislation.

<P>

<a name="40913-38_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment refers entirely to the authorisation of the warrant in Scotland. It has been put to us by the Scottish Law Society that the power to grant warrants should extend to sheriffs only. The society says that often a Justice of the Peace will not be legally qualified&#151;as would be the case south of the border&#151;and may be unfamiliar with the criteria needed to grant such warrants. Given the few times that such warrants will be needed, the JPs will not be able to build up expertise. The warrants are for investigating serious matters, so it would seem to be fair that a warrant should be authorised by someone who is legally qualified. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-38_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I know that the clause sounds either otiose or disingenuous, but it may be helpful if I give an example of where it may come into practice, which may address the questions asked by Members of the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40913-38_para20"></a>The board may become involved with the scheme because the employer has entered insolvency proceedings; at this point, the board would begin to gather data in order to carry out the valuation of the scheme's assets and liabilities. However, at a later date, there may be an application for fraud compensation from the same scheme. By virtue of the clause, the board will be allowed to use the data that it gathered earlier to help process a fraud application. It would not be an appropriate use of the board's time or money to gather that information twice. However, the usual restrictions will still apply: in other words, the board will still have to follow the disclosure requirement set out in the Bill and any obligations imposed on it by the Data Protection Act in respect of fair processing.
<P>

<a name="40913-38_para21"></a>The problem that lies behind the clause is the very appropriate concern issuing from the Data Protection Act not to allow "fishing trip" information. The clause covers a situation when the board is moving from one issue related to winding up to a second issue relating to fraud&#151;when it has collected the information which then goes across.

<P>

<a name="40913-38_para23"></a>I am still a little confused because it seems to me perfectly obvious that when the board has information it will use it. I did not really gather from the Minister's explanation why there should be specific provision to allow it to do so.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-38_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Perhaps I can help the noble Lord. This was not in the briefing&#151;but the problem might have arisen in the past, when OPRA collected information, and sometimes found information that was relevant to other forms of prosecution. It might have involved the Pensions Compensation Board, and so on. There was a real problem about Chinese walls and what information should go across. There were occasions when the chairman of OPRA had to excuse herself from discussions of deliberations, because she had become party to sensitive information.
<P>

<a name="40913-38_para24"></a>I am ad libbing here, but I suspect that we are addressing a problem that is a hangover from a time when these functions were exercised by two separate bodies, with fraud on one hand and pension compensation or OPRA rules on the other. That is the context. Unfortunately, as a statutory body, the board needs the powers to act in this way. I am assured that the words are necessary&#151;but I suspect that they relate to the history, which did not occur to me until I was pressed on the matter by the noble Lord, and which is one of separation of responsibilities which have been brought together here for the first time. In the past, that movement of information would have been problematic under the Data Protection Act.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale </B>   moved Amendment No. 274:
<P>

<a name="40913-39_para2"></a>

<br>

"(c)   the Secretary of State, or


<br>
(d)   any person that the Board has consulted on the matter"<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-39_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment deals with the same thoughts. The question is: who exactly should reveal information, and who should cling on to it? Except as provided by Clauses 189 to 194 and Clause 225, restricted information must not be disclosed by the board or any person who receives the information directly or indirectly from the board. That seems perfectly sensible, but the department will also receive restricted information. Indeed, restricted information might come out of consultation between the board and outside parties. Therefore, it would seem sensible to include the department and such outside parties in this prohibition. I beg to move.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I need further help from the noble Lord&#151;partly because of the acoustics. Is he saying that we should add to the shopping list of bodies to whom the restricted information can be given to, or that we should increase the number of bodies to whom it cannot be given?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   As I understand it, subsection (1) is about information that cannot be disclosed, therefore the amendment would add to it.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   The noble Lord should possibly use the word "by". Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) each start with the word "by": "by the Board" and,
<P>

<a name="40913-39_para4"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"by any person who receives the information . . .  from the Board".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-39_para5"></a>Does the noble Lord wish to include the word "by" in proposed paragraphs (c) and (d)?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Certainly.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am not sure whether my response fully addresses the matter, so I shall reflect on the matter and come back to the noble Lord. As it stands, both the Secretary of State and those whom the board may have consulted to acquire the information would already be bound by the restriction. As my noble friend rightly identified, Clause 188(1)(b) states that restricted information must not be disclosed onwards,
<P>

<a name="40913-39_para6"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"by any person who receives the information directly or indirectly from the Board"</UL><FONT SIZE=3>



<P>

<a name="40913-39_para7"></a>unless the onward disclosure is permitted by Clauses 189 to 194. The noble Lord does not need any further information about what restricted information would be in those circumstances. Does the noble Lord need me to comment on any further issue?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   What about the Secretary of State and, in this case, the department?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Both the Secretary of State and the board, whoever they have consulted, are <P>


<a name="column_GC283"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC283</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bound in the same way. Information may be disclosed onwards only if the person concerned has done it or if there are overriding circumstances such as criminal charges or criminal information. There is a well set-out procedure of what information may be disclosed and under what conditions. I would be very happy with an amendment to spell that out if the noble Lord thinks that it would be useful to have it on the record.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   If it is already there in pensions legislation and not amended by this Bill, I see no need for it.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   If the Secretary of State receives the information either using his own powers or from the PPF, the department must treat information appropriately. Where it is from the PPF, the department or the Secretary of State must follow the restricted information code. I think that all the loose ends have been picked up, but if the noble Lord continues to be worried, perhaps he could let me know.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   No, I am also certain that I am satisfied. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40913-39_para17"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 193 shall stand part of the Bill?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I was not absolutely sure whether the Inland Revenue still existed, or whether it was now combined with Customs and Excise. I am also not clear whether there is disclosure by Customs and Excise as well as by the Inland Revenue. I think that it is an old Treasury Minister's inhibition, but I have never liked the idea of the Inland Revenue disclosing information in this context. Indeed, I have some difficulty in thinking what Inland Revenue information might be relevant for it to disclose to the board in the exercise of its functions.
<P>

<a name="40913-39_para18"></a>The noble Baroness will be familiar with my next argument; we have had it on previous occasions. It is not clear at what level the disclosure takes place, in terms of the Customs and Excise hierarchy, or indeed what controls are imposed on those receiving the information. I am particularly concerned by subsection (2), which states:
<P>

<a name="40913-39_para19"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No obligation as to secrecy imposed by . . .  the Finance Act 1989 . . .  or otherwise shall prevent the disclosure of tax information".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_GC284"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC284</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-39_para20"></a>Section 182 of the 1989 Act was imposed for good reason. The idea that the information is floating around to a wider and wider audience gives me considerable cause for concern. Can the noble Baroness justify the relaxation of restraints that Parliament previously thought appropriate?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am advised that, because the clause refers to commissioners of Inland Revenue and Customs, it is still technically correct. That deals with the noble Lord's first point. We envisage that the provision will be rarely used but it may be appropriate, particularly in fraud compensation cases for the Inland Revenue to consider whether it has information that should be disclosed to the PPF in order to assist the board to fulfil its functions. I suspect that it will be rare. The provision is permissive; in other words, the Inland Revenue controls and determines the gateway out, rather than the regulator, the PPF or the Secretary of State on the way in.
<P>

<a name="40913-39_para21"></a>There are strict rules to ensure that permission must be given at a senior level. We got into difficulties at our previous sitting about what level that technically was, and I cannot now remember. It was certainly at the equivalent of EO or above in DWP, but there are different grades in the Inland Revenue, so I shall need to come back to the noble Lord on what level the power shall be exercised at. We expect it to be rare and in circumstances such as fraud. As comes up under a drafting amendment, the power is permissive and the   Inland Revenue will determine whether it is appropriate to disclose the information. The noble Lord is right&#151;the Inland Revenue is very protective, and rightly so, of the integrity of its information and therefore the privacy rules associated with it.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-39_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that reply. Last time that we discussed the matter, I was unhappy at the level of EO or equivalent; it seemed that the decision ought to be at some higher level. Are we right in thinking that disclosure of information will happen only if there is some question of fraud, or is it in relation to the Pension Protection Fund as such?

<P>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-40_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I expect disclosure to happen when sometimes the regulator, but primarily the PPF, cannot get the information that it seeks from the company with which it is dealing&#151;in other words, where there is some suggestion that there may either be manipulation of information or destruction of records.
<P>

<a name="40913-40_para0"></a>I shall give an example. Again, I am ad libbing, so, if I am wrong, I shall apologise to the noble Lord and correct the information. One of the reasons why, in an earlier debate, we discussed the fact that the PPF would have the right to ignore any changes in scheme rules in the three years before a scheme came into the PPF for compensation was that there could be manipulation of those rules. For example, there could be manipulation at fairly senior level between DB and DC contributions, in order to maximise the potential for compensation. It may be that records associated with it have been destroyed&#151;sometimes in good faith, <P>


<a name="column_GC285"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC285</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>although it seems unlikely that records from three years earlier would no longer exist. In such a situation, the PPF may want to check the veracity and reliability of the information about what is counted for Inland Revenue purposes against the information that the PPF is given. That is a possible example, but only if the Inland Revenue believes that it is necessary for the PPF to have the data, for example to ensure that a scheme is still tax-approved or registered.
<P>

<a name="40913-40_para1"></a>I can conceive of various situations in which the PPF is worried that the information that it has is not reliable or robust or in which some information about tax status that the PPF needs may be held by the Inland Revenue. The Inland Revenue will control such information.
<P>

<a name="40913-40_para2"></a>If the noble Lord has any particular worries on the matter, he should write to me, and I will seek more extensive guidance. It is a complicated area.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-40_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am grateful for that reply. If the information were not available in the company or pension fund concerned, that would be an offence. Under Inland Revenue rules, they must keep such information for seven years or so.
<P>

<a name="40913-40_para3"></a>I shall give the matter some further thought, but I am always worried when information begins to float around more widely. I particularly remember on one occasion when it floated into local authorities at a low level. I shall bear in mind what the noble Baroness said.

<a name="40913-40_para11"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 196 shall stand part of the Bill?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-40_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   This clause could be found virtually anywhere in the parts of the Bill containing the powers, duties and rights of the board of the Pension Protection Fund. It says:
<P>

<a name="40913-40_para12"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Board may, if it considers it appropriate to do so in any particular case, publish a report".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-40_para13"></a>I assume, as the clause comes in the fraud section of the Bill, that we are talking only about fraud, in which case that might be made a little clearer. I may have got it wrong, and the clause may apply to any case before the board relating to the entire Bill. In that case, it might be sensible to move the clause out of the fraud section into the more general section relating to the board earlier in the Bill.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-40_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I take the noble Lord's castigations, but I wonder whether what he said is <P>


<a name="column_GC286"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC286</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>completely true. There were previous amendments, for example, about the provision of information to members of schemes. It is not just a question of fraud; it is about the disclosure of information. We have passed the fraud section, and we are into clauses relating to information, some of which may indeed be fraudulently withheld. This is the general information section. I am happy to consider the matter, but the clause probably is in the appropriate place, and there is a bundle of amendments relating to information.
<P>

<a name="40913-40_para14"></a>As the noble Lord half suspected, the clause applies to all functions of the board. The board may wish to publish reports or statements containing details of consultation exercises, statistics concerning the PPF's functions or recommendations of good practice for schemes that become involved with the PPF. The clause was introduced by the Government in another place, following debate about similar provision for the regulator. As Members of the Committee shall see, Clause 196(3) contains the slightly unusual words,
<P>

<a name="40913-40_para15"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to be made with malice"</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

</P>

<P>

<a name="40913-40_para16"></a>Although Parliament is a privileged forum, the provision was inserted in response to concerns raised in another place about naming and shaming. It is an extra burden of care before going into a naming and shaming list of the sort that we have seen in the past, if the PPF decides to do that.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-40_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I am sorry to intervene after the Minister has spoken. I was very surprised at the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. This is the very last clause in Chapter 5, headed "Gathering Information"; Chapter 4 is headed "Fraud compensation". I do not see why this should be confined to matters relating to fraud.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-40_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   No, I think that we have moved on. Perhaps I may ask about a possible inconsistency in Clause 196. I am not a lawyer but I would welcome a response from the Minister on the matter. Subsection (3) states:
<P>

<a name="40913-40_para17"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For the purposes of the law of defamation, the publication of any matter by the Board is privileged unless the publication is shown to be made with malice".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-40_para18"></a>Is that consistent with the general exemption from liability in damages contained in Schedule 5(28)? That states:
<P>

<a name="40913-40_para19"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Neither the Board nor any person who is a member of the Board, a member of any of its committees or sub-committees, or a member of its staff is to be liable in damages for anything done or omitted in the exercise or purported exercise of the functions of the Board conferred by, or by virtue of, this or any other enactment".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-40_para20"></a>Another question is: would the qualified privilege for members of the board which is given for the purposes of the law of defamation equally apply for the purposes of the law of injurious falsehood? To put it differently, are the members of the board exempt from liability in damages in cases of injurious falsehood by virtue of Schedule 5(28), or will they be exempt from liability only if they have acted <i>bona fide</i> as there cannot be an injurious falsehood without an element <P>


<a name="column_GC287"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC287</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of malice? I apologise for not having given the noble Baroness notice of that technical question. I would be happy if she would prefer to respond in writing.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-40_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My understanding is that the position is exactly as the noble Lord described it at the end: any publication by the board is to be exempt from defamation unless it is shown to be made with malice. In other words, Clause 196(3) overrides the previous provision about no liability for damages. This means that an individual cannot prosecute the PPF for damages concerning the content of a report unless they can show to a court that the report has been made maliciously.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-40_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   Why is it thought appropriate that it should override Schedule 5(28)?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-40_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   As I recall, under Schedule 5(28) the members of the board would not be liable for damages where, for example, they acted in good faith. The question on which I was being pressed is whether they could give information about the status of a company which, to some extent, was a self-fulfilling prophecy&#151;in other words, information about its insolvency or risk. The company might feel that that was unreasonable or unfair. Unless the report was malicious, the issue of damages would not arise.

<A NAME="40913-41_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham </B>   moved Amendment No. 274F:

<a name="40913-41_para0"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 289, line 43, leave out paragraph 1.</UL><FONT SIZE=3>






<P>

<a name="40913-41_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: As we are moving on to a new chapter, it might be helpful if I make a few contextual remarks.

<P>

<a name="40913-41_para2"></a>Clause 197 is the first of a series of clauses in Chapter 6, which deals with reviews, appeals and maladministration. The clauses set out, among other things, the challenges that people can make to determinations made by the PPF board. I shall set out our overall strategy before coming to the specific amendments to the Schedule 9 list of reviewable matters.
<P>

<a name="40913-41_para3"></a>Our overall strategy for dealing with PPF appeals is to strike a balance between fairness and administrative efficiency. In order to achieve this we are introducing a two-stage internal review process within the PPF to deal with appeals. We will discuss the details of this if we discuss Clause 198. However, we envisage that it will be broadly similar to the process currently in place for occupational pension schemes generally. That will be an informal review and a right to refer on, if not satisfied with that, to a reconsideration sub-committee set up by the PPF to review more formally.
<P>

<a name="40913-41_para4"></a>Where someone remains dissatisfied with the outcome of the two-stage internal review process&#151;perhaps there has been an error of fact that they want corrected and a reconsideration&#151;they will be able to refer their dispute to the PPF ombudsman. This is a new office that we shall be setting up specifically for this purpose. The PPF ombudsman will be in a position to review matters of fact, law or maladministration.
<P>

<a name="40913-41_para5"></a>The intention of Clause 197, together with Schedule 9, is to make it clear on the face of the legislation which of the board's decisions can be challenged. One might ask why some PPF decisions might not be challenged. If I may say so, the sort of decision that could be challenged is fairly obvious when one scratches away at this. As regards a defined benefit scheme, if the levy payable has been calculated incorrectly, for example, it needs to be challenged. If it has not been corrected in the internal review process, it can be challenged with the ombudsman. However, the kind of decision that cannot be challenged is the formula used to calculate the levy. This is because the formula is used for all schemes and there can be no deviation from it. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to allow challenges to a formula that has been established for all schemes.
<P>

<a name="40913-41_para6"></a>I turn to the specific Amendments Nos. 274F, 274K and 274M, which amend Schedule 9. In the examples that I cited a few moments ago, our intention was to allow such challenges to be made under paragraph 1 of Schedule 9. However, we have recognised that the intention behind this paragraph may not be clear. We have therefore decided to replace it with the new paragraph which will sit after paragraph 15 (and which is to be introduced by Amendment No. 274M). This new paragraph makes it clear on the face of the Bill itself that the board's determination in relation to the <P>


<a name="column_GC289"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC289</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>initial or PPF levy can be challenged. This group of amendments also introduces Amendment No. 274K, which will allow a challenge to be made against the board's failure to obtain an actuarial valuation under Clause 135(2).
<P>

<a name="40913-41_para7"></a>Paragraph 7 of Schedule 9 already provides for challenges to be made against the board's approval of a scheme valuation, or the failure to approve such a valuation. However, we recognise that appeal rights need to be made available where the board fails to obtain a valuation. Amendment No. 274K makes provision for this.
<P>

<a name="40913-41_para8"></a>These amendments are essentially redrafting to close what might otherwise appear to be loopholes. I thought that it was worth taking the opportunity to spell out what we expect the role of the PPF ombudsman may be more generally. If the Committee wishes, I am very happy to enlarge on that role regarding costs, staff, number of cases we may expect and so on. I beg to move.




<P>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>




<P>

<a name="40913-41_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: The process of reconsideration by the board of reviewable matters struck me as being rather light&#151;an internal equivalent of judicial review. The board has to decide: first, whether the matter is within its competence; secondly, whether a review could make a material difference; and the third stage would be to conduct the review. The last two stages are already in the Bill but the first is not, which is the reason for the amendment. I beg to move.





<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-41_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I thought that I had touched on this matter to some extent, but perhaps I need to expand further.
<P>

<a name="40913-41_para16"></a>When a written application is made requesting a review of the board's determination of a "reviewable matter"&#151;we need to spell that out because some matters are not reviewable; for example, the structure of the formula&#151;there will be a two stage internal review procedure within the PPF to deal with it. It will be more informal and involve the correction of a mechanical error and a reconsideration committee. If an interested party is dissatisfied with the outcome of the first-stage review, which should pick up errors, it can request a second-stage review. This will be undertaken by a specially constituted committee of the   board, referred to in the legislation as the "Reconsideration Committee", which can undertake a review only if the dispute relates to a "reviewable matter" and a "review decision" has been given following a first-stage review.
<P>

<a name="40913-41_para17"></a>Amendment No. 275 would require the reconsideration committee to determine whether the matter is reviewable and then carry out the second-stage review. I do not believe that we need to do that because, by definition, if the reconsideration committee is sitting, it has already been determined that there is a reviewable matter that has come within its remit. We do not need that extra stage. I appreciate that a second-stage review could be requested when one is not appropriate. But if that occurs, the applicant will be advised of the correct review procedures to be followed&#151;he will not lose out on his right of appeal. So it is not necessary for the reconsideration committee to decide whether it can review and then go on to conduct a review. That would become the same process.
<P>

<a name="40913-41_para18"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 276 would require Clause   198(3) to be deleted. Clause 198(1) requires regulations to be made to require the board to undertake a review when it receives a written request to do so. So in general terms, if a person wishes to dispute a "reviewable matter" decision made by the board, he or she will need to do so in writing. However, Clause 198(3) allows the regulations to provide that a review can be undertaken on other occasions. For example, the levy payable by an eligible scheme may have been calculated incorrectly and an invoice may have been mistaken. Such an error could come to light in two main ways. We would hope that possibly the scheme trustees could bring the error to the board's attention by writing to ask for the decision to be reviewed. This would normally be corrected at the first-stage review.
<P>


<a name="column_GC291"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC291</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-41_para19"></a>Conversely, the board may notice the mistake after the invoice has been issued to the scheme. In that case the board would need to be able to review the decision of its own volition&#151;which it could not do if the amendment were passed. So by deleting this subsection the noble Lord would deny the board the capacity to correct mistakes that it has noticed, rather than the trustees. I am sure that he would not wish to do that.
<P>

<a name="40913-41_para20"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 277 would amend Clause 198(4)(d) which, as it stands, ensures that the regulations under Clause 198(1) must provide for the board to pay such compensation as it considers appropriate to such persons as it may determine. So, for example, when PPF compensation has been underpaid, the regulations may provide that the PPF board should reimburse the amount underpaid and may also include a requirement to pay interest. The intention is to ensure there is an adequate statutory remedy for any infringement of rights that has occurred. The regulation-making powers under Clause 198 will be used to provide adequate remedies. However, the opposition amendment would require the regulations to set parameters on the amount of compensation that the PPF board could pay in relation to "reviewable matters". That is not necessary, and the noble Lord did not press it in any of his arguments, so I hope that with that explanation the noble Lord will withdraw not only the amendment but the subsequent ones.

<P>

<a name="40913-42_para10"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 199, as amended, shall stand part of the Bill?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-42_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am a little puzzled by the clause. It is headed "Investigations by the Board of complaints of maladministration", but, unless I have misunderstood, the maladministration complained about is maladministration by the board, which will then carry out an internal inquiry. I may have misunderstood the purport of the clause, but, in any case, if the board is accused of maladministration, it would be more appropriate for the matter to be dealt with by some independent body, presumably the ombudsman for the Pension Protection Fund. I may have misunderstood the purpose of the clause.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-42_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I do not think that the noble Lord has misunderstood: that is exactly what will happen. The provisions of Clause 199 apply not only to PPF compensation but to fraud issues. If someone believes that there has been maladministration, the board will see whether the issue can be resolved through the informal process of reconsideration. If not, the matter will go to the PPF ombudsman, who will be completely independent of the board. The noble Lord is right.
<P>

<a name="40913-42_para11"></a>Basically, there is an internal review process that should pick up errors. There is a reconsideration committee to examine larger disputes&#151;about valuations or whatever&#151;that can be agreed between the parties. If not, matters of fact about valuations or matters relating to the appropriate application of the law or the mishandling of a case by the PPF board can go to the PPF ombudsman. From there, any matter of law, not of maladministration or fact, can go to the High Court. It is a four-stage procedure. I hope that, with that information, the noble Lord will feel that we have put some good steps in place.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-42_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am grateful for that explanation. It is not the normal procedure for an ombudsman. There is not normally an internal inquiry, nor is there any ability on the part of the body complained about to pay compensation. It would normally be the ombudsman who would decide whether it was appropriate for compensation to be paid. I have a nasty, sneaking feeling that the board will carry out an internal investigation and pay up fast, in order to prevent the matter getting to a wider audience. No doubt, that is excessively cynical on my part. I understand the mechanism that the noble Baroness has in mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-42_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   It is no different from the system for the pensions ombudsman under the 1993 Act. The noble Lord is right to say that it is different from my experience of local government or parliamentary ombudsmen and so on. The powers to require rectification are different. In local government, I sometimes did not feel that it was appropriate to do what the local government ombudsman wanted me to do. The ombudsman might have been dealing with an individual case against a local authority, and, in a planning case, there might be a triangular situation.
<P>

<a name="40913-42_para12"></a>The noble Lord is right to say that the powers are different. They are similar to those of the pensions ombudsman, and I hope that the noble Lord will agree that they are satisfactory.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-42_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I have some sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, on this matter, because the word "maladministration" hardly existed in political parlance before the existence of "ombudsmen". In other words it was something that was not necessarily criminal or illegal in civil law, but involved some inadequacy or inefficiency of a government department. When the parliamentary ombudsman was created, the famous Crossman list or schedule of ways in which the department could be guilty of maladministration was enunciated. It has been used ever since by all the public sector&#151;including local government, which the Minister mentioned&#151;and private sector ombudsmen. Their overriding concern has always been, "Has there been maladministration?".
<P>

<a name="40913-42_para13"></a>I suppose that I felt the same as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins&#151;at any rate until I also read Clause 205 which we have not yet debated. All that there is here is a situation in which the board can do an internal examination whereby such typical complaints of maladministration can be examined internally before one reaches the completely independent person, the ombudsman.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-42_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   That was a slight diversion. Such was the inflammatory speech made by the noble Lord that there seems to be a slight smell of burning on this side of the building. I gather that the matter is being investigated.

<P>

<a name="40913-43_para2"></a>First, they include the newly established PPF ombudsman, his staff and any deputy ombudsman in Schedule 1 to the Superannuation Act 1972.

Secondly, the amendments provide for the PPF ombudsman to pay to the Minister for the Civil Service the amount payable in respect of those pensions.

<P>

<a name="40913-43_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: I am something of a regulations and statutory instruments fanatic&#151;and have been for many years.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-43_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Perhaps the noble Lord is the statutory instruments ombudsman.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-43_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Not quite. So whenever I see the word "regulations" in a Bill I look at it extremely carefully. After all, the point about regulations and statutory instruments is that they are used for matters which change over time within the broad parameters of an Act of Parliament and may do so regularly. The noble Baroness produces or is responsible for endless social security statutory instruments during a year. Over the past seven years she has been responsible for an enormous number&#151;which I have not counted, but perhaps she keeps a running total.
<P>

<a name="40913-43_para9"></a>In this case regulations shall require the PPF ombudsman to conduct an oral hearing in relation to any reviewable matter, and so on, and enable him to consider evidence and make other provision about procedure for conducting investigations. I would have thought that that was pretty standard stuff and it would not change on a regular or even irregular basis before the likelihood in, say, seven or 10 years, of another pensions Bill. Therefore, regulations are certainly not appropriate and such matters could well be incorporated in a schedule to the Bill. I beg to move.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-43_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I do not agree with the noble Lord. We are talking about who can request a review by the PPF ombudsman, how such reviews are to be made and the time limits for doing so. It is perfectly reasonable that that should be done by regulations, but the regulations will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure&#151;so they would be debated in both Houses. Anything that contains time limits is particularly unwise.
<P>

<a name="40913-43_para10"></a>Regarding the prescribed persons, I could conceive that the bodies that believe themselves to be injured in any way might go wider than we would currently list. For example, at the moment there may be no statutory right for, say, an unmarried partner of either gender to have rights of compensation or whatever from a <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>scheme. We might list scheme members or survivors. That might well change over time and many of us hope it will, but that is a gradual process and depends on how broader society shares that view. Then we might need to add to this. The last thing that we would wish to do would be to come back with primary legislation requiring a Second Reading and three stages in both Houses, when it could be done by amending affirmative regulations. This seems to be exactly the sort of matter which I hope that, on reflection, the noble Lord would agree should be dealt with by regulation&#151;but through affirmative procedure so that the House would know what was going on.

<A NAME="40913-43_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   The example that the noble Baroness has just given would be quite a major shift in policy, although she says that she has hoped for it for some time, which, given her position, I can understand. Surely it would be part and parcel of an Act of Parliament in the future because it would affect not only this but all sorts of other things as well. Therefore, during the course of the legislation's proceedings through Parliament, it would be perfectly possible and proper to amend it to encompass this. I am afraid that I am not convinced by the example.

<P>

<a name="40913-44_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: The beginning of this clause was covered right at the outset of our discussions on the Bill. The provisions of this part apply to every occupational pension scheme other than a money purchase scheme or&#151;and this is the point&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-44_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The simple answer is that subsection (1) exempts money purchase schemes, prescribed schemes or schemes of a prescribed description from the remit of the scheme funding provision. Schemes that are currently exempt from the MFR and which we expect to be exempt from the minimum requirement include most public service schemes; schemes in which a Minister of the Crown has given a guarantee, such as the British coal and <P>


<a name="column_GC299"></a>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-44_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Not quite. The amendment refers to subsection (2), which says that regulations under subsection (1)(b)&#151;a prescribed scheme or a scheme of a prescribed description&#151;

<a name="40913-44_para12"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may provide for exemptions from all or any of the provisions of this Part".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-44_para13"></a>The question is whether those two go together, as it were, or whether there will be further regulations exempting some types of scheme from some provisions of this part.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-44_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   That will teach me to try to expedite proceedings.
<P>

<a name="40913-44_para14"></a>As well as schemes that will be exempt from the new funding provisions in their entirety, such as money purchase and Crown-guaranteed schemes, there will be some schemes for which some but not all the provisions should apply. The power to do this is in subsection (2) of the clause, as the noble Lord identified, which Amendment No. 280 seeks to remove. Without subsection (2), a scheme could only be fully bound by, or fully exempt from, the new funding provisions.
<P>

<a name="40913-44_para15"></a>The problem with that approach is that defined benefit schemes are not homogenous. We also need to cater for the specific situations that may arise during the life of an occupational pension scheme. The power in subsection (2) enables us to adapt legislation to fit the circumstances now and in the future. For instance, we may exempt schemes that are winding up from many of the new requirements, such as drawing up or revising a statement of funding principles, or putting a schedule of contributions in place.
<P>

<a name="40913-44_para16"></a>Where a scheme is in the process of winding up, it would be inappropriate to ask it to remedy the situation as if it were not winding up. That is the use of such a power. Where a scheme is winding up, members' interests will be protected by other legislation, such as the debt on the employer provisions, the statutory priority order and ultimately the PPF. We want that power to be able to exempt them from subsection (1).
<P>

<a name="40913-44_para17"></a>The power in subsection (2), together with the power in Clause 222 to modify the scheme funding provisions in prescribed circumstances also enables us to place appropriate requirements on particular schemes, such as those operating on a pan-European Union basis across national borders, or multi-employer schemes operating on an industry-wide basis.
<P>

<a name="40913-44_para18"></a>Taking these powers to make adjustments to the scheme funding provisions in regulations enables us to consult the pensions industry and other key stakeholders such as the CBI and the TUC on our proposals, and provides for the possibility of further modifications in the light of operational experience or the development of different types of scheme. Discussions with representatives from these groups are already under way and will continue as the detailed provisions are developed.

<P>

<a name="40913-44_para19"></a>I trust that the noble Lord will accept that some schemes are wholly exempt and some schemes may be because they are in the process of winding up. There may be some extremely complex pan-European schemes where one wants more finesse than the Bill allows. That is why we need the powers in subsection (2).

<P>
<P>

I apologise&#151;I had marked Clause 213, but the noble Lord wished to speak to the Question whether Clause 212 shall stand part. No doubt he will wish to speak to the Question whether Clause 213 shall stand part also.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-45_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   As I understand it, I am now speaking to the Question whether Clause 212 shall stand part. The noble Baroness was confused because an earlier version of the grouping presented the clauses in the <P>


<a name="column_GC301"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC301</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wrong order. It took me about a quarter of an hour this morning to work out what had happened, and I cannot do it on my feet now.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-45_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I picked this up again at 3 o'clock this afternoon and the error is still there. Anyway, that is fine.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-45_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   In that case, although I reported it, nothing happened. However, I think that I am right in saying that we are now on the Question whether Clause 212 shall stand part&#151;the statutory funding objective.
<P>

<a name="40913-45_para6"></a>As I began to say, this is a very important clause, as are those which immediately follow it. It effectively substitutes a statutory funding objective for the previous minimum funding requirement. Indeed, I believe that the minimum funding requirement is still in operation.
<P>

<a name="40913-45_para7"></a>I was not involved in the original legislation to introduce the minimum funding requirement, but there is a widespread view that it had serious technical problems and unfortunate consequences for the investment market. There was a strange effect on particular companies which came up against the limit of the minimum funding requirement. However, from my own experience, the fund of which I was chairman never got anywhere near the minimum funding requirement, but was funded above that. Even so, we might have had concerns at times about whether we were adequately funded. The minimum funding requirement effectively has not worked. That has been demonstrated by the number of company schemes which have gone bust. Presumably, if they had been funded at an appropriate level, they would not have done so.
<P>

<a name="40913-45_para8"></a>Can the noble Baroness tell us how many schemes are currently under their minimum funding requirement? I suspect that it is a very considerable number. Therefore, I welcome the change proposed by the Government&#151;namely, a scheme-specific funding objective which will be based on advice from the scheme actuary and would make it apparent to members and trade unions that the scheme was adequately funded.
<P>

<a name="40913-45_para9"></a>I gather that the department's pristine intention has been somewhat adjusted or, at any rate, affected by the European pensions directive. This includes various provisions, so that instead of having sensible expressions in the Bill such as the actuarial value of liabilities, we end up with references to schemes' "technical provisions"&#151;a totally meaningless expression which I understand is eurospeak for what one would normally call the value of the liabilities. However, it seems that this is the reality of the situation. I am not clear why we did not object to this kind of absurd terminology when the directive was being formulated, or perhaps we did and were overruled. However, there are other aspects that give cause for concern. It is appropriate to raise the following matter in connection with the clause that we are discussing.
<P>


<a name="column_GC302"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC302</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-45_para10"></a>I gather that the directive also requires that the fund should hold sufficient and appropriate assets. Whereas the expression "technical provisions" may become a term of art and reasonably well refined, the expression "sufficient and appropriate assets", at the other end of the scale, seems to be so vague as to be virtually meaningless. However, this is an important matter.
<P>

<a name="40913-45_para11"></a>It is also the case, if I understand it correctly, that the powers in the Bill as they stand at the moment would enable someone simply to adopt the MFR in its old form using the same powers. I gather that that is certainly not the Government's intention but is that a possible way in which the powers could be used?
<P>

<a name="40913-45_para12"></a>What is more worrying is the aspect of the matter&#151;if I understand the point correctly in the directive to which this clause is related&#151;which requires that the sufficient and appropriate assets have to be there at all times, which may not be the case at all with schemes at present. It is not clear what the expression "at all times" means, or whether the directive or this clause should make provision for them to be sufficient and appropriate for a limited period. It also raises difficult questions about how you value the liabilities together with the assets at a moment of time in terms of discounting for the fact that they are all not due at a particular moment. The expression "sufficient and appropriate assets at all times" presumably means at all times taking into account the fact that the liabilities and the assets do not relate to a moment of time but are spread over time.
<P>

<a name="40913-45_time0"></a><H5>5.15 p.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>

<a name="40913-45_para13"></a>There is concern that this clause could be interpreted to mean effectively that a scheme has to be funded on a full buy-out basis at any moment. I guess that a number of schemes are not in that position at the moment. The Minister may have data that illustrate whether that is true. While I think it is right that we should get rid of the minimum funding requirement, which has proved useless and an irritation at times, we should be careful to examine exactly what the Government are proposing as regards the statutory funding objective. I have sought to spell out some of the possible doubts about what it means. I should have thought that this is a matter of very considerable concern.
<P>

<a name="40913-45_para14"></a>Later we shall discuss the recovery period and so on, which is related to some extent to what I have just said. I hope that the noble Baroness will reassure us on these points, which are clearly very important, as the whole future viability of any scheme seems to be related to this clause.
<P>

<a name="40913-45_para15"></a>The relevant heading, which is not part of the Bill, refers to scheme funding. It would be clearer if it referred to schemes' funding, as scheme funding might appear in this context to refer to the pension protection scheme rather than to the schemes of pension funds. I should be grateful for the Minister's response.

<FONT SIZE=3>business and for individual pension funds. Can the Minister tell us her department's current estimate of the overall impact on pension funds of moving from the current MFR arrangements to the statutory funding objective, as it is called, either under current conditions or when it comes into effect? Can we have some order of magnitude, some idea of whether this will be a tougher or less tough target and by roughly how much, in money terms? That is very important in assessing this.
<P>

<a name="40913-45_para16"></a>We would also be grateful if the noble Baroness could give us further information on the sort of schemes where the gap between one and another will be greater. To have some overall estimate of the effect would be exceptionally useful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-46_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am certainly happy to respond. I endorse everything that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has said about the welcome there has been for moving from the MFR to scheme-specific funding. This has been widely welcomed by the industry for two broad reasons.
<P>

<a name="40913-46_para0"></a>While not wanting to use terms such as "one size fits all", I have been struck by the fact that MFR is very top-down. As a result, trustees have not owned the funding of their schemes as one would have hoped. They have been too reliant on a formula coming from their actuaries or their accountants and have not owned it themselves. One reason for that is that MFR, as most people would now agree, focused perhaps too narrowly on the connection between assets and liabilities and did not take into account the strength and solvency of the company and therefore the capacity, over time, to remedy matters.
<P>

<a name="40913-46_para1"></a>As was mentioned in a previous debate, a very strong company such as BT could be allowed a number of years to rectify matters, whereas a company that was much flakier might have a higher level of scheme-specific funding but less capacity to remedy up to meeting its full liabilities. There are two broad grounds. Scheme-specific funding is a determination by the trustees on funding methods, which can be ongoing or discontinuous depending on whichever method is adopted, given the advice of their actuaries and reflecting their investment principles. That allows a more realistic&#151;we hope&#151;structure for the pension promises originally made to be delivered.
<P>

<a name="40913-46_para2"></a>The noble Lord asked me how many schemes are currently underfunded under MFR. I am amazed that I have the answer&#151;I am very impressed with myself. I am told that, as of December 2003, some 45 per cent of schemes were less than 100 per cent funded on the MFR basis. He also asked whether a scheme could accept or adopt the MFR in a slightly lazy-minded way and simply move over. That could happen only if the trustees and the scheme actuary made a series of decisions which effectively put the individual scheme at this level. They could not, under the legislation, simply adopt the MFR. In other words, they could arrive at a scheme-specific funding level which presumably was aligned with that of the MFR; they could not simply introduce the MFR in lieu of scheme-specific funding.
<P>


<a name="column_GC304"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC304</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-46_para3"></a>The noble Lord's third point was about the European directive and the phrase "technical provisions". The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, has raised this point as well. Under the new scheme funding requirements, each scheme will be required to meet the statutory funding objectives of having sufficient and appropriate assets to cover its "technical provisions". Where that statutory funding objective is not met, the scheme's trustees must put a recovery plan in place.
<P>

<a name="40913-46_para4"></a>The term "technical provisions" is used but not defined in directives. I circulated some background material on this earlier. It is worth putting this point in <i>Hansard</i> because, as the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said, it sounds dusty but is actually key. We consider that "technical provisions" mean the amount that the trustees, on actuarial advice, judge that a scheme needs to have in its fund now to be able to meet its accrued pension commitments as they fall due, to be paid in the future, as far as can be reasonably foreseen, according to sufficiently prudent assumptions on factors such as investment returns, life expectancy and so on, and taking account of all commitments for future benefits and contributions.
<P>

<a name="40913-46_para5"></a>The Bill describes technical provisions as the amount required, on an actuarial basis, to make provision for the scheme's liabilities. The intention is to require schemes to value their liabilities on a full solvency basis: that is, the cost of discharging all their accrued liabilities by the purchase of insurance company annuities.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-46_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Is there legal advice that that definition is acceptable in the terms of the directive?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-46_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I shall come on to that, because one of the points that the noble Lord raised cross-refers back. I believe that I shall be able to meet that point. The European directive was originally extremely heavy in terms of valuations required: it required full valuations every year. We were able to get a derogation from that to triennial valuations with interim valuations where there has been a material change. I believe that that will substantially reduce some of the burdens on companies in a sensible way.
<P>

<a name="40913-46_para6"></a>The noble Lord then asked about sufficient and appropriate assets at all times. I am assured that that applies only to schemes which are operating on a cross-border basis. Cross-border schemes will have to comply with the scheme funding provisions in Part 3 of the Bill, as modified under the powers in Clause 222, to take account of that requirement. For example, it is likely that schemes will be required to undertake annual valuations and send a copy of the valuation report to the Pensions Regulator, but it applies only to a section of schemes.
<P>

<a name="40913-46_para7"></a>The noble Lord cheerily asked a question about apostrophes. He may be quite right about that. There was rather a nice line in the <i>New York Times</i>, which I read when I was in the States this summer and which I should like to share with the Committee. It said that President Bush was hostile to all taxes, including syntax. I cannot help feeling that this may be one case where he may come up against that.

<P>

<a name="40913-46_para8"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, asked me for statistics on the overall impact on scheme-specific funding and on the financial implications for schemes. The pension benefits must obviously be properly funded in order that the benefits can be paid as they fall due. I do not have a cost figure in the sense that the actual cost of providing the pension benefits promised by DB schemes is not altered by the replacement of the MFR with the new scheme. The noble Lord needs to return to his question. The cost of a scheme being able to meet its full pension promise as defined classically is not altered by whether you have MFR or scheme-specific funding: that remains a constant. In that sense the requirement of schemes to meet their pension promise remains unchanged and, therefore, the cost to do so remains unchanged.
<P>

<a name="40913-46_para9"></a>But certainly MFR and scheme-specific funding allow trustees to make different decisions, whether on an ongoing or discontinuous basis, on the advice of their actuary, and to take into account different considerations, such as the strength and solvency of the company, in how they best meet that obligation of delivering the full pension promise at the point at which a member leaves. I do not know that I can add to that. I do not know whether the noble Lord wishes to press me further, in which case I invite him to do so. I hope that I have met some of the questions that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, raised.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-46_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am certainly grateful for that reply. The figure that the Minister mentioned of 45 per cent of schemes being at the moment below the MFR is a frightening one. I am not clear how those concerned with supervising the schemes enabled that situation to come about. Would I be right in thinking, however, that with a scheme-specific funding system introduced (assuming, <i>ceteris parabis</i>, all else being equal) rather more than 45 per cent would manage to meet immediately their scheme-specific funding level? The noble Baroness shakes her head.
<P>

<a name="40913-46_time0"></a><H5>5.30 p.m.</H5>
</P>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-46_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Not necessarily, because scheme-specific funding is about seeking to ensure that the scheme will be able to discharge its full liabilities as and when its members seek to draw those liabilities down. Each scheme will be different; one scheme will proceed on an ongoing basis and another on a discontinuous basis, while another may have a different ratio of deferred members to active members. They may have different salary structures and may, reasonably or otherwise, be making different assumptions about longevity. They may have different strategies relating to future salary increases by the employer. All those things will come into the scheme funding schedule, such that the trustees on the advice of the actuary must produce a funding strategy to satisfy the regulator that the funding promise will at an appropriate time be able to be met.
<P>

<a name="40913-46_para10"></a>I do not believe that one can do such an easy read-across. It was possible with MFR because it was standardised, which is why I was able to produce those <P>


<a name="column_GC306"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC306</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>statistics&#151;slightly to my own surprise. It cannot be done with scheme-specific funding in the same way. What we can do is to ensure that the regulator works with the trustees on the advice of the actuaries to ensure that, given certain assumptions and decisions made by the trustees, the pension promise of that scheme should be met in full over a realistic and appropriate period of time.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-46_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Making the change from MFR to scheme-specific funding may have an effect on whether or not the employer decides to close the scheme. Again that will depend on individual cases and it is uncertain how that will go.
<P>

<a name="40913-46_para11"></a>The Minister in her first reply, rather than in her recent intervention, said that we had obtained a derogation from the European directive&#151;if I recall correctly, with reference to whether the "at all times" provision applied or not. Is that a permanent derogation? She went on to say that the "at all times" provision applied only to schemes on a cross-border basis. Some of them, such as that of Shell, would be very important. But it seems very odd to have one standard for cross-border schemes and another for UK schemes. There are obviously implications as to whether the European directive and those enthusiastic for it were trying to have a scheme always funded on a full buy-out basis. I gather that was something that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was not wildly enthusiastic about, which I can understand.
<P>

<a name="40913-46_para12"></a>These are serious points. We should consider to what extent the present wording of the clause represents the best we can do. The original intention of the Treasury seems to have been significantly altered in some respects by the implication of the directive. I shall make other points on subsequent clauses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-47_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   The Minister invited me to press her further on this matter. I obviously did not ask my question clearly enough.
<P>

<a name="40913-47_para0"></a>I understand and accept that changing the funding objective does not make any difference to the actual assets that one has or to the actual cost at any one time, and does not change the pension promise. However, my question was&#151;and I repeat it, I hope, more clearly&#151;what does the department believe the effect of changing from the MFR to the statutory funding objective will have, on average, on the liabilities or underfunding of schemes?
<P>

<a name="40913-47_para1"></a>The Minister did not begin to answer that question. She proudly pulled out of her notes the figure of 45 per cent of schemes being underfunded on an MFR basis in December 2003. On the new statutory funding objective proposed, what proportion does the department estimate would have been underfunded at that time? I do not think that it is nearly good enough to say, "We've no idea, it will depend on the individual trustees". Has no estimate or assessment been made by the department? That was what I was asking&#151;and I ask it again more clearly, I hope.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-47_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   The Minister said that it would be possible for a scheme to devise an arrangement which <P>


<a name="column_GC307"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC307</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was the equivalent of the old MFR. Given that that arrangement has failed to ensure that schemes are properly funded, do we need to tighten up the clause so that a particular scheme could not in effect reproduce the MFR, with all its inadequacies?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-47_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   On that last point, I was at pains to say that it is not that those schemes will replace MFR but that they could end up with the same figure as they reached under the MFR scheme. Under MFR, they might well have been 95 per cent or 98 per cent funded; they may get to the same point by completely different paths.

<P>

<a name="40913-47_para2"></a>With reference to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, I cannot see how one can answer it until one knows the type of scheme funding principles adopted by individual schemes. There is clearly a difference between ongoing and discontinuous schemes, with assumptions being made about having a full buy-out immediately or over time. It would be a question of what would be appropriate, given the assumptions being made about salary increases and so on. Perhaps the noble Lord could tell me, but I do not see how one could make that estimate.
<P>

<a name="40913-47_para3"></a>I can see how at the end of a period of time in which schemes have in place the scheme funding assessment one could do an account and see where one scheme was 90 per cent funded, another 85 per cent and another 92 per cent. One might turn that into a sum, add the difference up and show the difference between where the schemes were and where they needed to be. I do not see how one could do that in advance, because each scheme would be judged by its own criteria, which it has yet to set up.
<P>

<a name="40913-47_para4"></a>I may be being dense, but I do not see how I can answer the noble Lord's question. That is the whole advantage or&#151;if he likes&#151;difficulty of moving away from MFR. I suspect that it is one of the reasons why the PPF has to have a separate set of valuations&#151;in order to produce precisely the standardised scheme that the noble Lord is asking for, which will not be provided by scheme-specific funding. The question there is whether it is possible to meet or exceed the compensation offered by the PPF.
<P>

<a name="40913-47_para5"></a>I do not believe that I can answer the noble Lord's question, and I do not believe that we shall have the information until scheme-specific funding strategies are in place, and we can see the degree of shortfall by individual schemes. That will vary from scheme to scheme; it may align itself with MFR, or it may not.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-47_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   I believe that the Minister can answer me&#151;and the answer that I am hearing loud and clear is that the DWP has made no estimates and does not know what the effect will be. That is a fair summary of what the Minister has just said: the department has made no estimate of what the effect will be. The 45 per cent figure will obviously no longer be relevant. The department has no idea what the figure will be, or whether there will be more or less underfunding. The department has no views on what <P>


<a name="column_GC308"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC308</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would be an appropriate method; the department shrugs its shoulders and leaves the matter to individual funds. That is really what the Minister said.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-47_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   That is a provocative and frankly absurd way in which to put the matter. I was trying in a reasonably thoughtful way to say to the noble Lord that he was asking a question that pre-judges answers to questions that have not yet been addressed by individual schemes. Only when we have that information can we make that estimate. For the noble Lord to say that we are shrugging our shoulders is absolutely absurd, and he knows it. I do not mind him in the least deciding to enliven proceedings by going in for a bit of combative rhetoric.
<P>

<a name="40913-47_para6"></a>Normally, I would have hoped that with the noble Lord's background and experience, he would be more reflective about the situation in which funds will find themselves. Until we know by what method they seek, on the basis of actuarial advice, to propose a scheme-funding structure and get it evaluated by the regulator, we will not be able to add the sums up. For me to suggest otherwise would lack integrity. For the noble Lord to say that when I cannot tell him the answer to his question, it shows that we are simply shrugging our shoulders, is to put a spin on the matter. I hope that on reflection he will realise that what he said was good fun but actually absurd.






<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-47_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   I shall try once more, then. The trouble is that I first asked the question in a very low-key way and got no answer at all. I have asked two or three times now whether the department has made any estimate of the overall effect of the change.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-47_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   No&#151;but I put it to the noble Lord that there are about 10,000 DB schemes out there. How many of those does he believe will go for the scheme-specific funding on an ongoing basis or a discontinuous basis? He has five seconds in which to answer.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-47_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   I shall take that as a no.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-47_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am asking the noble Lord a question about the sort of information that we would need even to begin to make the sort of assessment that the noble Lord has invited me to make. That is the whole point of scheme-specific funding, which is bottom up. If we were laying down an MFR funding assessment from the top, we could take a measurement and say how big a slice was missing.
<P>

<a name="40913-47_para7"></a>The industry has welcomed the detailed scheme-specific funding, with its assessments of assets liabilities, future salary increases, assumptions about longevity, staff turnover, the ratio of deferred pensioners and so on. That funding is individually constructed on individual schemes&#151;so I cannot then be blasted by the noble Lord for not being able to produce the information, which is available only when there is a top-down funding assessment, such as the <P>


<a name="column_GC309"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC309</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>MFR. If the noble Lord believes that the department could and should have made an estimate, what methodology does he think that it should have employed which would have been sufficiently robust?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-47_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   I am only asking a simple question about whether the department has or has not made that assessment. I have now got an answer, although it seems difficult to get it clear. But if that is the answer, that is fine.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-47_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The answer is not difficult to get clear. It is difficult to make an answer, for the reasons that I have given. The noble Lord wants me to give an answer that would not have integrity, because the schemes have not made a decision about how they will assess their scheme funding, and the regulator is not yet in a position to authorise that decision as appropriate. But that is not the department shrugging its shoulders.
<P>

<a name="40913-47_para8"></a>To say that I cannot give the noble Lord the information I would like when, by definition, it does not exist, is not to walk away from the problem. It is a proper, truthful and honest assessment of the situation. It is no use the noble Lord putting a spin on that; the fact is that we do not have that information, for the best of reasons and not for the worst. The best of reasons is that the schemes will produce that information, not the Government, and that is why we have abandoned the MFR standard. I do not believe that I can go beyond that; the figures do not exist because the schemes have not yet introduced their scheme-funding method. Only when they do can we assess the shortfall between that and the capacity to meet full wind-up buy-out promises. At that point, I am sure that we shall all be very happy to share that information.
<P>

<a name="40913-47_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, asked about the European directive. The directive does not require a domestic scheme to be fully funded, in the sense that it must at any time be able to buy annuities and deferred annuities to discharge all its accrued liabilities immediately. That is unrealistic and inappropriate for an ongoing scheme, because liabilities fall in over time. We are coming back to the FI 17-type debate here.
<P>

<a name="40913-47_para10"></a>Looking at the official journal of the European directive, I believe that it is clear that the concern over cross-border schemes is that there may be no capacity for a cross-European scheme to have a statutory recovery period to be negotiated with the regulator. That is why they are requiring funding at all times. Paragraph 3 of Article 16 states:
<P>

<a name="40913-47_para11"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the event of cross-border activity as referred to in article 20, the technical provisions must be fully funded at all times in respect of the total range of schemes operated at all times. If these conditions are not met, the competent authority"&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-48_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   So does that mean that Shell, for example, has to be fully funded?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-48_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   Perhaps I may help the Minister. I suspect that it depends whether the Shell UK pension scheme is separate from the European one, but I am only guessing.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-48_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes, that may be right. That is our reflex, but perhaps the noble Lord will let me look into that regarding the Shell case.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-48_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I gave Shell only as an example so that does not really help. But it seems surprising anyway that we should have different standards for cross-border schemes than we have for our UK schemes if a cross-border scheme is based in the UK.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-48_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   In the UK?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-48_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Yes. It seems that a scheme based in the UK which has cross-border implications would always have to be fully funded on a buy-out basis, whereas a UK scheme would not. I cannot see any justification other than the fact that we are stuck with a super-European directive which would require that.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-48_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   We will be dealing with cross-border matters under Part 7. I promise to look at every damn cross-border scheme I can think of to see whether it is protected by a separate free-standing scheme, as the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott said. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will permit us to concentrate our debate on the Shell situation when we deal with Part 7 of the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-48_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   This clause seems relatively straightforward. I am not clear why there are civil penalties relating to it or how civil penalties would apply as a sanction. What kind of civil penalty is implied?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-48_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Perhaps I may help the noble Baroness. The clause as such is very important, but it appears to be relatively straightforward compared with the previous clause. However, right at the end it <P>


<a name="column_GC311"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC311</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>says that if the clause is not complied with there will be civil penalties. I am not clear what would happen. Does the Pension Protection Fund sue the trustees?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-48_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The regulator is entitled to impose fines in respect of specified breaches of the requirement of the legislation, continuing the powers under the powers of the Pensions Act 1995.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-48_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   There are some variations in the way in which sanctions apply, and what is apparently envisaged here are fines and so on; whereas, for example, we shall deal later with a clause about whether trustees or the company can give advice. At the moment if one gives advice&#151;as I know only too well, having to avoid that&#151;one is subject to criminal penalties, which is an absurd arrangement.

Again, I assume that the provision is designed to get round&#151;if that is not a dangerous way in which to put it&#151;the European directive. Normally, the process would be triennial; apparently, it is all right if there is an actuary's report in the middle. Any prudent scheme normally does that, but I was not clear why the process was phrased in such a roundabout way, rather than simply saying "every three years". I beg to move.

Basically, we thought that it was unreasonable to ask for full-scale valuations every year; we are going therefore for triennial valuations, as is customary, with interim valuations to meet the agreement that we have come to.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-48_para13"></a>There is one point that I should like to establish. The technical drafting amendments simply clarify whether the provisions apply to the future or the past. However, it might be helpful to clarify an issue on which we have received a number of representations. We are aware that a requirement to seek the agreement of the sponsoring employer raises particular issues for schemes in which the rules of the scheme give the trustees or scheme actuary the responsibility for determining the level of contributions payable to the scheme. Such a requirement would override existing rules of the scheme in a way that could have an adverse impact on the security of members' benefits. We have concluded that it would not be appropriate to override existing rules of schemes in that situation. We therefore propose to modify the new provision under the powers in Clause 222 to provide that when rules of the scheme provide for the trustees or scheme actuary to set the contribution rate, that arrangement may continue.
<P>

<a name="40913-48_para14"></a>I wanted to put that detail on the record.

That will be done in consultation with the industry, and will be turned into a code of guidance that it can follow. The other virtue of using that phrase is that it avoids the hassle that we had with OPRA, whereby something like 52 per cent of offences reported to it were of employers paying their contributions a day or a couple of days late. We shall get rid of that level of detailed graffiti.
<P>

<a name="40913-48_para20"></a>The overriding issue is that there will be a general code of guidance as to what "reasonable period" means in all parts of the Bill, which will be an easy ready reckoner for practitioners to consult.

<A NAME="40913-48_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   That is very helpful. Clearly, "a reasonable period" may be unreasonable in some cases and overgenerous in others. I am glad that it will be spelt out in regulations that will end up as a code of practice. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40913-49_para2"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 216, as amended, shall stand part of the Bill?






<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-49_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   The clause gives rise to the other part of the argument that we began earlier on MFRs, and so on&#151;namely, what is to be done if a particular scheme turns out to be, in nice, simple, non-European terms, in deficit. The question is over what period the scheme should be required to bring itself back into conformity with its statement of funding principles.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para3"></a>The matter is affected to some extent by the European directive. Obviously, if it were in the form of a buy-out situation, that would not matter; but if 45 per cent of schemes are below their MFR, it seems probable that a very considerable number of them will be below any likely or sensible scheme-specific standard. Things will have to be done over various time periods, and it is not clear to what extent the regulator will be able to require a scheme to put its matters right in a particular time. I presume that he would take into account the strength of the employer, so that it would not be appropriate to have the same provision for all schemes. Perhaps, however, that is rather paradoxical; perhaps, if the employer is strong, he ought to put things right straightaway, rather than it be argued that he is a strong employer so that it does not matter if he does not do so for some time. There is something of a paradox there.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para4"></a>Regulations are to specify acceptable recovery periods, rather than the regulator doing so. I was not quite clear why the Government were to specify such periods; presumably, that relates to the solvency of the scheme and of the company. Is it really appropriate for the Government to do that through regulation, rather than the regulator?
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para5"></a>The other difficult problem arises when we consider what will happen if the recovery period extends beyond the date of the next revaluation. Does it then roll forward? If the recovery period goes over the next six years, does one start all over when one comes to the next valuation and roll it forward again? In those circumstances, is it possible for the end of the recovery period never to be reached? The noble Baroness looks <P>


<a name="column_GC314"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC314</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rather puzzled. Not to put too fine a point on it, she did not see this one coming. If the recovery period is six years, does it remain at six years, or does it depend on a valuation taking place in the mean time? The valuation may be either better or worse than was expected when the plan to end the deficit was made, of course.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para6"></a>Those are the main points that arise on the clause, and I would be grateful for the Minister's comments.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_time0"></a><H5>6 p.m.</H5>
</P>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-49_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   What is the Government's thinking on a longstop maximum reasonable recovery period? Would 20 years be acceptable under any circumstances? Would 10 years be too much? It would be helpful if we had some indication of the Government's thinking on maxima.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-49_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The clause is rather important, and it may help if I try to widen the debate. I try to cut my comments down as much as possible, so that we can expedite proceedings, but what happens when a valuation shows that a scheme is underfunding against the statutory funding objective is a critical issue. Where that happens, subsection (1) requires the trustees or managers to prepare or review, and if necessary revise, a recovery plan. The intention is that a recovery plan should be put in place where a valuation indicates that there is a funding shortfall, with no recovery plan in place. If a subsequent valuation shows that there is still a deficit, the trustees or managers will be required to review the recovery plan and, if necessary&#151;for instance, because the shortfall has increased&#151;revise it.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para7"></a>In that sense, no recovery plan is open-ended over three years. For example, if there was an acceptable recovery plan to take place over six years with a three-year evaluation, that does not mean that one has another six years thereafter. At that point, one would be seeing to what extent one could move forward, and therefore whether the contribution came from the employer or whether anything else needed to be made more rigorous in the circumstances. I looked sceptical while the noble Lord was pushing me because the problem seemed more theoretical than real. Over the three years, liabilities and assets may both have changed quite sharply and, as a result, further revaluation would take place at that point. In the light of what has happened to the stock market and so on, the recovery plan may be closer to realisation than was originally expected.

<P>

<a name="40913-49_para8"></a>There is a power in subsection (1) to prescribe the time within which the recovery plan must be prepared or reviewed, and if necessary revised. It is worth putting on record that we intend that the period should be 12 weeks from the date on which the actuary signs the valuation report. That is currently the period allowed under the MFR for preparing or reviewing and revising a schedule of contributions and putting it in place following a valuation. Under the new provisions the preparation and review of any recovery plan will be a complementary activity with the preparation and review of the schedule of contributions following a valuation. We do not, therefore, expect the common timetable to cause <P>


<a name="column_GC315"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC315</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problems for schemes. As required by subsection (2), the recovery plan will be a document showing the steps to be taken to bring the funding of the scheme back on track and the period over which the trustees plan to make good the shortfall.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para9"></a>I want to make it clear that we do not expect to specify in legislation a fixed period for correcting the shortfall. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, asked whether we had a maximum in mind&#151;20 years, 10 years, 50 years, whatever. He will not like my answer at all, any more than he did my previous answer, because he is asking for answers to questions that, by definition, do not have the sort of answers that he would like. The time will depend on the circumstances of the scheme. For example, in an ongoing scheme, it may be appropriate for the recovery period to be the average remaining working life of the members. However, in a scheme closed to future members, where most of the members are pensioners, a shorter recovery period may be more appropriate. I shall not be tempted today to put years on that.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para10"></a>We do not have a fixed period. That is a key difference with the new scheme's funding provisions, and one which has been widely welcomed. One of the main criticisms of MFR was the very inflexible rectification time in which schemes had to get to 90 per cent in three years or to 100 per cent in 10 years. That proved unacceptable to business. The rigidity of that was independent of the solvency of the employer and the strength of the company. It made the fixed target of 90 per cent in three years in practice one of the areas in which MFR was most criticised, as I am sure that Members of the Committee are aware, because of the rigidity of the recovery period independent of the viability of the company.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para11"></a>Under the new scheme funding arrangements, the trustees and the employer, with the advice of the actuary, will be required to work together to develop a customised funding plan for their scheme. It will need to take account of the specific circumstances and nature of the scheme, as required by subsection (3). Trustees will need to have regard, for example, to matters such as the age profile of the scheme members, and whether the scheme is open to new members. The code of practice which the regulator will issue on trustees' duties under Part 3 will give guidance on the matters which trustees will need to take into account in determining how and over what period any shortfall is to be made up.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para12"></a>Although we are not specifying a fixed period for correcting deficits, we are putting safeguards in place to prevent abuse. There are sensible precautions to protect the interests of scheme members and to demonstrate compliance with the requirement of the European pensions directive, which allows schemes to be underfunded for a "limited period of time", provided that they put a "concrete and realisable" recovery plan in place under Article 16. Therefore, recovery plans will be subject to such other requirements as may be prescribed in regulations <P>


<a name="column_GC316"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC316</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>under subsection (3), and subsection (4) requires trustees or managers to take account of prescribed matters when preparing or revising the recovery plan.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para13"></a>It is our intention to require that recovery plans are time-limited and comply with certain limitations to ensure that schemes do not effectively plan to operate with an open-ended deficit. We are currently discussing the nature of those limitations with representatives from employers, the pensions industry and OPRA. For instance, regulations may prevent arrangements under which the whole deficit was repaid towards the end of the recovery period, or may require plans to be structured to restrict the amount of re-spreading permitted.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para14"></a>I do not know whether there is anything further that I can usefully add. Subsection (5) enables regulations to set out other circumstances in which a recovery plan may or must be prepared or revised, following a valuation. Subsection (6) requires schemes to send a copy to the Pensions Regulator, which will allow him to apply closer scrutiny or take regulatory action where it deems that members' benefits may be at risk. I emphasise that we are consulting representatives from employers, the pensions industry and OPRA on what additional information would most assist the regulator in identifying the schemes where members' benefits might be at risk.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para15"></a>Clearly, the size of the deficit relative to the scheme assets, the number of members and the length of the plan are all factors. However, other factors, such as the relative strength of the funding strategy chosen by the trustees will be equally relevant. For instance, members' benefits could be less at risk where there was a larger deficit in a scheme where the technical provisions are calculated on an extremely prudent basis, than where there was a smaller deficit in a scheme where the technical provisions are calculated on a moderately prudent basis.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para16"></a>We will also require schemes to give their members details of any recovery plan that they put in place, when they send them annual information about the scheme's funding position. We will do that through an amendment to the current disclosure regulations for occupational pension schemes. The clause follows the approach taken elsewhere in Part 3.
<P>

<a name="40913-49_para17"></a>I have taken some time, but I thought it might be useful to set down some of what we think that we can do and what is being progressed in consultation with OPRA, employers and the pensions industry and will therefore come forward in regulations and guidance. I hope that I have answered some of the questions, except for the ones that are by definition unanswerable. That does not prevent them being asked, but it means that one cannot give the tidy answers that in other circumstances would be helpful.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-50_spnew0"></A><B> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </B>   I apologise for having to flit in and out of the Committee's proceedings to other engagements elsewhere. The area is very important, and I am grateful to the Minister for spelling it out so far as she could. I want to take her a stage further, however. I can see that, for trustees, managers, employers and actuaries, in certain <P>


<a name="column_GC317"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC317</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>circumstances, it will be vital to get it right. She indicated a number of factors that require flexibility from scheme to scheme. However, it was not absolutely clear, to me at least, whether there would eventually be a firm time limit on all schemes. Naturally, she would not give one today and said that consultation was going on with industry. However, at the end of the day, will there be through regulations guidance to trustees and managers on exactly what the ultimate time limit is within which they have to operate?
<P>

<a name="40913-50_para0"></a>I note, for example, in Clause 221(2), that the regulator will have powers to give directions about how and over what period any failure to meet the statutory funding objective should be rectified. That rather suggests that the regulator will have to review, for individual schemes or schemes as a whole, exactly what the limited time period should be. In drawing up recovery plans, trustees, managers and employers would need some clear idea of what that was. Is it ultimately intended that there will be clearer guidance than can be given today?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-50_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   For clarification, did the reference to a 12-week period mean the period within which the recovery plan has to be produced? The Minister indicates that that is so. In line with what my noble friend said, I understand that it is now not the Government's intention to set recovery periods. However, the regulator will presumably do so. Can I be clear about valuations? If, soon after the Bill comes in, a six-year recovery period is set by the regulator, presumably that will be adhered to regardless of whether there is a valuation in the mean time. Will the scheme be six years if the scheme is better off, worse off or the same, or will we get a new recovery period every time that we have a revaluation?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-50_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The noble Lord's understanding is absolutely right; the 12 weeks is the period to produce the recovery plans, as with OPRA.
<P>

<a name="40913-50_para1"></a>We are finding it hard to engage on the point about the six years and renewal because the process is that the regulator will normally intervene in directions only when the trustees and employers cannot agree, fairly obviously. Basically, it will be for the trustees and employers to produce a rectification or recovery plan to be able to meet the scheme funding and take that into account. In the light of that and other information that the regulator has about a company's solvency, investment principles and so on, the regulator may decide that the recovery plan is realistic, needs to be tightened or can be extended. It will certainly not be open-ended, but the regulator may wish to expedite things and accept that the timetable is prudent and appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40913-50_para2"></a>At the point of the three-year valuation, the recovery may have been completed. It may not have been, or may need to be expedited because the situation of assets has worsened or liabilities have increased. In light of that, the recovery plan may need to be amended. In that sense, I suspect that that would be a reiterative but sensible process. I cannot answer <P>


<a name="column_GC318"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC318</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the question in the way the noble Lord put it, again; I have to do it in the form of a dialogue. The outcome is very clear. The degree of intervention from the regulator will be determined by the degree to which the regulator believes that a scheme may be at risk. Therefore, it needs to exercise greater stringency and oversight to prevent a scheme coming into the PPF at some point in future.
<P>

<a name="40913-50_para3"></a>I wonder whether I have answered the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, with the answer that I have just given. All recovery periods will be time limited. That will not be set out in regulations, because we are not talking about MFR. Regulations will give guidance in the code of practice for trustees, but it will be for trustees, on the advice of actuaries, to produce a plan that the regulator is satisfied meets the objective to be able to meet the pension promise as laid down by the rules of the scheme. I do not know whether I can help further.
<P>

</P>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-50_spnew3"></A><B> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </B>   The Minister could provide clarification simply by answering on this point. That means that there will not be a fixed time limit right across the board eventually. The regulator will have the power to decide, in terms of the individual scheme, whether the time limit set by the trustees and employer is too long and will therefore, taking into account all the factors, be able to come back and say, "I want a shorter time limit than has been set" or whatever.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-50_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   That is exactly right, precisely because each scheme will be different. It would depend on the valuation, whether ongoing or discontinuous. Information about future possibilities of salary increase and so on, and an assessment of the strength of the company are relevant. The company may say, "We would like five years", and the regulator may say, "You should be able to do this in three years". If the regulator is not satisfied that the scheme is appropriate and realistic, it will come in. That will vary from scheme to scheme; there will not be a common time period. That was precisely the problem of MFR, when there were three years to get to 90 per cent and 10 years to get to 100 per cent, which really took no account of the profile of the scheme, the age of its members, the pay levels of those members, the life expectancy assumptions made by its actuaries and the like. I agree with the noble Lord's description; it is also my understanding that that is the process to be followed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-50_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   There are one or two points on the clause, which is concerned with matters on which the employer has to agree with the trustees or managers. I shall ask a question that I have been meaning to ask all the way through. I am not sure why managers keep turning up. There are employers, employees and trustees, but managers have nothing to do with the matter. However, it was noticeable in the case in the courts between Unilever and its fund manager that it was the manager&#151;a glamorous lady matched by an equally glamorous lady on the other side&#151;who constantly turned up rather than the chairman of trustees. I was never clear why. What is the role of managers in all such matters? Their status is rather strange.
<P>

<a name="40913-50_para14"></a>The other thing that worries me about the clause is that the trustees or managers and the employer must agree on certain issues, such as,
<P>

<a name="40913-50_para15"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the methods and assumptions to be used in calculating the scheme's technical provisions".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>



<P>

<a name="40913-50_para16"></a>I may be quite wrong, but my understanding is that that is not the present position. At the moment, the methods and assumptions to be used in calculating the scheme's assets and liabilities are a matter for the trustees and the actuaries. It is not necessary to get the agreement of the employer to the assumptions. If that is not so, I have been behaving rather oddly on a number of previous occasions, because certainly one did not use to get the agreement of the employers to what was suggested.
<P>

<a name="40913-50_para17"></a>In subsection (4), there is mention of a "reasonable period". I have no problem with that, but the relationship between the employers and the trustees is very important. It is important that the trustees act in an independent manner.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   On the first point about mergers, the noble Lord is quite right. He has asked me this about three times, and each time I have overlooked the point in my response. The provision concerns public sector schemes not protected by Crown guarantee, such as Arts Council stuff&#151;that shopping list of schemes which have managers rather than trustees. They are not protected by Crown guarantee; they are DB schemes and they come within <P>


<a name="column_GC320"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC320</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the scope of the PPF and pay the levy. That is my understanding where the Bill refers to trustees and managers. I do not know of any exceptions to where it applies, other than in that way.

<P>

<a name="40913-51_para0"></a>The noble Lord's substantive point was about the expectations involving the sponsoring employer in the decisions being made by trustees about scheme funding. It may be worth spelling this out. The trustees will be responsible for taking decisions on the governance and funding of the scheme. However, the ongoing viability of the scheme is crucially dependent on the continuing support of the sponsoring employer. The clause requires the trustees to seek the sponsoring employer's agreement when developing an appropriate strategy for funding the scheme's pensions commitments.
<P>

<a name="40913-51_para1"></a>While we hope that in most cases the trustees and employer will be able to agree on the funding of the scheme, we recognise that in some cases the trustees may not be able to secure the employer's agreement&#151;if he needs to raise his contribution level, for example. Where that happens, particularly where the employer might otherwise consider closing or winding up the scheme, subsection (2) enables trustees to modify the future accrual of benefits under the scheme, for example, by reducing the scheme's accrual rate from, say, 1/60th to 1/80th. They can do so only where the employer agrees.
<P>

<a name="40913-51_para2"></a>Subsection (2A), in government Amendment No.   288A, clarifies what is meant by "accrual of future benefits". Effectively, it prohibits any modification that would adversely affect a member's subsisting rights, as defined in Section 67A of the Pensions Act 1995, as inserted by Clause 251 of this Bill. Those rights are built up in respect of past service.

<P>

<a name="40913-51_para3"></a>I should mention that where the trustees and employer agree to such a modification, it is intended that the regulations made under powers in Clause 248(2)(b) will require the employer to consult those scheme members who would be affected by the change. We will, of course, consider the requirement to consult in more detail when we look at Clauses 248 to 250.
<P>

<a name="40913-51_para4"></a>Where a scheme is so modified, subsection (3) of Clause 219 requires the trustees or managers to notify the active members of the scheme&#151;those who will be affected by a future change&#151;in writing, within one month of it taking effect.
<P>

<a name="40913-51_para5"></a>Where the trustees or managers are unable to agree with the employer on these matters, they are required by subsection (4) to notify the regulator. So, for instance, they will need to notify the regulator where trustees and employer cannot, or do not wish to, resolve matters through modifying the future accrual of benefits.

<P>

<a name="40913-51_para6"></a>Subsection (5) empowers the regulator to impose a penalty on a trustee or manager who has failed to take all reasonable steps to comply with the requirements in this clause.
<P>

<a name="40913-51_para7"></a>The clause will introduce an important check and balance within the scheme funding regulatory framework, enabling the regulator to intervene and help resolve disputes between the trustees and the employer, as we shall see, I hope, when we consider Clause 221.

<a name="40913-51_para8"></a>That is the basis of the funding partnership that we expect to see under scheme-specific funding.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I do not have a clear answer from the noble Baroness. My understanding is that this is not the present position, because at present the trustees, in conjunction with the actuary, decide what the assumptions are and what the basis of the valuation of the liabilities should be, without any agreement by the employer. Am I wrong? I do not think so.
<P>

<a name="40913-51_para9"></a>Secondly, if one looks down the paragraph, the matter ultimately remains unresolved. Supposing that there is no agreement between the employer and the trustees. If the employer agrees&#151;not otherwise, apparently&#151;they may, by resolution, modify the scheme. Supposing that that does not happen either, they have to report it to the regulator, but then nothing happens. How is the matter resolved?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   In most schemes, the employer currently has the deciding say on the contribution rate. In some schemes&#151;the minority&#151;the trustees do. We seek to establish a collaborative arrangement in which, if the collaboration fails to produce an acceptable scheme of contributions and any adjustments, the regulator would intervene to ensure that it happened. Is there anything further that I can add?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   There appears to be a change from the present situation.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   For some schemes, yes.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   So the Government are going to force trustees, who had previously made the assumptions and agreed on the valuation and so on with the actuary, to get the employer's agreement. The employer may well take the view that he does not want to pay up as much as the trustees think that he should. I had not realised, because it was outside my experience, that there were any schemes in which one had to get the agreement of the employer. It would certainly be undesirable, for those schemes for which the trustees have set the matter, for that to be prevented in future.
<P>

<a name="40913-51_para10"></a>If there is a dispute, how is it resolved?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   A dispute will ultimately get resolved by the regulator.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   The clause does not say so.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   In other clauses, the Bill certainly does. Clause 221 states that the regulator resolves disputes, but we will come to that in a moment. For the most part, the employer decides, and that will be modified. As I said when I spoke to a group of government amendments, we will modify the requirement where the trustees already have the power to set the contribution rates. They do not have to seek the employer's agreement. Where trustees already <P>


<a name="column_GC322"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC322</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have the power, it will not be diluted. Where employers have full power, there will in future be a collaborative process between the employer and trustee.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   That is not what the clause says. The clause does not say that, if the trustees have the power without the agreement of the employer, that will continue.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Clause 222 states that:
<P>

<a name="40913-51_para11"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Regulations may modify the provisions of this Part as they apply in prescribed circumstances".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-51_para12"></a>That will be the point at which the existing power of the trustees is not overridden by the changes in Clause 219.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Clause 222 could mean anything to anyone.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   Why do we want to leave that to regulations? I hope that I heard the noble Baroness correctly and that she said that, where trustees effectively had the sole power at the moment, the intention was not to change or override that. I would have thought it perfectly simple to have that in the Bill and make that clear. This is an important and topical matter. Of particular relevance is the recent WH Smith case, where Martin Taylor, the chairman of the trustees there, stood up very firmly. If that power is to be diluted, that would be a seriously retrograde step. There is no reason not to have that set out clearly in the Bill.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-51_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   It is not only WH Smith, but the Marks & Spencer case as well, I suspect, where the trustees had unusual powers, to some extent, over the autonomy of their scheme, independent of the employer. The provision is in the form in which it is because of the parliamentary draftsmen. Let me check on it. I take the substantive point that it is not clear in the Bill exactly how the power would be used. Reassurances may need to be given. I shall see whether we need to increase the clarity, either through guidance or through any changes&#151;I would be reluctant to make changes, given what parliamentary counsel have said on the matter. I accept the criticism that it is not obvious that the power in Clause 222 protects the existing powers of trustees against the employers, compared to Clause 219. Some cross-reference may need to be made in Clause 219 to Clause 222, which may serve the purpose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-52_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I may be able to respond quickly to the noble Lord. The prescribed body would be the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries. It will draw up the guidance. The Secretary of State intervenes not on matters of professional judgment but on the process point only. He must be satisfied that the process point is appropriate. Officials are working with the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries to draw that up so that the Secretary of State can then endorse it. It is fairly easy and it should be fine.

<FONT SIZE=3>provisions, whereas under previous clauses he simply has to sign what he has produced. I am not clear what the difference is between certifying something and signing it. Clearly, "certify" is the right expression, but previous clauses provide that the actuary must merely "sign". I would have thought that the terms meant the same thing, but I do not know why the terminology differs.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-52_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Is the issue about where the actuary is unable to certify and therefore has not signed?




<P>
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="40913-52_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Can the noble Lord point out where it is provided that the actuary must sign? I presume that he signs where he certifies, and that if he is unable to certify, he does not sign.

<P>

<a name="40913-52_para32"></a>I am extremely sceptical about the entire clause. It is very desirable that people know what they are likely to face&#151;or enjoy&#151;in retirement. In any event, people really want to know whether it is worth providing for their retirement&#151;that is to say, whether they would receive sufficient benefits to remove the need to rely on means-tested benefits. On previous occasions, the noble Baroness and I have exchanged views on the amount of resources needed to float someone off means-tested benefits. The estimates produced by Mr Willetts, Mr Field and the Government vary greatly.
<P>

<a name="40913-52_para33"></a>In any event, it is clear that a substantial sum would have to be accrued to make saving worth while. That reflects the enormous expansion by the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the provisions of means-tested benefits. Estimates of the number of people who will end up on such benefits are fairly terrifying, not least because of the likely burden on those who are not on means-tested benefits. Therefore, if we have the exercise of providing information on retirement planning, this would be the most essential element of provision; otherwise people will not know whether it is worth providing for their retirement. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-53_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I hesitate because I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, is also concerned about this issue. We cannot estimate far in advance people's eligibility for pension credit within the pension planner. It is impossible to tell whether a 40 or 50 year-old will be eligible for disability premiums and what the state of their capital may be.
<P>

<a name="40913-53_para0"></a>This morning I made a cross-reference to the pension credit calculator. Somebody on the cusp of retirement, if their information is relatively conventional, could deduce from the Pension Service's calculator whether they would be entitled to pension credit. The Pension Service is happy to circulate copies of the calculator; we simply downloaded it from the Internet. Whether individuals have paid off their mortgage will affect their eligibility for benefits. Another factor is whether they are entitled to disability premiums. In the few months before retirement, one may be able to give people a more reliable estimate of whether they would be eligible for an income-related benefit. We could not do so many years before simply because of the uncertainty of the individual's circumstances. One cannot easily roll them forward.
<P>

<a name="40913-53_para1"></a>The noble Lord asked whether saving was worth while. Various calculations have been made of the level of pension pot necessary to float people off income-related benefits. A significant number of health warnings must be attached to the calculation, primarily because one of the most potentially <P>


<a name="column_GC326"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC326</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>"generous" benefits is housing benefit. Around 80 per cent of pensioners are owner-occupiers and will almost invariably have paid off their mortgage by pension age. A pensioner in rented accommodation might well be entitled to housing benefit of &#163;100 or &#163;200 a week under certain circumstances, particularly if they have a disability which requires a particular type of accommodation. So there is a health warning about housing costs, about whether you are living singly or jointly, and about what assumptions one makes about indexation when deciding whether to opt for an index-linked pension or not. Variations of how much is needed in a pension pot can range from around &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000-plus before someone reaches a pension level that would take them out of the situation covered by pension credit.
<P>

<a name="40913-53_para2"></a>I do not want to sound too belligerent but pension credit and its targeting has an undeservedly bad press. I understand that pensioners would prefer to avoid detailed enquiries into their circumstances. But one must remember that pension credit is based on a snapshot at the point of retirement. It has stripped out nearly all the complexities of individual voluntary contributions and private organisations such as RNIB. It is a very simple calculation which, because most pensioners' incomes are stable, would need to be revisited only where there has been a major event: the big two are the death of a partner or the sale of a house and possibly going into sheltered accommodation.
<P>

<a name="40913-53_para3"></a>The procedure takes about 15 to 20 minutes on the phone. All our feedback shows that, although many pensioners are apprehensive initially, time and again we receive bouquets of thanks, with people saying that the information was helpful, that the young person to whom they talked was easy to understand and could progress the matter, and that as a result they now receive &#163;20 or &#163;30 a week that they would not get otherwise.
<P>

<a name="40913-53_para4"></a>Although pension credit is income-related, one must compare it with the situation that prevailed previously. Before pension credit was introduced, if the widow of a local authority manual worker was entitled to a pension of &#163;100 a month, or &#163;20 a week, from the local authority, she would be no better off than if there was not a penny of pension because it would be lost in a 100 per cent, pound-for-pound reduction against MIG. We inherited that situation from the previous government. We recognised the need for MIG, but it disincentivised the small saver. Pension credit means that such a widow now keeps &#163;60 of the &#163;100 and is therefore, under pension credit, &#163;13 a week better off. I accept that that is based on income calculation but compared to the situation that preceded it there is now no such disincentive for small savers. Given finite resources, it targets the available moneys on the smallest savers who otherwise would have lost the benefit of their savings pound for pound.
<P>

<a name="40913-53_para5"></a>Although I understand the noble Lord's criticism of pension credit, means testing and so on, there are benefits. First, it means that around 2 million pensioners receive additional moneys that they would never otherwise have received. Secondly, as a result, it rewards small savers for the first time. Thirdly, in <P>


<a name="column_GC327"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>practice, all our feedback from the Pension Service shows that the workings of pension credit have proved not only acceptable but reasonably attractive to pensioners receiving the service.

</P>

<P>

<a name="40913-53_para6"></a>Since the noble Lord has baited me slightly, I wish to make an additional point. In 1997&#150;98, on a relative low income test&#151;60 per cent of median income&#151;after housing costs, 2.7 million pensioners were in poverty. As a result of our activity, the current number on the same relative low income is 2.2 million. The figure has fallen by half a million. Even more dramatic is that in 1997&#150;98 26 per cent of that cohort of pensioners were in poverty&#151;after housing costs, because so many are owner-occupiers&#151;whereas five years on, only 9 per cent of the same cohort are in poverty. Using the baseline of 1997&#150;98, we have taken two thirds of that cohort of pensioners out of poverty, partly because of our targeting of benefits through initiatives such as pension credit. I must say that I am extremely proud of that record.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-53_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   As another survivor of the then State Pension Credit Bill, I cannot decline the opportunity given by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, to return to the subject. To an extent, the noble Baroness laid down a route towards a discussion on pension credit, which we have had many times in your Lordships' House. I understand that this has happened because of the nature of the amendment. The noble Baroness has avoided the third element of income on retirement: stakeholder pensions, the other much-vaunted part of the Government's pension policy. The provision of stakeholder pensioners will make a prediction of final retirement income much more difficult. Of all the many things that the noble Baroness has said in defence of the Government's pension policy, one of her most telling remarks was that the key determinant of a person's retirement is what they do in their 20s and 30s, not in the years leading directly to retirement.
<P>

<a name="40913-53_para7"></a>We support strongly the aim of these provisions. It is extremely important that people have a way of making informed choices at an early enough stage in their earning life to make a key difference to their retirement income. Therefore, the exclusion of contributory benefits and council tax benefit makes the system extremely limited in what it can offer. The noble Baroness mentioned housing benefit but council tax benefit is perhaps a bigger issue for more people.
<P>

<a name="40913-53_para8"></a>I thank the department for organising a demonstration on the issue. Those of us who attended it made a clear assessment that individuals could obtain no more than a very rough guide of what their income might be on retirement. It is therefore a very blunt instrument for determining what changes an individual may make to plan for retirement. The noble Baroness will remember that one of the issues that I raised during the demonstration was that care costs were not included in the prompts used to take people through the needs that they may wish to provide for <P>


<a name="column_GC328"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC328</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>during retirement. Given the generation of people about whom we are talking, some provision should be made for care costs.
<P>

<a name="40913-53_para9"></a>Given the uncertainty of integrated information that is reliant on benefits, which the noble Baroness has honestly outlined, does she not agree that the Government are selling a promise that ultimately the department will be hard pushed to deliver? At a time when it is possible for people to take remedial action themselves, they will be no clearer about their likely retirement income.

<A NAME="40913-53_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I certainly agree wholeheartedly with the noble Baroness who has just spoken; it is important that, if people are going to provide for their retirement, they should do so as early as possible. However, I want to concentrate on the amendment and discuss the clause in a moment or two.

<P>

<a name="40913-53_para10"></a>I do not propose to repeat the endless debates that we have had on the pension credit, the stakeholder pension or the state second pension. That constitutes much water under the bridge. I seek to establish that if this advice is to be given&#151;when we have the clause stand part debate I shall express much scepticism about it&#151;at the very least it is only fair to people (indeed, I think that it is misselling otherwise) to give them some indication of how much they have to save for it to be worth while, allowing for all the complications connected with housing benefit and everything else.
<P>

<a name="40913-53_para11"></a>While estimates have been varied as to what it is necessary to have to "float yourself off" means-tested benefits, I should not have thought it was seriously arguable that saving &#163;20,000 is no good at all. Mr Frank Field expressed this in more colourful terms, saying roughly that you should spend it at the pub on a Saturday evening. I do not agree with that. He used a more colourful expression which I shall not use, but there is no point in saving &#163;20,000 for your retirement. I should have thought that the estimate which is made ought to make that clear. That is the point of the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40913-54_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   On that last point I was trying to do some ready reckoning. I am trying to work out what money you would get with a sum of &#163;20,000. I believe that it would be &#163;100 a month, or something like that. I am trying to do sums in my head. Given the pension credit, it would be worth having.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-54_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   I do not think that it would be as much as that.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-54_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I shall check that. I accept that the retirement planner cannot encompass all of the things that may happen to people. For example, an absolute key matter for the woman is whether her partner is the main carrier of the income in retirement and he dies ahead of what might reasonably be expected in terms of longevity tables. That would completely alter their accounts.
<P>

<a name="40913-54_para0"></a>I defer to the noble Baroness who has more hands-on experience than I, so to speak, but I think I am right in saying that only about one pensioner in eight, and only about 3 per cent of all pensioners, go into <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>sheltered housing, let alone residential care, although they may have home helps, which they may or may not pay for depending on their income. I take on board all the warnings given by the noble Baroness but it is hard to incorporate such eventualities into any assessment. The retirement planner does something slightly simpler. It enables people in their 30s and 40s to project, probably into their early years of retirement in all fairness&#151;into their 60s and 70s&#151;what income they would like and expect to enjoy. Then, given certain assumptions about what savings they have, their expenditure on travel to work, their housing costs and so on, it enables people to assess how far short they are of realising that and how much they need to save in order to be able to remedy it. Bluntly, it is a wake-up call to people who begin, perhaps in their 40s, to realise that their retirement may not be as prosperous as they had hoped and to enable them to see what the options are. For example, can they save more? Can they increase their hours? Should they increase their years of work? Does it mean that a woman does not take retirement as early as she had hoped?
<P>

<a name="40913-54_para1"></a>Having said that, I absolutely accept that many other individual contingencies exist and that people will not know whether they are going to happen to them, and which we cannot build into the retirement planner.
<P>

<a name="40913-54_para2"></a>Pension credit, which is the big one that I was concerned about when the noble Baroness first raised it, we have covered as best we can so that people at the cusp of retirement can do the read-across to the Pension Service to see what their eligibility will be. But I do not see how one could realistically build in much of the information, as the noble Baroness rightly says, that affects the standard of living, particularly of older pensioners, into a retirement planner at this stage. In other words the retirement planner is most useful in the first 15 years or so of retirement. It may become less useful as ill-health grows, as issues about survival grow and as one is more likely to come within the reach of pension credit because one's income has fallen and not kept pace with the cost of living. That is a legitimate criticism.
<P>

<a name="40913-54_para3"></a>Having said that, we are not trying to claim that the retirement planner can answer all of those issues, but it can serve as a wake-up call for people in their 30s and 40s to realise&#151;as we know from all the evidence, including from the Citizens Advice Bureaux&#151;that they have a slightly utopian notion of the income that they think they will receive in retirement. They are not going to get it and they need to know the strategies that are open to them to improve their financial position. I would not wish to claim more for the retirement planner at this point. We shall discuss those people who have received combined pension forecasts, but they have emphatically said that it is very useful and a significant proportion of them have increased their savings as a result.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-54_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   We still have not covered the clear point that these calculations should make people aware of the fact that they have to save a great deal if they are to get any benefit from it. All the other points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, do not focus on that issue. If we are to have this exercise at all, it is important that that particular point&#151;which is the crucial point regarding whether people should save&#151;must be brought out clearly.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-54_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Could I just press the noble Lord; what does he mean that it will not benefit people? Anyone who has a full basic state pension and has any occupational pension, stakeholder or anything else in retirement, will benefit. That is unlike the regime we inherited whereby if people had income worth between &#163;77 and, say, &#163;105 on today's figures, they would not have benefited. They would have lost 100 per cent. Now they will keep 60 per cent. So it is not true that they will not benefit. What they will not get until they come out of pension credit is 100 per cent of the value, because it is a targeted form of support.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-54_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am not talking about pension credit but whether one receives any return for saving a small amount of money.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-54_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Of course one does. Why does the noble Lord think that one would not? Whatever income &#163;20,000 may as a lump sum produce in terms of a weekly income, one will enjoy either all or part of that in retirement. How much of that one will enjoy will depend on the interaction with pension credit. For example, it will depend on whether one is the second earner in a family. If a woman is bringing in that sum of &#163;20,000 and the husband's occupational pension is already sufficiently generous, they will enjoy every pound of any income earned by that &#163;20,000. I do not understand the noble Lord's point. Of course one will enjoy all small moneys, but the amount one enjoys will depend on the total assessment of household income and how it interlocks with pension credit.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-54_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   Perhaps I could add a point. The strategic question that faces us all is the low savings ratio and the need for people to increase their provision for retirement. We have all given a general welcome to the new thinking, whether it is in the Citizens Advice Bureaux and other people, to see what we can do. The bias that is introduced by Amendment No. 295ZZA&#151;which is an Alfa Romeo rather than a BMW&#151;is to make people think, "Well don't bother because you might get caught out with your means-tested benefit". But if one looks 20-odd years ahead, the amendment would be a strange form of words to introduce as a requirement on the people who are providing that information, when, as part of the bigger picture, they will have to be balanced in the sort of information they give. It would be a strange instruction to add to this clause, which will have to be developed as the years go by.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-54_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I do not want to delay the Committee longer on this. I understand the point the noble Lord is making. The trouble is that the whole effect of the vast increase in means-tested benefits has been to make it less worthwhile to save. I should have thought that there is some case for making that clear to people, even though it has the unfortunate effect of making them face the reality of the situation.
<P>

<a name="40913-54_para4"></a>I do not wish to pursue this issue further now, although I should like to come back to it on clause stand part. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40913-54_para6"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 224 shall stand part of the Bill?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-54_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   The broader question of the clause, which suggests that the Government should promote retirement planning, is, in one sense, clearly desirable. But one cannot help feeling that the estimates made are likely to be misleading. Take, for example, the state benefits that one is likely to receive. The result of the next general election is likely to be that people will receive a higher state pension than they will under the present Government because of the proposals which we have made. If this had been done in the past, the people who invested in Equitable Life would not have been grossly misled as a result of the failure of the regulatory system under both parties.
<P>

<a name="40913-54_para7"></a>There is a whole series of issues here which mean that trying to forecast what is likely to be the outcome may well result in severe disappointment. It seems to me not a function of government to engage in what is inevitably, to a considerable extent, whether it be on the state or the private pension side, likely to be misleading. The whole point of the Bill is to deal with people who will find their pension expectations disappointed. They will find themselves with a very much smaller pension provision than they expected. Yet under the same Bill, the Government are telling people what their pension prospects are. I simply do not think it is possible for the Government to do it with a sufficient degree of probability for it to be a worthwhile exercise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-55_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I should like to add to what the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has said. Let us take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, on our previous debate. I cite again, for good reason, the example of an employer with which I work. The employer has a lot of staff who are part time and are not paid very much. The employer has had to think long and hard about whether the provision of a stakeholder pension of a small percentage will actually be beneficial to employees in their older age.
<P>

<a name="40913-55_para0"></a>I take the point that one wants to encourage employers, but there are some who, for good and ethical reasons, are deeply concerned about the lack of information with which to model what might happen to their employees. Such employers fear that they may be doing a disservice to low-paid and part-time staff in particular.
<P>


<a name="column_GC332"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC332</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-55_para1"></a>It is not just those employers who wish to abrogate their pension responsibilities to their employees who stand to be caught by this lack of information. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is right. The more provision of state pensions is provided to people in the form of one-off allowances, which may or may not be uprated annually, and of discretionary benefits, the more difficult it becomes for anybody, including employers who, for good reason, want to make sure that their employees are not disadvantaged, to make a decent, educated guess at the likelihood of future provision.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-55_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I can understand all those criticisms, but my question back to both the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, is: is it better for people to have the information, limited though it is and with all the health warnings that we need to attach to it, than none at all? Until we went into the area of automatic pension forecasts and combined pension forecasts, how many women, for example, did not realise that they would not necessarily get a full basic state pension? I can tell the Committee that it was 70 per cent. If, as a result, they get an automatic pension forecast, they will realise that they do not get one in their own right, and that if they are not married they will not get one by virtue of their partner. That may or may not propel them to the altar, but it may seriously propel them into thinking about their situation in future, and not regarding "him" as being available to pay for their pension.
<P>

<a name="40913-55_para2"></a>I am sure that the noble Baroness and I could multiply instances. The pension planner can deal with only the current legislation on pensions, social security and so on, and is therefore subject to change in state pensions and any other form of pension provision, and in the individual circumstances. I accept that, but the alternative is not to have anything at all. Without that, a lot of people will go without the information that they need.

<P>

<a name="40913-55_para3"></a>The noble Baroness will agree that the CABs are flooded with people who do not have even the most basic financial literacy. They are in debt, cannot cope, face eviction, do not have any rainy-day savings whatever, and have not even begun to think about their pensions. Those who have access to the pension planner will at least be given some basic comprehension about their basic state pension and what pensions they may get. It may even lead them for the first time into asking their employer whether they have a pension, in some cases. It will at least give them some sense of what they are likely to enjoy, and might give them the opportunity, as my noble friend Lord Lea said, to rectify the situation.
<P>

<a name="40913-55_para4"></a>It is a long way from complete, by definition, because we cannot say what the situation will necessarily be for state pensions and private occupational pensions in 30 years' time. None the less, it is salutary for low-paid people, people who have been students at some period in their life, and people who have worked for a period below the LEL&#151;few women know what the LEL is&#151;to realise what the implications will be for their pensions.
<P>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC333</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40913-55_para5"></a>Because the planner cannot do 100 per cent&#151;it can give people only 60 per cent or 70 per cent&#151;that is not a reason for saying that 60 per cent or 70 per cent is not desirable, provided that health warnings are attached. The noble Baroness will know, having gone through the pension plan, that plenty of health warnings are attached. The alternative is not to have anything at all. The reception that we are getting already shows that there is a hunger for the sort of information that the planner will have, backed up by information such as that from the CAB, financial advice, employer advice and so on. We have to transform financial literacy in this country. One of the biggest forms of social exclusion in this country is not where one lives, but how little so many people know about finance and all its implications, and how to make a future for themselves and their families.
<P>

<a name="40913-55_para6"></a>I accept all the criticism; I just think that it is unfair. We are being criticised for not doing what we know perfectly well we cannot do and have not set out to do. That tells me that we must make sure that the limitations on such a planner are clearly there. That said, the information has so far been found useful and valuable. Noble Lords who saw it were asked whether they had any comments on the adequacy of the financial planner and to suggest ways in which it should be adjusted. We did not receive a single comment from any noble Lord, but they are coming forward now. I wish that we had received them at the time, and we could have then responded to see whether we could take any of them on board. Most of them are, by definition, about what may happen in future, and we cannot forecast that.
<P>

<a name="40913-55_para7"></a>The alternative is not to have a planner. From my limited experience, people&#151;including, frankly, my own sons&#151;have benefited from the information. It has made them realise the situation that they are in, but it is of course incomplete because, by definition, a lot of factors that will affect people's outcome are 30 years in the future.

<P>

<a name="40913-55_para19"></a>I shall deal first with Amendment No. 295A. Clause 228 is concerned with information and advice to employees. It provides:
<P>

<a name="40913-55_para20"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Regulations may require employers to take action for the purpose of enabling employees to obtain information and advice about pensions and saving".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-55_para21"></a>I have two concerns. First, the provision places on employers a responsibility to give employees information about a number of areas for which they are not immediately responsible. More particularly, I wish to question the use of the word "advice". My experience in this field has been salutary. One would have liked very much to advise employees on what to do about Equitable Life, particularly because the company's trustees had taken out an AVC, like so many groups of trustees, with Equitable Life. Under the Bill, trustees are no longer required to take out an AVC. Equitable Life went from disaster to disaster, and it was apparent to the trustees that it was doing so. Alas, it was not apparent to the government regulator under either government. However, we could not say to the employees covered by the fund, "For goodness' sake, get out of Equitable Life". Had we done so, we would have been liable for criminal penalties because we were not registered financial advisers.
<P>

<a name="40913-55_para22"></a>The provision is a radical change from the current situation. It refers to employers rather than trustees of a pension fund but the same situation appertains: you cannot give advice unless you are a registered financial adviser. This clause suggests that the Government propose to reverse their policy on that matter. I have indicated that that would be a rather good idea in many respects, but it would then raise the issue of the qualifications of the employer or trustees to give financial advice. Employers will not necessarily have the least ability as financial advisers. They may be all right at running a company, but their ability to give financial advice, if they have any, is a matter of sheer chance. So we need to be clear what the Government's policy is on this matter. Will they continue to impose criminal penalties, or will they encourage the unqualified to give such advice? I am somewhat ambivalent about this matter, because the group of trustees with whom I was working were extremely expert and highly qualified to give financial advice, and would certainly have been able to say without a moment's hesitation, "Get out of Equitable Life". But we could not do so. So what is the policy now on employers or trustees giving advice? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-56_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   My question to the Minister is, who pays for this advice? It is reasonable for an employer to give information about a scheme, but we are getting into the area of advice. It is right that at the moment employers are at grave risk if they give <P>


<a name="column_GC335"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC335</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>advice, and that advice should preferably be independent&#151;should probably not come from an employer. Is it the Government's intention that employers who are running a pension scheme should have to pay for individuals in that scheme to find advice elsewhere? I should have thought that that would be a disincentive, certainly to small employers.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-56_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I shall deal with that last question first. Any employer who fails to contribute at least 3 per cent into a pension scheme will, in lieu of that&#151;or as an alternative, or however one wants to put it&#151;be under a requirement within the remit of these provisions. I was asking about costs this morning, and we may be talking about &#163;100 or &#163;150 for an individual scheme member, depending on the assumptions that one makes about how long, who, and so forth. As a result an employer of someone with moderate earnings, such as &#163;15,000&#151;a not untypical stakeholder, for example&#151;may decide that, after corporation tax exemption, it may be cost-effective to contribute to a stakeholder pension, which would obviate the need for paying for advice. There is a trade-off in that regard.
<P>

<a name="40913-56_para0"></a>In my own mind, I am quite clear that an employer who is failing to contribute towards a stakeholder pension that he has set up, so that it remains an empty-shell company, will as a result not get employee contributions. As a result, we feel that there should be an obligation on that employer, in the absence of making even the most modest contribution towards the employee's pension, to come within the remit of the clause. That is the compromise.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-56_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   I must clarify the situation. This provision, then, applies only to employers who are not making a 3 per cent contribution to pension schemes. It obviously applies only to employers with more than five employees, too, otherwise it would not be relevant to stakeholders.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-56_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-56_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   Does the provision include employers who have offered a stakeholder pension, when the employees have declined it?




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-56_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   If there is a stakeholder pension, that must be available. I cannot conceive of a situation in which an employee would decline a stakeholder pension&#151;when, even though the employee is choosing not to contribute, the employer will contribute 3 per cent or 5 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40913-56_para1"></a>While the noble Baroness perhaps reformulates her question, let me come back to the question asked by the noble Lord&#151;




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-56_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Where does this 3 per cent business turn up in the Bill? There is not a sign of it in Clause 228; it has suddenly come out of the blue.

<a name="40913-56_para2"></a>In the December 2002 Green Paper the Government stated their views that employers who do not currently provide their employees with access to an occupational pension scheme, make contributions of at least 3 per cent to a group personal pension scheme, or offer schemes with a low take-up have a responsibility to ensure that their employees have access to the information they need to make an informed choice about saving for retirement, with the exception of the very smallest companies with fewer than five employees which, as the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said, are required to designate a stakeholder pension scheme. We are currently undertaking pilot exercises in that regard.

<P>

<a name="40913-56_para3"></a>Subsection (3) provides that employers to whom regulations under subsection (1) apply must provide information also to be specified in regulations to the new Pensions Regulator, which ensures that the regulator can measure employers' compliance with any future regulations.
<P>

<a name="40913-56_para4"></a>Subsection (4) expands on subsection (3) and allows the Secretary of State to specify in regulations the information that employers must provide to the regulator, the form and manner in which it must be provided and the period within which it is to be provided.
<P>

<a name="40913-56_para5"></a>The matter was clear in the Green Paper and in our debates, and it is covered by subsection (3), which states:
<P>

<a name="40913-56_para6"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Employers to whom regulations under subsection (1) apply must provide",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-56_para7"></a>this information. Therefore, I believe that the matter is covered there. I am surprised that this is news to noble Lords opposite.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-56_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am not clear from what the noble Baroness is quoting, but at all events there is no reference whatever to the matter in Clause 228. It may be in a schedule or somewhere else. The fact that the noble Baroness made the relevant speech at Second <P>


<a name="column_GC337"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC337</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Reading and the fact that the matter was contained in a Green Paper does not constitute legislation. There is absolutely no indication on the matter in Clause 228. Coming back to the main point, there is surely less reason to suppose that employers in the category that the noble Baroness mentioned are any better at giving advice than any other employer. On the contrary, I should have thought that they would be worse.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-56_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   That is exactly why I should like to come on to the point about advice. The noble Lord is absolutely right on that. That is precisely why employers will not be asked to give advice. None of the options that we are currently planning for involves employers giving regulated financial advice, so the question of employers' liability should not arise.
<P>

<a name="40913-56_para8"></a>The pensions information pack, which I was checking with the officials, makes it very clear that employers can give factual information. They cannot give advice but they can give access to people who can give advice; that is, regulated advisers. The document provides a case study. I am happy to circulate this to noble Lords. For example, an employer could say that saving for retirement is an important issue, state pensions form a base but are unlikely to provide everyone with enough income for a comfortable retirement, or that he is offering a stakeholder pension scheme with X, Y, Z company, or that he contributes X percentage of his employees' pay to the company group personal pension or stakeholder pension scheme on top of any contribution that the employee makes, or that the earlier the employee starts paying into a pension and the more he or she pays in, in general the higher his pension will be.
<P>

<a name="40913-56_para9"></a>The employer can say that but may not say that an employee should definitely join a stakeholder pension or that he advises an employee to invest in the ABC investment fund, or that an employee would be better off putting his money into something else, or recommends that an employee transfer benefits under his old pension scheme into a certain scheme. What employers can do and what they may not do in this respect is well covered.
<P>

<a name="40913-56_para10"></a>The clause that we are discussing contains powers relating to how the regulations will apply. What we are saying in the RIA, which your Lordships will also have, in paragraph 523, is that employers and organisations with low scheme membership and/or low or zero levels of contributions to pension schemes are one of the groups most likely to benefit from pensions information and access to advice through the workplace. I refer also to low-paid workers, part-time workers and so on. Employees in this group may previously not have had access to this information but it will now come through.
<P>

<a name="40913-56_para11"></a>What has slightly taken me by surprise is that members of the Committee on the Opposition Benches appear not to have been aware of this provision. It was in the Green Paper; it was referred to on Second Reading; it is in the regulatory impact assessment. For <P>


<a name="column_GC338"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC338</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those employers who do not contribute at least 3 per cent there will be, in regulations, a requirement that they should offer information and access to regulated advice. I have done the costing and am hoping that, as a result, employers may decide that they are better off contributing to a stakeholder pension at 3 per cent. However, that is their choice. That has always been part of the Bill and, as I say, I am slightly taken aback that it has come as a surprise to Members opposite.
<P>

<a name="40913-56_para12"></a>We have been at great pains to make the distinction between information and advice in the documentation precisely to avoid a situation in which a small employer, who is not necessarily very sophisticated regarding pensions, will not be put into a false position leading to a subsequent case of mis-selling. In that sense, I think that we have covered the noble Lord's point.

<P>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-57_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, and I were equally surprised that the noble Baroness raised these points when the clause is opaque in this respect. One had no reason to suppose that this clause would be defined in the way in which it has been. In any case, if the Government think that advice should be provided, why should this requirement apply only to those who are not making contributions of 3 per cent? It is either a good idea or it is not. In fact, it will impose higher costs on the very employers who are likely not to be in the best position to provide or obtain this information.
<P>

<a name="40913-57_para0"></a>It is all very well for the noble Baroness to say that the existing legal and criminal sanctions position will remain the same. This ought to be on the face of the Bill and the legal position on giving or obtaining advice should be made clear.
<P>

<a name="40913-57_para1"></a>I am not disputing for one moment that it was mentioned in the noble Baroness's speech&#151;




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-57_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   We are talking about Clause 228(1), which states:
<P>

<a name="40913-57_para2"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Regulations may require employers to take action for the purpose of enabling employees to obtain information and advice about pensions and saving for retirement".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-57_para3"></a>Subsection (2) states that regulations under subsection (1) may in particular,
<P>

<a name="40913-57_para4"></a>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"provide that they are to apply in relation to employers of a prescribed description and employees of a prescribed description".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>


<P>

<a name="40913-57_para5"></a>This was always the intention. It was debated in the Commons, where the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives both questioned some of the points about advice and information. But they were very clear, as far as I can tell, to whom this referred.
<P>

<a name="40913-57_para6"></a>I agree that the Bill does not say that the employer must provide at least 3 per cent in contributions otherwise this requirement will apply. That will be dealt with in regulations. But the regulatory impact assessment makes it very clear how one is to understand Clause 228(1) which is about information, and subsection (2) which concerns how it will apply to employers of a prescribed description. Indeed, at Second Reading, the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, <P>


<a name="column_GC339"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC339</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>welcomed the clause and was delighted that it would apply to employers who might not otherwise contribute.
<P>

<a name="40913-57_para7"></a>I have been slightly wrong-footed, because I took this as common knowledge between us and thought the real issue was how to protect employers from allegations of mis-selling. This provision was clearly laid out in the Green Paper, consultative documents, the Second Reading debate, the regulatory impact assessment and debates in another place.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-57_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   There is one simple final point to be made. If it is so clear that this should not be in regulations, it should be on the face of the Bill.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-57_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   I really think that it is time to give us a chance now. I am very happy to accept the noble Baroness's long and complicated audit trail about how she has always intended this provision to be there and it is in the Green Paper, and so on. All we are talking about is whether it is beyond the wit of parliamentary draftsmen to draft regulations requiring employers who are not contributing at least 3 per cent to provide such information. Then everyone is clear, and we do not <P>


<a name="column_GC340"></a>

<B>13 Sept 2004 : Column GC340</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>need to go into whether people in another place knew. Let us keep it simple and not worry about what was in the Green Paper. If that is the intention, let us say so.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-57_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   No. It is not inconceivable that a future government of whatever description might think that 3 per cent was not the right figure and want to change it. As a result, they would need the power by regulations. A figure tying us down to a percentage is exactly the sort of point of information that should be covered by regulations.




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40913-57_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   It can be specified in the Bill that the provision is amendable by regulation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

That review may cover the future eligibility of land under orchards to attract single payment entitlements but this can not be guaranteed at this stage.
